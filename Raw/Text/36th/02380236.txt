CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE. 
January 2, 
ADJOURNMENT OVER. 
Mr. MAYNARD. ImovethatwhentheHouse 
adjourns to-morrow it adjourn to meet on Mon- 
day next. 
Mr. ETHERIDGE. 1 demand the and 
na s on that. 
{"Ir. BRIGGS. I move to amend by striking 
out Monday" and inscrting Saturday. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. 1 move that the House 
do now adjourn. 
The motion was not agreed to. 
Mr. KUNKEL. 1 move to amend the amend- 
ment so that when the House adjourns to-day, it 
adjourn to meet on Saturday next. 
Mr. HUGHES. 1 wish to call the attention 
of the House to the fact that to-morrow has been 
set apart for the transaction of business connected 
with the District of Columbia. We were de- 
prived of one of the two days assigned at last ses- 
Sion for the transaction of business of this District 
by the announcement of the decease of a member 
of Congress. We had therefore but one day for the 
purpose, and in fact nothing was accomplished. 
It is a matter of imperative necessity that some- 
thing shall be donc for the District of Columbia. 
The r.)istrict business has been made the special 
order for to-morrow, and I trust there will bc no 
adjournment to interfere with it. 
The question was taken on Mr. KUNKEL'S 
amendment to the amendment; and it was not 
agreed to. 
The question recurred on Mr. BRfGGS 's amend- 
ment.

time we shall adjourn to-morrow. If wc can do 
so for to-unorrow, we can decide to what time the 
House shall adjourn a wcck after to-morrow. 
Mr. HUGHES. Thc use of the Hall has
