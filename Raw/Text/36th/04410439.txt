Federai relations with the descendants of the Pii- 
grims. Standing here in this great council cham- 
ber of the nation, and speaking for the brave sons 
of' New England, most emphatically declare to 
all who would try the experiment, and dissever 
the tics that bind us together as a common peo- 
ple, -we can live without you as well and as long 
as you can wichout us. 
For tnore than three quarters of a century we 
have lived with you in the Union; not as your in- 
feriot•s, not as so many dependencies, but inde- 
pendent sovereignties, subject to the obligations 
and lirnit.ations of a c.omunon Constitution, to 
which wc have been loyal both in peacc and in 
In all that Inakcs a nation great and pow- 
crful, prosperous anti happv, respected and hon- 
ored, at houue and abroad, none have contributed 
more than the six New England States; and if 
ever the time shall come when the demon of dis- 
union shall makc you onc people and us another, 
history wili record the fact thal six of the bright- 
est geins t.hat over bedecked our national diadem 
were found in thc great Northeast. 
In defending New England from the vituperous 
assaults that have long been made upon her, I 
deal in facts and figures, and not in empty 
declamation: the forme:• appeal to the jud«ment 
and reason; the latter pleases the ear, but seldom 
enlightens (he understanding. 
To elaborate the proposition that the people of 
New England have been and still are a pat.riotic 
eoynmunlty—that they love their country, tho 
constitution, and tbc Union, would bc like an 
argument to prove that the sun shines at noonday. 
The memories of the past dispel thc idea. So 
long us the plains of Lexington reverberate the 
echoes of the' first guns that inaucnn•ated the 
American Revolut.i0Fi, and covet the ashes of the 
horocs that fir.st laid down their lives in defense 
•of their country; so 10 Fig as the tall shaft, that

II-lilt, shall siynal the spot whcrc rcpose in majes- 
tic silence the bones of Warren and his brave 
who fell ficrhting for their homes and 
firesides; so long as the rcmcmbrances of old Fan- 
euii Hall, whcrc liberty was first cradled, and 
whose walls once echoed with tlieeloqucnt trumpet 
ton-cs of the fiery Otis and the impetuous Adams, 
shall linger in American minds, until all thesc 
cherished recollections shall fade away in the dim 
distance of the futuce and be forgotten, the sons 
daughters of the Pilgrims will need no cham- 
pion, hei•e or elsewhere, to vindicatc her honor or 
repel assaults upon her valor and patriotism. 
The bones oc her heroes lie buried beneath the 
sods of every battle-field of the Revolution; while

In order that the House, the country, and the 
world may judge between us, 1 shall institute the 
comparison between New England and her most 
vehementaccusers. LetSoutliCarolina, Georgia, 
Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Louisiana, 
stand up and face Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and 
Maine. New England has a -territory of 65,038 
miles, and a shore-line upon the ocean of 4,003 
miles, being more than a third of the whole Atlantic 
coast. She has the best navigable waters and •har- 
bors in the world. Her inland streamsabound in 
water-powers and facilities for drivi ng machinery. 
Her population, by the census of 1850, amounted 
to 2,705,095. But as I prefer to deal in results 
rather than theories, I shall pass at once to my

obliged to refer to the census of 1850. Thc re- 
ligious habits of a people can be dctetmincd by 
the attention they give to the well-rccognizcd in- 
stitutions of Christianity. The regard paid to the 
Sabbath and the institutions of the Sabbath are 
correct index from which to iudge the religious 
character of a community. "By the census of 
1850, the value, of church property in New Eno•- 
land was $19,875,948; value of same in the SIX

Now England there were 11.31 churches to every 
100 square Illiles; in the six cotton States, only 
2.18 to the, sanie area of territory. 
From the samo authority it appears, that in the 
New England States thcrc is an annual circula- 
tion of copies of newspapers, while 
the six seceding States circulate but 28,348,051 
copies. In New England there are 50,911 inhab- 
itants who can l'ieithcr read nor write; in the six 
cotton States 129,126. In Now England therc arc

land the number of libraries, including public

rics, is 2,183, containing 1,226,044 volumes; in 
thc seceding States total of libraries, 254, contain- 
From this it appears New 
ing 211,079 volumes. 
England has ten as many libraries and about 
six times as rnany volumes as the six cotton 
States. New England has more than onc fourth 
of all the library volumes in the whole Union; 
the whole amount to volumes. I prefer 
to make no further commcnts upon thc statistics, 
but leave them to speak for t.hernsclves. 
I now pass to speak of the wealth and industry 
of New Lngla.nd. I admit that its soil, as awholc, 
is not naturally so productive as that of inany 
the Union; yet New England

298,304 persons employed in manufacturing estab- 
lishments; the six cotton States 30,917. 
I now turn to the commerce of New England. 
By a reference to the letter of the Secretary of the 
'Treasury, on tl'1C commorcc uld navigation of the 
country, I find the following returns for the year 
ending Junc 30, 1859: The number of Amencan 
and forcign •vessels which entered the ports of 
New England, for said year, was 5538; the ton- 
nage upon these vessels was 1,170,297; and they 
were manned by 45,149 men and boys. In the 
cotton States the Bumbcr of vessels entered was 
2,069; the tonnage, 1,100,811; manned by 34,400 
men and boys. More than- half of this latter 
amount, to wit: 661,415 of the tonnage, was at the 
port of New Orleans, which takes the' commerce 
of the Mississippi from thefrce States in the North- 
west. Of this number of vessels which entered 
the ports of New England said year, 3,396 were 
forugn, and 2,340 American; and of the number 
which entered the ports of the cotton States, 721 
were foreign, and 1,348 American vessels) show- 
ing a great preponderance of the foreign trade to 
bc with New England. In 1850 New England 
had engaged in sea and riVcr navigation 43,018 
the six cot.ton States 6,698. More than 
men; 
l)inc tenths of all the persons navigating the occan,
