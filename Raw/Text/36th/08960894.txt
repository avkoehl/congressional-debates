So the House refused to adjourn. 
During the roll-call, 
Mr. QUARLES stated that Mr. LEACH, of 
North Carolina, was still detained at his rooms 
by indisposition. 
Mr. ALDRICH stated that Mr. WINDOM was 
absent in consequence of sickness in his family. 
The result was announced as above recorded. 
Mr. CURTIS. I now move that the special 
order of the Pacific railroad be continued over till 
to-morrow, so that the House may now adjourn. 
Mr. GARNETT. I suppose that requires 
unanimous consent. 
Mr. CURTIS. No, sir; it does not. 
The SPEAKER. The motion to postpone is 
in order. 
Mr. CRAIGE, of North Carolina. 1 rise to 
point of order. 
Mr. SICKLES. I call the previous question 
on the motion to postpone. 
The SPEAKER. It is not necessary. No de- 
bate is in order. 
M.. CRAIGE, of North Carolina. The pre- 
vious question was not called till after I obtained 
the floor, and was recognized by the Chair. Then 
the gentleman from New York [Mr. SICKLES] 
proposed to call the previous question. I have as 
zood a right to the floor as the gentleman from 
New York, and I will keep possession of it. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from North 
Carolina was recognized and has the floor, and is 
entitled to be heard as far forth as any member 
can be heard on this subject. No debate on this 
question is in order. 
CRAIGE, of North Carolina. There was 
a motion made to postpone the special order on 
the Pacific railroad bill. 
I then rose to a point of 
order, and have a right to state it. 
The SPEAKER The Chair will hear it with 
creat pleasure. 
Mr. CRAIGE, Carolina. A few days 
acro, on the motion of the gentleman frorn Ohio, 
[Mr. CORWIN,] to-morrow was set apart for the 
consideration of the report of the special commit- 
tee of thirty-three. Now, I hold that it is not 
competent for the House, on the mere motion 
of the gentleman from Iowa, to supersede that 
order. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that 
that question will be decided when it arises to- 
morrow. 
Mr. CRAIGE,0fNorth Carolina. That the 
very point. But the gen tleman from Iowa desires 
to have it decided now. He moves to postpone 
the special order of to-morrow arid to substitute 
for it the special order on the Pacific railroad bill. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair supposes that 
nothing can be decided ut present on that subject. 
I The only question to be settled now is, us to the 
postponement of this special order till to-morrow. 
If the point of order be raised to-morrow, it can 
bc decided then.
