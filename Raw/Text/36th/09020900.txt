We have in the Postmaster General, at the head 
of the Post Office Departihent, an ofiäcer who, ac- 
cording to the state of our present:lævvs, can plunge 
this-Government into debt almost at his pleasure. 
He •can increase- the expenditure on a route; he 
can " order up "the service, as they call it. There 
is scarcely any practical -limit to his discretion as 
to themmount in •which he can involve this Gov- 
ernment. I-Ie is not limited by the receipts from 
postages; he not limited even by the appropri- 
ations in annual bills, but he increases this 
expenditure pleasure.. - Now, sir, unless we 
do something to restrain -this discretion, unless 
we do Something to ' regulate this Department, 
instead of adding thus immensely to the imposts, 
as it isproposed to do in this bill, we shall never I 
succeed in rescuing the Treasury from its financial 
embarrassments. 
I believe that sotnething might 
be done, that one great step might be achieved, if 
we were to put out to contract not only the trans- 
portation, but the delivery of the mails. I believe 
we could thus arrano•e a scheme which would not 
only eut off a great and unwholesome source of 
putronage from the Executive, but which would 
add greatly to the cheapness and emciency of the 
Post Office service itself. But, sir, without refer- 
ence to that which is theoretical, it is certain that 
if the Post Offce Department were managed as it 
was. managed up to the year 1851, and made a 
self-sustaining Department, so as to relieve the 
Treasury from these vast, embarrassments, and if 
the proceeds of the public lands were applied to 
the payment of the public debt, if trade and com- 
merce were to revive, the tariff as it now stands 
would yield us an abundance för the just wants 
of the Government. 
But, Mr. President, suppose that in the present 
condition of the finances of the coun try now, since 
the debt has been increased, it was desirable to get 
more money than the tariff of 1857 would give: 
we could easily make additions which, on the im- 
ports of the last fiscal year, would giva us some- 
thing like more of revenue than we re- 
ceived for t.hat fiscal year; and that, too, without 
interfering with the business of the country, with* 
out imposing any burden which it would be griev- 
ous to anybody"to bear. 
I had a statement made 
out at the Treasury Department, showing the 
details of such an amendtnent of the present law. 
Without reading the tables, I will state in general 
terms, that if we were to raise the 4 per cents to 
10, the 8 per cents to 10, the 12 pcr cents to 15, 
and carry up the spices to 30, we should l')avc got, 
in that way, an increase of revenue fbr the last 
fiscal year of' a little over $2,000,000. The im- 
portations of articles on the free list, exclusive of 
specie, were about $72,000 5000; and if we bad laid 
got somet.hing like or that 
• is to say, the two together would havc given an 
addition of nearly and we should have 
had, with these two additions, a revenuc of nearly 
the last fiscal year. 
I say these addl- 
tions and changes in the tariffof1857, wh ich would 
not bear heavily on any one, would yield us, if any 
Why should we not, then, be contented with 
bring us in much more money, as I think I am 
proposed to pass, and which would give us this 
additional amount of money without embarrass- 
ing any branch of trade, without impairing the 
operation. of any of the great divisions of. our in- 
dustry? We know, from statistics, that the oper- 
ation of the tariff of 1857 upon the industry of the I 
country has been eminently beneficent. 
1 have 
turned to the various great branches of our indus- 
try to see. I took the iron; 
and that is a matter 
about which we hear most complaint. 
I com- 
pared the imports and exports of iron and of iron 
manufactures under the last tbrce years of the 
tariff of 1846 and the three years of the tariff of 
1857. The average annual import of iron and 
iron manufactures for the last three years under 
the tariff of 1846 was $22,781,000, and for the 
three years under the tariff of 1857 , 
$16,060 ,800: 
thus showing that the imports had dirninished 
actually $6,000,000, or nearly one third. On the 
other hand, the average annual export of iron and 
Iron manufactures for thc last three years of the 
tariff of 1846, was equal in value to #12,799,000,

such this would bank- II or an average of The average annual 
export under the tariff of 1857 for three years 
were or an average of $5,312,000; 
thus showino an increase-of one fourth in that rc- 
gard.* We see that the average yearly import, 
under the last three years of the tariff of 1846, was 
much greater than for the same number of years 
under the tariff of 1857—thus showing a diminu- 
tion of the importations under this tariff on the 
one hand; and on the other, that for the same 
period there Was a large increase of the exporta- 
lions of iron and manufactures of iron. What 
does this prove? It proves that a duty of 24 per 
cent. is in fact more protective now than duty of 
30 per cent. was at the time the tariff of 1846 was 
passed. It is more protective, because the differ- 
ence between the relative cost of iron 
here and in England at this time and then, is so 
much less now than it was then; and the very 
fact that the importations of iron have fallen off 
under this reduction of duty to 24 per cent. shows 
that, probably, to reach the revenue standard, in- 
stead of increasing, you ought to diminish the I 
duties. 
If these facts do not prove this conclu- 
Sion positively, they go far to establish its prob- 
ability. To show, too, the effect the present tariff 
has had upon the general interests of the country, 
we find that the yearly averaffe exportations of 
iron and manufactures of iron are increasing from 
$4,000,000 up to $5,000,000 a year, increasing at 
the rate of nearly 25 per cent. ; and that in the 
short space of three years. 
How is itin regard to the general manufactures 
of the country? I have compared the last three 
years of the tariff of 1846 and the three years of 
the tariff of 1857 in regard to the exportations 
of domestic manufactures. 
I find, that the aver- 
acye exportations of domestic manufactures for the 
last three years of the tariff of 1846—in 1855, 1856, 
1857—were 1 find that for the last 
three years of 1858, 185.9, 1860, the average was 
say thus showing a 
rapid increase of the exportations of domestic 
manufactures undci• this tariff of 1857. t 
Is not that evidence of tl'le benöficence of its 
operations? Have we not evidence of it from the I 
assertion of the newspapers? Are there any 
petitions here from the manufacturers for an in- 
crease of the tariff? Have we not seen, lately, that 
the Massachusetts mills have resumed full work ? 
Is there any other interest in the country aspros- 
perous? -VVhy, sir, I heard a shrewd man from 
Massachusetts say two years ago that wherever 
they had new machinery they vvere doing well; 
and that those who were running old machinery 
in Rhode Island, instead of altering their machine- 
ry, were seeking to alter the tariff'; and that if 
they would introduce the new improvements, and 
keep up with the progress of the age in manufac- 
tures, they would not require an increase of the 
tariff; and I say these statistics prove the fact, for 
they show a general improvement and increase 
and advance in the manufacturin(r interest of the 
country. 
The •difference between the tariff of 1857 and 
that now proposed, so far as manufactures are 
concerned, is this: the tariff of 1857 made the raw 
nnaterial, to a great extent, free; it diminished the 
expense of manufacturincr, and, at the same time, 
it reduced the duty on the textile fabric, thus 
enablin«y thc manufacturer to make a profit, and

yet sell his product ata lower rate. That eave 
him a larger circle of consumers and customers. 
That placed him at issue and at war ••.vith nobody. 
The customer was pleased, because he got the 
articlc cheaper; the manufacturer was contented, 
because, being enabled to produce cheaper, he 
could furnish the article at a lower price, and thus 
satisfy the consumer. This tariff now proposed, 
while it increases the duty upon the ras.v material 
of some species of raw wool and upon iron, en- 
deavors to compensate it by laying duties almost 
prohibitory upon the manufactured articles, so 
that, in order to enable the manufacturer to make 
a profit, the consumer must be forced to pay a 
larger price ; and •th us the manufacturer, under this 
tariff, will have a smaller circle of consumers, be- 
cause there must be fewer who will consume at 
high prices than at low, and hc will find himself 
at war with the consumer, -and •every other inter- 
est, as long as this tariff remains on the statute- 
book. 
But, sir, allow me to proceed with a review of 
the operations of this tariff upon the great inter- 
ests of the country. 1 have shown you how it 
acted upon manufacturers .of iron. How is it 
upon raw cotton? For the years 1855, 1856, and 
1857, the average exports of cotton—those were 
the last three . years of the tariff of 1846—were 
$116,034,000, and the average price 10.2G ceots. 
For the years 1858, 1859, and 1860, the nverage 
yearly exportation was $161,542,000, at an aver- 
age price of 11.76 cents; thus showing a large in- 
crease of the quantity exported, and of the price 
which it brought.* Does this say nothing for the 
tariff of 1857? I am looking now to the produc- 
tion not only of the manufacturer, but to the in- 
terest of him who produces the raw material. 
How is as it to tobacco? W by, sir, I find that, 
in the last three years of the tariff of 1846, the 
average exportation of tobacco was $15,865,000. 
In the years 1858, 1859, and 1860, the average ex- 
portation of tobacco was $17,996,000; thus show- 
ing a large increase in these items.f 
Mr. Pre?ident, if I had time—but I know I shall 
be forced to weary the Senate more than I desire 
to do, with every effort that I can make to con- 
dense and compress—I should like to go into a 
review of the operations of this tariff on the for- 
eign trade of the country. I would like to show 
how •it has been increasil)ff our direct communi- 
cation with Europe; how it is that, under its op- 
eration, we have been decen tralizing our European 
commerce from Liverpool and England. Before 
that, most of our French and continental goods, 
with the exception of Bremen goods, which come 
here directly in steamers, used to go through 
England; but from the time the tariff of 1857 was 
passed, and we reduced so largely the duties on 
wine, brandies, cloths, and the continental prod- 
ucts, our direct trade has been increasinff. As 
a consequence, our ships have gotten a larger 
share of freights; as a consequence of it, our mer- 
chants have had a larger share of profits upon 
these exchanges; and we ourselves have been able 
to consume upon cheaper terms. As another con- 
much upon a commercial center in Great Britain. 
We have been building up one of our own; and 
New York, but* for these political troubles—an 
if you will not crush it down with this monstrou 
bill which is now proposed—may soon become 
the center and emporium of the world. 
Fut, Mr. President, have no time to enter now
