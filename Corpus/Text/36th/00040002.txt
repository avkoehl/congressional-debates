from the. rising of the sun unto the going down 
thereof; and Thou knowest all of our interests, 
and Thou knowest ali of our dangers. Our good 
men are at fault; our wise men are at fault, in the 
North and in the South, and in the East and in 
the West. Everywhere they are at fault. We 
know not what it is best for us to do; and with 
common consent we come unto Thee, O Lord, 
Our God, and we pray Thee to overrule unrea- 
sonable and wicked men in all parts of our Con- 
federacy; and we pray Thee to inspire and to 
strengthen and to assist all true patriots in every 
part of our Union. 
And may Thy blessings rest upon' all the de- 
•partments of the Government. We remember, 
with special solicitude, the President of these Uni- 
ted States and his immediate advisers. They lack 
wisdom; but if they call upon Thee, Thou wiitgive 
them wisdom, for Thou givest to all mcn liberally, 
and upbraidest not. While we trust they pray 
for themselves, we here also pray for them, that 
Thy Holy Spirit may be granted unto them, and 
that they may see exactly what they ought to do, 
and have grace to do it in the positions in which 
they are placed. 
We thank Thee for this bright and beautiful 
morning for the assembliw of the two Houses 
of Congress. And we pray that "I'hy blessing 
may rest upon the Vice President, and upon 
every Senator in his place; and upon the Speaker 
of this House, and upon every member in his 
place. We rejoice to learn that they see their 
responsibility; that they feel their responsibility; 
and that many of them are looking toward Thee 
for counsel and direction. O Lord, our God, 
let Thy own presence subdue every heart and 
every mind, and sanctify all actions to 'I'hy 
own glory and the good of our whole people. 
Oh, that we may still be happy in this blessed 
Union ! 
Our Father who art in Hcavcn, hallowed be 
Thy name: Thy kingdom corne: Thy will be 
done, on earth as it in Heaven: give us this 
day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts, as 
we forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temp- 
tation, but deliver us from evil: for is the 
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever 
and ever. Amen.

HOUR OF MEETING. 
Mr. FLORENCE. Imove o'clock 
be the daily hour of meeting until further ordered. 
The motion was agreed to. 
HOMESTEAD mr-,L. 
Mr. GROW. I rise 10 a privileged question. 
I call up the ynotion to reconsider thc vote by 
which the bill reported by me trom the Commit- 
tee on Agriculture to secure homesteads to actual 
settlers was referred to the Committee of the 
Whole on the state of the Union; and upon the 
motion to reconsider I call thc previous question. 
The bift was read by its title, as follows: 
A bill (1-1. R. No. 24) to secure homesteads 
actual settlers on the public domain. 
Mr. PHELPS. If we are to have no discus- 
Sion upon that bill, I move to lay it upon thc table. 
This is calling up the questi01) too soon. 
Mr. GROYV. propose to leave it open to dis- 
cussron. 
Mr. PHELPS. The gentleman can np his 
motion on any other day than the present; but 
now there are members absei)t from the House, 
and we have not time to examine the bill. 
Again, I suppose the gentleman from Pennsyl- 
vania contemplates that we shall have the usual 
lottery to secure our seats for the session; and for 
that further reason I suggest to the gentleman the 
postponement of his motion, and the calling it up 
another day. If the gentleman persist in his mo- 
tion, I shall insist upon my motion to lay the bill 
upon the table. 
Mr. GROW. 1 withdraw the call for 
vious question one Inoment, to say that my object 
was not to put the bill upon its passage no•vv, but 
to leave it open to discussion, if any gentleman 
desires to discuss it. 
i call up the motion to re- 
consider now, in order that we may have the busi- 
ness before the House. Gentlemen are aware that 
there are special orders covering almost entirely 
the first three or four weeks of the session, and
