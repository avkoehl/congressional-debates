have- seen the consequences that have•been -en-

But, Mr. President, -this was riot •the Only: re- 
! spect in which the expectations of those-who voted 
I fot the tariff of 1857 were disappointed ihfegard 
to public expenditures. We did not suppose that 
•the Post Ofiice Department was to be saddled as 
a constant •and permanent source of expenditure 
for millions annually upon the Treas'ury; and ;yet 
such has been the case; and when a Demoeratic 
President recommended an increase of-the •rates 
I of postage, to make it self-sustaining, and when 
a Dcmocratic Postmaster General récommended 
the same increase, and when we •sought 'here to 
i pass it into a law, and also to cut off, at the same 
time, the expenditures arising outof,the franking 
privilege, that bill was lost in the House of Rep- 
resentati ves; and we have been met by a persist- 
ent opposition whenever We have attempted' to 
make the Department sustain itself. What', has 
been the consequence? What do you suppose, 
MI'. President, has been the expenditure out of 
the Treasury for the Post Offce Department for 
the past three years ? 
I venture to assert that, if 
i any Senator wras called on to st.ate it, he could not 
come within the amount by millions. Here is a 
i statement showing the payments from the Treas- 
ury for the support of the Post Office Department, 
exclusi ve of the rec,öi pts from postage, from March 
4, 1857, to January 31, 1861; and they amount to
