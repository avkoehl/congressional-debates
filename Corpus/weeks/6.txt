352 Mr." PÜGH
I do not understand the bill of my from Pennsylvania to propose to alter the Constitution,but to submit to the people, in their primary capacity, the question whether it shall be amended according to its own terms and forms

As to the present motion, I agree that a bill of this importance ought to go to a commit- tcC before it is- finally put' on its passage; but when the Senator who introduces it requests that it may not be committed for a few days, I think it is unpfecedented in the Senate to insist upon committing his bill against his own wishes; and therefore l' shall vote against it, holding myself at liberty, at some subsequent stage, to vote for committing it Oither to the Committee on thc Ju- diéiary or to a select committee; but when the Senator- from Pennsylvania asks the Senate not to commit it at this stage, I cannot imagine any reason why it should be done
Mr
BIGLER
I will simply state that I am unwilling to have this bill referred in the absence of the Senator from Kentucky
If he were present and assented to it, I should acrrce to it; because this bill has close connection With the propositions he has presented
I desire to keep it before the Senate until that honorable Senator can have an opportunity of seeing it, and seeing how far it meets the purpose he has in view in his resolu- tions, As I understand, it is supposed there are constitutional difliculties in the way
I will say that itis not pretended we can command the people of the States to •vote
The vote must necessarily be informal
But, sir, the surroundings are very extraordinary; and it is bclicved that •the people of the States would take this measure in hand and cxpréss their views, hoping they might thereby give peace -to the country
Nor, sir, is it so clearly in conflict with the Constitution
At all evcnts, it is not one of those conflicts which alarm the country; it is not an attempt to interfr.rc with the rights of the people, but simply to consult the powel: which made the Constitution, and consti- tutes this body and the other I-louse—the people, the source of all political power
r I' hc proposi- Lion is to take their will in advance of any action here: that
is all; and it will be for the men) bers of both branches to consider whether the oxiffcn- cics of the country warrant and dcmand such an extraordinary measure
I shall certainly not ob- iect to the reference of thc proposition to the Committee on the Judiciary, after I shall have had an opportunity of consulting the Senator from Kentucky on tbc subject
I trust the Senalor froin Massachusetts Will withdraw his motion for that pur ose
Mr
BROWN
Mr
President, when the rocord shall be completed which the Senato is about to make, it wiii show the absence o
the Senators from Alabama, Fiorida, and Mississik)pi
to say in a word why this will be
'1 hcse States have taken steps to withdraw from this Union, of which we are not so well infonncd offcially as to justify our filing a formal notice, with the Seriate; but we think that our duty to our States and to ourselves no longer pcrrnits us to take an active part in tbc proceedings of this body, either by speaking or voting
My colleague is confined to hlS roon-l by a painful illness; but I quite surc he concurs in what I now say
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Secretary will call the roll
Mr
FOSTER
1 voted to this bill to the Committee on thc Judiciary; but after the expla- nation o
the Senator from Pennsylvania, request- ing that it may lie over until he can confer with the Senator frorn Kentucky, I shall be willing to accord that courtesy to him, and shall vote now not to t•cfet• it
Mr
WILSON
On the request made by the Senator from Pennsylvania, will withdraw the motion at this time, If I can do so by the general consent of the Senate, the yeas and Flays beintr ordered 
The VICE PRESIDENT
Is general consent given, the yeas and nays having been ordered

COMMITTEE SERVICE
Mr

have to ask the Senate to discha.rce me from further service as chairman of' the Committee on Claims
I will take occa- Sion to say that I have been serving on the Com- mittce on Claims six years, and four years as It is one of the most laborious, if chairman 
not thc most laborious, committees in the Senate
I Icavc it to the Senate, of course, to say whether I have discharged my duties faithfully or
not; but I think it is time, after this long service, that I should be •allowed to ret-ire from the laborious duties of that position
therefore ask thc Sen- ate to discharge me from it; and I move, in con- nection with it, that the Vice President appoint a chairman in my place
There are other consid- erations which the Senate will readily understand and appreciate, which induce me to ask for this indulgence, but which I will not state at present

FORTIFICATIONS IN THE SOUTII
The VICE PRESiDENT
The Senator from Virginia moves to take up the resolution submit- ted by him, calling for copies of orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, to omcet•s in command of förtifications of the United States in the Slate of South Carolina, since the 1st day of November last
Mr
•MASON
Read the resolution
The VICE PRESIDENT
The question is now on taking it up
Mr
COLLAMER
Let us hear what it is, that we may see whether we will take it up
The Secretary read it, as follows: Resolved, That the Secretary of War be directed to conn- munieate to the Senate copies of all or(lers issued from that Department
or frotn the
C-onunan•ier-in-Chiefofthe Arrny, to the
officers in connnand of the tortifications of the Uni- ted States in the
State of South Carolina, since the 1st day of November last; and that he also conununicate to the Senate copies of any military plans, or recotnrnendations, oc the 00111tr,ander-in-Chief of the
Army, or of any officer thereof, to the War Departmcnt, touching the military oc- cupation, by increased force or 01herwise, of the forts or arsenals of the United States in the State o
Virginia, or in any of the States bordering on the Atlantic ()l• Gulf of Mexico, south 01' Virginia, in the District of Columbia, or the navy-yard at Pensacola; and that he inforrn the Sen- ate whether any such plausor recomnendations havc been adopted at his Departnxent., and what orders, if any, have been issued pursuant thereto
The motion to take up the resolution was agreed to
Mr
MASON
Mr
President, the purpose of the resolution, as explained upon its face, is a direction to the Secretary of to communicate to the Senate the information called for in the res- o)uuor,
That information is concerningany orders that have been issued to othcers of the United Stales, commanding forts or arsel'lals in South Carolina, if any such there be, and any military plans or suggestions by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army touching the occupation by military force, or the increase of the garrisons, of any of the forts or arsenals in Virginia, and the States 'I'he purpose of it, sir, is to south of Virginia
learn whether, in the consideration of the Presi- dent of the United Ståtes, who is the Commander- in-Cllicf, there is any present necessity for in- creasing 01' for redistributing the military force of the Ullüe.d States in a certain section of this Confederation—for it is col'lfined to the southern I should not have offered the resolution States
as to any military plans, or military suffge.stions from the officer commanding in chief, but for in- formation, upon which I rely, that such military plans have been submitted to the Federal author- lty
I want to know, for thc information of my State, and for the information of all the States in- terested, whether, in the opinion of the President, there is any military necessity for changing the status of the military force of the country in ref- erence to one section of the country only; for the inquiry is confined to one section
In times like these, we are all aware that the very atrnosphere is filled with rumors and reports of the purposes of those in authority—the far greater proportion of them without any founda- tion in truth, and a great many of them with the truth perverted, whether designedly or ignorantly is immaterial
"VVhat we ought to know—what we have a right, in my judgment, to know—is whether there is anything in the condition of the country which, in the opinion of those
havinff authority—to wit, the President and those acting under him as military omcers—calls upon him and aut.horizes him to change the previous condition of the distribution of the military force of the United States with reference to one section of thc country onb.'
An honorable Senator near me, for whose opin- ions I have very great respect, has suggested, in- 23 TUESDAY, JANUARY 15, 1861
formally, that the resolution should directed I have thought it best, in the to the president
present state of things, to direct it to the Secretary of War, and to make it imperative; to make a mandate; to take from him, at least, all discretion
It is very certain, from the organization of the Government, that it will not be done without the sanction of the President; and if the President, in the exercise of his high responsibility, should consider that there is anything which makes it incompatible with the public interests that we should have that information, let him say so; but unless be does interpose, I desire that the resolu- tion of the Senate shall be imperative upon the subject
Now, sir, we know the honorable Senator from Mississippi has just announced that there are our States of this Union which have already de- clared themselves no longer members of the Con- federacy
We know that it is the opinion of many very el]kightened gentlemen that the act of those States is sirnply void, and in the career of Federal power not to be regarded
learn, sir, from very pregnant information, that there are other St,at.es, all confined to the southern section of country, who have it in their immediate contem- plation to take similar steps to abandon this Con- federation
As to onc of the States to which the resolution refers, we have official information, communicated to us by the President, that that State, acting in its highest sovereignty by the people asseu)bled in primary convention, have, in the exercisc of their sovereignty, withdraw n them- selves from this Confederacy
Such being the sta_te of facts in the section of the country to which the resolution refers, if it be true that the President of the United States has deemed Ili'uselfauthorized, or if it be true that the very high military offcer who is commander-in- chief of the Army of the United States, has con- sidered it an occasion for him either to volunteer or to prepare any instructions and plans for thc distribati01') of the military forces of the United States in th ose States, or upon the borders of those States, I should consider myself not discharginff the duties that belong to me asa Senator from one of those States, if I did not take the most direct means of bringing that information before the country
I hope, therefore, it will be the pleasure It is for in- of the Senate to pass the resolution
fbrl.vmation only
Mr
CLARR
I move to amend the resolution " the Secretary of War by striking out the words, and be directed to connuunicatc to the Senate, the President to insert
in lieu thereof the words, of the United States b
requested to communicate to tho Senate, if not incompatible with the public i service;" and on that amendment I ask for the I yeas and nays
Mr
MASON
The whole subject will be neces- sarily under the control of the President of the United States
The Secretary of War is but his minister
The Secretary of War will not obey the mandate of lhc Senate unless the President of the United States authorizes him todo so
Ifthe Presi- dcnt thinks that it is incompatible with timo public , interest to give this information, let him say so, upon his responsibility; but I object to out' direct-e ing it to the President, and thus, in terms, leaving it to his discretion, because it would imply that in the consideration of the Senate there might be something inconsistent with the public interest in informing the whole country of the relations in which the executive authority, or in which the highest military offcer in the land, stands in re- gard to one section of this country
I want toobtain the facts by a mandate upon the Secretary of War
If the President chooses to interpose, and to with- hold from us the information, let him do so; but I therefore oppose the I I would not suggest it
amendment
Mr
FESSENDEN
Mr
President, 1 (10 not feel particularly called upon to object to the reso- lution on the ground ofa want of the ordinary courtesy that is extended 10 the Chief Magistrate, particularly in t.h is case , comi ng from o•entlemen on the other side of the Chamber, and especially from NEW the Senator, from Virgi_nia, who is usu.till-y•éx- ceedingly particular: upon those points
L recol-
lect—although I- could not specify—more thanone instance in which, at the
suggesüon of the Sena' tor from Virginia, the amendment now, proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire has been made on the ground that it was not proper, in relation to
matters of delicacy especially, to call upon an inferior offeer in the form of a mandate; but that the direction should be to the PreSident, su cr«esting, or requesting, that he wot.fl(l communia cate the information if, in his judgment, he thought Mß
MASO'N
Will the Senator allow me, a moment
Mr
FESSENDEN
Certainly, Mr
MASON
I think—indeed I am sure—the Senator misapprehends the sort of objection that I have heretofin•e made
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 think not
Mr
MASON
According to my recollection, I think the Senator is mistaken
Sometimes, when a resolution offered by a Senator has been addressed to the President, without leaving it to his discretion, I have taken leavc to suggeét that .the President, being a coequal department of the Government, it has been always usual to leave hirn to determine whether it was compatible with the public interest; but -I have never, I am sure, when any Senator, upon his responsibility, has thought it right to address a mandate to:one of the offcers of the Government, suggested that it should be addressed to the President inscead of his subordinate in the Department
Mr
FESSENDEN
I may be in error with regard to my recollection on that subject so far as the Senator from Virginia is concerned
Of course 1 would not undertake to say so if he was posi- tivc the other way
But, Sir, we never address to the President a communication directing hiln to furnish us with information
; The ordinary form is to request him, precisely in the terms su«r- gested by my friend fron'l New Hampshire
How- ever, when we send a resolution to tbe Secretary of War or any other Secretary, the head ofa De- we generally direct him to furnish the Information
The oblection made in the present instance is: that from the very nature of t.his busi- ness, it is a matter of delicacy, and therefore we should not request the information, unless in such a form as to leave it to the discretion of the Ex- ecutivc to communicate it; because it might be that he wrould have to be obliged, necessarily, to make the communication to us in tbe form suæ- (rested by the honorable Senator from Virginia
Now sir, why should we depart from the usual form in this instance
Has the Senator given any reason
In the very nature of this matter sought to be inquired into, the Senate must perceive a rnat- ter of delicacy and difficulty
Everybody knoivs what the situation of the country is at the present time, and if these movements are made, and they are certainly founded upon something, not upon mere suspicion, of course Itisan executive Inatter, a military matter, which it is very likely ought not to be, in the judgment of the President, com- municated to the couhtry at the present time
The only reason the Senator gives is, that he should like to know whether the President will refuse the information
I do not perceive that that fact va- ries ita particle
If, he says, and it is undoubtedly true, the President thinks it is not compatible with the public interest to communicate this informa- tion, he will say so
If he will say so, why, then, avoid theordinary course of proceeding, which is considered c.ourteous to the Executive, aid put this in a different form from that which is usually adopted in like cases
It is not to be presumed that the Secretary of War will, without consulting tho Commander-in-Chief, communicate any informa- tion on matters of that description—I mean the President of the United Slates, the Commander- in -Chief of the A rmy
Why then avoid, I ask again, the ordinary course of proceeding in this case
I feel no very great interest in it, and i do not rise here to pro- tect the President against anything which is a de-  354 Le@idiaury___ courtesy op the pm•t political' friends
• They can do as they like withh•egard•
to him; but 'I suggest that it is hardly worth while to- vary from the ordinary course, and that which has-heretofore been deemed the proper and formgl one in addressing commu- i•iitätiöns of' thisßort from this body
But,' sir; there isone suggestion which I wish to make, a-nd In-rose -for the purpose of doing so
When the honorable Senator from New Hamp- Shire [Mr
•CLARK] -introduced a resolution some days; perhaps someweeks, since, making certain inquines with
reference to the forts in Charleston harbor sand' addressed, if I recollect properly, to the
President; the Senato* from Mississippi, the chair-man of the Committee on Military Affairs, Objebtod to the passage of the resolution, on the it I.Vas an improper interference with an-executivenatter; and he -went on at length to state that he objected entirely—unless there was Strong ground of suspicion that something was being done that was very injårious to the public ,—that we, who were •a legislative bödy, interests should undertake to interfere witf'l the details of- military arrangements
That was a single in- quiry as to what had been done in a particular case, and addressed in the most respectful manner to the Chief Magistrate; and the objection made —though perhaps a technical one, but unques- I tionably on sufiicient grounds; grounds satisfac- tory to the mind ofthc Senator whomade it—was, that it: was an improper interforence with- the province Of the Executive, especiallv in the direc- • tion of
the military arm, that all those matters depended for their effect, in a very great degree, upon secrecy, and it might be entirely improper for ueto be making inquiries about them—I do not know that he said it, but of course he meant it—unless in those cases where we might suppose there was danger to the country
Now, sir, here comes a resolution—not direct- ed to the President—not left to his discretion, I but directed to a suijordinate offcer, inquiring ! minutely into the details ofall the mili proceed- inos which havc bccn adopted for certainly a nt.un- bcr of weeks since this session commenced, and asking that they be made public and laid before the Senate
T hc objection certainly which was made by the Senator fi'0'ü Mississi ppi t.o t_he single in- quiry, to a mere request to the President, if ten- able at gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber acted upon it—is ceriainly pertinent and strong when directed to an order mandatory in its character, and covering the whole ground of the military proceedings of the President and the military department in relation to all matters now involved
l- shall make no sort of objection to the passage of this-resolution if put in its proper place; but the Senator and the Senate will perceive that nothing is gained by changing the ordinary cou pse of' proceedings; for have as body, as a Senate simply, no control over the Secretary of War
We cannot compel him to make the communi- cation if the President
thinks it not advisable; or otherwise, in my jitdgment, he is subject to this body alone under any circumstances, and therefore nothing il) tile world can be gained by the proposed mode of proceeding
ADMISSION OF
KANSAS
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mt•
FOSTER in the chair.) It becomes the duty of the Chair at this hour to announce the special order, being the resolution of the Senator from Virginia, [MG
HUNTER,) which was made the special order for this day at one o'clock, on which the Senator from Missouri, [Mr
POLK,] is entitled to the floor
Mr
COLLAMER
is the biil for the admission of Kansas; and that has precedence
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Vermont is right
The bill for the admission of Kansas into the Union has precedence
The other order only lay on the table
The bill (H
R
No, 23) for the admission of K.ansas into the Union was made the special order for this day at one o'clock; and being the older order, is prior to the resolution of tl-)Q Senator from Virginia, on which the Senator from Missouri has the floor
Mr
COLLAMER
I desire that proceedings shall be taken on the bill
have already pro CONGRESSIONAL that it may now be taken up and considered; indeed it ig up
Mr
PUGH
I understand the other resolution to bc the unfinished business of the last adjourn- ment; and if so, it has precedence, and the Senator from Missouri is clearly entitled to the floor
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The unfinished business is the motion to print the message of the President of the United States on the present dis- turbed state of the country
That is the unfinished business of Saturday
Mr
PUGH
I understand that the Senator from Missouri claimed the floor on that, and gave notice that he would speak to-day
The PRESIDINGOFFICER
The resolution of the Senator from Virginia was the resolution which was made the special order for to-day at one o'clock, and it was on that resolution that the Senator from Missouri was entitled to the floor
The bill for the admission of Kansas into the Union is an older special order, made the special order for to-day at one o'clock; and under the rules of the Senate, where there are several spe- Cial orders, the older order is the one which has therefore, is the business 
priority
That bill, now before the Senate
Mr
POLK
1 believe the order of business I would has been correctly stated by the Chair
prefer to submit to the Senate the remarks which I propose to address to the body, upon the order that was madc specially for to-day, and which the Chair first called up; but if the Senate shall determine otherwise, and determine to adhere to the oldest special order—the onc referred to by the Senator from Vermont—I shall feel myself at liberty to address the remarks that I may submit though I would pre- to the Senator on that order; fer that they should be submitted on the resolu- tion that wag on Friday made the special order for to-day
Mr
CÖLLAMER
1 have no objection to the I suppose he has a right to gel) tlcman 's course
his rcmarks on what topic he pleases; deliver but this is a subject that has been passed over several times, and I think the time has come when I therefore desire, and it sEiould receive action
insist on it, that we proceed to aet upon t.he bill in preferencc to any other special order, until it is finished
The PRESIDING OFFICER
House bilt No
23, for the admission of Kansas into the Union, is before the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole
Mr
PUGH
I Inove to postpone all prior orders, so as to take up •the resolution on which the Senator from Missouri is entitled to the floor
Certainly, I have never known a Senator who had l.)reparecl himself to speak, to have it refused that January 14, Durkee, Fessenden, Foot, Foster
Grimes, Hale, Harlan, • Trumbull, Wade, Wilkinson, and Wilson—27
So the motion x,vas not agreed to
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The bill is yet before the Senate
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 hope the Senator from Missouri will not take.the floor upon the bill, as has been suggested
The vote just Tiven is the most insulting breach of courtesy, m my judg- ment, that has ever been given in the Senate— utterly unworthy of the Senate; and I do trust the Senator from Missouri will show a proper ap- preciation of it by declining to take the floor
Mr
POLK
I shall decline taking the floor on the bill that has now, by the vote of the Senate on a call of the yeas and nays, been held before ! the Senate
1 have no recollection of ever havinæ seen such a thing take place since I have been in the Senate
Mr
GREEN
1 hope my colleague will me to make a suggestion
The motion just made was to postpone indefinitely
It is now perfectly competent to postpone to a day certain
'As to- morrow has been fixed for the consideration of the Pacific railroad bill, move to postpone the bill now before the Senate until one o'clock on W5dnesday next, and make it the special order that time
{Ir
TRUMBULL
1 was out of the Senate when the question was put that has just been decided
I voted against postponing; but
I cer- tainly did not vote against postponing with any idea that I was practicing a discourtesy upon any one; and, as the Senator from Louis:ana has so intimated, I should like to know what the state of facts was
The question was being taken when I came into the Senate, and I voted against post- poning the proposition to take up the Kansas bill, because I thought it irnportant that that question should bc considered
I certainly am of that opin- ion st.ill; but, in casting that vote, I certainly did not intend it as a discourtesy to the Senator from Missouri in any way
I do not think the ques- tion was understood in that shape here around me
I certainly did not understand it so
Mr
LATHAM
I voted to continue the con- sideration of the bili to admit Kansas; because understood the Senator from Missouri to state dis- tinctly that he perfectly willing to make his speech on that bill
Therefore, I thought it was a zne-re question of priority of business; and ac- cordingly, I gave my votc to go on with the bill to admit Kansas
Certainly, discourtesy was intended by me to the Senator from Missouri
Mr
FOOT
I desire to state it •was so under- stood on this side of the Chamber; and under that impression and assurance, we voted against tha postponement of the prior orders
he should t.nk{l up the particular question on Which Mr

COLLAMER
He said he would speak this subject before the Senate; but we understood on this bill
the genileman to announce that he would speak Mr

FORTS AND ARSENALS IN THE STATES
The Senate resumed the consideration of the following resolution, submitted by Mr
HUNTER on the 2d instant: Whereas certain forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and •other needful buildings, have been placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States by a cession to that effect from certain States, and it may be the desire of onc or more of t.hose States to resume the jurisdiction thus ceded : Now, therefore, Be it •resolred, That the President of the United States ought to be authorized by law, upon the application of the Legislature, or of a regular cenvention of the people , of any such States, to retrocede this jurisdiction to such.States, upon taking proper security tör the sate-keeping and return of all the property of the United States, or for paying for the value of the sauue if destroyed or injured by the act of any of the States Inaking such application
The pending question was on the amendment of Mr
TRUMBULL, which was to strike out the prcamble, and all the resolution after the word " that," and, in lieu of it, to insert: We fully approve DC thc bold and patriotic act Of Major Anderson, in withdrawing from Port Moultrie to Fort Sum- ter, and the detennination of the President to maintain that fearles.s officer in his present position ; and that we will support the President in all constitutional measures to enforce the laws an(l preserve the Union
Mr
POLK
Mr
President, in the momentous crisis precipitated upon the country, I have felt constrained hitherto to refrain from participating in the debate occasioncd by it
I have feared that if I should speak I might say something which might be productive of harm; that, under the pressure of excitement or of interest for my State and constituents, I might not heed as implicitly as I oucrht the dictates of moderation and patriot- ism
Bat, representing, in part, on this floor, a State whose welfare know is most deeply involved—a border slaveholding State, and though one of the youngest, yct onc of the most populous of the soulhcrn States; indeed, the first of • all of them in white population—I feel that duty allows
me to remain silent no longer
Mr
Prcsident, the Roman historian, Tacitus, in describing the condition of the eternal imperial city when about to receive the shock of one of those startling revolutions which transferred the imperial purple from one Emperor to another, used this language: G Non tunvult•us, non quies, sed quale magnæ iræ, mao•ni ntetu.s, silent'ium E fruit." There 'tvas not turnult, there was not quiet; but the silence of great wrath und great fear
This, I apprehend, is the condition of the southern half of our Confederacy at this hour
The noise and excitement of the late presidential cttnvass are past

Six others are on the of being removed • soon to be followed, it may be, by half of the re idue, including among the slaveholding States t e first and the last to come into the Union
the circumstanccs which r- Mr
President, round us are enough to force us to pause and to porjder
And if we do so, we shall perceive the cold shadow-of events still more startling comino• upon usin the future
Even now vision Of civil war begins to rise up before us; but we are not yet able to discern the form thereof
Sir, Ilféel, for me, that we are in the midst of a crisi$ unprecedented in our history
It may be 'ihe
vei•y crisiS of our country's fate
Some affect to ignore it all; as, for instance, the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
WADE,] who first ad- dvessed the Senate
Some, again, try to argue against it
'l'hat is the wisdom of the ostrich, which thinks to escape .hiB pursuers by hiding his head in the sand
Othe}s still strive to allay apprehension
they say; " thcrc is no sufficient cause for danger." Grant it; nnd the danger is not thereby removed
Whatconcerns us, and what we ought to be concerned about, is the magnitude of the evil
It matters not how trifling and insignificant the cause
A very small leak will sink a line-of- battle ship; and when tho noble craft has gone down forever, it will not relieve the disaster to point out the smallness of the cause
You mav tell me never so eloquently how she was able to battle with the storm-king on his own element, and to vanquish him; but the fact still remains that the gnawings Of an insect has sunk her into the abyss
The American Revolution, says Mr
Is it not Webster, was fought on preamble
wiser and better to admit the truth, and look the danger full in the face
Then we may 'hope to prevent, or at least to avoid it
The prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth him- selt'; but the fool passcth on, and is punished." But there are causes, Mr
President, for the I perilous condition of affairs which is upon us
know Senators say, statc your grievances; draw up your bill of indictment; implying that there arc no grievances, and that no bill of indictment can be drawn up
They are in crror
They gay, you complain of the Government; and yet the Government has been, for most of the time, in the hands of the Democratic party." CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January '14, tion of the spirit of the Missouri compromise
Moreover, the admission of California destroyed the equilibrium in the Senate between the slave- holding and thb •non-slaveholding States forever, and- put the South at the mercy of the North
But the complaint, I repeat, is not against the It is against the action of certain Government
States, and of the people of those States—States which are the parties to the constitutional com- pact, on which rests the Union of which they and their southern sisters are alike members
They reap special advantagcs from the Union, in the protection it gives to their manufacturin«r industry; in the bounties it lavishes upon their fishing interests; in the discriminations it imposes in favor ofthcir commcrcc; in the millions of ex- penditures it pours annually into their lap; and they cry very loudly for its preservation, while, at the very same time, they are violating the Con- stitution which supports the Union
They vio- late the compact on their part, and insist that their southern confederates shall be required, nay f coerced by force and by war, to keep it on their part; as if, in the language of Mr
Webster, " a compact broken on orle side was not broken on all sides." They pass their personal libcrty bills there are some exceptions; I single them out, and honor them—bills in the very teeth of the Con- stitution, in contempt of it, and intended to de• prive their southern brethren of their undoubted rights under the Constitution
These bills not only do wrong and injury to their southern brethren, but they intensify the wrong by adding insult to the injury
They are passed in States wherc it has been admitted on this floor a fugitive slave scarcely ever goes—not onc in forty years, according to the Senator from Vermont, (Mr
COLLAMLR.Ü A high-spirited peo- plc may bear wrong, but it is quite too much to expect that they will bear with patience insult added to the wrong; and this, too, from those standing in the relation of friends and brethren
" It was not an enemy that reproached me,' says I the wor(l of inspiration; " then could have borne but it was thou, a man mine equal, rny guide and minc acquaintance.' T hc fugitive escapes
Is he delivered up in obe- dicncc to the ccnumand of the Constitution
No, i hc is harbored and secreted and hastened on Sir; [f the, nmster is passing through the his way
in the spirit of I State, is he bid God-speed friendship and fraternity
On the contrary, his slave is enticed away by false promises, or is ravished from him by force
Underground rail- roads are established, stretching from thcremotest slaveholding States clear up to Canada
Secret acrencies are put to work in the very midst of our slaveholding communities, to steal away the slaves
T hc constitutional obligation for the rendition of the fugitive from service is violated
The laws of Congress enacted to carry tllis provision of the Constitution into effect are not executed
'I"heir execution is prevented
Prevented, first, by hos- i tile and -unconstitutional State legislation
Sec- ondly, by a vitiated public sentiment
Thirdly, l, by the conceaiing of the slave, so that the United , States law cannotbe made to reach him
And when they are in error again
The complaint is not I I the runaway is arrested under the fugitive slave ered his slave; he has never recovered a dollar of his value, although he has spent more than his Valuc in the endeavor
He has recovered judg- ment, and incurred costs, and that is all
And in this very case the sunreme court
of Wisconsin coni- mitted the judicial outrage of deciding the fugitive slave law unconstitutional
And even yel the fruitless litigation is not ended
This lawlessness is felt with special seriousness in the border slave
States
The underground railroads start mostly from these States
Hundreds of thousands of dol- Idrs are lost annually
And no State loses more heavily than my own
Kentucky, it is estimated, loses annually as much as $200,000
The other border States, no doubt, lose in the same ratio, Missouri much more
Bat all these losses and outrages, all this disre- gard of constitutional obligation and social duty, are as nothing in their bearing upon the Union, in comparison with the animus, the intent and purpose, of which they are at once the fruit and thecvidence, They demonstrate thattheauthority of the Constitution has ceased to be respected at the North
That instead of fraternal feelings—instead of the good faith which ought to subsist between confederates—there are animosity and bad faith
And it is rendered worse still by the consideration that it was-not so in the earlier and better days of the Repüblic
Then there were loyalty to the Constitution and kindness towards the South
These are now changed, it is to be feared, into disloyalty and hatred
If so, how remorseless is that hatred
Earth hath no hate like love to malice turned, Nor hell a demon like a brother scorned." Is this a gloomy and portentous picture
1 fear it is not equal to thesad reality
A worse picture is yet to be added
These sentiments have become the animatin& spirit of a political party
They have found ex- pression in its platform of principles; they have nominated candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency; and they have elected them bya strict- ly sectional vote
The candidate just elected to the Presidency was the first man of his party to enunciate the dogma that there is an irrepressible conflict between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding States
This house of the Constitution, made by oar fathers, and which they supposed , by being divided into many apartmen Is, s,vas thcrcby rcn- dcred morc commodious for a harmonious Family of numerous and happy States; this Union, we a house divided against itself
have been told, The Senator from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH,] not fong since, showed, beyond
cavil, that Mr
Lincoln, in uttering that sentiment, had reference to slavery in the States; not merely in the r Iterritories, but also and especially in the States
Moreover, Mr
Lincoln has announced the cerous dogma that, in point of political the neo•ro is the equal of the white man
in a speec.h mado by him at Springfield, Illinois, on the 17th of July, 1858, he said: I adhere to the Declaration of Independence
r f Judge DOUGLAS and his friends are not willing to stand by it, ket thein coine up and ainelld it
Let thenl make it read that all Incn are created equal, except negroes.' Again : Mv declarations upon this subject may be misrepre- against the Government
To assume that it is, is a great mistake
To bc sure, the action of the Government affecting thc institution of slavery has been prejudicial to the South, and violative of its constitutional rights
That was the case when the admission of my own State was resisted, and the Missouri restric- Lion was enacted into a law
The South has borne the weight of that unconstitutional restric- lion for more than a
quarter of a century
But Bhe did not complain, because it was the work in part of southerl) men
That was the case acrain in the passage of the Oregon territorial bill
President Polk, a
south- ern rnan, deprecated the blow aimed against the rights of the citizens of the slaveholding States by that bill as unjust and unequal
Yet, yield ing to wrhat he deemed the spirit of the Missouri compromise, he signed it
He signed it, be- cause Oregon was north of the compromise line of 360 30
That, still again, was the case in the admission or California
California did not lie north Gf 360 30'; and .he:• constitution did not t.olerate slavery; and she was admitted into the Union, in viola- law—which, however, is seldom the case—he is very often rescued
It is said that, in such case, sent.ed", hut cannot be misunderstood
I have said that 1 do when suits are broutrht
acainst the rescuers, not understand the Declaration to mean that all men were courts and juries will enforce the laws against created equal in all respects
'l'hey are not equal color; but, I suppose that it does mean to declarc that all men are them
But all this is accompanied by delay and equal in respects; they are equal in their right to life, vexation, and the most serious expenses—far ex- liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' Certainlv,thenegro cecding thc value of the slave
Ar)d even when not our equal in color—perhaps not in man-y other re- , in the right to put in his mouth the bread his judgment is obtained, it is, in many cases, value- own hands have earned, he is the equal of every other man, less, for nothing can be znade on the execution

cither worthless negroes or This needs no comment; its meaning is plain I equally insolvent white inen
But worse than all ' i and unequivocal
I how beg to call the attention these rescues arc always accompanied by violence of the Senate for a moment only to the platform and consequently by the most imminent peril to upon which Mr
Lincoln secured his election
the master
They are effected by mobs Of ex- Considering the history and antecedents of this cited and fanatical whitc men and reckless black party, no man can doubt that the fol\owin« por- men, themselves runaway slaves

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
ent Democratic Administration has exceeded the worst apprehensions of the convention, (the Chi- cago convention,) among other thingo, "in con- struing the persönal relation between master and servant to involve," as they say, " an unqualified property in persons." And again, the eighth resolution is as follows: That the normal condition of the territory of tho Ünitcd States is that of freedom
That as our republican täthers, when they had abolished slavery in all our national territory, ordained that no person should be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due brocess of law, it be- comes our duty, by legislation, wrbcnever such legislation is necessary, to maintain this provision of the Constitution against all attempts to violate it
And we deny the author- ity of Congress, of a 'Iterritorial Legislature, or of any indi- viduals, tn give legat existence to slavery in any 'Iterritory of the United States." Now, consider this in connection with the dec- laration made on the floqu• of the United States Senato in 1857, by thc Scnator from New York, [Mr
SEWARD,] who may be considered the leader of the party, that the Supreme Court of the Uni- ted States must be reformed, which means that the national judiciary must be abolitionized; and is it not evident that the writ of habeas corpus might bc brought into use to effect the liberation of tliC Is not such a slaves in the sla•veholding States
purpose palpable, and such a result probable 
What, then, could the slaveholdingStåtesexpect, after the election of such a candidate upon such a platform, but that all the patronage and all thc power of the Federal Governmellt, in all its depart- 2nents, would be brought to bear upon the inst_i- tution of slavery in the South, in order to com- pass its destruction
To this effect have been the plain and unmis- takable avowals of the Republican part.y since the It has constituted (he election of its candidates
theme of their rejoicimys•, it has rung from the members of the Republican party, including both Senators and Representatives, that they have shown a disposition as unyielding and defiant as even Mr
Giddings could have desired
Nothing is to be conceded, it would seem, even if the de- struction of the Union is to be the consequence
Sir, at the formation of the Constitution, twelve of the thirteen States were slaveholding
And even Massachusetts herself had been a slavehold- ing colony; nor had she
ever abolished slavery by 
any statute law
Thcy all recognized the right of property in slaves
The Constitution was adapted to the institution of slavery as it then existed, and was in accord- ance with thc public sentiment of the whole coun- try at tho time
Accordingly, no man doubted that it rec.ocnized property in slaves, and was
designed to protect it wherever the national flag I was unfurlcd, on sea or on land
No question was made as to the right of the master to carry his slave with him into the common Territories of the Union
Even the men of Massachusetts Its denial would no doubt have conceded it
vvrould have lessened thc market, and consequently depreciated the price that the New England slave trader might gct the slaves hc was importing from Africa by the ship-load
The flag of the Union protected this property on its passage from Africa to the slave States of the South
The trea- tics of the country with foreign nations specially mur, to the destruction of such an mazingamount of property
Sir, no people,-in anv dgo.ofil,id world, in any country,- Or climes ufider anv of government, has ever submitted to the 'dé- struction of a hundredth part of it without resiSt• ance and revolution
But there is a more horrible result still to lo•.v; especially in those States where the black slaves greatly outnumber; the free Whites
This I forbear to hold up to view
'I draw a vail over it
Let not its horrors be reven suggested to the imagination
I um satisfied, Mr
President, that there existS, and is spreading among the masses of the citizenx of the southern section •of our Union, alarm in all the slaveholding States, rear and profound alarm, for the safety both of their property and of the lives- of their •vvives and children
•The Presidénc has sketched tl)is in the following sentences of his last annual message: The inmediate peiil arises not so much from these causes as from tbc fact that the incessant an-d violent agl- I t.ation of the slavery question throughout the North, for the last quarter ofa century, has at length produced its -malign influence on the slaves, and inspired them with vague no- tions of freedom
Hence, a sense of security no longer exists around the fan)ily altar
This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrection
Many a mason
throughout the South retires at night in dread of what may befåll herself and children betöre the morning
Should this apprehension ofdomestic danger, whether real or imaginary, extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade the tnasses of the southern people, then dis- stipulated for the indemnification •of the loss of union will become inevitable
Self-preservation is the first I slaves
This was done in Jay 's treaty
I t was lavv of nature, and has been implanted in the heartot' man by his Creator for the
wisest purpose; and no political done in the treaty of Ghent;" and the treaty for union, however t•raught with blessings and benefits in all the acquisition of Louisiana rccoffnizes and pro- other respects, can long continue, if the necessary conse- tccts the right of property in slaves
quence be to render the homes and the firesides of nearly But the tirncs have changed
States have institutions; and now eighteen of changed their ofthcm are non-slaveholding—a majority in num- ber, and the majorit.y in population—and now the press; it has spoken from the rostrun:u
editors and potiticians have reiterated it
The v political power of the country is in their hands
Eut the Constitution is not changed
No amend- attitude and temper of the party have been not ment ha.s been added to it on the subject of sla- merely .morc arrocrant, but morc hostile and moro very
It rctnains exactly the same to-day that it threatening, since their triump h than before, evinc- was in 178.9
Yet, Mr
President, what do we ing a detoro•ination to use
their victory axrair:.st now behold
A political party has been organ- the rights of the slaveholding States of the Union, izcd upon orie idea of hostility to sla- rcgard]css of the consequences
The New York Tribune, which may bcsaid to it very,and its ultimate and certain abolition inevery section and State of our broad republic; and it have been the war-horse of Mr
Lincoln 's cam- paion, and whose editor is supposed to have been his special friend in the Chicago convention, on the 22d of December last, published the followrinc
We arc enabled to state, in tbc most positive terms, that Mr
Lincoln is utterly opposed to any enneession or compronjise that shali yield one iota of the position occU- pied by the Republican party on the subject of slavery in the Territories ; and that he stands now, as he stood in May last, when he accepted the nomination for the Presidency, square upon the Chicago platform." And the Springfield Journals which is consid- ered Mr
Lincoln's home organ, after the States bordering on the Guff of Mexico had begun to evince a determination to take tbc steps deemed necessary by them to insure their domestic tran- quillity, published an articlc in which occurs the following strong language: Let the secessionists understand it; let the press pro- claim it;
let it fly on the wings of the lightning, and fall like a thunderbolt mnong those now plotting treason in con- vention, that the Republican party, that the great North, aided by hundreds of thousands of' patriotic mcn in the slave States, have determined to preserve the Union—peaceably, if they can; forcibly, if they inust." In a speech made by him, at a public meeting of his partisan friends in Massachusetts, shortly after the late presidential election, assembled in order to rejoice over their victory, one-of the Sen- ators on this floor from that State [MI'
WILSON] is reported to have said, that they now had their heel upon the neck oftbe slave power
And Mr
Giddings, of Ohio, who has the utation of having procurcd the insertion in the Chicago platform of the portion most hostile to southern institutions, has lately held forth in the foliowinff strain: Let it be understood that we do not recognize the right of any menuber of Congress to rnake platftn•nis for us; that we shall -not recounize their right or assumption to abandon our principfes or aaerifiee our honor: at the dictates of our enemies, whom we have triurnphantly vanquished at the, ballot-box." But, Mr
President, there was no neod of his holding such lano•uage to the members of Congress of his partyin either House
We know full well, from the reports of the committee of thirty-three in the House, and of the committee of thirteen it) the Senate, and fröm the temper evinced by the has triumphed
It has wrought a revolution in the public sentiment of the country against SIR- very, and is about to ina.uryurate a revolution in the policy and administration of the Government for its extinction
Mr
President, has the South no cause for alarm for the safety of her institutions, and the security I of her rigllts
Is not her very existence at stake
How long could she retain the institution of sla- very after the whole power of the Federal Gov- ernment shall have been brought to bear upon her for its destruction
Think w}oat
could be effected by the Federal legislation
Abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia; abolition in the arsenals, dock-yards, and forts; outlawry of it on the high seas, and wherever the flag of the Union floats; exclusion of it from the common Territories belonging equally to all the States; circumscribing it as with a wall of fire within the States
Then let the long and strong arm of the Exec- utive power of the Government be put forth for its extinction within the States
Sir, it will be mighty to the pulling down of the strongholds of southern institutions and rights
Against almost everything else but this, the South might protect herself
Cohorts of Federal offce.holders, Abo- litionists, may be sent into her midst to exert the patronage, influence, and power of their offces, half thc parties to -it habitually and hopelessly insecure
i Sooner or later the bonds of such a union must be severed," This very alarm is one of the most Intolerable of tho grievances inflicted on the South by the ceaseless and systematic aggressions of Northern abolitionism and negroism
NO people can con- sent to live in the midst of alarms by _day, and terror by night
Last of all others will the Amer- ican people in the slavchoJding States of this Con
federacy consent, to it
terror by night" is ranked by the Sir, the sacred penman In the same category with the arrow that flieth by day, and the pestilence that walketh in darkness, and the destruction that wasteth o.t noon-day
I am also satisfied, sir, that there is a settled purposc on the part of the peoplc of' thc southern I States to have the difficulties now brought upon them settled fully and forever, and settled at once
Nothing short of this will meet the exi«rencies of the present crisis
And in order to such settle- ment, irrepealable amendments of the Constitu- tion ought to bo made, covering the following points: 1
Express and uncquivocal recognition of the right of property in slaves
2
A •similar recognition of the right of the owner to take his slaves into the common terri- tory of the United States, and to have his rigut of property in them protected by the Federal Government there, and wherever elsc its jurisdic- {ion extends
3
That Congress shall have no power to abol••• isli slavery in places under its immediate juris- diction situated within the limits of the States I that permit the holding of slaves
4
Nor within t.l'iC District of Columbia, so long as slavery shall cxist in either of the States of Virginia or Maryland, nor without the consent of the inhabitants, nor without just cornpcnsation first made to such owners as do not consent to such abolishment
5
Nor shall Congrcgs have power to prohibit and to plot and conspire acrainst proper- t y, her peace
Pqstmasters—more than thirtccn or hinder thc transportation of slaves from ono thousand—with all their employös, controlling the State to another, nor to the District of Columbia, mails and loading them down with incendiary II nor to a Territory of the United States
documents Add t-o these, land officers, surveyors 6
That, when the owner shall be prevented of land, surveyors of ports, collectors of customs, from retaking I'lis fugitive slave, or when such assistant treasurers, judges and marshals, each of l! fugitive shall be rescued from him by force, he these, with all his employés, intent upon one aim
shall receive compensation for the value of his What institution could withstand such an inva- slave
sion, such sappino and mining
Even the Senator p All this the slaveholding States ought to have; from Ohio [Mr
WADE] is not surprised that the and all this the non-slavcholding ought to be citizens of the slaveholding States should begin ing to concede
They ought to be willing to make these concessions, first, for the suffeientand com- to arouse themselves from their supinencss
T hc slave property of the South, sir, is worth manding reason tl'lat they would relieve the com- Is it to mon country
thrcc and a half or four billion dollars
Secondly
They are fully varranted by the be expeéted that a bravo and intelligent pcople woufd submit without resigtance, without a mur- Constitution as it mw stands, and are in  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 14, concqrdåwith both its provisions and spirit
Ac- cording '10 i.h.e opinion of the Supreme Court of the U.r,ifed States—the appropriate and the ap- péinted tribunal for the arbitrament of such ques- tions—.he tribunål of last resort—they are guar- antied by the Constitution, as it was made by our fathers
*Thirdly
The Republican party has, brought aboüt the condition
of things-which *has made stich concessions necessary, and-that same party ought3 to be ready to grant the concessions which are needed in' order to remedy these evils
If they haye done
wrongs or inflicted injury, both justice and 'magnanimity require that they should make prompt and full 'reparation
In this, at least, you receive the hearty and cordial coöperation of the Democracy of the North
The northern De- mocrå€y, -have always been willing to sustain the COnstitution accord tng to its true construction , and So as to secure to the citizens of the slaveholding States their just and equal rights
Fourthly
You of the Republican party alone have the power to heal the dissensions which are dissolving the Union
The South cannot do it
The political power, adequate to the task, has passed out of their hands into yours
The north- ern Democracy are also unable to accomplish it
• They can only aid you
Fifthly
'I'he northern States constitute the more populous and the more powerful section
Con- sequently you incur no danger by making the eopeessions
Sixthly
You are the victorious and the domi- nant party, and you ought not to be willing to abuse your power to the oppression of the van- quished and weaker section
Nay, more; stand- ing in aposition where a wantof generosity would be a reproach, you ought ever to be prompt to tender overtures
And, lastly
, the South asks no pecuniary' ad- vantage
She only demands safety
Can it be refused 
Mr
President, the honorable Senator from Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN] has introduced into •the Senatc a joint resolution, proposing a number of articles as amendments to the Consti- tution
in the main, these articles meet my ap- probation
But I frankly confess I have objec- tions to that one—the first of the series—which proposes to extend the Missouri restriction ' line of 360 30' of north latitude, through thc ter- ritory of the United States, westwardly to Cali- fornia, excluding slavery north of the line, and requiring that it shall be protected by the territo- rial government, in all its departments, south of the line, And yet, sir, so anxious am I to re- lieve the country, that I would consent to waive my objections, and vote for the article, if peace and harmony could be restored, and the Union be preserved
I would vote for the article, althougl'i do not think it will do eqaal.jnsticc to the South
The partition of thc territory it proposes to make is unequal and disproportionate, and for that rea- It gives by far the larger part of' the son unjust
common territory to the North—at least four fifths of it
It says, to be sure, that the States that may be admitted into the Union, fcn•mcd in this portion, shall come in with or without sla- very, accordingly as their constitutions shall pro- vide
But, sir, we all well know, that if the slave- holder is never allowed to go there with his prop- erty, no slaveholding State will ever be fornied there
This portion of thc tcrritory, therefore, which, as I have already said, is four times larger than the other, is Inevitably forever set apart for free &ates
But is the other portion, which is by far the smaller one, secured to the slaveholding States
By no mealis
For the non-slaveholder m-ay settle there•as well as the slaveholder
And, sir, all the northern portion boing secured to the North, the emigrant aid societies will be able to devote all their means and energies to occupy the srnaller Southern part
It will, of course, bc much easier to make the conqucstof the one fifth than it would of thie whole It may be accomplished in one fifth of the time
'Ithis proposition, it seems to me, gives them a more favorable opportunity even than thev now have without it, of accomplishing the cher*jshed object of surrounding slave- holding States With a cordon of hostile non-slave- holding ones, as with a wall of fire, so as either to smother the institution or to make it destroy itself; the scorpion, as they say, surrounded by fire
If I remember correctly the terms of the prop- osition offered by the Senator from Minnesota, [Mr
RICE,] in regard to the Territories, prefer it to thåt of the Senator from Kentucky, [MI', CRITTENDEN.] But .1 speak of the proposition of the Senator from Minnesota only from recollec- tion
I have it not before me
Mr
President, I repeat, that, in my opinion, the diffculties and dangers which are thickening around us every hour can be dissipated but by one course
Concessions must be made full and certain, and that without delay
There is but one other alternative left, and that is a dissolution of our beloved Union
And now, Senators of the Republican party, if you are resolved to force this alternative, and refuse everything else, all the slaveholding States must, of necessity, make common cause—the bor- der and more central ones with their sisters of the southern extreme; and thus it will be the secession, not of one State only, nor of tbe cotton States merely; but of fifteen States
They have common institutions and interests, common ties and sympathies, and kindred blood
I apprehend that son)e harbor the belief that there is difference of opinion among the slave- holding States, and that when the time comes, there will be difference of
action
They imagine that the border States will refuse to go with the more southern ones
This, sir, I am sure, is a great mistake.
God grant it may not prove fatal
My own State is a border slaveholding State
She loves the Constitution which supports this Union with an affection as ardent and as profound as that of any of her confederated sisters
The principles of that Constitution constitute the very life-blood of her body-politic
'l'hey animate and quicken hcr social system, and- thrill and vibrate through its evcry nervc and fiber
Her gallant sons have always been proud " to march under the flag and kccp step to the music of the Union." They have rushed to every battle- field when the honor of the Union has been at stake
And when, last war, Mexicans our wore heeding the cxhortation " to welcome Amer- icans to Mexican soil with bloody hands to hos- pitablc graves," they were quick to accept the bloody greeting
But if you are determined to push and precipitate disunion upon the country, though I am i10t authorized to speak for Mis- souri, yet do feel authorized to express belief that she will not hesitate to take her posi- tion with the South
Her institutions, hcr inter- ests, present and prospective, her lineacre, and the manners and habits and sympathies of her peo- ple, all " grapple her to the South with hooks of The institution of slavery was planted upon soil whcn it was first purchased by Mr
Jef- ferson from the First Consul •of the French
It is there still, with the ancient inhabitants of the upper Louisiana and their descendants
It has been greatly augmented and strengthened by the Amer- lean irnmirrration
It constitutes the wealth of hcr citizens, t.o the large extent of Ijerhaps one hundred million dollars
It contributes in a large degree to the support of her agricultural industry
It produccs two of her great staples almost exclusively—hemp and tobacco
Mr
President, let it not be supposed that Mis- souri will be deterred from taking her position because she has non-slaveholding States on her borders, some of whose people may be hostile to slavery
Sir,shc has already suffered deeply, grievously, from this cause; suffered not only by the loss of property, but by the loss of the lives of her citi- zens
No State has suffcrcd more, none perhaps so much
The underground railroad has been vifforouslyoperated against hef
Abolition incur- sions have been made into hcr territory, destroy- ing both life and property
John Brown made his first raids into Missouri
As recently as the cmnmencement of this very session of Congress, she has becn compelled to march a regiment of her citizen soldiery to her southwestern border, to protect her peaceful agriculturists against the incursions for robbery and murder of Montgom- ery and his band of " jayhawkers" and despera- does
And at this very moment she has a patrol of three companies of rangers and one of artillery upon that border, in order to maintain her own sovere,ignty upon her own soil
Will she be worse off when those of the resi- dents in the neighboring States who are the foes of her institutions and her peace shall be regarded by her as such, than she has been, while they were treated as friends
In the changed posture of affairs her citizens will be more vigilant and better prepared
And vigilance and preparation are the best guarantees of safety, Mr
President, I am sorry to say that Missouri seems to be the first of the slaveholding States selected after Mr
Lincoln's election for abolition attack
The New York Tribune, one of the most prominent of the organs of thé Abolitionists, shortly after the late presidential election, con- tained an article on that election
In that article it descanted upon the results and bearings of the election generally, and also especially in reference to Missouri
It used the following language: Deeply as we all rejoice on the general result of the election, there is even greater reason förpleasure and hope in the condition of things it thug reveals in Missouri
Here, then, is a slave State entering upon a struggle to rid herself greatest curse that can ever bet-an a peo- plc
She needs our help
She needs the cneoura oemcnt of the Inoral influence of the North on behalf of freedom
She needs, above all, that the tide of free emigration pour- ing westward should, as far as possible, find homes upon her soil
'Chis part of the subject, especially, we commend to the attention of all parties who propose to seek for them- selves new abodes in the great West." But, sir, if disruption is to be forced upon us, we can at least guard ourselves acrainst incursions of that sort
Mr
President, I ought not to say, I will not say, that Missouri would be better off in the event of secession than she is nöw
But I may say that I cannot see how she can be greatly worse off
But, sir, I do not present before the Senate of the Uni- ted States the reasons why Missourians, in case of a division of the Confederacy into a northern and southern one , willfix the destiny of their State with the South
These reasons are properly reserved for another locality
Yet, Mr
President, I am satisfied that the citizens of Missouri do not desire to see the disruption of this Government
It would rend the «reat heart-strings of the entire State
She wouli submit to the most painful catastrophe with feelings like those with which an affectionate daughter would part forever from her long-loved and deeply-venerated mother.
Will you not spare her the mournful separation
Mr
President, I do not propose to argue the rigl•nt, under the' Constitution, of separate State secession
The controversy, in my opinion, has progressed beyond that stage of it
Secession is now already an accomplished fact
It has been thrice repeated
To stop to argue its constitution- ality is to lag behind the march of events
would be something like discussing the legality of the judgment ofa court, after its sentence had been executed and the convict hanged
Secession having actually t.aken place in four States, and just on the point of taking place in at least three others
we must now deal with its consequences
Following after secession, there comes upon us a question of more momentous import; and that is: has the Federal Governmcnt, by the Consti= tution, the right to coerce a seceding State back into the Union by force
In the emergency which is upon us this is now a practical question; and it is as Inomentous as it is urgent
Gentlemen on the other side seem to me to approach the subject under wrong impressions
They seem to think that the States were made for the Federal Government, and not the Federal Government for the States
But the truth is, that the Federal Government was made by the States for the States
Now suppose that Government becomes hos- tile in its spirit
and destructive in its action to the bights and institutions of the people of a portion of the States: what then
Lot the spirit which dictated our Declaration of Independence answer
On the other hand, suppose it fails to answer the purpose of its creation, and instead of insurino• domestic tranquillity, destroys it: what then 
Let the example of the revolutionary fathers, in wi th- drawing themselves and their States from the Government of the old Confederation, answer
The Senator from Ohio [Mr
PUGH] has said that he wid not stretch forth his hand to remove the vail behind which stands the Atlas which supports on his shoulders alone the firmament of our federative system
But, sir, 1 have no such aversion
I am willing to see the danger that lies I before us
If this Government is about torush into  •1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL the vortex of ruin, ',vant to know it
If civil war is removed from us but by a single step, do not let me be ignorant of it, lest I take that step in the dark
Hide from me the day when the dying agonies of my country shall begin; but do not hide from me the lawless and fåtal policy which must inevitably plunge ber into the mortal strife
By the tenth amendment of the Constitution— The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the pcoplc." The power to coerce , therefore, does notcxist— cannot exist., unless it has been delegated to the United States by the Constitution
Dut there is It follows, of no delegation of any such power
necessity, that the Federal Government does not possess it
And it will not sumce to argue that the Government ought to possess it
AIL such argument is confuted and confounded by the sin- gle and simplc truth that the Constitution nowhere gives the power
Nor will iqanswer to attempt to raise the power by implication
The very terms of the constitu- tional provision just quoted preclude the impli- forever
They utterly exclude any such conclusion
Yet somc persist in the attempt to deduce the power from I understood the Sena- the nature of compacts
tor from Tennessee , who first add ressed the Senate , to pursue that course
It is said that " whcn two parties make a compact, there results to each the power of compelling the other to execute it." Results from what
Such powcr can only re- sult, either, first, from thc compact itself, or sec- ond, from the fact of making it
It does not result from the compact, because we have already seen that the compact itself gives no such power to the it cannot result from the General Governmcntn fact of making the compact, because the compact itself expressly decla.res that it shall not vest ex- cept by Its own express delegation
But the States made the compact—the Consti- tution—not with the Federal Government, but with cach other
'Ehe Federal Government never was a party to any compact with the States
Therefore, by the very postulate itself, that Gov- ernment can have no right to enforce the execu- tion of a compact to which it never was a party
The postulate assumed goos upon the further assumption, that the Constitution is a compact between the Federal Government and the States
But that assumption is false in fact
If such a power, therefore, as is assumed in the postulate—the power of forcible coercion— exists anywhere, it must belong to the other con- tracting States, which are parties to the Federal Constitution, and not to the Federal Government
The Federal Government is the result of' the com- It can only use the powers pact, and that
is all
given to it in express terms by the compact, noth- in" more
Unless the power, therefore, is vested in the Federal Government by the very terms of the compact, or, in other words, by the Consti- tution
it can neither coerce a State to remain in the Union, nor punish hcr when she goes out
But no such power is delegated by the Constitu- (ion to the Federal Government
The absence of this power is no casus ovnissus in the Constitution
So far from it, the very point was presented and pressed upon the convention which framed the Constitution, at the very com- mencement of its deliberations
The convention met
and commenced its labors on the 25th of N•lay, 1787
Only four days thereafter, on the 29th, Mr
Randolph presented the plan ofa Fed- It consisted ofa series of fifteen era! Constitution
resolutions
The sixth resolution contained the foliowing: 'I'hat the
national Legislature ought to be empowered to call (Orth the
fOrce of the Union against anv member of the Union failing to fulfiii its duty under the articles thereof." On the motion of Mr
Madison, this proposition was postponed, and it was never again called up
was poutponed by-the convention, and was never a«ain rencsved
(Madison Papers, pp
192, 198.) So that the proposition to give to the General Government the power to coerce a State was dis- tinctly put to the convention twice over, on differ- ent days, and each time it was refused
The convention was exceedingly careful and scrupulous on this point of the power of the Fed- eral Government, in all of its departments, over the States
2
The sixth resolution of Mr
Randolph's plan contained another proposition akin to thc coercion It was " that the national Legisla- of a State
ture ought to bc empowered to negative all laws passed by the several States, contravening, in the opinion of the national Legislature, the articles of union or any-trcatv subsisting under the au- thority of the Union
This power w'as first agreed to
T Ins was on the 31st of May
Eut afterwards, on the 8th of Junc, it was reconsidered and voted down
It was never again renewed
(Madison Papers, pp
139, 174.) On the 18th of June, Mr
Hamilton also pro- posed aseries of resolutions, embodying his ideas ofa Constitution
His tenth resolution proposed, in order to prevent the passao•c of laws by the particular States contrary to the laws of the Uni- ted States, that the President should have power to appoint the Governor of each State w110 should have a negative upon the laws of the State ofwhich he wasGovcrnor
(Madison Papers, p
205.) This also was refused
Again: it was proposed, in the eighth resoli_ltion of Mr
Randolph 's plan, to give to the President and a convenient number-of the Federal judiciary a power of revision of the laws of the several States
And this was rejected
(Madison Papers, p
128.) But it is said that what is contended for is not coercion of a State; but only that the Federal Ex- ecutive is bound by the Constitution to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully exc- cuted
This I understand to be the position of I the Senator from fl'enncsscc, to whom I have al- ready alluded
Such infer to be the position of the President elect, if the newspapers of his party which have spoken on that subject truly give his position
Let us examine this a little
Suppose a State secedes, in the exercise either of a con- stitutionat or a revolutionary right—I do not carc which, for t.hc purposes in hand
She passcs laws in conflict v,'ith the laws of thc United States; they may be in regard to the revenue and its collec- tion, or the carrying of the mails, or anythino• else
An officer of the State, duly appointed such, acting in pursuancc of her laws, and in the cxc- cution of thern, does an act in violation of the laws of the United States
The Federal Executive un- dcrtakes to enforce the Federal laws against him
I Forthwith thc sovereignty of the State, whose acent and sorvant he is, and whose command he is obeyino•, is interposed to protect him
On the other hand, the United States Government brings its power into play to punish him
Here is neces- Government, refuses obey the laws" In hllie former case she has separated herself from- the Union, and: put off its jurisdictioh, To my min'd>, the difference is a clear, broad, ones-t : But; to enforce the laws within the-limits: Of a *State after' she has seceded is an impossibility.
This position was vindicated a few' days ago to'! ih:e Senate by the honorable Senator from Virginia [Mr
HUNTERI much more ably, than I can hope to be able to do it; and i shall therefore forbear to go over the ground much better occupied by Iiim, and shall invoke the attention•of the Senate to but a single view of it
The State has wi thd tawn herselffrom the Union
There is not a single Federal offcer within, her boundaries—no judges, no clerks, no marshals
In our Government the laws can be executed only by thc courts and their officers
The President, in fulfilling the duty imposed by the Con- stitution to see that the laws are faithfully exe- cuted, has no right to act as judge, jury, and exe He is no autocrat
cutioner
If the United States law is violated,the offense is cognizable under the Constitution only by the Federal judiciary
A court must be called; Federal judge must preside; a United States mar-t shal must bc there to execute process, and a dis- trict attorney to prosecute the But all this, in the case under consideration, is impossi- ble, because there is not a single one of all those officers within the limits of the State
Do you say you will change the laws, and send foreign judges and marshals into the State
Well, you make tho alteration of the law, and you send your judge and marshal to the State
'But the State will- not roc9ivc them
She' excludes them by If you are determined to force force of arms
them upon her, it must bo done by Federal troops, and at the point of the bayonet
Here is war.
But suppose you shall succeed in forcing your offcers into the secedingState,and you open your courts
The party to be proceeded against must be indicted by a grand jury
This IS the first step
Without it you cannot put him on his But the grand jury must bc citizens of the trial
State
Each one of them is prohibitcd by the au- thority of his State from finding a truc bill, and therefore bc cannot do it
And each one may be liable to the very samc kind ofa prosecution, and therefore be will not do it
And the next step, which is also an indispensable one, is, that the accused is cntitlcd by the Constitution to be tried a traverse jury, which must also be composed of citizcnsoftheState
And they, too, for thcsamc reasons already *tated in regard to the grand jury; will not, and cannot, convict the accused
The Army of the United States cannot be made to play any principal part in the process of enforcing the laws of tho United States
Nor is the Prcsident authorized by the Consti- tution to allow the Army of the United States to play any principal part in the process of enforc- ing the laws
He can only send the troops to act jn the capacity of a posse, •under the direction of thc civil authorities
'L"hese authorities must make sarily conflict and coercion
You may call it the I den-land for the posse, and take the charge of it
execution of the laws of the United States
It is, 13ut in thc case supposed, there is neither civil om- nevertheless, coercion, and coercion of the sover- cer to make demand for the aid of the troops, nor eignty ofa State
Mr
President, this is reaching coercion by an is there any judgrnent ofa court 10 be executed
indirect and roundabout mode; and I confös•s that' Now, Mr

Genesis, xiii, 8
Mr
President, South Carolina has, by solemn ordinance, declared herself withd rawn from the Union; and repealed
the act •by which she ratified the Constitution, and- entered into the Confeder- acy
This has been done' by a convention delib- etately -ctdled- by her people for that purpose
Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida ate in the same position
Other States are following close in the same path
Sir, I am sorry that the good people of these States, in the exercise of their high discretion for secu ring their sacred constitutionål rights, had not scen fii to consult with their sister slaveholding States before adopting this policy
These States all have the samo institutions, the same rights, the same blood
Their cause is a common one; their policy, it seems to me, ought to have been a common one also
But, Senators, I will never give my vote nor my consenteither to coerce or io execute the laws by force of arms in any one of them
'l'o do that would be to wage wer upon them; and that war could have but one object, and that to subjugate the State,'ttnd bring her back
a captive in chains
Is, there any Scnator who would be willing to achieve ' that scandalous and monstrous result, even if it were possible to accomplish it
The Constitution of the United States was never de- signéd by the fathers to be prostituted to any such base purpose of oppression- and outrage
It has no aptitude to coerce and hold in unwilling union alienated, hostile, and belligerent States; nor to maintain a centralized despotic power to dom- inate over subjugated provinces, and to coerce their allegiance by the bayonet and the sword
It is clcnr that in the attitude now held by South Carolina and the other seceding States towards the Federal Government, the laws of the United States can be executed there only by tho milita- ry power of the Government
The attempt will be resisted by arms
The very first
step therefore is, inevitably, civil war
Other States will rush to her aid; and it will bc a war of one half of the States against the other half
How can any friend of the Union bring himself to support or countenance such a measure
It witi be a disso- lution of the Union in blood
In such case, there can be no hope of reconstruction
No man can be so blind as not to see it
But if dissolution must come, let it peaceful
Then there may be a hope for reconstruction; fraternal feelings may be restored; the evil spirit of abolitionism may be exorcised; mutual inter- ests and wants may, as at the first, again attract the separated States together
They may aøain send up their deiegates to another convention, to make another Constitution, which shall indeed form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure dornestic tranquillity, provide for the com- to the consideration of the resolutions offered by epoch, to that height of happiness •rand power which has drawn upon us the gaze and the ad- miration of the whole civilized world

So the motion was not agreed to
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question recurs on the motion of the Senator from Ken- tuck y to postpone the resolutions until to-morrow at half nast twelvo o'clock, and make them the order of business to the exclusion of all other orders
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 should like to inquire whether it is competent to makc an order of that character
The resolutions may be postponed, doubtless; but is it competent to make an order that they shall be considered to the exclusion of all other business until they bc disposed of
Would such an order arnount to anything
Will not the Senate have it in its power, by a major- ity, at any time, to set that aside
It wouid a change, as it seems to me, of the rules of the Sen- If there are special orders to which the rules ate
apply, would they not be entitled to precedence, notwithstanding any such vote of the Senate
It seems to me that that portion of the motion is out of order, or rather that it would require a change of the rules to adopt it
Under the rules, thc old- est special order set for one o'clock to-naorrow, i for instance, is entitled to be called up at that hour; and the Presiding Offcer calls up that busi- ness at that hour
Now, is it competent for the Senate to-day, by a vote, to change that rule, so as to make this particular business the business of the Senate to the exclusion of everythino else 
I arn cbrtainly against any such proposition as I doubt if it would be competent for the that
Senate to pass it without changing the rules
The PRESIDING OFFICER'
The Chair will sav to the Senator, that he considers it in- on him to entertain the motion
The I Senate can make such disposition of the motion as the Senate thinks proper
Whether it will conflict W'ith the existing rules of the Senate, will be for the Senate to decide when that conflict may be shown
Mr
BIGLER
This case is in a nutshell
It is perfectly is not proposed to make a rule
competent for the Senate at any time to make an order, This is to be an order of the Senate
The Senate has a right to make an order, and to It is equally true
that it is execute an order
competent for the Senate to suspend the execu- tion of that order, and that is often done; but no question of order or rule can be interposed against this motion
It is competent for the Senate to make the order at any time, •notwithstanding it would seem to be inconsistent with a former order, because fixing business by priority is a mere Mr
FESSENDEN
1 should like to the rule read which relates to special orders
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will read the rule required
The Secretary read, as follows: Special Orders
31
When the hour shall have arrived for the consider- ation ofa special order, it shall be the duty of the Chair to take up such special order, and the Senate shall proceed to consider it, unless it be postponed by vote of the Sen- ate
Precedence in Special Orders
When two or more subjects shall have been specially as- signed för consideration, they shall take precedence accord- ing to the order of tune at which Lbe.y were severally assigned, aid such order shall at no time be lost or changed, except by the direction of the Senate
Precedence in Speciat Orders and over General Orders
When two or more subjects shall have been assigned for the satne hour, the subject first assigned for that hour shali take precedence ; but special orders shall always have pre- cedence of general orders, unless such special orders shall be postponed by direction of the Senate
Special Orders not to lose .their position
Special orders shall not lose their position 011 account of intervening adjournments; Imr shall they lose their relative position on the Calendar, except by vote of the Senate, until finally disposed

The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the Senate ready for the question on the motion of the Sen- ator from Kentucky
Mr
II ALE
If it is in order to ask a division of the question, I ask for a division
The PRESIDiNG OFFICER
The Chair would suppose that it is proper and competent to ask for a division, as the question is susceptible of a division 
Mr
HALE
Then, 1 ask for a division
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from New Hampshire calls for a division of the question
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Ido not wish to trouble or embarrass the Chair or the Senate with any questions about order
It is a subject about which I do not profess to have any great skill or knowl- it must be a clear edge
I suppose, however, proposition that the Senate has the right to order the course of its business and say that it will act f upon such a subject until it is concluded, when I i that subject regularly comes up for action
I, howevcr, will withdraw that part of the motion that these resolutions shall be continued the sub- ject of action until finally disposed of, and leave the question so tl-\at they shall be called up to- morrow, at the hour named, to the exclusion of I suppose the Senate can all other business
make that order wit.hout any question
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator so n)0dify his motion 
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 wiki modify itin that way, with the hope that a majority of the Senate will feel with me that we should act continually on the subject until it is decided upon
Mr
COLLAMER
Let be stated as no v,' modified
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- derstands the question I')OW, as Inodified, to be, that the
resolutions of.the Senator from Ken- lucky bc postponed until to-morrow, at half past twelve o'clock, and then taken up, to the exclu- Sion of all other business
Mr
I-I ALE
1 ask for a division of that question
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair prestune.s it is divisible also; and if it be, any Senator has a right to call for a division
The Senator from New Hampshire has asked for a division of the question
'I'he Chair understands that it is susceptible of being divided; and so un- derstanding, will put the question, first, on the motion to postpone until to-morrow at half -past twelve o'clock
The motion was agreed to
Mr
DOUGLA.S.- Now, 1 will ask the yeas and nays on the other branch of the ques- The PRESIDING OFFICER
It is now moved that the resolutions be taken up at the hour indicated to the exclusion of all other busi- ness; and on that motion the yeas and nays are Mr
FOSTER
aslöif there be order beside this fixed for to-morrow ut half "past twelve o'clock
If there be not—tis ih my pression there is not—the residue of the motion will be ineffectual and •perfectly immaterial; whether we pass it or not
If this•ubjectis made the special order for half past ti.velve O'clock' to- morrow, and there be no other, nothing will terfere with this, arid this Will interfere With nothing
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair is informed that there is a special order for to-mor• row At one o'clock
Mr
FOSTER
But not at half past twelve
The PRESIDING OFFICER
.No, sir
Mr
FOSTER
Then this subject must come up
Mr
SIMMONS: Then 1 take it there is no neccssity for saying that it shall be taken up at that time, if there is nothing else to interfere with it
Mr
BIGLER
Senators seem to the effect of an order and the execution of an order by the body and the rule which controls the Pre- siding Officer
Now, suppose the Senate:makes that order that these resolutions•shall be taken up at half past twelve to-morrow, and be proceeded with to the exclusion o
all other business
Mr
FESSENDEN
That is not the motion.• Mr
BIGLER
Very well; I am using it for an illustration
At the hour of one the Chair an- nounces that such a bill is the special order
Then it is perfectly competent for the Senate to post- pone the bill which is the special order, or refuse to take it up, and proceed in the execution of the order which we make at this time
It is all the while in the power of the body, and ccnnpetent for the body to make this order
It is competent for the body to proceed with its execution
is also competent for the body to suspend its execu- tion
Mr
DOUGLAS
aware that it is com- petent for the body to postpone if they see proper, even if we mako it a special order; but I suppose i the object of the Senat.orfrom Kentucky, and cer- tainly my object is, to procure action on these If there is a majority in this body resolutions
determined that we shall not have a vote on his proposition, I want that detenninat.ion to appear on the record
The friends of this measure cer- tainly do want action upon it; but if it is determ- ined t.hat by points of order and by giving it the go-by and taking up other questions, there shall never be a vote, let that purpose be avowed and appear on the record
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 presume is man in the Senate—certainly there is not one on this side of the Chamber—who is not perfectly ready to vote on these resolutions at- any time when they shall come up
Mr
BIGLER
Then let us vote now
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 mean wheneverwc come to the point where a vote is to be taken
There is no desire here to shun the vote
I certainly do not know anybody that desires it
There is not a question before the Senate that I' am not ready to vote upon when the pi•oper time shall arrive, and the matter has been discussed, without any sort of hesitation
Thcrcforc, as it seems to me, the object is to sacrifice the rules of the Senate for the sake of havino• n vote by yeas and nays, and putgent!emen on the record on a matter which they do not hesitate to meet at any proper mo- ment
Why, sir, it amounts to nothing
The proposition of the Senator from Kentucky is simply this: to postpone this subject until to- morrow at half past twelve o'clock, and then take it up to the exclusion of all other business
What is that
That it shall come up at that hour
That is tbc amount of it
Well, sir, will it not come up on the motion to postpone until half past twelve o'clock, unless there is a previous order
If therc is a previous order for that hour, you cannot dispose of it by a vote of this kind, for the simple reason that the rule says, that an order previous in time shall come up and be disposed demanded
Mr
COLLAMER
I desire to understand of first; and you cannot get over the rule of the what the gentleman means
Does taking it up to Senate by any provision of this sort
Suppose, the exclusion of all other business, mean that it It for instance, there is another order for half past twelve o'clock to-morrow, no matter what it is, shall continue 
and the Senator proposes to postpone this subject Mr
CRITTENDEN
No, sir; 1 have with- till ha'lf past twelve o'clock, and then make it It is simply that drawn that part of the motion
the special order: when half past twelve o'clock it shall be taken up in preference t.o any other arrives, will not the Previous order come up in business at' that time
 362 spite of our- order to-day
Necessarily so; be- I cause you cannot by a vote get rid of the opera- tion of
the 
rule, and the Praiding Offcer must call ic up
Then all the effect of this motion, as taken now, is what is suggested by the Senator from Illinois, and that is to get a vote upon noth- ing- for the purpose of having a record
Now, sir, I am: ready to yote on nothing for that pur- pose, if the Senator wants.me to do So
Mr, DOUGLAS
The Senator has said there was no
one •on that -side of the-Chamber that ob- jected tota.vote on this question.- Inasmuch as he seems to assume the right to speak for that side of the Chamber, I- hope -he will now specify a day and when- we shall have a vote
Mr, FESSENDEN.
1 cannot fix it, sir
The Senator •knows very well that nobody can fix it
Mr
DOUGLAS
If he can speak for that side of the Chamber, and there is no opposition on this, there will be no diffculty in fixing the tilne It is very usual in when we shall have a vote
this body to agree by common consent that, at a particular hour and day, there shall be a vote on a measnrc
All we want is a vote, and within reasonable time, and the shortest period that can be fixed; and if-there is no disposition to keep it off by these other measures, why not indicate a time when we shall have a vote, instead of calling it up from day to day, and shoving it off by other questions, postponing and procrastinating until the end of the Session
desire to have a time fixed, by common consent, at which we may have I am aware, if the majority are determ- a vote
ined- that we shall not have a vote, they can cull for another special order, or they can postpone this subject
They havo the power to give it the go-by
want to find out whether it IS thc de- termination to give it the go-by, so that•we shall not have a vote ; and if not, why not agree then that we may have a votc at a particular day or hour
Mr
KENNEDY
1 have but word to say, sir
Representing here, as do, with my col- league, the State of Maryland—a State as Inuch interested in the settlement of this question as any other—I havc retraincd from expressing any views on the distracting subjects that are now agitating the country
I have done so because I havo been disposed, like my colleague, to exhaust every rcasonable and honorable means that were deemed expedient, to settle this question
I have been anxious to see this matter brought to a test
Ifthe gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber do earnestly and really and honestly desire to see the: question settled before civil war is brou•ht upon us, want to see some téBt vote—sounetlnng that will show their sincerity, at least—on the propositions of the Senator from Kentucky
If they
are rejected, I consider that every hope has gone; that the last expedient has passed away frotn us; and I want to sec whether those gent)c- mell) now representing dominant party in the country are willing to meet us in tho spirit of compromise; and therefore I want the earliest possible vote that I can get
After that has failed, shall be prepared to speak for my State
If every just and honorable cxpcdicut shall fail to if thc bring about a settlemcllt of this question; propositions of my distinguished and venerable friend from Kentucky, and of the Senator from Pennsylvania, will not meet t.he views of gentle- men on the other side of the Chamber, I Svant the people of .Maryland to know it; and I am prepared then, gentlemen, to accept the issue which you present
Mr
SIMMONS
I am very sorry to see a question of the order of business presented here I have voted, for the last as a test question
thrcc or four weeks, to changc the regular order of business, so that a man could speak on a thing that he wished to address the Senate upon; and almost all of these propositions have come from the other side of the Chamber
I think we have got as many as half a dozen distinct propositions to compose these troubles; and when a man gets up and asks to have his brought up, I vote for it; and now this sort of accommodation is attributed I to a desire to postpone these questions
So far —and I never consult anybody as to as I know how I shall vote—if I can find what will accom- modate a particular Senator who wants to address the Senate, I try to get that question before us, that he may be accommodated
Mr
MT JLSON
Do not ask anything on my account
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 14, .Mr
SIMMONS
1 do not ask anything on anybody's account
I want to get at the business in as orderly a way as we can; in as temperate a way as we can; but above aH things, this mere question of which of these half dozen resolutions that are up, that involve the same question, shall be put ahead of the others, I think, is rather too small aquestion to makeatcst upon
I have no sort of desire to delay tho general action of the Senate
1 merely want every man who is going to address the Senate to have up the resolutions in which he feels the most articular interest
Mr
DOUGÆAS
Allow me to suggest to the Senator that there is no conflict between the dif- ferent movers of propositions as to which shall take priority
I believe we all agree to follow the lead of t.he venerable Senator from Kentucky
Mr
SIMMONS
But still the Senator wants to make a question on this side of the Chamber, that we will not put some one of the half dozen distinct propositions that have been made, ahead of all the others, and consider it to the exclusion of ail the others
Thismornin(rwegotinto trouble
Senators almost thought we were guilty of dis- courtesy to them, because we took up one bill when the Senator who was entitled to the floor said ho was willing to address the Senate upon that, as well as anything else; but we corrected that in order that he might have his choice
I do not recollect, myself, what particular resolutions the Senator from Missouri has been addressing the Senate upon, but I believe it was on the res- olution submitted by the Senator from Viroinia, [Mr
HUNTER.) If Senators on the other Side of the Chamber first call up one of these resolutions, and then another, as n matter of personal conve- nience to themselves, why should the Senator from Illinois get up and say he wants a test ques- tion, to see whether we will not give one the pref- erence over thc other
Mr
DOUGLAS
1 will answer
It is simply to have the subject of an adjustment of these dif- ficultics acted upon
When we take up the prop- osition of the Senator from Kentucky, which has priority, any Senator can 'Dove his own proposition as an arncndmcnt; and thus wc shall geta voto in turn on every onc of the propositions, and come to some definite conclusion on t.he sub- ject, either that we can pacify the country or can- not
Mr
SIMMONS
1 know the Senator from Illinois is very adroit
We have had a discussion to-day on another subject; and he chooses to charge us upon this side of the Senate that we have accommodated those on that side witha view to dela Mr
bOUGLAS
1 do not it at all
Mr
SIMMONS
You want a test on us
Mr
DOUGLAS
I ask them to show by their votes, or by common cohsentfixing the time, that they are willing to act
Mr
SIMMONS
we have fix-ed the time for considering these resolutions at half past twclvc o'clock to-morrow, and it has been stated from the Chair that thcre is no prior order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
At that hour
Mr
SIMMONS
Then they will certainly como up
Now, why should we sit herc and dis- pute with each other about whether they will come up or not
I know the Senator from Ken- tucky does not expect that I would interpose any objection to following what was his particular wish on any subject, whatever others might charge
All i want is, that business shall be reg- ular; and that whoever chooses to address the Senate to-morrow may have his choice as to the If he chooses to subject on which he speak
address it at half past twelve o'clock, we know what thc subject will be
It will be these reso- I do not believe a rule of the Senate can lutions
be overturned by this sort of side-motion
I think it is useless to waste the time in disputing about which resolution shall come up, because I do not know who wants to address the Senate; but these will certainly come up at half past twelve o'clock to-morrow, and then we may znake some dispo- sition of them
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Mr
President, always dosirous,as fatas I can , to accommodate the views and wishes of all gentle'nen here; and believing, myself, that if the resolutions are taken up to- morrow at half past twelve o'clock, it will be the disposition of the Senate to continue to debate them until they are decided, Certaihly,"] and announcing my purpose to move for that course of business whenever it shall become necessary, that wc shall postpone everything in their way, I withdraw the motion
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The motion is withdrawn, and there is nothing before the Sen- ate
Mr
LATHAM

By an act of Congress, approved 18th of Feb- ruary, 1859, a sum of $118 90 was appropriated for the benefit of R
A
Davidge
He was a con- stitucnt of mine, and was at that time a tempo- rary clerk in the Tréasury Department
He made an assignment to Duvall & Brothers of this sum of $118 90, to which they are justly entitled
But the Comptroller of the Treasury, upon a technical oujection, refused to pay the money
Heoce it becomes necessary to pass an act of Congress  1861

I avail myself of the occasion to say, however, that there ought to bea general law to cover all similar cases
Mr

Thiscase has been referred to the Secretary of the Treasury, and the bill has been drawn by him
Mr

I will not object to the pas- sage of the bill ; but I hope the gentleman , inasmuch as his attention has been called to thc subject, will report a bill of a general character to cover all these cases
Mr

It is proper that 1 should state that the ground of my objection was that I was not satisfied that the party applying here for relief had furnished evidence of his ownership of It seems, however, that 1 the lost certificates

I sce in this resolution a very fruitful source' of litigation, but I can see no good that can result from it
think, therefore, the gentleman from Virginia had better withdraw the resolution

All resolutions calling for information from the Departments, must lie over one day, if objected to
That is the rule under which the action of the Chair has taken place
Mr

The gen tleman from North Carolina [Mr

1 supposed that it was before the House for consideration, and I think that the ob- jection of the gentleman from Kentucky comes too late
BURNETT
The gentleman is mistaken in a point of fact, as the Speaker will remember
I rose as soon as the resolution was offered and addressed the Speaker; but the Speaker recoo- nized the gentleman from North Carolina
As soon as I could get the floor, I made the objection
Mr
VANDEVER
Then the gentleman must have withdrawn the objection so far as to allow the gentleman from North Carolina to make a speech axainst the merits of the resolution
Mr
BRANCH
The rule is not that resolu- tion.s which are objected to shall lie over, but those which give risc to debate

1 suppose that it is com- petent for me to give notice that I will move to consider the rcsolution to-morrow

Mr

I desire to know whether it is thc intention of the mover of that resolution merely iO have debate when we meet at seven o'clock in the evening

There is another rule to which I call the attention of the Chair
It is, that the rules cannot be changed without one day's notice; and I make a point of order upon The SPEAKER
That position is correctly taken
The resolu tion must lie over
Mr

Do 1 understand the Chair to decidc that the resolution is to be laid on the tablc, under the rules
The SPEAKER
Yes; because one day's notice of a change of the, rules is required
I understood that Mr

There certainly was debate, and the resolution was be- fore us for our action
I think the point of order comes too late

The Chair is of opinion that tile point of order was made in time

The pending resolution is to mako the bill a special order for to-morrow, and not for this day
As I do not ask for the consideration of' the bill to-day, I do not know that any gentleman has the right to demand that the bill shall be read at this time
B'ir
STEVENSON
In my judgment, the House has a right to hear what it is that is pro- posed to be made a special order
Mr
STANTON
The bill will take halt an hour to read it
If the House will permit me, I will make a brief explanation of it
It is a • bill that has been prepared by a board of Army offcers
Mr
BURNETT
If the gentleman be per- mitted to make his explanation, I want it to be understood that 1 shall ask for an opportunity to respond
Mr
STANTON
All want to say is, that this is not a bill got up now, but one reported at the last session of Congress

Mr
BOTELER
Before the bill is read, 1 want to put a question to the chairman of the Commit- tee on Militar Affairs
The SPEAKER
There is no objection; and the gentleman will proceed
Mr
BOTELER
I desire to ask the chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, in order that gentlemen of the House may understand it, whether this bill was prepared with reference to any existing difliculties 
Mr
STANTON
It was not
It was pre- pared, in pursuance of a law passed two years aeo, by board of Army officers, and it was re- ported from the Committee on Military Affairs by my colleaguc [Mr
PENDLETON] at the last ses- Sion of Congress
It is a bill arising, not out of a temporary, but a permanent condition of affairs in this District
Mr
BOTELER
Have there been any modi- fications in the bill 
Mr
STANTON
None at all
The bill is the same, that was reported at the last session from the Committee on Military Affairs
Mr
BOTELER
1 desire that fact to go to the country
Mr
BURNETT
1 hope that 1 may be per- mitted to say a word in reply
This bill, in fäct, cstnblishcs a standing army of six thousand men in this District of Cohnnbia, subject to [lie will of thc President of the United States; an army to bc mustered into service at his discretion, and to bc supplied out of the military stores of the United States, exactly as the regular Army is
Let t.he House understand that fact, and let jnmnbers vote accordingly
Shall this standing army bc estab- lished in this District, under the command of the President, and to be supplied with arms, camp cquipage, and indeed all the necessary military stores, from the store-houses of this Government

It is as follows: Resolved further, That the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union be discharged from the further consideration of House bill Ne

Mr
STANTON
There is no connection with that bill and the one I (lesire to get before the I cannot, therefore, agree to accept the House

But I have no doubt, when my resolution has passed, the House will consent to the intro- ductron of my colleague's

It is
Mr
MAYNARD
The District of Columbia has got along very well for many years without any such bill; and do not see any good reason for now proceeding to its consideration

Mr
Speaker, 1 find this bill for the better organization of the militia of the District of Columbia was reported from the Com- mittee on Military Affairs on the 25th of June, 1860, and that it was indorsed and its passage recommended by the late Secretary of War in a letter, the reading of which members on this side of the House have objected to
Seeincr nothin& in the existing conditiÖn of the country that woulä not make the passage of this bill as justifiable at present as it was when reported from one of the standing committees of the House, and when it was indorsed by the late Secretary of Wary I vote in the affrmative

Mr
WALDRON
Let me first submit my proposition to the House
I ask the unanimous consent of the House that the Committee of the Whole House on the Private Calendar be dis- charged from the further consideration of House bill No
85, for the relief of certain Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pottawatomie Indians
The bill, which was read, provides that the Secretary of the Interior be authorized and directed to pay to the Chippewa, Ottawa, and' Pottawat- orme Indians, now residing in Michigan, and who were parties to the treaties made at Chicago on the'2Gth and 27th of Septenlber, 1833, between the United States and the united nation of Indians, or to their descendants, their full proportion per capita of all the sums of money agreed to be paid by the United States to the united nation of In- dians by the treaties of July 29, 182.9, and Sp- tember 26, 1833, and the articles supplementary thereto of Septeinber 27, 1833, and of June 5 and 17, 1846, with the Pottawatomie nation of Indians; provided that, -upon examination, it shall appear that the moneys are still in the Treasury of the United States for, or have been paid out to, the Pottawatomie nation; whereupon the payments shall be made out of the moneys belonginø or accruing to the Pottawatomie nation
Mr
QUARLES objected to the introduction of the bill
Mr

The motion was agreed to; and the bill was introduced and read a first and second time
Mr
WALDRON called the previous question upon the enffrossment and third reading of the The previous question was seconded, and the main question ordered to be put; and under the op- eration thereof, the bill was ordered to be encrrossed and read a third time; and being engrossed, it was accordingly read the third time, and passed
Mr
WALDRON moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed; and also moved to lay the motion to recon.sider on the table
The latter motion was agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
I now renew my motion to go into the Committee of the Whole on tlle state of the Union
But I will say that, if there are any propositions which gentlemen desire to intro- shall have no objection to their being introduced if I have the right to hold the floor while they do so, SPEAKER
That would hardly be in order

Then 1 insist upon my motion
The motion was agreed to
ENROLLED BILL
Mr
THEAKER, from the Committee on En- rolled Bills, reported as truly enrolled an act for the relief of Jeremiah Pendcrgast, of the District of Columbia; when the Speaker signed the same

Thé motion was agreed to

The Clerk read the first clause of the bill
Mr
McCLERNAND
Mr
Chairman, when an impending danger can be no longer slayed or averted, is it not the part of wisdom and duty to meet, and, if possible, overcome it
Such, I think, isa sound canon of statesmanship
Acting on this belief, I propose rather briefly to deal with the question of secession now actually upon us
First, I deny the constitutional right of any State to secede f'rom the Union; second, I deprecate th exercise of any such assumed right as a measu e of revolution, which, in the present case, m St embroil the country in a sanguinary and was no civil war
Starting with these postulates, 1 ro- ceed with the effort to make them good
Our fathers, just emerged from colonial thral- dom, and jealous of consolidated political powcr, when they come to frame the Articles of Confed- eration, adopted in 1778, run into the opposite ex- treme of dispersed and divided power
They formed an alliance, or at most a league, of sover- eign States, under what mißht be called a treaty between independent Governments
In the lan- guage of one of the articles, they cntercdinto ' 'a firm league of friendship with each othei• for the common defense;" no n lore
Hence the Gov- ornment, or Congress of the Confederation, ',vas wholly destitute of any essential faculty of sov- ereignty
It had neither the right to prescribe a rule of action for its constituent body, nor the power to enforce one
it was without leeislative, executive, or judicial authority
It could only advise, recommend, and on treat; and even the richt to do that was closely circumscribed
Founded upon a league of sovereign and inde- pendent States, its exhibitions of authority were addressed to States whose interpretations of their Federal obligations might or might not bind them to compliance
It acted not upon individuals, nor had the right to do so; but, without coherence, without unity of principle or of action, without the power to preserve itself or to conserve interests of its authors, like the Amphyctionic Council, the Achacn League, the Helvetic, the Gerrnanic, and the Belgic Confederacies; like all rnere national federations, it fell into pieces in consequence of its own weight, of its own inher- ent weakness and want of vitality
The evils of this system disclosed themselves in two most striking forms: one in the domestic relations of the States; the other in their relations with foreign Governments
In regard to the former, we learn that the period elapsing between the treaty of peace with the mother country and the orcranization of the present Government, was one marked bv angry controversies and rivalries
The conflicting views of the several States in re- gard to their commcrcial, agricultural, and man- ufacturing interests often prompted them to un- friendly measures, not unfrequently in the form of legislative reprisals, having the effect not only to cripple their internal trade, but their foreign commerce; and incessantly to threaten them with the horrors of civil war
Foreign nations were encouraged to take ad- vantage of this state of things
They imposed upon our navigation and cornmercc just such restrictions as they deemed most conducive to their own interests
They excluded our sliip- pilig from the benefits ofthejr'OWn commerce ;while they daringly -and lawlesslystrove torriönopolize the benefits of ours
And, asa Consequence Of these and' other kindred measures, our foreign navigation was i•uined, our agriculture paralyzed, our mechanics impoverished, and the little money remaining in the country threatened with banish- ment from it
To boot of all this, the ordinary administration of justice was th reatened with over- throw by the clamors and desperation of penniless debtors
Indeed, we are informed that sueh was the excess of wretchedness continually accumu- lating from the slow but progressive destruction of all the resources of industry and credit that the calamity overwhelming all classes was more hopeless than that occasioned by the ravages of the Revolution itself
To remedy these and other evils incident to old system, the present Constitution wasadopted
How remedy them 
is the question now to be con- sidered
Was it by restoring the old league of independent sovereignties; by repeating the com- plete failure realized by it
Such, strange to say, IS the mgument of the secessionists; indeed, of all those who insist that the relations of the sev- eral States as co-members of this Union, depend upon the plcasure,.nay the caprice, of each; that each has an absolute right, at any momerit, to withdraw from it; that !here is no paramount authority anywhere to prevent it
T hrs doctrine, although countenanced, as I havo already said, by the theory of the old confederation, is, never- theless, contradicted by many of the leading characteristics of the revolutionary epoch
Appealing to history, we find that the idea of the nationality of the American people is as old as the Revolution itself
The authority of the first Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, on the 4th ofSeplcmber, 1774, was proclaimed,in the name of the people of the colonies, and not in the name of the colonial governments
So, the Declaration of Independence was adopted in the name and b the authority of thepeople of the United States, and not in the name and by the authority of sep- aratc sovereignties
It was a national act, and n.ot the act of several parties; it was an act only competent to be performed by the whole people, because it involved a change of government as to all
So, the
revolutionary ••,var was a nationat measure prosecuted for seven years by the com- bined forces of all the colonies for the benefit of all
So, the treaty of peace, in 1783, was' made, on the one part, the United States as one na- tion, and by it Great Britain, on the other part, • recognized our independence as one nation—the United States—and not as separate States
Such, too, is the testimony of the Supreme Court of the United States—often repeated arguendo in the course of its adjudications
In Penhallow vs

99,) Judge Chase, delivering the opinion of the same court, said: It appears to me that thc powers of Congress during that whole period were derived from the peoöle they rei> resented, expressly given through the medium ofthcir State conventions or &ate Legislatures ; or that, after they were exercised, they were implicitly ratified by the acquiescence and obedience of the people
Again; in Chisholm's Executors cs
the State of Georgia, (Idem, p
635,) Chief Justice Jay, de- livering the opinion of the same court, said: The Revolution, or rather the Declaration of Independ- ence, found the people already united tör general purposes, and, at the same time, provided for their 'nore domestie concerns by State conventions, and other temporary ar- rangements
From the Crown of Great Britain, the sov- ereignty of their country passed to the people of it ; and thirteen sovereignties were eonsidered as emerging from the principles of the Revolution, combined by local con- venience and considerations
'I'he people, nevertheless, colltinued to consider thernselves in a national point: Of view as one people ; and they continued, without inter- ruption, to manage their national concerns accordingly." The same idea penetrated the convention that framed the Constitution, ands•ruling its counsels, stamped that instrument with its national impress
Both the proceedings of tho convention, and the I language of the Constitution, attest this fact
 868 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

ence." Further, and if possible, still stronger evidence of the intention of the framcrs tlie Constitu- tion, und -of the true, nature of that instrument, may be foun(l in the following letter of the con- vention to the President of the Congress of the Confederation, dated September 17, 1787: SIR : We have now the honor to submit to the consid- eration of the United States in Congress assesnblcd that Constitution Which hiis appeared to us the rnost advisable
friends of our country have long seen and desired the:power of making war, peace, aud trehties ; that of leV•yi1ig inmiiey; and regulating conunerce, and the corre- spondent executive and judicial authorities, should be fully and emetually vested in the Genera! Gove,rntucnt ot• the Union ; but t.he impropriety of delegating such extensivc trust to obc body ot• men is evident; hence results the ne- cesSity of a different organization

[L is at ail titnes difficult to draw with prerixion the bctmveen those rights svhicll must be surrendered and those which Inay be rcservcd ; and, on present occasion, this diflicutt.y was increased by a difference atnong the scvcral Slates as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular intcrests
In all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily In otir view that which appears to us the greatest of every true American—the consolidation of our Union— in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, per- haps our national existence
This ilnportant considera- tion, seriously and deeply impressed on öur lilinds, Icd each State in the convention to be less rigid on point_s of int•e- rior rnagnitude than Inight have been otherwise e.xpceted ; and thus thc Constitution, which we now present, is the result of a spirit of nmity, and ot' that mutual (lcferencc and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensab}e
That it will Ineet the;ful] and entire approbation of every State is not, peraaps, to be expected ; but each will, doubt'- less, consider, that had her interest been alone consulted, the consequences might have been particularly disagree- able or injurious to others
'-L'hat it liable to as t'esv ex- ceptions as could reasonably have been expected, •.ve hope '.l'hat it rnay promote, the lasting we.lfhre of and believe
that country, so dear to us all, and secure her t•reed01n and happiness, is our inost ardent wish." I hardly nccd add that this letter was the unani- mous act of the convention; and after being signed by its presi(ient, George Washington, was com- municated to the Congress of the Confederalion by unanimous order of the convention
" And what is its import
Certainly that the prime ob- ject of the con vention was to consolidate " one Union " by a portion of the sover- eignly of the •States, and vesting the sarne " fully and éffeetually" in a common national Govern- ment; and that the infirmities of the Confedera- tion -created the necessity for it', In the Compre- hensive and perspicuous language of the conven- tion, our prosperity, felicity, safety, perhaps
our national existence" itself, depended •upon it
I come now to inquire whether the languabe of the Constitution itself does not sustain this interpretation of its character
The Articles of Confederation declared themselves to be articles of 'G perpetual union," but were void of power to make good the declaration
The prcsent Consti- tution, amending, extending and the powers of the confederation, declares the same Its preamble is in these words: purpose
We, the people of the United States, in order to form,a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tran- quillity, provide fbr the comrnon de(tmse, promote the gen- crul welGtre, aud secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and OUT posterity, do ordain and est&blish this Constitution for the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA." Hence, the Constitution, in its very preamble, proclaims itself to be the
act of the peopte—." of the people of the United States, " and not ofthc States, as such, cither collectively or individually; and at the same time styles the same people as a nation —the " United States Qfdm.erica;" while, viewed as an amendment to the Articles of Confedera- tion, it provides for ' 'a more perfect union," as means of insuring thc perpetual union con- templatcd by those articles
In no just view could the States have formed such an Instrument
As governments created by the peoplc, they had no moral or legal right to destroy themselves, or to abdicate or alienate their powers
Their powers were held by them, in trust, for the benefit of the people; who alone were cornpctent to redispose of them, who alone are competent to make and unmakc governments
As the people forincd the State governments, so they formed the United StatesGovernment
Each, s Drung from the creative womb of the peo- alike derives its sovereignty from them
As to the process by which the national Gov- it is simple enough
crnment was formed, was by tbc people resuming a portion of the sov- ereignty of the States and re-embodying it in the forni of that ffovprnment
The extent of its sov- and of tlnc prohibitions ixnposed upol') that of the Statcs, measures the diniinution of the sovereignty of the latter
In one aspect it is national in another it is federal
It is national in the objects of its powers; and federal in the limitation of those objects; it is national in what is delegated to iti and federal in what is reserved t.o the States
Its jurisdiction is of our external and common internal relations; ',vhile that of the States is of their respective internal and domestic affairs
Not only was the, Constitution the act of the people in its creation, but still more, it is the act of t.he
people by virt_ue of their subsequent formal ratification of it, through their directly-appointed It is truc that thc act of ratification was n ts
performed by the people dividedly, as distinct, local communities, and not collectively; nevertheless, it was performed by the pcople, and the whole people
And so said Mr
Morn•oe, sul»tantially, in a re- sponsible ofiicial forrn—Mr
Monroe, who had opposed the adoption of tl'le Constitution, for the very reasons here urged
Ho said: 'Itho great oilie.e or the (Federal) Constitution, by incor- porating the people of the several States, to the extent of its powers, into one conununity, and enabling it to act di- rectly on tile people, (the only parties to it,) was to annul the powers ot• the State governruents to that extent
Government of the United States relies on its own Incans for the execution of (#11) it* powers, as the State govern- *netlts do for the execution of theirs; both governments havin•r a common original sovereign, the people : the State govcnnuents, the people of' each State; thp, national Gov- ernjncut, thc people of every State ; each being amenable to the power that created it
It is by executing its fune- tions as a Governinent, thus; originating and thug acting, that the Constitution of the United States holds the States together, and pcrfOnns the ofiice of a league
It is owing to the nature of its powers, that it perjOrms that office better than the confederation, or any league which ever existed, being a compact which the State governrnents did not
form, to which they are not
parties', and which exe- cutes its own powers independently of them." Moreover, the Constitution, in the first clause• of the fourth articl(', draws an express distinction I and the " confederation." That clause is in these words: All debts contracted and engaaelnent.s cntercd into be- fore the adoption of this Consiitution, shall be as valid avainst the United States under this Constitutien ag under tfie confederation," If the Constitution was only a league or com- pact, soluble at the discretion of any of the par- tics to it, why this distinction
If it was only a renewal of those articles, why its adoption at all 
There was no reason for adopting it if it had not I been believed to be an improvement upon the sys- tem which it was designed to substitute
But, independent of this, the Constitution, in the character of other of its provisions, proves not only its popular origin, but its paramount au- thority and indissoluble nature, It organizes a legislative, judiciary, and an executive depart- ment, and confides to each its appropriate sover- eign functions
To the Legislature thc enactment of laws; to the judiciary the exposition of them; and to the Executive the execution of them
It declares that " Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises;" to " money," to " regulate commerce," to " coin money and regulate the value thereof," to " declare war," to " raise and supportarmies," to " provide and maintain a Navy, "and to " make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by the Constitution in the Government of the United States," &c
Mark, I repeat, the nature OF those powers: they are not only eminently sovereign, but are admitted to be so by the plain language of the Constitution
The power " to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises," IS commen- surate with an absolute, control over the substance of the people for the purposes defined in the Con- Stitütion
And the power " to declare war," an to raise and support armies," and " to provide and maintain a Navy," involves an absolute con- trol of the sword; thus combining in the Govern- ment of the United States both 
the sinews and the weapon of war
On the other hand, the Constitution declares that: No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or eon.
federation, grant letters of inarque and reprisal, coin Inoney, ornit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, pass any' bill of attainder, ec post.facto lahi', or law i;npairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title nobility
No State shall, without the consent of the Congress, lay any itnpos•ts or duties on i:nports or exports, except what
Inay bo absolutely necessary iOr executing its inspec- tion laws ; and the not-- produce of ali duties and imposts laid by any State on ilnport.s or exports
shall be for the use of thé 'Treasury of the United States; and
all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the Con- No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops or ships-ofLWar in tirne of peace, enter intö any a«yreement or compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in-such imminent danger as will not adlnit QC delay." In view of both of these provisions of the Qon- stitution, one positive and the other negative, how can it be said that the national Government, pro tanto, is not sovereign, and the States to the same extent subordinate
Any other conclusion seems I to Ule to be equally irreconcilable with reason and tbc leiter of the Constitution
I say letter ot' the Constitution, because the second clause of the sixth article of the Constitution declares that— This Constitution, and the laws of the United States, which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties Inade, or vvhich shall be made, under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme lavv of tbc land ; and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in toe constitution or laws of any State to the contrary not- withstanding." And the Constitution, after thus proclaiming its own supremacy, makes that supremacy a test of official character, by requiring every offcer, whether of the State or national Government, to swear to that supremacy
Such is the effect of the last clause of the article last quoted from, which is as follows: " The Senators and Representatives before Inentiened, and tho of the several State Legislatures, and a}! executive and judicial officers, both of tbe United States and of the several States, shall be bound by oath or affirm- ation, to support the Constitution." Again: if it S.vere true that the States, as arti- ficial bodies, had formed the General Government by contributions from their sovereignty; if' this were so, does it follow that they would •have any more or bettor right to dissolve the Government I than the people themselves, if it had been formed by them
Surely
not; for, in the one case, the States, as artificial persons, would stand iri the same relation to the common Government, as the people, as natural persons, would in the Qlber;  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

while in neither case would it be lawful for a con- coilisi01i were diminished, even in a greater pro- stituent member of the Government to withdraw from its jurisdiction, except by virtue ofa consti- tutional amendment
Any other mode of with- drawing from it would be simply extra-constitu- tional and revolutionary
The inconvenience, too, of such a doctrine would instantly reject it
What! leave it to any party to a contract of Government—whether that party be a State or individual—to throw' off the obliga- tions of the contract at pleasure
The idea is absurd
It would lead to a subversion ofall order, government, and stability
It would inaugurate a reign of anarchy, confusion, and chaos, which would ingulfin utter ruin the dearest interests of society
It would enable any recusant member of the body-politic to shirk the dbligations of a public debt, or the responsibilities of a war which had been induced by his own action—to shirk all the consequences of his own counsels
It would be wicked and abominable in thc last degree
is not to be tolerated or countenanced for a mo- ment
And is not this argument, in itself, a complete dissipation of the misty and frivolous disquisi- tions that have taken place upon a mere philolo- gical question—the distinction between a compact and a contract of Government
No such question can have any practical or useful application to our Government; unless, indeed, the Government, in its very nature, bc perverted to the conditions of an arbitrary and illogical definition
To recapitulate, then, no State has any lawful or constitutional right to withdraw from the con- tract of national Union : first, because that contract I was made by the people and not the States; and second, because, if made by the States, still, as artificial persons, they are bound by it, and havc no independent, constitutional -right to withdraw from or rescind it
And, again, because in such case, the contract of Union subordinates the States to a paramount sovereignty ordained by their own act and consent
And, again, because that sov- ereignty acts directly upon the people of the " Uni- ted States;" and by its own independent force must act upon them, despite of whatever the States, as such, may do
Being sovereign, its first duty is to preserve itself; and being sovereign, where is there a power more than sovereign to control it, disintegrate it, or dissolve it
When the States show their right to do so, the paradox will have been established, that the minor is the greater proportion; that the inferior has the right to substitute himself for the superior; that infe- riority is sovereignty, and that sovereignty is subordination 
But, sir, admitting, for the sake of argument, the constitutional right of the Gulf States to se- cede from the Union; would it bc just to the other States for them to do so
Again: would it be safe or expedient for the other States to acquiesce in such a measure
In answering these ques- tions it is necessary that I should take a survey of the past
All history teaches that coterminous, indcpend- ent nations are more liable to quarrel and clash with each other than remotc ones
Their very contact and neighborship, unregulated by a com- mon will, a common authority, in bringing out their Inutual diverøencies of opinion, feeling, and policy, necessurily make them so
The frequent wars occurring between the modern coterminous nationso
Europe, and especially, between France and her immediate neighbors, abundantly estab- 1ish this fact
Influenced, in a great degree, by this consideration, our fathers were unwilling to continue their divided existence as isolated, in- dependent nationalities; and accordingly consol- idated the several States of which they were members into one common Union
The effect of the measure was not only to se- cure a common control over the people of all the States, as already mentioned, but to give to each State a domestic boundary; and to of the States, as a nation, one common foreign boundary
That boundary, on the east, was a natural one—the Atlantic ocean
Hence the chances of strife and 24 portion than one to thirteen; and when, under this arrangement, collision should come, it would be between thirteen or more confederated States on one side, and a foreign and alien nation on the other
Besides, under the same arrangement, free and enduring access to that ocean became equally the right of the people of all the States
But what would be the effect if all the Atlantic States from Maine to Florida, inclusive, had taken it into thcir heads to secede from the Union, and in fact had done so
Would it not be to counter- vail all the reasonincy, rights, and objects inducing the formation of the Union
Would it not bo to reéxpose the separated States to all the hazards of continually menaced war
Would it not be a usurpation of exclusive jurisdiction by the Atlan- tic States over the Atlantic seaboard
Would it not be to deny the unalienable right of the other States to access to the Atlantic—to the use of its ports and harbors—except upon terms of conces- sion
What would Vermont say to that—Ver- mont clailning to be a revolutionary State
Would she or any of the excluded States willingly sub- mit to it
I think not
Acain: take an individual case—the case of Florida; who, as a Territory, x,vas purchased from Spain in 1819, at a cost of of the common treasure of all the States
And why, and for what purpose
It was, as we are informed, for important national purposes
First, to get rid ofa neighbor; next, to round out our Union, and establish a natural boundary; next, to obtain the Florida point, as a means of._con- trolling one of the outlets of the Mississippi and thc Gulf of Mexico; and lastly, perhaps, to open an artificial communication, across the peninsula of Florida, between the Atlantic and the Gulf, as a means of avoiding the circuitous and dangerous navigation of the coasts of Florida
These were thc purposes for which Florida was acquired; and since her acquisition she has cost us some thirty or forty million dollars more; ex- pended for the purpose of suppn•ossing Indian hostilities, removing Indians from her borders, and fortifying her extended coasts
Now, shall Florida, witli a population of onc hundred thou- sand—less than one half of that of my district— shall she, having become a State by our paternal consent, withdntw frorn the Union, convert her- self into a nation, and setting up for her- self, thus defeat all the objects inducing her acqui- sition
Who will say so
As a foreign nation, in the vicissitudes to which weak States particularly are incident, would she be able to hold the fortifications erected by the United States at Key West and the Dry Tortugas, for the protection of one of the chief passages of the Gulf
Who believes it
In such an event, this Government standing aloof, would not these positions, sooner or later, fall into the hands of England, France, or Spain; and, in that event, would they not become to the Gulf and the great inland sea of the Mississippi what Gibraltar, in the hands of England, is to the Mediterranean
Nor would the danger of such a result bc much diminished if a southern Confederacy, inclUding Florida, should succeed to thejurisdiction of those positions; for, as a non-maritime power, it would bc unable to cope with the great maritime nations of Europe
While, if they should fall under the power of Spain or Great Britain—the first holding Cuba, and the latter the Islands of Jamaica and Grand Cayman—either would be enabled abso- lutely to close the mouth of the Mississippi, by blocking up the narrow passage between Cuba and Yucatan on one side, and the same island and Fkorida on the other
Hence, in any event, the non-seceding and commercial States of the Union rnust needs retain those positions
Take still anotherexample: that of Louisiana— the State of Louisiana
She is a part of what was once the French province of Louisiana; for which, in our infancy, we paid the surn of $15,000,000, when we were hardly able to pay anything; when we were small in population, overwhelmed with the revolutionary debt, bankrupt in credit, and NEW SERIES....,NO

That sum then was morc to us than are now; but relatively ås large as it was, itfell far short of the value of that province—a province extendinc» from the Mississippi river wcstwalä —embracing -the area of an empire, traversed by noble rivers, abounding in rich min- orals, and lands of surpassing fertility, and which was transferred to us more in order to avoid Eng- land's seizing it, than as an equivalent for the really insignificant price paid for it
The French Consul Bonaparte, speaking of it, said: I know the price of what 1 abandon, and- have eum- ciently proved the importance that I attach to it,' since my first diplornatic act With Spain had rdr itSobject its recovery
I renounce it with the greatest regret
If should regulate my ternis according to the value of these vast regions to the United States, the indennüty would have no litnits
Pev haps it will be objected to rne that the Americans may be fOund too powerful for Europe in two or three centuries; but my fbresight does not embrace such remote fears." Again; hc exclaimed upon the conclusion of the treaty of cession: This accession ofterritory strengthens forever the power of the United States ; and I have just given to England a nmritirne rival, that will sooner or later humble her pride." Mr
Livingston, too, our minister at the French Government, upon the signing of the treaty, addressing his colleague, Mr
Monroe, and t.he French minister, Barbö Marbois, broke forth in the following rapturous strain: VVe have lived long, but this i* the noblest work'0four ',vhole lives
From this day the United States take their plaec among the Powers of the
first rank; the English lose all exclusive influence in affairs of America
The Uni- ted States will reéstablish the maritime rights of the world, which are now usurped by a single nation
The instrumentS which we have just signed will cause no tears to be •shed ; they prepare ages of happiness for innumerable generations of human creatures
The Mississippi and Missouri will see them succeed one, another, and multiply, truly worthy of the regard and care of Providence, in thebosom o:' equal- ity, undér just laws-:, freed the errors of superstition and the scourges of bad government." Such was the estimate of the Louisiana prov- ince by the greatest minds of that day
Such were the prophesies of Bonap•arte and Livingston
And has not subsequent experience progressively, but rapidly, contributed towards their fulfillment
'Che destinies of that great province, as thus viv- idly and graphically portrayed by these eminent Inen, were not those of a " pent up Utica " of a cotton confederacy, or a mere slave-State Union, but of' an ocean-bound Republic, rising in the strength of the soaring eagle, flaunting the banner of freedom, and boast.ing the proud title of the " Ui)ited States of America.' This province, thus predestinated to unity with this Republic, and concurrence in the fulfillment ofits glorious mission, has since been carved into a number of States and organized Territories— into the States of Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa, and into the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, besides the State of Louisiana: which is the pass- way of all the former to the Gulf of Mexico; not only of them, but of Tennessee, Kentucky, west- ern Virginia, and Pennsylvania, and the Six north- western States
The whole Mississippi valley has its only navigable outlet to the Gulf through Lou- isiana
Close that outlet, and ail the people in- habiting the upper shores of the Mississippi and its amuents, amoun ting to eleven or twelve rnillion, at once become isolated and excluded from the Gulf
In that event the agricultural and other products of the upper valley annually descending the Mississippi to the Gulf, for an outlet to our eastern Atlantic cities and abroad, to the amount of $150,000,000, would be forced into some other directioi, or be entirely stifled by insuperable dis• couracements
What, in the course of time, would be the effect of this deprivation upon the people inhabiting that valley
Would it not sap their enterprise, bliih&• their spirit, enervate their character, and degrade them to an inferior condition
Will the bmve and hardy men of that valley consent to so -ignomin- ious a fate

Let me
not be misunderstood
I do not dcsirc would avoid it by all honorable means, war
particularly a civil war between any of the Stutcs of this Umon
Such a war would be fratricidal, unnatural, and most bloody
It would be a war between States equally jealous of their honor, and men equally brave
would forfeit my own self- respect, if could disparage the courage of my brethren , cither of the North the South ; for cour- age ig the distinction of neither, but the virtue of both
The only difference between them is, that the man of the South fights from impetuosity, the man of the North from purpose, and the rnan of the West froyn a restless spirit, of adventure
Myself n Kentuckian by birth, and an Illinoisan by nurture and education, I would deplore such a war as the greatest caqamity that could befall the country; yet, as a practical man, and a rcp- resentative of the people, I must not shut my eyes to the logic of cause and effect—to the popuiar instinct of eclf-prcservation
Some sixty years when the white people of the Mississippi valley scarcely bercd two hundred thousand, and when Kentucky and Frankland (now r rennessee) were almost the only American settlements west of the Alleghanies, the people of that valley seriously deliberated whether they should transfer their allegiance to thc Span- isli crown, or forcibly seize New Orleans for the purpose ot• securing t.he outlet of the Mississippi river
And, at a later date, they boldly offered I to Spain the alternatives of wur or a concession of the jurisdiction of that rivcr to the United States
But' let history speak for itself on these points
Gayarre, in his history of Louisiana, gays: In 1786, the western portion of North Carolina, which called the VVashington district, had declared iisclf in- a nd had constituted itself into the State or dependent, Fran which oruanizcd its govcrnmc!lt, and elected Colonel John Scvior as its first Governor
But
Congress interfin•cd in thvor of North Carolina, the authority or which wag inaintained, and the new Sr.ate o!' Erankland tcrll)- 'I'llis first attempt in the inated its brief career in 1787
West to throw off openly the allegiance duo to the parent State had aroused inten.e excitelnent for and against it ; and the secessionists, still persevering in their former designs, were watching for the opportunity to renew them
'I'llns, on the 12th of September, 1788, e.x-Governor John Sevier had written.to Gardoquk, to iniörm hirn that the inhabitants of Frankland unanimou.q in thcir mchmnent desire to .fbrm an alliance and tieaty Qf commercc •utith Spain, and put themselves under her protection
Wherefore, he tur ammunition

'I'he same author gives the following pqssage, in a letter written by General Wilkinson on the 12th of February, 1789, to Miro: Thus, sir, It we review the policy [of annekation to Spain) favored by the fiibabftaut.s of Kentucky, we see that the most intelligent and wealthiest relish our designs,which ure opposed by only two men of rank, who, coiteolled by their fears of silly demago«rneg, and fliting their fbllowcrs wrth hopes from the expected action of the new Congress, i have caused the suspension Df the measures we had in view to unite the people, and thus to secure the success of aur plans without involving the countky in violent civil a time which -involved peculiar diffculties, the intendant, Morales, issued an order suspending the right of deposit at that town, by a proclamation of the 16th of October, 1802
This measure was extremely prejudicial to-New Orlea!is, where it almost produced a famine, by stopping the supplies of flour and other western produce, necessary for the daily sustenance of its population
When this news reached the western people, they were fired with indignation at an aet which suspended their com- rnerce with New Orleans, and deprived them of •an outlet without which they could hardly exist
Ntunerous appeals, petitions, and even violent throats, were addressed to the General Government on the subject, and tha protracted em- barrassments of the West were exposed to the whole peo- ple of the United States in so impressive a manner as to command their deep attention, and to force the Govern- ment into immediate and energetic action
Here is a spe- ' The cimen of the language used on the occasion : is ours by the law of sissippi,' said the western people, nature; it belongs to us by our nurnbers, and by the labor which we have bestowed on those spots which, before our arrival, were desert aud barren

No power in thc world shall deprive us of this right

retUses us effectual protection, if it forsakes us, we will adopt the measures which our safety requires, even if they endanger the peace ot' the Union and our connection with the other States
No protection, no allegiance.' Mr
Modigon, as Secretary of State, writing to Mr
Li vingston , (Novem ber27 , 1802,) on the same subject—the suspension of the right of deposit, From whatcvcr source the measure may have pro- ceeded, the President expects that the Spanish Government will neither lose a inotnent in countermanding it, nor hesi- tate to repair every damage which Inay result frorn it
You are aware the sensibility of' our western citizens to such '.l'his sensibility is justified by the interest an occurrence
they have at stake

Mr
Madison, again writing to Mr
Livincrston 1, 1803) upon the cession of Louisiana by Spain to the French Republic, said: " 'i'hc cession ot• Louisiana to France becomes daily more and more a source ot painful apprehension
Notwithstand- ing the
treaty o!' March, and notwithstanding the
gcn- crai belief France on the subject, and the accounts from St
that part of the armatnent sent to that island was eventllally• (testined for Louisiana, a hope was still drawn fro:n your early conversations with M

'nore it can be developed in candid and friendly appeals to I the reflections or the French Governtnent, the it will urge it to rcvi.se, and abandon the project
A mere neigh- borhood eould not be friendly to the harmony which both countriea have so much an interest in c}ierishing ; but if a possession of the nwut.h
Qj• t,he Mississippi is to be added to the other causes 0k' discord, the worst event* are to be ap- prehended
You will consequently spare
no Pfibrts, that wili eonsi*t, with prudence and dignitv, to lead the coun- cus o
France to proper views of this subject, and to an abandonment ot• her present purpose," Pursuing the samo subject, Mr
Ross (.Febru- ary 14, 1803) said: To tbc free navigation of the M(ssisgippi we had an undoubt.ed right froin nature, and frolii the
position of our and the rit'ht of deposit in westcrn country
the island of New had bc.cn solen:nly ackl')owl- edged and fixcd by treaty in 1795
'i'hat treaty had been in actual operation and execution nrany years ; and now, without any pretense of abuse or vio;ation oti our part, the officers ot• the Spanish Govcrrnnent deny that right, refuse the place of deposit, and add the most offen- Sive of all insults, by f'orbiddin',' us frojn landin" on any part of their territory, and shutting us out as a common nuisance
HI hy not seize, then, what is so essentöal to us as a nation
i,Vhy not expel the wrong-doers—wrong-doers by their own cont'esgion—to whom by seizure we are domg Subsequently, Mr
Ross offered a series of res• olutions for the consideration of the Serrate, from which I quote, as follows: That the President be aut.horized to take immediate possession of such piace or places in the satne island (New Orleans) OF the adjacent territories, as he ;nay deem fit and convenient tor the purposes aforesaid ; and to adopt such other measures for obtaining that comptetc security as to him, in his wisdom, sh•aü seem meet
Tbat he be anthorized to call into actual service any number of the militia ofthe States of South Carolina, Geor- gia, Ohio, Kentucky, •Tennessee, or the Mississippi Terri- tory, which he may think proper, not exceeding fifty thou- sand, and to employ them, together with the rnilitary and naval forces of the •Union, for effecting the objects above Inentioned." His colleague, Mr
Maclay, addressing the Sen- ate in support of these resolutions, said: These observations are urged upon the supposition that it is in the power of tbe Government to restrain the impet- uosity of the western pcople, and to prevent their doing justice to themselves; which, by the by, beg to be under- stood as not believing, but expressly the contrary
They kpow their own strength ; they know the tt•ebieness of the enemy ; they know the infinite itnportance of the stake ; and they feel, perrnit me to say, sir, with Inot•e than tnere sensibility, the insults and injuries they have received ; and I believe will not submit, even för the approaching scason, to their present ruinous and humiliating situation
You had as well pretend to dam up the mouth of the Missis- sippi, and say to its restless waves, ye shall cease here, and never mingle with the ocean, as to expect they will be pre- vented from descending it
VVithout the free use of the river, and the necessary advantages of deposit below our line, their fertilc country is not worth possession ; their pro- duce Inust be wasted in the fields, or rot in their granaries
These are rights not only guaranteed to them by treaty, but also given to thein by the God of nature, and; they en- force them, '.vith or without the authority of thc Govern
ment; and let me ask whether it is more dignified for the Government to lead or follow in the path of honor
One it must do, or give up that western country." Mr
Morris, Senator from New York, also ad- vocated the seizure of thc island of New Orleans; and finally , upon the motiofi of Mr
Breckinridge, of Kentucky, Mr
Ross's resolutions were substi- tutcd, and a bill passed morc fully developino• their sueøestions, enacted to carry them into cf- fect
The substitute resolutions are as follows: Resolved, That the President of the United States be, and hc is hereby, authorized, whenever he shall judge it expedient., to require of tlre executives of the several States and equ;p, according to to take effectual Incasures to ann and to bold in readiness to in arch, at a Inoment's warn- inz eighty thousand effective militia, officers included
'Phat thc President may, if.he judges it expedient, atr- thorize the executives of the several States to accept, as part of the detachment aforesaid, any corps ot• volunteers WI)O shakl continue in serviee for such tillie, not e.xceeding Inonths, and perlönn such services as shall be pte- gcribed by law
dollars be appropriated ftn• paying and sub- sisting such part of the troops {'töresaid, whose actuai ser- vice may be wanted, and for (lcf•rayin« such other expenses, during the recess of Congress, as the President may deem necessary tor the security of the territory of the United States
dollars be appropriated for erecting, at such 'Ithat place or places on the western waters as the President may judge most propcr, onc or inore
arsenals." On the 30th of April, 1803, the treaty Witb France ceding Louisiunu to the United Stales was signed, and happily put an cnd to all Curt her con- troversy in regard to the ownership of that prov- mce
In view of these historical facts, ean it be doubted w hat would be the course, nay, the ne- cessity, of the twelve or thirteen million people inhabiting the upper valley of the Mississippi if that river should be closed against thom and their immense commerce
If two hundred thousand people, with u comparatively insignificant com- mcrce, were ready to appeal to arms to secure tho frcc navi(ration of that river in 1809, would sixty timos the same number of people, with a corre- sponding commerce, do less now
Only the naan uninitiated in the springs of human action will say so
No, thc Mississippi valley is a geographical Its great river, with its intersecting tribu- unit
taries reaching out in every direction to its utmost , limits, is the hand of Almighty God, binding it together as onchomo"eneous and complete whole

It is an organic body, inseparable except by vio- lcnce to the laws of nature and those other laws I of commerce, education, and society, which are induced by the former

cohesion
I say this in no offensive, but in a Dhilosophical sense; and the reconstruction job- ers of the day, if they would make permanent'! work, must bear it in mind
Why, indeed, is not Missouri and the whole Son thwest, including Texas, Tennessee, and Ken- tucky, closer in interest and natural affnity to Illinois and the whole Northwest, than the same States are to South Carolina, Georgia, and Flor- i ida
Why, too, are not Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and perhaps North Carolina, closer, in the affnities of agricultural products and economic policy, to Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and the whole North west, than the same States are to South Carolina, Géorgia, Florida, Ala- bama, and Mississippi
These are questions to be answered by reason and facts, and not by mo- mentary passion and prejudice
But in a wider, loftier view than mere sectional interest and official duty, is there not something to draw us, by earnest, and irresistible attraction, to a fearless, faithful, and enduring embrace of this glorious Union
What, with its memories of the past, its blessings of the present, and its hopes of the future, is it not worth to us
Behold its youthful enet•ryies grasping a continent as the young warrior grasps his shield and buck- ler! Behold its lofty stature piercing the vaulted skies in the dim and distant peaks of the Alle- ghany and Rocky Mountains! Behold its com- merce whitenivevery sea! Behold its agriculture strewing the land and gorging the rivers and the lakes with its infiniteprofusion! Behold its toiling, tireless workshops and manufactories, forging and fabricating ali that utility, luxury, or taste, can crave! Behold its constellations of schools, colleges, and universities, sparkling as diamonds upon its bosom, and illun)inating its ext.ended sphere with grace, beauty, and intelligence! Be- I hold its expanded artns oflöring an asylum to the oppressed of ali nations! Behold its glancing ban- ner in the van of human progress ! Behold its em- blematic eagle soaring with unblenching gaze full in the sunlight of a higher, nobler, and purer civ- ilization than ever befbre kindled the aspirations of any other people! Behold this great federative system—behold it, built upon the Divine idea of the universe itself—with its central sun and plan- etary orbs, each revolving within its separate sphere, and all revolving collectively, and as •a dependent whole, within the circle of its mighty orbit! Behold all this, and answer me whether this wondrous political creation, the work of our fathers, and their loving legacy to us as their chil- dren, is not worth Patriotism, too, the sacred obligation of patriot- ism, would prompt every loyal citizen, whether in the North or in the South, to defend and main- tain the integrity of the Union and the authority of its common Government against the inroads of violence
Not only thc universal allegiance of all citizens of the United States binds them to it; bat we, and all other public offcers, especially are solemnly bound to it by our oaths
W c cannot avoid it ifwc would
We hear, however, the clamor of coercion—of coercion of States—a clamor got up, if not
to make us all traitors, at least to frightek'i us out of our i propriety
What is the foundation for thisclamor
ii Do the friends of the Union propose to invade South Carolina for the purpose of subjugating her people
Do they propose to force her send her members of Congress back here, or to hold any Federal office, or to perform any active Fcd- i eral duty
Not so
All we propose is to protect the property and jurisdiction of the United States
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
371 Rather is it coercion for a State to require of us to submit to her spoliation of the forts, arsenals, dock-yards, custom-houses, post offces, and the arms and munitions of the United States
Such submission, sir, in mv opinion, would be in the last degree reprehensible and disgraceful
Utter imbecility only can tolerate it; and if that be the condition of our Government, let us at once abol- ish it, and proclaim to the world the sad fact, that tl'ie last and most auspicious experiment of free government has signally failed
Can anything but madness countenance the scheme of secession
Let it become a practical doctrine, and the most fatal consequences must follow
Not only will States secede from the Union, but counties from States, and cities and towns from both ; and thus the work of disintegra- tion and dissolution will go on until the whole frame of society and government will be ingulfed in one bottomless and boundless chaos of ruin
Already it has induced civil war; indeed, in itself it is civil war
Whatdo we see
Castlc Pinckney, Fort Moul- tric, and the arsenal, and all other property of the United States, except Fort Sumter, in the harbor and city of Charleston, have been seized, and are now Field by the revolutionary forces of South Carolina
And still later, we hear that a vessel sent by the United States, under the stars and stripes, with supplies t.o their garrison ill Fort Sumter, hus been fired into by order of the Gov- ernorofthatState
Morc than that; she has placed herself upon a complete war footing by organ- izir1(T and arming her militia, and voting large supplies of money to maintain her rnilitary estab- lishments
Georgia, too, has seizod Forts Jack- son, Pulaski, and Niorgan; and Alabama the United States arsenal at Mobile, containing sevcn- ty-eight thousand stand of arrns, one thousand five hundred boxes of powder, three hundred thou- sand rounds of musket cartridges, and other mu- nitions of war; and thus Ethe war commenced, goes on, thus mad men rush upon— Lean farnine, quartering stecl, and climbing fire." Oh, how changed thc scene of yesterday warnings, and portents and evils ominous, are Belfold! T hc genius •of America, that upon us
fair divinity of peace, whose noble -statue, vying the noblest work of Phidias, graces the Capitol grounds
Alas! bel')old, behold! she has fled affrighted from her cmpyrcal throne; and Mars, the " mailed Mars, up to his ears in blood," has usurped her sway, and, in the hoarse dissonance of war, proclaims: Put armor on thine cars, and on thine cyes ; Whose proof, nor yells oc inotbers, anaids, nor bubcs, Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding, Shall pierce a jot." But before passing from this topic, let me in- voke the solemn and eloquent warnings of the immortal Jackson upon the subject of disunion
He asks, in his farewell address to the American people: VVhat havc you to gain by division and dissension 
Delude not yourselves with the belief that a breach once rnade, rnay be afterwards repaired
If the Union is once severeq, the line of' separation will grow wrider and wider, and the controversies wilieh are
now d '.bated a:ud settled in the halls of legislation, will then be tried in fields of battle, and deterniined by the sword
Neither should you deccivc yourselves with thc hopc that the first linc of scp- aratii)li would be the pcnnanent one, and that nothing kn_lt harnnony and concord would bc found in the new associa- tions iOnne(l upon the dissoiution of' the Union
Loeul interests would still bc found there, and unchastened am- bitiou
And if the recollection of comrnor: dangers, in •,vhich tbc people of these United States stood side by Fide against thc cennmon foc; thc Incmory or victories won by their united valor; the prosperity and happiness they have enjoyed under the present Constitution ; the proud name by defensive measures—no more
And is tha ,they bear as citizens of this great Republic , '—it' ail these coercion 
is it coercion ofa State for us to do Again, sir: what we arc sworn to do—to support the Con- • stitution," and the laws" and treaties" of the United States, as " the supreme law of the land
" Is it coercion for us to maintain, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must, possession of thc treas- ! ure and other property of the United States
Is it coercion for us to stay the violent and lawless hand that would tear down the noble structea•e of nay, more; is it coercion for our Governrnent,
us to let the flag of the Union stand upon the bosom of our country, where our fathers planted it; to let the eagle of America sweep with buoy- ant wing the Widc domain of this great nation 
it is a perversion Is that coercion
Why, sir, of all languaoe, a mockery of all ideas, to say so
recollections and prootk of comrnon iiiterest are not strong enough to bind us together as one people, what tio will hold united the new (livft,ions of empire when these bonds have been broken, and this Union disscvcrcd: The first line of separation would not last for a singlc generation; new f'ragments would be torn off; new• leaders would spring up ; and this great and glorious Republie would soon be broken into a Inultitude of petty States, without emnmerce, with- out credit, jealous or oneanotber, armed for Inutual aggres- sions, loaded with taxes to pay armies and leaders, socking aid against cach other from iöreigu Powers, insulted and trampled upon by the
nations o!' Europe, until, harassed svith conflicts and knunhlcd and debased in spirit, they would be
ready subalil to the absolute, (10111iui011 of any tniütary adventurer, and surrender t.heir liberty for the sake It is iinpossibie to look on the consequences of repose

that
inevitably the destruction of this Gov- and riot feel indignant when we hear cold calcu- Iaüons about the value of the Union, and have so con- • ' *tantly bc!öre us a line of conduct so well calculated to weakex its tics
But it is answeréd bylihe secedihg Ståtes that they are aggrieved, and •must needs have•'redress
And what are their alleged, grimnces
First; the nullification of the fugitive slave 'law-byithe so-called liberty bills of the northei•h States, kind otherwise; second, the exclusion of slave: prop* erty from the Territories of theu United: States; third, the continued agitation of- thö Slåv-eriques;• tion; and fourth, the election of Mr
Lincoln
This is the gravamen of the indictment lately drawn up by Sbuth- Carolina, and published to the world
In part it is true, and in part untrue
So far as Illinois is concerned, except in a few instances of rescue, there has been no -serious obstruction offered to the execution of the fugi- tive act, either under color of law or otherwise; and in the cases of rescue referred to, the par.ties implicated were promptly and exemplarily pun- ished by the courts and juries in the State
On the contrary, Illinois has had upon- her statute- books, for more than twenty-five years,- police laws operating effciently in aid of the fugitive act
Without pausing to dwell upon these laws, I refer all who are concerned, and -particularly her assailants, to them
Nor is it true that a ma- jority of her delegation in Congress has at time voted to exclude slave property from the Territories
As Rcpresentative from Illinois, I have always voted against excluding it, and in favor of the doctrine of non-intervention by Con- gress upon the subject
This has been my course from the date of the Wilmot proviso to the pres- ent day
As to our
territorial acquisitions, and the op- portunities afforded for slavery expansion, surely there is no just ground of complaint by the South
What arc tl'le facts
All the Territories hitherto acquired have been slave Territories, and in large part eminently adapted to slave labor
So it wäs of Louisiana, now embracinT the cotton and -su- gar-growing slave States of Louisiana and Ark' ansas; so df Florida, now another Biave State; and so of Texas, still another slave State; and withouthinderance slavery has spread all over this extensivc area, quite up to, and even beyond its climatic ability to sustain itself—as in northern Missouri and 'Texas, and in the Territory of New Mexico
On thc other hand, as often as our territory has been clipped, it has been on the north and free side—as in the case of Maine arid Massachusetts, under the Ashburton treaty; and of Oregon, under the Washington treaty
It is true, however, and I admit the fact, that scv-cral of the northern States have passed laws obstructive of the execution of the fugitive act, and violative of a solemn guarantee of tho Cone stitution of the United States
And protesting against it, as a northern man appeal.to the moral sense, the good faith and love of country of the people of those States, to repeal those laws, re- move this grievance, and right themselves in the eyes of their coun trymen
Will they not do it
I verily believe they will when their sober second thought has had tzme to act upon the subject
Already the peoplc of Pennsylvahia, New York,- Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts, havc led off upon the sukject; and no doubt the' people
"of' the ot.hcr delinquent States will follow their example
Admitting, however, as I do, that the slavery agitation was commenced in the North, still I can- not say that the South is blamelcss in regard to it
On the contrary, both sections have been driven into excesses upon thc subject by incendiary dem- In the North there
are the Garrisons acyooucs
and Phi)lipses, who are but the counterparts of the Rhetts and Yanceys of the South
rlhe one, re- garding the Constitution as a shield for slavery, denounces it as a covenant with death and an agreement with hell;" while the other, regarding the Union as the enemy of slavery, denounces it as the coil of the anaconda crushing out the life- blood of the South
These characters, on the one side, as crusaders agai nst slavery , assume to crush il out by authority of God; while on the other, as propagandists, they deem it their Heaven-ap- pointed mission to spread it everywhere
Such characters are but the incarnation of fanaticismq Transpose them geographically, one to the South and the other to the North, and each will em- brace the other's form of fanaticism—thö Abo- litionist becoming a fire-eater, and the .fire-eater an Abolitionist
It is such men who haye led the Way in forrmn• two great sectional parties; one, the ahti-sla#cry  372 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 14, Republican party of the North; and the other, the pro-slavery disunion party of the South, which, respectively, have seized the control Lhcir par- ticular sections, and are now grindin'* the Union into powder
"Thc onc seetn'd woman to the waist, and fair, But ended foul in tuauy a sealy fold, Voluminous and vast.' • This was the parent; and the other: Black it stood as night, Fierce as ten furies, terrible as hell, And shook a dreadful durt." This was the hideous offspring of the fraudful parent
And thus I am brought to the consideration of the last ground of complaint—the election of Abraham Lincoln
And who, let mc inquire, is responsible for his election
Surely, not the reg- ular national Democracy, who were antagonized by the Republican party on thc one side,' and by the disunionists on the other
That party faith- fully and fearlessly resisted Mr
Lincoln 's election to thc last
Occupying a middle ground, they counseled reason, moderation, and forbearance; but amid the storm of excitement that prevailed, their counsels were unheeded
Their brethren of the South seceded from the Democratic conven- tion, set up a new party test, bolted the regular Democratic nomination, and dividing its forces, by consequence betrayed its success
Therespons ibility, therefore, be upon others, not upon us
Thou cans't not say, I did it; never shake Thy gory locks at 'ne." Sucli being the primary and secondary cause, and such the disastrous result, we say now, to the Republicans, abjure your fanatical and pro- scriptivedogmas; and to the disunion ists, or rather to our conservative brethren of the South of all parties, we say—to them we say, stay disunion— stay that fatal movement, at least until the people of the North, in their sober second thought, have had time to come to the rescue
Let us all—let all conscrvativc Inen of all par- ties and of all sections, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Gulf of Mexico to the far lakes— rally in favor of the integrity of Constitution and the Union
Let them merge the partisan in the patriot, and, coming up to the altar of their country, generously sacrifice every angry feeling and ambitious aim for the welfare and glory of that country
Let no man, whether he be Dem- ocrat, Republican, or American, refuse to yield something of his opinions and prepossessions in deference to others, and the higher claims of patriotism
All government, all authority, all human life, is a compromise
Christianity itselT is a compromise between justice and mercy—be- tween disobedience and Its predoomed punish- ment
Let us, therefore, in a spirit of conciliation and concession, compromise our existing differ- ences upon just and equitable terms; let us all do this for the good of all
Our fathers set us such example in the formation of the Federal Consti- tution; and why cannot x,ve follow it as the con- dition of preserving and perpetuating that sacred instrument
To do so would be no discredit or disparagement to any one, but, an honor to all
The people, posterity, and future history, in the name of freedom and l•mmanity, call for it
Personally, I would prefer compromise upon the basis of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the States, in the Territories, and in the District of Columbia
My own choice would be, to leave the people of the States and Territo- ries each to decide for themselves whether they would or would not have slavery, and what should be the character of their other local insti- tutions
This would be my choice; but if such a gettlement is unacceptable to the majority, then I am willing to forego my strong objections to a geo- graphical line, and adopt the plan of adjustment recommended by- a committee of the members from the border States, which is familiar to the tion
It has immense •interests at stake in this I Union, as well from its position as its power and patriotism
W c have had infidelity to the Union beforc; but never in such a fearful shape
We had it in the East during the late war with Eng- land
Even Sö late as the admission of Texas, Massachusetts resolved herself out of the Union
That resolution has never been repealed; and one i would infer, from much of her conduct, that she did not regard herself as bound by our covenant
Since 1856, in the North, we have had infidelity I to the Union, morc by insidious infractions of the Constitution, than by open rebellion
Now, sir, as a consequence, in part, of these very infractions, we have rebellion itself, open and darin«r, in ter- rific proportions, with dangers so formidable as to seem almost remediless
From the time I took my seat this session, I have acted and voted in cvet•y way to remove the causes of discontent and to stop the progress of revolution
At the threshhold, I voted to raise the committee fro:n each State ; and I voted against ex- cusing the members who sought to withdraw from it, because I believed then, that such a committee, patrioticaHy constituted, as I believe it was, had tn it much of hope and safety; and because, to ex- cuse members from service onit, upon the ground pends for its execution on public sentiment
To that sentiment alone, in its calmer mood, are we to look for a restoration of a better feeling
that feeling comes, it will be hailed like the sea-bird which visited the sea-tossed caraval of Columbus—as the harbinger ofa firm-set footino• Other facts of a similar perilous character will soon transpire
Georgia, Texas, and Louisiana, will assuredly follow the erratic course of South Carolina
This fact must soon be encountered
South Carolina has been singing her Marseillaise, and the waves of the Gulf make accordant music in the revolutionary qnthem
It but echoes the abolition of the North and West; for scarc.ely had the song died away on the shores of Lake Erie, before South Carolina took it up with a wilder chorus! Extremes thus meet
Extremes north have aided, if not conspired, with extremes south, in the work of disintegration That work will go on
I know •that we are very slow to believe in any sign of dissolution
-we havc faith in our luck
We have trust in a certain inventive faculty, which has never yet failed us, either in mechanical or political expe- dients
Our politics are plastic to emergencies
Still I must warn the people of Ohio that it is the of secession, was to recognize the heresy
I am 'I well-grounded fear, almost the foregone conclu- ready to vote now for any salutary measurc which will bring peace and preserve the Union
Herodotus relates that when Mardonius was en- camped in Bæobia, before the battle of Platæa, he und fifty of his oflicers were invited to meet thc same number of Thebans at a banquet, at which they reclined in pairs, a Persian and a Theban upon each couch
Daring thc entertainment one of the Persians, with many tears, predicted to his Theban companion the speedy and utter destruc- tion of the invading army, and when asked why he used no influence with Mardonius to avert it, hc answered: When one would give faithful counsel, nobody is will- ing to believe Ililn
Although Inany of' us Persians are aware of the end we are corning to, we still go on
because and this is the very bitterest we are bound to our destiny ot• a Inan's griefk, to see clearly, butto have no power to do anything at an I believe, sir, that tho events now transpiring are big with disaster to my country
I have done In y humble part for years to prevent them; but I do not see now that any effort on my part can avail; and this is the bitterest of a man 's grief
It is in such peril as this that the heart spontane- ously prays for a nearer communication with a divine prescience
We long for some direction from u superior power, in whose great mind the end is seen from the beginning
At least, one might wish for soxne magic mirror df Merlin, in which to see the foes of our country approach, so as rightly to guard against them
Four States have, in so far as they could, by their own act, separated from our Federal Union
-This is one of the stern facts which this Congress has to encounter
The Government is passing through one of those historic epochs incident to 0.11 nationalities
Our prosperity has madc us proud, rich, intolerant, and self-suffcicnt; ar)d therefore prone to be rebellious
We have waxed tempestuously well." As- fat—are doing well, cending to the height ofa national glory, through a national unity, we are in danger of fålling by our own dizziness
We are called upon to break down and thrust aside the very means of our ascent—the Constitution itself! In such a time, the bitter crimination and vain threats and insults of party and of sections are out of place
They should not turn the people of the North from doing their whole duty to the South; nor the South from a more deliberate re- vicw of its past, and a more prudential view of its perilous future
No man has the right to say or do aught that will further exasperate the pub- lic sentiment of thc South
No good man in the North can oppose any measure of honorable re- Sion of the, patriotic statesmen here, that the work I of breaking up will go on, until the entire South members of the House, and which, as the peace- II cession from wrong
I cannot speak of South offering of conservative men, would no doubt i Carolina in the tone and temper of some
She II meet the approbation of the great mass of the has been a part of our national life
Her blood shall bc arrayed against the entice North
In view of these facts, I will discuss these propositions: I
That secession is not a right in any possi- ble relation in which it can ne viewed; to tolerate it in theory or practice, is moral treason to patri- Otism and good government
2
That while it may not involve such direful consequences as other revolutions, still it is rev- lution
3
That every effort of conciliation should be exhausted to check it, before force is applied." 4
That if the North does not do her part fully in recession from aggression, it will be impossr- ble to unite the northern people, or any portion of the southern people, in repressing secession
5
That if the South will make a patient en- deavor, equal to the great occasion, to secure her rights in the Union, I believe that she will suc- coed; and if she is then repulsed, it will be impos- Sible för her to receive any detriment from the North; but she will depart fn peace
6
If she go inconsideratcly, as some States are going, the country may incur the fearful hazard of war
7
If the South press the one hard overmaster- ing question upon the North, and follow it up with seizure of forts and revenue, cannonading of our vessels and other aggressive acts, without giving an opportunity for conciliation, there will be no power in the conservatism of the North to restrain the people
No sacrifice wiil be consid- ered too great to make in the protection and defense ofthc Union
8
That, in the present state of facts, so long as the revenues can be collected on land or sea, and the forts and harbors can be commanded by the Federal Government, that Government must be, as to these matters, the Government de facto, as well as de jure; and that so long as this status can be maunained by the Executive, it should be done by all the legal forces of the Government
9
Only when revolution becornes so formi- dablc as to be irresistible, would it be proper to nquire whethcr coercion would not be both sui- idal to the Union and criminal to mankind
I would not exaggerate the fearful consequences f dissolution
It is the breaking up of a feder- ative Union; but it is not like the breaking up of society
It is not anarchy
A link may fall from the chain, and the link may still be perfect, though the chain have lost its length and its strength
In the uniformity of commercial regulations, in matters of war and peace, postul arrangements, foreign relations, coinage, copy-rights, tariff, and other Federal and national affairs, this great Gov- ernment may be broken; but in most of the es- is in our veins; her Marions, Sumters, and Pinck- people; a plan which understand my distin- It sential liberoes and rights which Govermnent is neys are ours

mained
Hungary has lost her national crown; but her home institutions remain
South Car- olina may preserve her constituted domestic au- thority; but she nutSt be content to glimmer obscurely remote; rather than shine and revolve in a constellated band
She even goes out by the ordinance of a so-called convention, content to lose, by her isolation, that youthful, vehement, exultant, proø•ressive life, which is our NATIONALITY! She foregoes the hopes, the boasts, the flag, the music, all the emotions, all the traits, and all the energ;es, which, when combined in our United States, have won our victories in war and our miracles of national advancement
Her Governor, Colonel Pickens, in his inaugural, rc- gretfully " looks back upon the inheritance South Carolina had in the common glories and triumph- ant power of this wonderful Confederacy, and fails to find language to express the feelings of the human heart as he turns frorn the contemplation
The ties of brotherhood, interests, linca•e, and history, are all to be severed.
No longer are we to salute a South Carolinian with the idem sen- tentiam de republica," which makes unity and nationality
What a prestige and glory are here dimmed and lost in the contaminated reason of man ! Can we realize it
Is it a masquerade, to last for a night, or a reality to be dealt with, with the world 's' rough passionate handling
It is sad and bad enough; but let us not overtax our anxieties about it as yet
It is not tho sanguinary regimen of the French revolution; not the rale of assignats and guillotine; not the cry of" Vivent les Rouges! mort le•s gendarmes!" but as yet, I hope I may say, the peaceful attempt to withdraw from the burdens and benefits otthe Republic
Thus it is unlike evorv other revolution
Still it is revolu- tion
It may, according as it is managed,'involve consequences more terrific than any revolution since Government began
Ifthe Federal Government is to bc maintained, its strength must not be frittered away by conceding the theory of secession
To concede secession as a right, is to make its pathway one of roses, and not of thorns
I would not make its pathway so easy
If the Government has any strength for its own preservation, the people demand it should be put forth in its civil and moral forces
Deal- ing, however, with a sensitive public sentiment, in which this strength reposes, it must not be rudcly exercised
It should be thc iron hand in a glove of velvet
Firmness should be allied with kindness
Power should assort its own prerocr- ative, but in the name of law and love
If these elements are not thus blended in our policy, as the Executive proposes, our Government will prove either a garment of shreds or a coat of mail
We want neither
Our forts have been seized; our property taken ; our flag torn down; our laws defied; our juris- diction denied; and, that worst phase of revolu- tion, our ship, sent under our flag to the relief of a soldier doing his duty, fired upon and refused an entrance at one of our own harbors
Would that were all! The President informs us, ili his last message, that— In States which have not seceded, the forts, arsenals, and magazines of the United States have been seized
'I'his is by far tho most serious step which hag been taken since the commencement of the troubles
'l'his public property has long been left without garrisons and troops för its pro- tection, because no person doubted its security under thc flag ofthD country in ail the States of the Union
Besides, our small army has scarcely been sufficient to guard our remote frontiers against the Indian incursions
'l'he seiz
ure of this property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressiue, and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the Union," All that the President has done is defensive; all that he has resisted has been aggression
He proposes no agcrression; nor wou*ld I favor it
He would maintain the laws and property; what else
can he do
These facts havc to bc met—how
By the con- quest of all tho people of a State
By the dec- I answer, by the laration and wao•er of war
enforcement of the laws and the protection of our property in a constitutional manner
This is the answer I have alrcady voted in this House, in voting for the resolution of tho gentleman from New Jersey
But is it asked, how will you cn- force the laws and keep forts and property, with- out war
I will answer: first, repeal here every law making ports of entry at the recusant cities sible
That is in our power
Second
Libel and confiscate in adrnirnlt.y every vessel- which leaves such ports without the Federal clearance
Third
Collect the revenue and preserve the property, and only use such force as will -rnaintmn the de- fensive
But again it is asked, is not this coercion ao•ainst a Government de facto, established by the consen t ofall the people ofa State under an assu med legal I answer, South Carolina is not de .f&cto the Government as to these Federat .natters, so long as the Federal Government can hold -her harbors, shut in her ships, and collect the revenue
Who can deny that proposition
But still it is asked, will not the use of force in executing the laws, and preserving our property, result in civil war
Is there any practical differ- ence between the enforcement of law when re- sisted by so targe an agn•essive power, and the actual state of war
Here is the Sphinx of our present anomalous situation
I do not choose now to say what I will do, in casc a certain result fol- lows the performance of presentduty
It is enough for me now to do the duty of the present
But that judgment vvhich makes no discrimination between the enforcemcnt of the laws and defense of property, and the actual state of war, must be palsied by undue fear of consequences
There nothing more plainly distinguished in the books and in experience, than the difference between the civil authority and the war-making power
True, the military arm may be invoked to aid the civil authority, but it must be subordinatc to it in many most essential particulars
It is then the sword of the magistrate, and not of the soldier
Says Chief Just-ice Taney, in the Rhode Island case: (Jnqucstionably, a State :nay use its military povver to put down an armcd insurrection too strong to be controlled by tbc civil authority
'I'hc power is esserrtial to the exist- cnce, of every Govcrntneut; essential to the preservation of order and free institutions; and is as necessary to the States of this Union, as to any other Government.—7 How- ard, 45
This Government hag had insurrections, and has quelled them by the civil authority, with the aid of the militia, and without martial law
The Shay's rebellion and the western insurrection were put down by the posse comilatus
The writ of habeas corpus was not suspended by the United States
But, even in extreme cases, where the President may call out tbc militia to suppress actual array und violence, without a law of Con- gress authorizing it, the force was only to be used with a view to cause the laws to bc duly executed
All arrests were made under civil authority
Trials were had as in civil cases
In Pennsyl- vania, in 1793, the expedition was not in its nature belligerent; but it was to assist the marshal
(7 Howard, 80 and 81.) Washington enjoined strictly the subordination of the military to the civil power, and went in person to see that his orders were obeyed
The very genius and structure of our Consti- tution would forbid the making of war, in its sense of aggression, against any State of thc Con- fed(irucy
But, unless the power to enforce reside somewhere ill t.he Government, it is virtually no Govern men t at all
It x,vcars a garment of shreds
If the force is of that irresponsible kind called war, the Government is then worse than a failure
it then wears a coat
of mail
But if it have the I force to maintain itself, and subordinate to itself the military which it Ilia y use in its defense, then it is a Government
It then wears the robe of State ! The time does not yet call for threats of coer- cion by martial or other nleans
It only calls for defense from those who are wygressive
I would reserve this power of coercion, as Prince Arthur did his diamond shield
He ever kept it out of siffht., covered with a vail; and only uncovered it to fi"ht monsters and alien enemies
I cu.]} this secession revolution
will notin an American Congres.s, with an oath on my con- scienco to support the Constitution, arøuc thc right to secede
No such right can ever bo had, except by amendment of the Constitution, legal- izinff such secession
It is a solecism to speak of the right of secession
It is revolution; and the burden of proof is on him who begins it, to show why hc geeks the change
The combined reason of the age has fixed in its maxims of thouffht rules to govern the actions of men and nations, which no one can overrule without great cri minality
Tl'i)cge rules require first that revo- II or towns; and thus avoid as rnuch trouble as pos- i, lution must have no light and transient cause, To overthrow a despotism, the -causes of grave weight
fortiori; what bé the grievance to justify a revoltagainst a Government so free as ours! Besides, there must be-a able hope of a happy and succesSfuII teéminåtion:
Otherwise history, with her judicial prescyipt, ban those who begin it to an eternity of retribu- tion
There must be in every State some power to which all others yield, competent to -meet, every emergency
No nation can be consigned toanarchy by some absurd contrivance, either- in- the shape of personal liberty bills or secession ordinances
In America, we have a national Constitution
Under it, we have United States citizenship
To it we owe and swear allegiance
It may be a com- pact; but it is a government also
It may be a league; but it has authority, 'G operative," as Mr
Madison holds, " directly on the people
It may reach States as States; but it does more: it reaches the people of the States through-its executive, judicial and legislative departments
if it cannot declare war against a State; it is because a State is a part of itself, and not, quoad hoc, foreign and independentState *Its Constitution is the supreme law of the land; and though, as Chief Justice Marshal says, (I Wheaton, 304,) "the sovereign powers vested in the State governments by their respcctive constituencies remain unaltered and unimpaired, yet they remain so, except so fgr as they were granted to the Government of the United Sta tes
I could Citc Marshal, Jefferson, Madison, Jackson, Story, Ducr, and Webster, almost every student, expounder and executor of the Constitu- tion, to show these conclusions to be irrefragable
It is an absurdity to conténd that States, which voluntarily surrendered such portions of their BOV- ereignties as were requisite for a national Govern- ment, can be the equal in power of that national Government
In the name ofthe people, the Consti- tution asserts its own supremacy and that of the laws made in pursuance thereof
It is supreme, by the consent of South Carolina herself, over the constitution and laws of the several States." Let South Carolina, then, attempt, as she has done by her ordinance, to annul her connection with this national system; does she not usurp a power of the General Government
Does she not infringe on the rights of Ohio
Is it not a plain violation of the permanent obligation she is under as one of its members 
Nay, she not only breaks her oath of fealty to the United States Constitution, but she breaks her oath to her own constitution, which rcquires that oath
Am referred by members of my own party to our platform and principles indorsing the Ken- tuck y and Virginia resolutions
Am 1 told that t.he sacred principles of State rights declared by Jefferson and Madison, as a check against the usurpations ofa consolidated Federal Power, allow that cach State may so judge of the infraction of the Constitution, and the means and measures of redress, that it 'nay go out of the Unicm
T he>e Virginia and Kentucky resolutions are- misin- terpretcd
Judge Marshal, however federal hig views, in a letter to Judge Story of July 31, 1833, (Story's Life and Letters, p
135,) is an honest witness to this misinterpretation
Hc says: The word State rights,' as expounded by the resolu- tioos or 1798 aud the report of 1799, construed by our Legis- Iature, has charm against which all reasonina is vain
Those resolutions and that report constitute the creed of every politician who hopes to rise in Virginia ; and toques- tion then), or even to adopt the construction given by their author, is deemed political sacrileae." This Government was intended to be perpetual
It was adopted in toto, and forever
Says Mr
Madison : The idea of reserving the right to withdraw was started, considered, and abandoned ; worse than rejected." Judge Marshal says: The instrument was not intended to provide merely for the exigencies of a few years, but was to endure through a long lapse of ages, tile, events of which were locked up in the inscrutable decrees of Providence." It was, therefore, provided with means for 
its own amendment
By the Legislatures of threc fourths of the States, there is a means of amebd- ment; and in that way alone can a State with- draw
Nullification and secession, said Mr
Mad- ison, are twin heresies, and should be buried in the same grave
Well said General Jackson, that secession did not break a league;- but it destroyed the unity of a nation; hence, he argued that it is an offense agamst the whole Union
To say that  374 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 14, a State may constitutionally secede, is to say that the constitutional elements wero poisoned at the birth of the nation, and of malice prepense wore intended to kill our national life! Such reasoning It is to affrm that overthrows all Government
the tribunal appointed for the arbitrament of mooted questions under the Constitution, or that the means for its own amendment, shall be set aside at the pleasure of one of the parties to be affected
Monstroüs sophistry! Are gen tlemep of the South aware that it is from this twin her- esy that the Republicans have drawn their argu- ments for their personal liberty bills and for their repudiation of the fugitive slave law
The very chief justice of Ohio so recently reindorsed for his seditious decision in the Oberlin fugitive case, bases his adjudication on the usurpations of the Federal Government
He, like South Carolina, denies that " the decisions of the usurping party, in favor of the validity of its own assumptions, (Ec parte, Bushnell, 9 Ohio can settle anything
State Reports, 227.) He warns aa•ainst the prac- tical omnipotence of the Federal Government by making authoritative tbc .judænent of its judicial tribunals." He sang the Marseillaise in his ermine from the supreme bench, as South Carolina sings it in her convention
would , therefore, guard against the least recog- nition of this right of secession, or of nullifica- tion, which is the lesser type of' the same disease
It would It would, say, destroy all government
dissolve the united mass of powers now deposited in the Union into thirty-three separate and con- flicting States; cach with a flag, a tariff, an arrny, a foreign policy, a diyersity of interests, and an idiosyncrasy of ideas
Nay, that would be toler- It would able; but it would do more and worse
disintÜTrate States, counties, towns; tear cities from their places thc map; disorder finances, taxes, rcvenuc, tariffs ; and con vert this fabric, now so fair and firrn that it seems built on the carth 's base, and pillared with thc firmament, into n play house of cards, built on a baso of stubble
would thus destroy the established order
And is such order amontr men, with view to perma- ncncy, nothing
'l'he North has rights, prop- erty, interests, relations in the Sou th, not to bc sundered without loss; and the South in the North, oicc versa
Is this nothing
Is deprecia- tion of property, depression of business, loss and lack of employment, withdrawal of capital, de- rangement of currency, increase of taxes, mis- carriagc of public works and enterprise, destruc- tion of State credit, the loss of that national sym- name, honor, unitv, metry, geography, strength , and glory, which publicists tell us are themselves the creators and guardians ot' cash, credit, and ——arc thesc consequences nothing

I wish that I could contemplate secession as a I fear that it I peaceful rcmedv
But I cannot

The Government is framed so compactly In all its parts, that to tear away one part, you tear the whole fabric asun- dcr
It cannot be done by consent
There is no authority to give consent
The Constitution looks It is a voluntary, to no catastrophe of the
kind

A majority of the States, and a great majority of the' people, In this angry and warlike dis- are hostile to it
ruption of the compact, where shall we find our more perfect Union, the establishment of justice, domestic tranquillity, provision for the common defrnse, the promotion of the general welfare, and thc security of the blessings of liberty to ourselves The country knows both question and answer
I proceed
If, then, South Carolina can dispense with an amendment of the Constitution to which she solemnly acceded on the 23d of May, 1788, can- not she dispcnse with other portions of that in- strument; ay, even with this American Congress
'I"he whole framework of our Government, by the action of separate States, may thus be swept away
This Congress may be dissolved, if not by the- military usurpation which dissolved the Long Parliament, or expelled the Council of Five Hun- dred from the Orangery of St
Cloud, yet by the very impotence of its organism, as the Confeder- ation dissolved under its imperfect articles, to give place to•this more perfect Union ! What justification does South Carolina offer for this abt
" Fifteen States," says her declara- tion, " have deliberately refused for years to ful- fill their constitutional obligations.' It refers to the fourth article of tho Constitution for the
spe- cific cause of grievance
But ig there not now, since tho vote in this House the other day on the personal libert.y bills, when the demands of rc- turning public justice made even the sincere gcn- tlcman from Illinois [Mr
LOVEJOY] recede from his ultraism—a reasonable hope of curing these evils
Again: is there not the Supreme Court, as to whose fidelity no question is raised in the South
And are these peculior wrongs remedi- less in that forum
The Governor of Kentucky has already arraigned tho recreant executive of Ohio for his delinquency under a kindred consti- tutional clause
Why may you not cxhnugt your remedics in the courts beforc you raise the ensign of revolt
If you would have public opinion cor- rcct tbc errors of thc North as to fugitives from justice and labor, already assurances come from all quarters that such remedy will bc given
Rc- publican Governors and Legislatures are begin- ning to rccedo from their aggressive
acts
Already Ohio has begun this of redress
'l'hc fugitive slavc law may be the ostensible rea- son for secession, or ancillary to the real grievancc
Aside certain economic reasons, vvhich have cver impellcd South Carolina, and which I will not now consider, the real grievancc consists in the apprehension of slave insu rrcctions and abolition, under the nuspiccs of an Executive who, though not yet inaugurated, was elected on a principle of hostility to the social systcn•n of thc South
Or, to 'Tive it tbc strongest statejncnt, which I find in a pamelet, signed by the member fronk Arkan- [ r
HINDMAN,] The Republican candi- dates wcrc elected upon a platform destructive of our rirhts, branding our institutions as infåmous, decreeing the equality of the negro with oursckves and our children, and dooming us,in the end, with murderous certainty, to all thc horrors of insur- He holds: " that to rcction and servile war

I will grant the full forcc of this fcar, though not the sufficiency of this or any mere fear as a cause to justify 'I'hc Union men of the North began revolu tion
to warn against the dax.vning of this dangerous geographical mo in 1856
They repeated then, and then not in vain, the fareweH words of Washington
From every press and bustinæ which a Detuocrat could e,omrnand, this evil day was prophesied
But we were Cassandras

Tho patriotic Choate, in I onc of his weird and wondrous prophecies, in 1855, with thc pain of anxiety and föar upon his brow, put on record his delibÖratc and inextinguishable and posterity 
In this light, the ordinance of South Carolina I opposition to this geographical party
Hc re- I becomes an offense; and in case a sufficient num- I garded the contest then as the stupendous trial ber of others followed, to the bankruptcy of thc and peril of our national life
Admitting faults remainder, or the injury of any, it would bc worse south and faults north, yet turninrr to the battle In the cases of Texas and Flor- years of the Ilepublic and its baptistn of fire, he than an offense idR, Louisiana and California, for which millions shrank aghast at the moral treason of attempting graphically—to take the whole vast range of the free States, lying together, sixteen out of thirty-one, seventeen miE ulous, the strongest, the most advancing—and form them in battalion against the fewer numbers and slöwer growth and waning relative power on the ('ther side ; to bring this sectional majority under party drill and stimulus of pay and rations; to offer to it, as a party, the Government of our country; its most coveted honors ; its largest salaries ; its sweets of patronage and place ; to penetrate and fire so mighty and so compact a mass with the still more deli- cious idea that they are moving for human rights and the equality of man ; to call out their clergy t•rmn the pulpit, the library, the bed-side of the dying, the chair of the anxious inquirer, the hearth of the bereaved, to bless such a crusade ; to put in requisition every species of rhetoric and sophistry to impress on the genera} mind the sublime and impressive dogma that all men are born free and equat ; and that such a geographical part.y is a well-adapted means to that end—does this strike you as altogether in the splris of Washington and Franklin, and the premnble to the Con- stitution, and the Farewell Address
Does it strike you that if carr$ed out it will prove to be a mere summer excur- Sion to Moscow
Will there be no bivouack in the snow, no avenging winter hanginc• •on retreat; no Leipsic, no Waterloo 
Has the avenging winter indeed come! God in his mercy forbid ! That crusade failed in 1856
What a risk we ran then! It succeeded in 1860
What a perii is now upon us! What a crusade it svas which has produced it! I well remember that my own Republican competitor for this seat was quoted in the Blackwood Magazine, with Tory delight, over thc an ti-slavery tion which ho preached in this House in 1856, and which he would have ushered in with Bunker Hills, and other battle- fields of freedom
But admitting the source of this great peril to lic, as it is admitted, in Republican ascendency: still, I ask, is it remediless in the Union
Ad- mitting ali you claim of' danger to your States from tbis sectional triumph; admitting that you are right in concerting for your own protection— yct is it right, fair, or just, to rush forward, rc- gardless alike of friends and foes, to a chasm where no (Tuarantee can bc asked or offered

Why, to break up this Gov- ernment before a full hearing of the grievahces, is to be worse even than Red Republicanism ! Shalt it be said that some of our friends of the South are worse than the Red Communisis of France

Apprehension of evil! It was the argument of despotism in France in 1851
Louis Napoleon ust.d it for his bad purposes; but the French Re- publicans denounced it
Let me draw theanalogy
In article forty-five of the French Constitution, it was enacted: Le Président dc la République, est élu pour quatre ans, et n'est rééligible un intervalle de quatre années." —.annuai•rc Ilistorique, 1848, Appendic, p
43
In article onc hundred and ten, it was further enacted : Lorsque, dans Ie derniörc année

It was before the giant intellects of France were exiled by the perfidy of its ruler
Here was a country like France, with sixty years of political vicissitude, wherein every tradition and compact had been violated; and yet even there, the Constitution of the new Republic was invested with such a sanctity, that it defied the majority of the Assembly to change it
The Lafayettes, the Hugos, the Lamartines, the Af- rican Generals, Lamoricierc, Changarnier, Ca- vaignac, Bedeau, and Lcflo, struggled against this change, with an eloquence radiant with Frcnch fervor, and inspired with the genius of great deeds

They declared that the prolongation of the term of Napoleon was a crime, impious and parricidal
When it was said that Napoleon would override the Constitution with force in 1852, if not before, they answered: "Such a crisis will be revolution, arising from a viola- tiån of the fundamental compact
In that case we declare that, enveloped in the flag of France, we will do the duty which the salvation of the Republic imposes ! " On the other hand, it was urged, as it is here urged, that if the Constitution was not broken, there would be dangers more fatal
By a fore- knowledge of disaster, it was urged that the end of Napoleon 's term must be a convulsion, which the Assembly, acting on an apprehension, ought to bind in advance
To save him from perjury, a majority of tho Assembly were willing to com- mit It themselves

W iii southern statesmen look a few facts in the face,'not with that dumb gaze which deadens the will and paralyzes 'he intellect, but with that large roundabout common sense which distinguished her early statesmen
Is not Mr
Lincoln power- less for harm
Elected by about two milhon out of five million votes, he is in a minority ofa mil- lion
That minority diminishes with every hour of northern misery, want, and bankruptcy
In that million there are antagonizing elements, with- out power morally or politically
More than half of that million will show feeling of fraternity, which no partisanship can overwhelm
They witl unite with that gallant band of Democrats and Americans in the North, who have ever warned and worked against the impending catastrophe
They will stand in the next Senate and House as a bulwark against the further advancesofsection- alism
In my own State there are two hundred thousand patriots already, as a nucleus for this great party of Union and justice
These men, sir, will welcome any honorable gettlemcnt
For myself, I hnvc a preference

But wili vote eithcr, for they answer every reasonable demand with respect to the fugitive slave 12.1 w, slavery in this District, and on ot her points
In reförence to the "I'erritories, the border projet provides: Vi'hat the line 01' 36030' shali be run through all the exist- ing territory o! the United States; that ilk ali north of that line slavery shall be prohibited, and that, south Lhut tint: , neither Congress nor t.lle ' Porritnrial shall Iu•re- after pass any law abolishing, prohibiting, or in any nuan- ner intertering with African slavery, and that, when any 'L'e.rritory containincr a suflicientr population tar one inenl- ber of Congress in any area of sixty thousal.(l square Iniles, a (l itted , *hail apply tör adniission as State, i with or without slavery, as its eonstiLHtion inay determine

RICE be adopted
Nay, further, if it be the only alternative to preserve this Union, I would vote for the proposition of Mr
CRITTENDEN
Much us I dislike, this age of progress, an irrevocable law, still would write it in the Constit.ution, if thus only you can preserve that instrument
It provides fin• an irrev- ocable division of the territory
Ti'he President says of it: Thc proposition to cornprmnise, by lotting the North have exclusive cont.rol of the territory above a certain line, and giving southern institutions protection below that line, In itself, indeed, ought to receive u n iversal approbation
it in:.ty not he entirely satist-actory ; hut t.vften the alterna- tivo is between a reasollal)le concession on both sides, and the destruction of the Union, it is an unputat.ion on the pa- triotism of Congress to assert that its tnctnbcrs will hesi- tate ror a Ilitnnent." Shall this appeal for compromise bc ineffectual 
It may be a sacrifice of northern scntiment
But, sir, the conservative mcn will sacrifice much for the Union
Sacrifice and compromise are con- vertible terms
They are words of honorable import
The one gave us Calvary; the other the Constitution
Nothing worth having was ever gamed without them
Even the father compro- mised With the prodigal son, despite the Incan- ness of the elder brother

You may bear away the booty, M,'ill carry the banner! We will not quarrel, nor need we taunt each other, You may enioy the honors and patronagc of administration; to us will belong the laureled crown of the revolution, and the civic wreath of the great convention

They will be content with the tricks—and I trust allow us the honors
They will be a's harmless in office as most men are
When General WILSON talks of grinding the slave power to powder, he never intends to use the powder, only tp enjoy the power
[Laughter.] When the gentleman from Illinois [Mr
LOYEJOY] would speak to the God of battles, he is only praying to an u n known God
[Renewed laughter.] When Senator WADE, at Belfast, Maine, four years ago, proclaimed that there was no Union; that the pre- tended Union was meretricious; and when he pro- posed to drive " slavery back to her own dark dominions, and there to let her rot, and damn all who foster her," he was only illustrating that Christian sweetness of temper und fragrance of sentiment which now is offered up as incense on the only altar he knows, that of a meretricious Union, whose shew-bread he would eat and whose precious emblems he would plunder! The John Brown and Helper characteristics are convenient garments among them, to be put on to proselyte the churches and thc old women, and to be put off to placate wide-awakes and old Whigs

'Itheir success is the rcsult of passionate ap- peals
Passion soon subsides
This is the old and avowed means of the anti-s}averyparty
It began in England, as you will see by the London 'I'imes of November 3, 1832, when hired orators went over Britain, under pay of an anti-slavery prop- agandism
It was then said that George 'i'homp- son, who was sent to this country as its apostle, the very lecturer we want, because his ICC- w as turcs are addressed to the passions
We are so satisfied of thc goodness of our cause, that we do not want to consult the or judgment of If they vote for us, we do not care the people
whether their votes come through their passions " This brute appeal to the passtons suc- or not
ceeded in England, as her ruined Indies testify; .för philanthropy there is great in propor- tion to Tts distance, from its object
Rat here the sense of a brotherly people will reprehend such appcals
They see the African here in his rela- lion of servitude
They know what he becomes in the North when free
They know that it is impossi_ble to manumit him without injury irrep- arable to white and black
They will not sac- rifice this Government of thirty-one million whites to do no good to three and a half million blacks
Even many of those who oppose slavery, find in it the relation which the eagle and the lamb sustained in the air
It might have been wrong for the eagle to seize the lamb
The eagle, wklile holding it, may return to consciousness of the wrong he is doing; •but it does not follow that he should let it drop from his talons to the earth
It seems impossible for any one to view the philosophy of Republican principles, and not revolt in sober reason from its inevitable and suicidal results
Ti'here is hope that it Will be as timid in power as it is destructive in principle
Heaven will smile on such timidity
Nay, it will cease to be such, if prompted by an honest desire to establish jus- tice by the retraction of wrong
It will becomo moral cou rao•e
When Mr
Giddings writes to Mr
Ewing, that none but cowards, none but invirile minions of the slave power, like himself, are afraid of disso- lution, he begins to show the impotence ofa rage at a fracture already begun in the party he oriffin- atcd
The Republican party, it is to be hoped, under the lead of Bates, Raymond, Corwin, Ew- ing, Weed, ay, and Seward and Lincoln also, will drown the Giddings crew, even if they have to scuttle their own party ship, and cro down with it
Time, patience, fidelity to your old and tried friends, gentlemen of the South , and all will be well! Let us exhaust every effort at an accom- modation
Protest if you will; secede in your harmless way if you are so impelled; but do not make an aggression upon the laws of the Union until in a last resort, when your northern friends can sustain you and history wili justify you

They never can, while spotted with moral treason and guilty of deliberate nullification, make Ohio Dem- ocrats the tools of their vengeance, never—never ! When they denounce the mad precipitancy of the South, let them remove its cause! I know and ponder what I say
You will have justice if you will have patience and pcr.mit reconciliation; and if you do not get it then, after & fair trial, you will have immunity from northern attack
Whatever the legal powers of the Federal Gov- ernmen tmay bc ,thcy derive al I their efficiency from the popular will
The Constitution (Fives the Gov- ernment force to execute the law; but it is a force, after all, which resides in the people, and which they will withhold in an unjust cause

Abolitionists themselves would shrink back ill disfnay and horror at the contempla- ti6n of desolated fields, conflagrated cities, murdered in- habitants, and the overthrow of the fairest fabric of human government that ever rose to animate the
hopes of civilized znan
Nor should the Abolitionists flatter themselves that, if they can succeed in their object of uniting the people of the free States, they will enter the contest with numerical superiority that must insure victory
All history and ex- periencc proves the hazard and uncertainty of war
Alld we are admonished by Holy Writ that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strona
But if they were to conquer, whom would they conquer 
A foreign löe—one who had insulted our flag, invaded our shores, and laid our country waste
No, sir; no
It would be a conquest without laurels, without glory—a self, a sui- cidal conquest—a conquest of brothers over brothers, achieved by one over another portion of the descendants -of common ancestors, who nobly pledging their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, ha(l taught and bled, side by side, in many ah hard battle on land and occan, severed our country from tttc British Crown, and established our national independence." Such a war is the almost unavoidable result of a dissolution of this Confederacy
Mr
Madison (No
61, Federalist) urged as a reason for the Union , that it destroyed every pretext for a mili- tar y establishment; " but its dissolution,' said he, will be the date of a new order of things
Fear and ambition would make America copy Europe, and present liberty everywhere crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes
He augured for a disunited America a worse con- dition than that of Europe
Would it not be so
Small States and great States; new States and old States; slave States and free States; •Atlantic States and Pacific States; gold and silver States; iron and copper States; grain States and lumber Statcs; river States and lake Statés; all having varied interests and advantages, would seek supe- riority in armed strength
Pride, animosity, and glory, would inspire every movement
God shield our country from such a fulfillment of the proph- esy of the revered founders of the Union
Our struggle would be no short, sharp struggle
Law, and even religion herself, would become false to their divine purpose
Their voice would no longer be the voice of God, but of his enemy
Poverty, i&norance, oppression, and its hand- maid, cowardice, breaking out into merciless cru- elty; slaves false; freemen slaves, and society itself poisoned at the cradle and dishonored at the grave—its life, now so fuli of blessings, would be gone with the life ofa fraternal and united State- hood
What sacrifice is too great to prevent I such a calamity
Is such a picture overdrawn 
Already its outlines appear
What means the inaucural of Governor Pickens, when he says, " from the position we may occupy towards the northern States, as well as from our own internal structure of society, the government may, from necessity, becovne strongly military in its organiza- tion MT hat means the minule-men of Governor Wise
What the southern boast that they have a rifle or shot-gun to each family
What means the Pittéburg mob
What this alacrity toaave Forts Moultrie and Pinckney 
What means the boast of the southern men of being the best armed people in the world, not counting the two hun- dred thousand stand of United States arms stored in southern arsenals
Already Georgia has her arsenals, with eighty thousand muskets! What mean these lavish grants of money by southern Legislatures to buy more arms
What mean these rumors of arms and force on the Missis- sippi
These few facts have already verified the prophesy of Madison as to a disunited Republic
Mr
Speaker, he alone is just to his country; he alone has a mind unwarped by section, and a memory unparalyzed by fear, who warns against precipitancy
He who could hurry this nation to the rash wager of battle, is not fit to hold the seat of legislation
What can justify the breaking up of our institutions into belligerent fractions
Better this marble Capitol were leveled to the dust; better wore this Congress struck dead in its deliberations; better an immolation of every am- bition and passion which here have met to shake the foundations of society, than the hazar(l of these consequences! As yet, I do not believe that the defensive conduct of the Executive involves these consequences
Nay, I hope that firmness in resisting aggression, with the, kindness which he has endeavored to show, may do much to avert them
Certainly weakness and indecision now will not avail to check the rising tide of public sentiment, and pre- serve the public peace
I a ree with much that my friends from Illi- nois, Mr
MCCLERNAND,] New York, [Mr.'SxcK- LES,] and Ohio, [Mr
VALLANDIGHAM,] have said as to the interests, dignity,and rights of their own sections
I will not now go into any calculation or contemplation about the results of u dissever- ance of this Union
Long may it be averted—that picture
of Ohio, as the narrow isthmus betwccn a broken East and a divided West, with a hostile southern border! Long may it be averted—that sad picture of New York, a great free emporium, trading to all the world, and closed agamst the interchange of her own inland ! We have gloom enough without these new schemes of division
I invoke the
better spirit
of him who never spake so truly prophetic as a statesman, as when he combined in his speaking thc great truths ofa com- prehensive political economy—as when Wash- Ington said: In contcmplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as a matter of scrious concern that any ground should havc been furnished for characteri%ing par- ties by geographical discriminations, northern and south- ern, Atlantic and western, whence designing men may en- deavor to incite a belief that there is a real difiiffence of local interests and views
You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heart-burnings which spring from these misrepresentations
They tend to ren- der alien to each other those who ought to be bound to- gether by fraternal affection." In these days of anticipated trouble, when finan- Cial disaster tracks the step of political infidelity; when the violation of compact is followed close by the intemperate zealotry of revolution; when even the property of our Union is seized, and our flag is torn down under its impulses; when, as if premonitory of some great sacrifice, the vail of our political temple seems rent, and the earth about usquakcs, and the very graves give up their , dead, who come forth to warn, beseech, advise, and moderate—in this hour of our country 's deepest gloom and peril, let us heed with an all- embracing and all-compromising patriotism, the warning of Washington, whose voice, though he be dead, yet speaketh from yonder tomb at Mount Vernon, and whose august presence would summon here as the PRESERVER of that country whosegreatest pride it is to hail him as its FATHER ! In his sacred name, and on behalf of a people who have ever heeded his warnings, and never wavered in the just defense of the South as of the North, I appeal to southern men who contem- plate a step so fraught with hazard and strife, to pause
Clouds are about us! There is lightning In their frown! Cannot we direct it harmlessly to the earth
The morning prayer
of the people I speak for in such
weakness nsee in strength to that Supreme Ruler- who, ing the fall of a sparrow, cannot! disregard the-fall of a nation, that our States may continue
M)' beZ as they have been—one; one in the unreserve of u mingled national being; one as the though' of God is one! [Here Mr
Cox's hour expired; but, by unan• imous consent Of the House, he was allowed to go on and conclude his remarks.] These emblems above us, in their canopy of beauty, each displaying the symbol- of State ins terest, State pride, and State sovereignty, let not onc of them be dimmed by the rude breath of passion, ofeffaced by the ruder stioke of enmity, They all shine, like stars differing in glory, In their many-hued splendors, by the light of the same orb, even as our States receive their luster from the Union, which irradiates and glorifies each and all
Our aspirations and hopes- center in the proud title of American citizen
Whether we hail from the land of granite or the everglade of flöwers; from the teeming bosom of the West, the sea- • washed shore of the East, or the gold-bedring sierras of the Pacific slope—all are Imbound by the same rigol of American patriotism
Abroad, at horne, in palace or in cabin, in ship or on laud, we rejoice in that proud distinction of American citizen
We look upon our nationality as the actual of that ideal described by Edmund Burke in a strain of finished eloquence and sublimest philosophy—as something better than a partner- ship in a trade, to be taken up for a temporary interest and dissolved at the fancy of the parties
We look upon it with other reverence, because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to a gross animal existence of perishable nature
It is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a partnership in cvery virtue and in all perfection
As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it be- comes a partnership not only between those who arc living; but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born
Each contract of each State is but a clause in the great primeval contract of ETERNAL SOCIETY, link- mg the lower •.vith the higher natures, connecting the visible with the invisible world, according to a fixed compact, sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical, all moral natures, each in their appointed place
Thus, regarding our NATIONALITY as more than a life, as the association of many lives in one, as an immortality rather than a life, the people of this country will cling to it with a tenacity of pur- pose and an energy of will, as to the very cross of their temporal salvation, and revere it as the im- personation of their sovereign upon earth, whose throne is this goodly land, and whose mighty minstrelsy, ever playing before it, is the voice of an intelligent, happy, and free people !

STATE OF THE UNION
Mr
BAYARD
Mr
President, 1 desire to present the memorial of one hundred and twenty- five citizens of Wilmir;gton, in the State of Dela- ware, without distinction of party , earnestly pray- ing the Senate to pass the resolu tions introduced by the honorable Senator from Kentucky, [Mr
CRIT- TENDEN,I orresolutions embodying the same prin- ciples, and expressing the belief that our constitu- ents throughout the country will sanction these proposals, and that they will have the effect of allaying the present unhappy excitement
Mr
President, I have no remarks now to make in reference to those resolutions, except to express my concurrence with them, and my regret that they could not have been voted upon at an earlier day
I fear they come now too late; but as they would tend to allay excitement, and I hope suc- ccssfully tend to that result, as they would tend to the prevention of a dissolution of the Union, or, if dissolved, to its restoration; as they are specific in their character and moderate in the extent of what they require—embodying, in my judgrncnt, no more than the public sentiment of the 'slaveholding States will demand, and the least that it will demand, I shall necessarily votc for the resolutions
f hn.ve forborne to take any part in the debate on the various questions in relation to the present state of the country, which has occurred in the Senate up to this time, bccause I did not believe that it would be possible here for us to do anything which would be calculated to eilher preserve or restore the Union
But, sir, we can vote; and I do hope that, before this day passes, at least we shall have some indication of the determination of the Senate, and see whether tbc principles embodied in the resolutions of the Senator frorn Kentucky will command the vote ofa portion, if not ofa majority, of the Republi- can members of this body-
It is right that the people of the country should know something, at least, as specific as is embodied in those resolu- tions—something more specific than that which fell from' the honorable Senator from New York, [M.r
SEWARD.] Sir, shall take occasion to trespass upon the indulgence of' the Senate next week for the pur• pose of expressing at large my views on the present distracted and unhappy condition of the country; and also on the only remedies which I suppose exist for the purpose of preventing what is now imminent—a civil war between the dif- ferent sections of the country
'The exact day I cannot at present indicate; but certainly some day during the next week, when shall hope to interfere with no other gentleman who may 1 have nothing to say now; I desire to speak
resolutions, except to express my opinion of the mode.ration of the demand, and of the necessity of some specific action by Congress as indicating the extent to which the opposmg party mean to go—indefinite propositions will not ansurcr—and to express further my hope .thut we can vote on these propositions; for, after all, debate only leads  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

vote; and then, when we know by that vote what the result must be, it will be time enough to dis- cuss what course will have to be taken dependent upon such a result
The memorial was ordered to lie on the table
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
Mr
SEWARD
I present the memorial of Samuel F
B
Morse, the distinguished and illus- trious inventor of the electro-magnetic telegraph, praying Congress for the extension of one of the two patents which constitute the titlc he holds for his property in that great invention
These two patents will expire at different times
He asks an extension of the one that expires carliest, to the dale when the latest one will expire, in order that he may protect that property more perfectly than he would be able to do otherwise
The extension which he asks of the one patent is five years and three months
I move the reference of the memo- rial to the Committee on Patents and the Patent Offce
It was so referrcd

STATE OF Tllß UNION
Mr
POWELL
1 ask leave to present the pro- ceedings of the union Democratic State conven- tion of' Kentucky, held al Louisville, on the 8th of January, recommending the adoption of the I move resolutions proposed by rny colleague
that they lie on the table
Mr
HALE
I have not the slightest objection, myself, to the reception of those proceedings
I do not, know the character of them; but questions of this sort have been before the Senate several times before, and, if i am not mistaken, the uni- form practice of the Scnate has been, not to re- ceive reports or proceedings of meetings of this sort, unless they were expressly directed to the Senate
The question has been raised here a great many times, and I think that has been the uni- form action of the Sengtc, and, in my judgment, we had better adherc to it
The VICE PRESIDENT
Does thc Senator raise objection to the reception ofthe proceedings
HALE
Yes, sir
The VICE PRESIDENT
The question will be submitted to the Senate
Mr
HALE
Then let mc state my objection distinctly
I do not know anything about the I do not mean any discourtesy to resolutions
the resolutions, or to the meeting, or to the Senator who presented them; but I want to pre- serve the uniforrn practice of the Senate which, as I havc understood it, ever since I have had the honor of being a member of the body, has been, not to reccive reports of rneetings of this character, unless they were expressly directed to the Senate, or to Congress
Mr
POWELL
These resolutions express devotion and attachment to the Union; they pro- tcst against coercion; they recommend the adop- tion of the resolutions proposed as amendments to the Constitution by my colleague; and re- ceived a letter from the secrctary of the meeting requesting me to present them to the Senate for I do not think there will be its consideration
any impropriety in receiving the resolutions, and I hope it will allowing them to lie on the table
be done
The VICE PRESIDENT
Will the Senate I receive, the resolutions,offered by thcSenat01' from Kentucky 
Mr
PÖWELL
I look upon them as being ad- dressed to the Senate
I received an official letter from the offcers of the meeting requesting me to schooner Augusta to Colonel Cook, to report it back without amendment, and recommend its passage; and I ask the consent of the Senate to pass the bill now
It is merely to change the i i It, will not occupy a moment

Mr
CRITTENDEN
By urging lutions as the business for to-day, I did not;prö-
pose myself to address the Senate on the subjects I wish to save the time of the Senate as much as possible
I intended, if I might bc allowed to do so, to •close any debate that might arise on the resolutions; and I yield the floor therefore to any gentleman who desires to discuss them
Mr
CLARK
I gave notice the other day that I would move to amend the resolutions.- I now move to do so, by striking out all after the pre- amble and the word " resolved," in the first res- olutäon, and inserting the following: That the provisions of the Constitution are ample for the preservation of the Union, and '-the protection of
'til the material intercsts of tbe country ; that it needs to be obeyed rather than amendcd ; and that an extrication nom our present dangers is to be looked for in strenuous-efforts to preserve

Resolved, That all attempts to dissolve the present Union, or overthrow abandon the, present Constitution, with the hopc or expectation of constructing a new one, are dangcr- ons, illusory, and destructive; that, in the opinion of the Senate of the United States, no such reconstruction is practicable ; and, therefore, to the maintenance of the ex- isting Union and Constitution should be directed all the energies of all the departments ot• the Government, and the efforts of all good citizens
Mr
GREEN
With apart ofthatamendment I coincide, and with the remainder of it I totally disagree
Taking it as it comes, as a substitute, I shall vote against it, and will very briefly eive the reasons why
That the present Constitution, in its provisions, is good enough for thc whole Union, I think cvcry one will readily-admit; and to that extent, I coincide with the Senator from New Hampshire
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
F00T in the chair.) The Chair will state, for the inform- ation of thc Senate; with reference to the order of business and the particular question before the Senate, that inasmuch as the resolutions offered by the Senator from New Hampshire are pro- posed as a substitute for the original rcsolutions, both the original resolutions and the substitute are open to perfection by way of amendment or mod- ificati_on, before the quéstion shall be taken upon substitution
There is an amendment pending to the original resolutions, which will be read
Mr
GREEN
It is not necessary to read it I understand the question before thc Senate per- fectly; and I have a right to speak to any!hing pending before the Senate
The original resolu- tion can be perfected, and then the substitute can be perfected, and then the vote taken as to the choice between them; but whatever matter is law- fully pending before the Senate, I have a right to speak to
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair hopes the Senator from Missouri did not under- stand the Chair as intimating that he was not in perfect order
The Chair only thought it proper to state the precise question as it stands before the Senate; and that when vote comes to bc taken, the first question must be on the amendment proposed to the original resolutions, before the question on subst.itution can be taken
Mr
GREEN
was just remarking that I coff- sidered the present Constitution of the United States good enough, amplc in all its provisions, if enforced and adhered to in good faith; and if there is a spirit in the people, north or south, in the center or in the circumference—fixed, determ- to observe the present Con- stitution, a thousand amendments will not make i shall vote for the proposition it more effective
of the Senator from Kentucky, not because I have any faith in good results, save one bare possibil- ity; and that IS, to hold the people still long enough for them to reflect, and see whether there can be a reaction in public sentiment; for, if there can be no reaction in public sentiment, all his amend- ments will not be worth a straw
Ours is a peculiar Government
It has n0t'that strontr military arm to enforce the Constitution which the Governrnont of hås
It rests upon the consent and the good feeling of the peo- ple; and when that consent is withdrawn, and that good feeling is destroyed , a thousand constitutional provisions will tmount to n0thing whatever; and  380 it is useless for us to talk about doing anything except this: hold the country still long enough to If what is now considered let the people reflect
to be the prevailing spirit of the North, in Its de- clared hostility to the South, is to be permanent and enduring, we bad better separate this day in peace
If it is not permanent and enduring, then the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky comes in well as a means to check action long enough to give time for that reaction in the senti- ment of the North
We are reduced to that ex- tremity
The proposition that a State shall pay for a runaway slave, if rescued by mob, is very good; but suppose the State refuses: then what
Sue and get judgment: then '•vhat
You take ex- ecution
QI) Nhat do you levy
You never can collect it
without the consent of the State; and if that consent is withdrawn, and the disposition to adhere to the principles of the Constitution is de- stroyed, it will never be effective; and so with all the other provisions, every one of them
Yl'here is, therefore, but one single possible benefit that can in any degree result from any of these prop- ositions; and that is, we may hold the country still long enough to give the people an opportu- nity to reflect
It is useless to discuss the latter branch of the proposition of the Senator from New Hampshire, denying the right ofa State to secede
I hold that the States have the right; but it is useless to dis- cuss it; and all of the opposition to it seems to have grown out of a misconception of the real character of our féderative Government
This is not a Government as a unit
As was well ex- pressed by one of the greatest
statesmen that this country has ever produced, or I fear ever will produce, it is not a unit, but it is a multitude of units
Ench State is u unit, and the whole Union is a multiplication of units
Wherever there is a single concentrated unit as a Government, no brunch of that unit can fly off at a tangent, and if it undertakes to do so, It is rebellion; and the whole of the misconception growing out of this question results fram the fact of not considering the character of this united Government
Each State is an entirety; each State is a unit
Then therc is an association of these entireties and these unities, forming what we call the United Stat,es of A merica
An individual cannot secede from a State or from the Federal Government, because he has not that unity of sovereignty; a county cannot secede from a State or from the Federal Government, because it has not that unity of sov- ereignty; but wherever you find that unity of sovereignty, and it came in by consent, it can go out by consent
And here r wish to make one other explanation
The original thirteen States first formed the Constitution and formed the Union
It has been specially provided, whenever any other additional State has come into the Union, that it should come un on an equal footing with the ori&inal thirteen
If, therefore, we can under- stand tile status of the thirteen, we understand the exact posiLi01') of the whole, for they are all alike
Now, you will observe there is no agreement be- tween South Carolina and thc Uni6n
The did not exist; but South Carolina and others made the Union, and there is no agreement between it and the Union
As was well expressed by Mr
Webster, it is not a compact between a State and the Federal Government, because all the States made the Federal Government, and they could not make an agreement and create a compact with a thing that had no existence
What, then, is it
Certain propositions are presented to the several States; each one exercises its own volition in coming in or staying out
Itcomes in
By whose action
Not the action of the Federal Govern- ment, for it did not exist; not the action of the other States, because each acted for itself
How, then, does it go out
It goes out just as it came in, on its own volition
Perhaps it will be said it is a violation of good faith
Well, cases might arise in which it would be a violation of good faith
There are many cases in which a State withdrawing from a confederation of States would violate good faith; but where is the tribunal to pass sentence upon them, and where is the power to enforce an execution against them
Thé only tribunal is the enlightened judgmentof mankind; the only power of execution is the frowns of the community in the United States and in the world; that is all
There is no military power that can punish a CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, State for doing what she oucrht not to have done if she had the power to do It
The right must In other not be confounded with the principle
words, a State havino come in in good faith—-no wrong having been done, perfect concord and perfect harmony prevailing—if she goes out she does wrong
The degree of injury that will jus- tify her before the enlightened judgment of the world is a question for her to consider
She must take the responsibility of determining a question like that
She formed no agreement with the Union; she formed no agreement with any State; but when a plan of organization was presented, arid the opportunity was given to all to come in on their own volition, she came in; and she can go out on the samc volition with which she came mto the Union
If States go out without justi- fiable cause, they will be condemned by the judg- ment of the world; but even if condemned in a case like that, that is the only punishment
There is no power in the Federal Government to pun- ish them
There is no power in a sister State to punish them
They are a sovereign unity
This association of thirty-three States which existed a fex..v months ago (twenty-nine, I believe, still remain) is not one associated mass constitutina a unity, but it is a collection of units; twenty-nine If individuals, while a State is remaining yet
in the Union, violate the law, they are amenable to the law, and ought to be punished under the law
If a State secedes, in the exercise of that sovereign powcr which she never transferred, there is no power to punish a State; it is a State act.ion, and not individual action
Now, Mr
President, it has been so clearly and so fully illustrated by the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
Pucu,] that I deem it unnecessary to en14rge that in whether upon this point, to wit: a State may have the power to secede or not, we are not to see whether that power is expressly reserved in the Constitution, but to see whether that original power has ever been transförred and convoyéd away
It certainly was an original power pertaining to the sovereignty of that unity
Phat original power pertaining to that unity is not to be found as having been transferred in the Constitution by any law; and if Riot, it exists
[ do not deem it neces- But one point further
sary, indeed I think it entirely unnecessary, to go Into the subject as to whcther the North has oppressed the 'South; as to whether they have afforded asylums for fugitive slaves; as to whether they have passed personal liberty bills; for these are small.and unimportant matters, compared with the additional fact that by means of societies formcd in the North, not known to the law, not recocrnized by the State governments in which they exist, hundreds and thousands, nine tenths of all the fugitive slaves are spirited away, con- veyed in secrecy, locked up in the mail car of the railroad, not seen by the public, and are never returned
Now those personal liberty bills are only in vogue, and your habeas corpus actis only called in requisition, when one has been arrested
Nine tenths of those that escape are never arrested ; and the reason they are not arrested is, you can- not cnforce the law; and you cannot eniÖrce the law because the state of public sentiment is such as to forbid it
That brings me back to the point where I commenced
You may pass bills of pains and penalties; you may pass amendments to the Constitution; you may pass all that is suggested by the honorable Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from Pennsylvania, [Mr
BIGLER,] and the Senator fronl Illinois, [Mr
DOUGLAS,] and it all amounts to nothing at last, unless you can get a public sentiment there, capable of enforcing and protecting your rights, as guarantied by these It is true, there is one other several provisions
last resort, and that is physical power; and if there comes a separation between these sections— an unfortunate one, but one x,vhich now seems to be a fixed fact—physical power will then be brought into requisiblon
Each will be jealous of the other; each will be determined to protect its own rights as far as possible; and each will hold itself in readiness to do so; and hence, from the line of Marvland to the line of Kansas, you will see military preparation on both sides
Yet, let it be remembered, no invasion has ever been made from theSouth on the North, nor will there ever be in the future, unless it be to retaliate fora previous invasion from the other side
Pcace is the motto of the South; constitutional rightis the plea of the South; and if we get these we shall be content
The present Constitution, as the honorable Sena- tor from New' Hampshire said, is good enough if itcan be carried out; and I therefore think, to some extent, with him, that we had better be devising ways and means to carry out the existing Con- stitution, than to be patching up amendments which, if the present state of public opinion con- cinues, will amount exactly to nothing
That is the view that I have taken of this sub- It strikes me as palpable
There is an ject
uneasiness in the public mind now, in regard to the danger ofa war between sections of this Union ; there is serious apprehension entertained; and if we possibly could quiet that, it would be good to that extent
Laying propositions, by consent of Congress, before the people to take their sense nt the ballot-box, might have a tendency to quiet that apprehension, and hence migh t do some good by delaying action long enough to let the people I know well that it is as utterly impossi- reflect
ble to live in peace with the present state of pub- lic sentiment, as it would be with the Navajoe Indians; not because they are not civilized, but because they are influenced by a degree of fanat- icism that cannot be checked
And those who have raised the storm are unable to control it; for I remember having read once, I think from Moore, these words: Fanatic faith once wedded fast To some fhlse object, hugs it
to the last." And I have no hope until we can check them up, and make them see the consequences likely to I ',vould insult no Senator in this body; ensue
aud yet have been unable to brin'F out a single response from a single Senator on the other side that he would discharge his bounden duty, under the Constitution and the law, to assist in enforc- ing the fugitive slave act
This is a reflex of the sentiment of the people at home-
These are rep- resentative men
These control, guide, and cre- ate the sentiment at home
While this is the case, what have we to hope for
While this is to be continued, what instrumentality has been invoked to change the sentiment of the North
None in this body; none in the pulpit; none in the school- room; none in the nursery-room; none in tract circulating
What, then, is to effect that change
Without that change, I tell you this moment and this hour, I am for immediate secession, whether I am wilting to give you an my State is or not
opportunity to effect that change
I am sorry to separate from some noble spirits who have clus- tered around and sustained us in days and years past; but still, my friends, you must bear With us when self-preservation prompts us to the deed
Not a single instrumentality has been brought to bear to effect that change; not a speech has been made in this body by any of those gentlemen calcu- lated to operate on the northern mind, and say to them, " you have done wrong; you must retrace your steps; and you must observe the existing, present Constitution." Without some of these Instrumentalities, do you think it will possibly take place
It is utterly impossible
This isa forlorn hope; and yet, if you think giving a few days' time to reflectupon this matter will have the effect, I will do it; but if it will not have that effect, it is a work of folly
It is prompted by a noble It has been introduced from the highest spirit
feelings of patriotism
I commend the spirit of the man that moved it, and the motive that in- fluenced him; but have very little confidence, and I have that little confidence for the simple reason I have stated
Now, what is to be done
To make inflamma- tory speeches here to go abroad over the land, one side in favor of the Sou th, and the other holding up the hands of the North, sayino•, stand firm, and while you are too weak to pray, we will hold your hands towards Heaven ' '—is that to be the spirit that will actuate us here
And if it is, what good can result from it
I have believed for some time, and I now give utterance to that belief, that the only possible hope is to separate in peace and let the States interchange propositions for a reunion
All will not come back, and a portion of them I hope never will, if they entertain their present sentiments; but the glorious Northwest, and the center here, I hope, with the South, will cluster together once more under bonds stron" as steel, insuring prosnerity and happiness and strength never equaled'on the face of the globe
Can it not be done

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
38t The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
FOOT.) The Senator from Missouri will suspend his re- marks
The Senate assigned as a special order for one o'clock this day, the Pacific railroad bill; and the Chair is required, under the rules of the Senate, to eall that up for consideration ; and under the rules of the Senate, it takes precedence of and supersedes all other business; but it is open to postponement or such disposition as a majority of the Senate shall see fit to make
The Pacific railroad bill is now the subjeCt before the Senate
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 move to postpone that special order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Kentucky moves to postpone the consider- ation of thc Pacific railroad bill
Mr
GWIN
I should not like
to interrupt the Senator from Missouri in the midst of a speech
Mr
GREEN
I have no speech to make at all
It is merely talking on this proposition
Mr
G WIN
Very well; then I hope the Pacific railroad bill will not be postponed
Mr
SUMNER called for the yeas and nays
The yeas and nays were ordered; and being taken, resulted—yeas 21, nays 27; as follows: YEAS—Messrs

RAILROAD TO THE PACIFIC
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the consideration of the bill (H R
No
701) to secure contracts, and make provision for the safe, certain, and morc speedy transportation, by railroad, of mails, troops, munitions of war, military and naval stores, between the Atlantic States and thosc of the Pacific, and for other pur- poses
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The pending amendment will be read
It recurs to the Chair, however, that the
motion pending at the adjourn- ment upon this bill was the motion of the Sen- ator from Minnesota, [Mr
RICE,] to postpone the bill indefinitely; and that motion takes prece- dence of ail others now pending
Mr
LATHAM
The yens and nays were called on that motion ; and that was pending when the Senate adjourned
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- derstands that the yeas and nays were ordered upon that motion
Mr
LATHAM
Yes, sir
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question, then, is on the indefinite postponement of the bill, and otbtlaat question the yeas and nays have been ordered
The question being taken by yeas and nays, resulted—yeas 12, nays 38; as follows: Bragg, Clinginan, YEAS—Messrs

So the Senate refused to postpone the bill in- definitely
Mr
RICE
I believe the next question is on the motion of my colleague to commit the bill to a select committee
Mr
President, when I was up the other day, I said that 1 had no objections to make to the details of the bill
I meant that I had no remarks then to make upon the details
As it seems to be the determination of the Senate to act upon the bill now, either to go on and pass it, or to commit it, 1 take this occasion to say that i am in favor of committing it to a special committee, as proposed by In y colleague
On examination of the bill, I find that there are many defects in it, some of' which I think the friends of the bili themselves would like to cor- rect
Some have been alluded to
I shall only allude to one or two others
The bill proposes to give the odd sections of the land upon the route, one mile in width on each side, to the company
The road will pass thrOugh a very large extent of i Indian country, in which the title to the land has not been extinguished
It will pass through the Pike 's Peak settlement ; and should it pass through the center of that settlement, it will deprive thou- sands of the pioneers there of their homes
true, the bill says unoccupied lands*' but ac- cording to the laws, no land within the Indian country can be lawfUlly occupied; hence that pro- vision amounts to nothing
In its present shape it will deprive tl)ousands of honest settlers, who have made roads and have built up an empire of their own in the wilderness, after all the hardship and suffering they have endured, of every thing they have
I think an amendment should be made in regard to that
I am sure the friends of the bill must have overlooked that very important point
I dislike, also, another provision in this bill, which says that the rails and all the iron work shall be of American manufacture
That is noth- ing but the protective tariff
I think the tariff question is of such vital importance that it should be brought before the Senate by itself, nnd not be thus mixed up with provisions ofa bill like this
There is another slight omission, I think, in the bill
It says the rails shall " be of good quality and size." Now, who is to judge of the quality and size
Why, sn•, you cannot find a State in the Union that will charter a railroad without specifying the size of the rails and the number of ounds to the yard; but here, while you are throwing away $100,000,000, you are leaving it to a few irresponsible men to say how mucl') the rails shall weigh to the yard, and of what quality they shall be
Nor is there anything said here in regard to the gauge of the road
There is not, probably, a road within the limits of the United States, the gaugc of which is not specified in its charter
Here is another clause that st.rikes rne as n little singular
Itisin the third section
It provides that the roads shall carry " all the mails, troops, sea- men, Government stores," &c
"until the whole amount of money and accruing interest advanced by the United States to said corporation or cor- porators shall be rein-iburscd by services so ren- dered." These $100,000,000 of bonds to be issued must be redeemed by the United States in thirty years; the United States must provide the in- terest; and yet the corporation or corporators have until the angel Gabriel shall blow his hom to refund the money to the United States, if they please
No time is specified
There is nothing billding upon them whatever
They can take a thousand years if they like, provi(led we cannot get it out in service
'Why, sir, we all know that the service the road will render will not pay the interest upon the bonds
The bill provides that, for a certain distance, $12,000 a mile shall be paid, and then goes on increasing the amount to be paid per mile until it reaches the enormous sum of $46,000
Why, Mr
President, a railroad can be constructed and put into operation fronh the head of Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains These corporators are to receive from twelve to forty-six thousand dollars a mile for just so much of the road as they see fit to build
They can commence on the east and build it to the mountains, over a country that needs little or no grading a.nd no heavy bridging; and when they get to the mount- ains they can stop, put the money in their pock- ets, and say they have concluded not to build the road any further
They can likewise commence on the west and run to the Inountains, and receive from twelve to forty-six thousand dollars a mile; and when they come to where the work will be costly they can throm.v it up
There is not word, not a clause in the
bill to bind them to do any- thing whatever
They get everything and grant nothing
I do think that Senators should con- sider well a measure of so much importance; and even the friends of the two routes should weigh the provisions of the bill well before casting their votes
I-lere is another clause which is very modestly put in a little proviso: Provided, That in like bonds shall be added to the gross surn for every yeaPs reduction of the time of completing the work, payable as the bonds before named." By other provisions of the bill they have fifteen years in which to complete the road
We all know that this road, if it is to be worth anything to the corporators, if it is ever to pay anything, must be completed within eight or ten years; be- cause, until the, road- shall- be finished;, it will; be comparatively of little value; and'; if; it -takes' fifteen years to complete it, the portioh5 first menced will have rotted and become w,örthlesstbv that time
If it be built at probably complete it in seven or eight years; thus adding the modest little sum of fourteen or fifteen million more to the enormous sum already pr0- vided for the road
Mr
BRAGG
That applies to both roads; for all the provisions as to the one are extended to the other
Mr
RICE
Yes, sir; and therefore, this little proviso would - make only a small difference Of twenty-eight or thirty million dollars to the Unia ted States
Sir, any business man must see, from tho very face of the bill, that it is most crudely and imperfectly drawn.- What should first be done is to extinguish the Indian title, survey the lands, and offer facilities to the emigrant to go and settle on the line of the road, in order to protect it when itshull be built
Suppose the Indians refuse to sell-the lands; suppose the road should be extended: into their country, which would be- eontrary to law: what would be the result
Or suppose the road were built, and we should have a 'War With the Indians: what then
Why, sir, halfa dozen women could pull up the rails for a sumcient dis• tance to prevent the cars from running over} and after they had passed over one section, they could go back and pull them up behind
What relief would you have against this
There, perhaps, would be your troops without provisions, with- out supplies, and without any means of getting them, and starvation must inevitably be the result
I do not know that it is necessary, or that it would be of any sort of use, to point out any other defects in the bill
The manner in which it was forced through the House of Representatives, the votes which have been taken here, and the haste which has attended the whole thing, show it to bc a foregone conclusion
on this side—that is, the opponents of the bill— have so many of them left us, that we are in fact thrown into the camp of the enemy
Whether these few remarks will have any effect or not, 1 do not know; but if this bill shall become a law, but a few years will elapse before they will be referred to by thinking men
Mr
G WIN
Mr
President, I wish briefly to give my reasons for urging the passage of the House bill, without amendment, and to answer some of the objections that have been urged by Senators against it
The amendment of the Senator from Missouri, which was adopted, seemed rather a small one for which to jeopardize so important a bill
Mis- souri gets, under the bill as it is, say—by way of numerical but thinks she" ought to have $1,000,010: ought she to jeopard- ize the order to get these ten, espe- cially When the terminus may be made in- the bill further north, if Missouri gives it no support
The objection to •the bill urged by the Senator from Missouri, [Mr
GREEN,] that It does not se- cure proper connections with other -roads, is an
swered by the fact that
charters have to be granted by the States and Territories through which the road will have to pass, andGt cannot be doubted that proper provisions to this end will be made in these laws
The objections of like general character to the omissions of other details in the bill I-nuy be an- swered in the same way
This bili merely states whatythe United States are willing to do, leaving details to the States and Territories, that must look to them all
The principal objection seems to be to the nam- ing of fifty-three persons, and their associates, as the beneficiaries
Such bills are very usual in the States
'I'here are two general classes of acts of incorporation
One names persons, as com• missioners or trustees, to open books of subscrip- tion, and to superintend the organization of the I companies
The other class, like this bill, names certain persons, and their associates, (which means the persons named, and such others as the ma- jority may invite to join them,) as the corporae tors
Hundreds of such acts of incorporatiön Of the latter class, by the States, can easily be pro- duced
I have in my hand a list of one-hundred and twelve of such acts, and I could run' it up to a thousand
They are not much -less numerous than the other class
 382 The names inserted by the committee of the House of Representatives in this bill, were se- lected from hundreds suggested, withoutsas I am informedfil single one of them seeking the posi- tion, or desiring it, or even knowing their names were to be so used
Others may have been in- serted after the bill was reported, from
personal application, knowing their names rvere to be so used
The active friends of this great public work WOUHI not care if every name were erased, and other good names substituted, if it did not unne- cessarily jeopardize the bill
These names were selected because the persons were all supposed to be of high character, great energy, and ample means, and therefore could induce other capi- talists and men of energy to contribute suffcient capital; enterprise, and business talent, to accom- plish this, the greatest single work of any age
These corporators are, in fact, only commis- sioncrs, and will, no doubt, be so considered by the Legislatures of the States and Territories in giving them acts of incorporation
If such cor- porators could not secure the, great object, it could not be done by openingbooks to advehturous sub- scribers, from whom collections, after the first small installment, might not be made; and who would, be clogs to thc enterprise
The object is It was correctly stat.ed In this to build the roads
debate, that the southern road is intrusted, by this bill, to a vast number of persons all over the South, and could be given to no others, as they now 'have the charters for eight hundred miles of the route through Texas
To the northern road, the bonds of the United States, for every section of fifty miles, as it shall be finished, are to be lent; the return to be secured by the first mort- gage on thc wholc road; the bonds not to exceed sixty million
So far from the objectof the bill being to enrich a few l.)ersons, many contend the road cannot be madefor much more than double the credits loaned by the United States; and some think—although I am not one of them—it cannot be made at all; in which event all the private subscriptions of the stockholders would be totally lost, as thc mort- guge to the United States would have to bc first fully satisfied
If, under such conflicting opin- iops, the corporators should bc rewarded for tho vast capital raised and hazarded in the great ad- venture, who ought to regret such a result, when their success presupposes the completc accom- plishmentof the undertaking—worth, politically, many times the cost—presupposes the return to the United States of her credits to the uttermost farthing; and, in fact, that the great work will have been madc by tbc capital, enterprise, and business talent of the corporntors themselves, aided ternporarily by the credit of the Govern- ment
The greater the success of the corporators under such circumstances the more genera] would be the satisfaction throughout the world, as their at
the expense of others
gains would not be Ought such a bill to bc jeoparded by amendments of no moment to the country at large, 
110 wevtn• desirablc to minor rival localities, especially when short branches, hereafter to bc granted ahuos•las n unatter of course, may substantially satisfy their wishes 
The bilk, as now presented, is the result of ten years' consideration, and is the coinpremisc of various rival and conflicting interests; and an al- teration, apparently slight, may arouse extended opposing interests not now seen, and may thus deft•at the bill
Mr
President, the Senator from Missouri [Mr

LANE.] He says that this bill is unknown; that it was forced through the House of Representatives without consideration, under the previous question If my friend had only examined thc question, he would have ascertained the fact that this bill was reported during the last session of Congress; that it has not been altered in a single word, with the exception of the inser- tion of two or three or four names; that it was reported by a select committee of the House of Representatives, who had hadit under considera- tion for mon ths—a committee co mposed of sixteen members of that House; that they not only rc- ported the bill, but twenty thousand copies of it were ordered to be printed and circulated over the whole Union
In addition to that, I will say to my friend from Oregon that this bill was per- fectly well known in my State, and that the thirty- four thousand Democra tic voters of that State who voted for him for the second Office within the gift of the American pcoplc, arc every onc of them in favor of this bill; and I may say further that, of the one hundred and tWenty thousand voters of• California, there would not be a hundred votes It is well understood there
It cast acrainst it
was my belief at the time that this bill, after such long labor in the select committee of the lower House, would pass that body; and the question '-.vas whether, if it came to the Senate, this body It is well known would also pass the same bill
and understood, so far as my constituents are concerned
But, Prcsident, the Senator from Minne- sota speaks of going by Pike 's Peak, and that the rights of actual settlers will be encroached Ill.-»on
Sir, it reservcs all the mineral lands on the whole route, and there arc no scttlers there cxcept on mineral lands
I-lc says therc are no (yuards im- poscd; no restricti01'is for the benefit of thc Gov- ernmcnt.; no protection to the United Stales
-Why, sir, the Government of the United States has the first on all the road; and if the road is not built, it is to be given up, and ail the private subscriptions are to be forfeited
I undertake to say that this bill will build both roads
YVithin less than twelve months after thc bill becomes a law, the greatest obstacle that has cver been pre- scntcd to the central route will have been over- come, for we shall have, a railroad through the Sierra Nevada mountains to the Washoe silver will ask the Senator from Louisiana, mines
BENJAMIN,] who is opposed toa Pacific rail- road bill, if' he thinks there is any obstruction that cannot be overcome
He has traveled over he hag told me tl-iat there is none; and the route; there, are belter routes than thc one hc traveled over
Thcre aro parties now who will contract to build, within twelve months, a road through the Sierra Nevada mountains to the Washoe sil- ver mines, where these mountains have heretoforc been considered an impassable barrier
I will not detain the Senate in regard to this bill, which is of such transcendent importal'lcc to the whole country, and so vital to my own constit- I want the Senate to understand that m.•vc uents
arc not contending for routes
W c will take any route; we will take any bill that will secure the the Senator from California seem to make it ne- cessary for me to answer very briefly what he said
He reminds me that thirty-four thousand patriotic national Democratic voters of his State voted for me for the second highest office in their gift
Well, sir, they gave a good vote; and I thank them
And he further reminds me that they are, every one of them, in favor of the pas- sage of this bill; and he says they all understand it; that they have every one seen it, read it, and comprehend its provisions
Mr
GWIN
My friend will permit me to state that 1 did not say they had read it; but we discussed it on the stump
It was debated by the speakers of all phe four parties
This bill was well understood in California, and all parties were committed to it
I made speech after speech in favor of this very measure, stating that, ifit passed the House of Representatives, in my judgment it would certainly pass the Senate
Mr
LATHAM
1 will state, also, that this very bill, with the exception of the new corpo- rators that were inserted in the House
this year, was published in the papers all over the State
1 saw It and read it mvself
Mr
LANE
well, Mr
President, 1 will only say to my good friends from California, that I do not understand this bill as they do; and I yant them to understand now, distinctly, that they are no morc anxious for a Pacific railroad than I am
1 have labored here for years, and am ready now kto vote for such a bill as ought to pass; but when I was up the other day, I said that it appeared to me this was no time to pass a Pacific railroad I was very sorry this morning to see the bill important measure that has been introduced in o this Senate, or can be introduced into it dur- ing this or any other session, set aside to take up I allude to the proposition introduced this bill
by the venerable Senator from Kentucky
It was a proposition presented with the hope of saving the final dissolution of this Union
'I'he measures proposed by birn, if sanctioned by the people, if approved by the northern States, would in all hu- man probability—and I know there is no man in this Union more anxious for it than myself—de- lay the move:ncnts which are now coing on, that are to result ultimately in the entire dissolution of the Union
At such a time, when every gen- tlcman knows that the coun try cannot be held together unless sornething shall bc )romptly done, I ihought it was not proper to ta ce up a bill in- volving the country in obligations amounting to hundreds of millions, for the making of two rail- roads, in preference to adoptincr some measures by which this Union may be held together; some plan that may afford security and protection, and guaranty the rights of all the States of the Con- GREEN) and the Senator from Ohio [Mr
PUGH] I say that this is a coercive bikl; that it will force the States and Territories through which these I roads pass, to grant charters as thc corporators I can speak confidently for IT! y owrn may dictate
State in answer to this objection, that its passa(re through Congress will be hailed with joy by thou- sands and tens of thousands of its citizens
Bon- fires will bc built on our mountain-tops to cele- brate an event morc imporcunt to them than Napoleon 's greatest victories wepc to France in consolidating his empire
California will hail If' I could making ofa road to the Pacific ocean
do no better, I would vote for a bill that would carry it to Puget Sound, and leave my own State out
I believe, thougl-i, that this bill carries these routes to the great center of comrnerce and com- tnunication 0B the Pacific ocean, and secures im- portant connections on both sides of the conti- nent
T hc people of California want a railroad, they want a connection; and thcy arc wil\ing• to take it in any forn')
Their delegations in the two Houses of Congress have always been willing to take any kind of bill that could present.ed to I them, which would secure this great object
Now these corporators as bel)efactor.s, Who, through we have before us u bill which has been sent to I the beneficence of Congress, have been intrusted us from the other House, and if the friends of a with an enterprise that will rnake us one of the Pacific railroad will throw away their minor ob- great Powers of the earth
We will notlookupon W jections, and stand by it, we can pass this bill; fideracy
it is not a good time to take up this measure, and to impose it upon the country, sim- ply because gentlemen have the power to do it, when they know that they are pledging Staffs that will not regard the obligation which they under- take to impose on them, and when they are making debts here and contracting obligations that these States will always hold they had no right to do
I say to those thirty-four thousand sensible, loyal voters of California, that no man in America .is more devoted to their interests than I am
1 will såy to every voter of every political party in Cali- fornia, that no one of them is rnore anxious for a Pucific railrond than myself
Any plan by which one could be made, if this were a proper time to do it, would satisfy me
This bill, as I look nt it, is not a good one
It isaloose bill; it is an objectionable bill; and though printed and published, as the Senator says, and scattered over every portion of this country, he knows, as well as do, that no opportunity was given for its consideration in the House of Rep- resentatives
There was no opportunity allowed there for amending or perfectino• it
There was no opportunity given for considering it; but under the previous question it was hurried through that House and sent to us
The Senator from Cali- fornia now stands here, saying that we shall take it just as it is; that it is a holy thing; that it shall not be touched; that no amendment shall be made to it; that no consideration shall be given to it; that every amendment that is offered shall be it as coercion when we are asked to pass State and I undertake to say that in a very fey.T years, voted down, and the bill hurried through the Senate
under its provisions, both roads can be built
laws to aid in carryino• out this great law, which will shower such benefits upon us
Such I feel I Mr
LANE
Mr
President, the remarks of II Mr
President, I repeat again that this is not  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
383 the time for passing a Pacific railroad bill
Let this matter go over
Let us take up the
propo- sitions of the Senator fro» Kentucky
Letus sub- mit to the people some niethod by which the diff- culties that surround us, •and which appeal to every patriot in the country, can be averted, and peace restored to the country, so that the States that have left us may be invited to return upon terms that 'Vili afford security to them
Would the Sen- ator have a railroad at the expense of the Union 
Would he place• it in the power of that party who disregard the Constitution; who disregard their obligations to the country; who trample upon the decision of the Suprcmc Court; who will not respect a single guarantee to which the States are entitled under the Constitution; who have said on the floor of the Senate, and in his presence, to the southern States: " We have you now surrounded; we intend to hem you in; you shall submit to our rule, and to your destiny;" showiw as plain as language can express it that it is their purpose, not only to hem in, to fence around the southern States of this country, but to destroy their institutions
Would he consider a railroad bill now in preference to the adoption of measures that would secure rights to these States that are to be trampled upon and literally crushed out by a party who would inaugurate and bring about negro equality in this country; who would free the negroes of the South, and bring them to New York and the other northern States, and introduce them there upon an equal foot.ing with the laborers of that portion of OUI' country, to compete with them in their labor, and who would allow them to vote
And then this party say to us, when war comes, we will have a utiited North to go down against the South, and destroy it, and to bring about this negro equality
They expect the Germans, the Irish, and the Demo- crats, who have struggled to maintain the rights of all the States, who have stood firmly by the Constitution, will help to establish negro equality, and that these good people will go under the Rc- publican banner to do it
1 say they will never engage in any such cause
I allude to all these things in order to satisfy the honorable Senator and his constituents that I am with them in favor of the Pacific railroad; but I dq not belicvö this bill to
be a good one
I said so before; and not think it ought to pass
voted for its-indefinite postponement with the hope that something could be done to save the country
Another Congre:ss can attend to this matter
When Congress shall again assemble, the Senator from California or his colleague will be here; and if we should have peace, they can take up the railroad bill and pass it
1 should hail its passage with as much pleasure as he
will go on the mounto.in tops and light up the beacon fires, and rcioice over the passacye of a railroad bill, when ihe time comes to do it, when it is proper to do it, apd when a good railroad bill, such-a one as 1 know he would introduce if he had the opportunity, shall have passcd Con- gross
There is another objection to this bill
vides for making two railroads—a southern and a northern railroad—to terminate at San Francisco
Well, sir, I will go for both these roads at the proper time
I wrould go for two or three rail- roads to terminate at San Francisco
I appreciate its importance as much as the Senator from Cal- ifornia does
I know it is irnportant to us in Oregon
I know we are identified with California
We look to California as the great portion of the Pacifw
We go there to purchase everything arid to sell everything; and I am, and intend to bc, as true to California as he is; but I submit to him, and I submit to other members from the Pacific coast, whether they would not like, when they see the northern road that is to terminate at San Fran- cisco reach the Sacramento valley, that a branch should be provided to follow the Sucr,mnento river
It affords a natural passage through the mountains to the Chasta valley, in which stands Yreka, one of the flourishing town of that State
Then it is of easy access to {he Rogue River val- ley, and that opcns communication with the Ump- qua valley, and that again opens communication with the Wii*amette valley
There is no formi- dable obstruction ut all to making the road
ft is the finest route in the world for a railroad, term- inating at Portland, a seaport town, where ships of almost any class cun arrive; they enter the Columbia, and come to Portland
Then, a branch or road can be extended by the Columbia river valley, by the Cowlitz, over a level country to Pugct Sound
Thus you would accommodate the whole Pacific coast
Why should the State of Oregon and the Territory of Washington bé cut ofF entirely, and forced to travel seven hun- dred miles by land, or more than that by water, to reach San Francisco, to avail themselves of the benefit•o$ this road 
Should it not extend through the Sacramento valley up that river, by the route I have mentioned, to Portland 
I ask the representatives from the Pacific coast whether they will vote for such an amendment, whether they will vote to extend this road over the best portion of the Pacific coast
The valleys I mention are larger in extent and Inore fertile and productive than any other portion of the Pacific coast
That road would afford them an opportun- ily of bringino• everything they have to San Fran- cisco
Will Senators say that all these roads shall concentrate or terminate at San Francisco, and that the State of Oregon and Territory of Washington shall have no part or lot in the mat- ter
Is that just to that portion of the country
Is it right (hat two roads shall terminate at San Francisco , and no man shall raise his voice in favor of extending it on a route that is entirely easy, and vv'hich can be made at as littic expense as it can up the Platte valley, from the Sacramento valley up the Sacrzunento river, which makes a natural pass to Chasta valley, and then there is no ob- struction to Portland
Jt is almost a level coun- try
T herc are but two obstructions by passes through which the road can pass
Everybody that has been in the Willamette valley will see that there IS nothing hardly to do there but to lay down the timbers, put on the rails, and set the cars runnmff
When you get to Portland, you have reached the ocean six hundred miles north of San Fran- Cisco, and in a direct line to China; for, as I said the other day, vessels sailing from San Francisco for China, all go up our coast by the Columbia river and further up by Puget Sound, or rather a little west of it, and strike across to China
It is the nearest route
I say •again, when you have reached Portland, you can then reach Puget Sound, the finest inland sea in the world
There is not such a sheet of water on the face of the earth
There is an entrance without obstruction, and a harbor suflicient for all the shipping of the world
Why shut oul thal harbor
Why will not rny friend be generous, and say, that when this northern route reaches the Sacramento, it shall be provided that one branch shall be ex- tended on through Oregon to Puget Sound
Shall we be cut off
Is that portion of the country in which I live, and which extends from 420 to 490, to be entirely deprived of the advantages and ben- cfits ofa railroad which it is attempted to hurry through Congress without any opportunity to amend
If this amendment can bc madc, and if proper guards can be inset•tcd in the bill, that will make it secure, then I should vote for it wit.h great pleas- are, if I believed at this moment it was the duty of Congress to pass it
I would vote it anyhow, but that this is an unfortunate time to pass a rail- road bill
Let Senators provide for all that por- tion of the country; let them be just to Oregon, just to Washington, and eslablisll a line that will open the connmerce of the world through Wash- incyton Territory by the 'Willamette valley route straight to New York
Then they will have ac- complished much
But the gentlemen who can urge two routes to terminate at San Fral'lcisco, without providing for this other portion of the country, disregard the interests of all that por- tion of the country lying north of San Francisco
While I intend to be just to San Francisco and to I California, and to
every voter in it, I think it is but right to be just to the other portion of our• country lying north of it
Let us deal fairly; let this bill be amended; let it be well considered; let and the principal -route that has been looked upon until very recently for this railroad, the- centråi route , must pass through the Sierra Nevada;mounta ains at the head of the Sacramento
river, nearly one half of the way, hundreds Of mils north-of Sacramento city
The road is •to pass-to Saci•a• mento if it goes over that route; so that,t-he athehå- ment of the Senator to make a road from- Sacra• mento to Portland, when for hundreds of miles this route must travel the same region of country before it gets to Sacramento; would not accom- plish his purpose
It seems to me, -his amend& ment, if he proposes one, should be to run the road north, if it goes on the surveyed route, the, one that has always been recognized as the route over which the road must pass, to strike the head waters of the Sacramento river and go north to Pörtland
Bat, Mr
President, the Senator himself' has answered (very weakly against this bill, in my judgment, but very powerfully against his own amendmen t) his own ardent appeal for this branch and that is, it can wait
He says the whole bill, the great Pacific railroad, can wait.
ment of the Senator is good against -the whole bill, is it not good against an amendment in which two States and a Territory alone are interested
If I understand the public sentiment of Qregon and Washington Territory, they do not.wish that connection 
I do; for if the amendmentshould be adopted, it •.vould touch an important settion of my own State
This road will be built by pri• vate enterprise to a certainty , in time, without any aid of the Government
It will go through a splen- did country in Oregon, California, and Washing- ton Territory
It is a natural route, with very few grades
Give us t.his great connection with the Atlan tic States, and, in Iny iudgment, so far as Cal- ifornia and Washiæbon q erritory is concerned, and I believe his own State, we shall ask no aid of the Government to make that connection.- I should be very glad to aid in anything, if did not jeopardize the great measure itself, that would look to a connection with my own State, as well as to Lake Superior
But, sir, so far as the Senator's arguments are concerned with regard to the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky, there is this difference between him and me: am for both measures
I am for this bill, and I am for those resolutions
It would be scarcely possible for the Senator from Kentucky to present a proposition here in favor of the constitutional rights of the South that I would not vote for
I will go a great deal further in the way of protection than that Senator has , proposed to go
My position in regard to those questions is well known, althouch I have never look upon the forced them upon the Senate
representatives of the Pacific coast as occupying a peculiaf position here—an advisory position
They should, if' possible, throw oil on the troubled waters, and not present opinions here when they are not effective to accomplish good
I always vote on the side that I think will preserve- thc Union, and remove these sectional diffculties•y but there is no slavery within two thousand miles of our coast, and therefore I •have only once, in my whole senatorial term, said anything on the subject at all, and that was merely as a precau- tionary argument against certain political move- ments
I will not detain the Senate on this subject
shall vote for the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky in cvery form in which they shall come up; and they sh0Ltld bc made a great deal stronger than he has made them, if rny vote could do it
I do not wish to interfere with those propositions; but I look upon it that every man, woman, and child in my State expects me to aid in the pas- sage of this bill as it is, and i am representing the united and unanimous sentiment of mv own State
There is my duty, and I must that-duty
The people of that State believe that this is the best Union-savinsr measure that could be brought before the Congress of the United States
Mr
BAKER
What has been said, Mr
us advise whether this is the proper time for its ident, in relation to this northern road, compels passage, and if it is, let it go through providing ! me, to say a very few words, which for all the country on that coast, which can be I trust my friends here, and, indeed, upon both sides of the Chamber, wilÄ attend to
I am go_ing done at very little additional expense
Mr
G WIN
Mr
President, I will answer to vote for the bill as it is, as nearly-as [ can, briefly some of thc arcruments of the Senator from Ill the first place, he says there ought Oreo•on
to be provision made for a route from Sacramento to Portland
Why, sir, one of the >grveyedroutes, without any amendments or alterations; and I am going to do so, while as I believe 'I represent a constituency further north -thun any other gentle- man upon this floor
I am going to vote against
 384 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, although I am told that the northern route pro- posed will benefit the immediate people whom I represent, very greatly
While I do so, I know that I shall be misapprehended—I will not say misrepresented-—-at home
I know the argumcnt will bear upon me as heavily as it can bear upon any gentleman upon this side of the Chamber who may vote as I do, that I am not voting for the immediate interests of my constituents by bringing the road near their homes, and through their farms
I must rneet that as I may
I desire to say here, now, and to give Itas much publicity as I can, just this: having lived for ten years upon the Pacific coast, where our whole hopes have been directed toward some road, I see, at last, a prospect of accomplishing that re- I have observed, with great sult by this bill
care, the struggle in the other House; and I have seen that, by an overwhelming vote, the propo- sition for a northern route has been therc defeated
I am sure—and I take the advice of all the ori- ginal friends of the bill around me—that to incor- porate any amendment in the bill now, will defeat In that It for this session, and possibly forever
condition, quite alive to the intcrests of my con- stituents, quite sure that my conduct may bc the subject of misapprehension or misrepresentation, quite sure that all that strong feeling of locality for our State, our road, may be brought to bear upon me in future, yet risking my justification upon the great idca that I believe I am doing the best I can to promote the connection between the Atlantic and the Pacific now, I shall vote for these roads; and if, hereafter, here or elsewhere, my vote may ever be brougl'Et in question, I have but this to say: no man who can observe the condi- tion in which this bill is to-dw in the Senate, can do otherwise than know—and I say with empha- sis, know—that unless we do, within a very föw days, pass tl•ne measure substantially us it is, we cannot pass it at tl'lis session, and we risk it
for- ever
Hereafter, whethler here 01' at home, I shall say this in my defense, and make no otl'ler
The bill, in my judgment, is fhr from perfect
As an original bill ; I think—as I have said, I bc- lieve, before—there ought to be but one road, one great highway of nations and ofcmpires; not for one country, nor for one Government, nor fo r one day, nor for one generation, but för all the and all the advancing generations who world, may partake of its benefits and its blessings
But in an age of compromises, aud in a Government of compromises, find that we have, after ten years, accommodated ourselves to each other's opinion; so that now, with two roads, we may pass a bill; may get it through this body, and It may receive the sanction of the President of the Umtcd States
Shall l, can I, dare r, risk this measure, to which the hopes, the prayers, the aspirations, of so many thousands, and hundreds of thousands, distant very fur from here, have been directed so tong
Can l, shall l, dare l, defeat it
And with all humility, without ofün•- ing my own example for other people to follow at all, 1 hope I may say to my friends on this side of the Chamber: Gentlerncn, if the road docs not suit you in its locality; if you want onc more or one less, let me beseech you, unless you see that probably you can do something else better, take this now, lest indeed we lose all
Mr
WILSON
Mr
President, the question pending before us is, I think, on the, motion of the Senator from Minnesota, 10 refer the bill to a special committee
I hoX)e the Senator will with- draw that motion, and that the Senate will go on and perfect the bill as near as we possibly can
If it needs amendments—and I am sure it does— or would be improved by some small amend- ments, I think they may be safely adopted here, and will be adopted in the other House
terial amendments, amendments of great import- ance, are proposed, they defeat the bill altogether; and therefore I concur with the remarks made by the Senator from Oregon
Sir, I am very sorry that every time this ques- tion comes up, or any question of great practical their principles exactly; and it is not his place to any material amendment, or, indeed, any at all, charge me with misrepresenting anything
Mr
WILSON
well, Mr
President, 1 am sorry that the Senator does not understand us If he did understand us better, I think better
he would not speak of us as he does
I do not say that the Senator's head has been turned by the result of the election through which we have passed, but I fear the Senator's heart ht'+ been changed; for no Senator, since Congress opened, has so habitually, when upon the floor,' used lan- guage here that is calculated to wound the feelings of Senators, or to misrepresent them before the country
Mr
LANE
I desire to say, Mr
President, if the Senator will allow me, that it has been my purpose to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; and I have never intentionally misrepre- sented anybody
I will say further to the Sena- tor, that I have held the same doctrines always, that I have held since the election; that my heart, It has been devoted has not changed a particle
to this country, to all of it; and to every Statc of this Union, and to Othe rights of every State, and It never has changed on that subject
shall be
1 intend to deal justly and rightly by every por- tion of the country, and call things by the names that I think the language used by the leaders jus- tifies me in doing; and I beg him not to charge me with misrepresenting
He may charge me with a mistake; but I never misrepresent
Mr
WILSON, well, Mr
President, 1 hope it is nothing more than a mistake; but I advise that Senator, if he does desire to do justice; if he does desire to stand by the rights of all sections of this country, and to do justice to all political organizations and public men, to study more care- fully tho position of the men he speaks of so freely He tells us that this is no time upon this floor
to act on this question
He seems to think that we have a country
tell that Senator, to- I day, we have Government of the United States of America, and we have a United States
1 see nothing in all that has transpired in any portion of' this country, and I see nothing in what it is proposed to do in any portion of the country, that revcnts us having a Government of the United tates, and being the Republic of the United States
I have always Now, sir, I am for this bill
been for a Pacific railroad ; for a great central route am willing to go for n across the continent
southern route as a local route, or för a northern route; and I should like to go for both
And to- day, as we cannot have a central route without a southern route, if [ could have my way—if I could amend this bill—I would change it
I would re- duce the $60,000,000 proposed t.o be ndva n cod on 4he central route to $50,000,000; extend the one mile reservation on each side of the roåd to six miles, thus increasing the land grant; I would reduce the amount on the southeFn route from to and have the road c.otne out on the Pacific ocean at San Diego; and then I would give to a northern route to go frorn Lake Superior to Puget Sound
'I'hat would add some fourteen million dollars to the amount of the present bill; arid I would vote for it that way
But I must say that i think the time has come when wo should pass some sort of a Pacific railroad bill; and therefore I shaft have to stand with those who are the most deeply inter- ested; for we all that the Senators who rep- resent thc Pacific coast here perhaps are more I deeply interested than we are upon the Atlantic, and I am willing to follow their lead in this mat- ter
Now, in regard to so much of this bill as com- mite the enterprise to certain gentlelnen named in it, there may bc persons named who ought not to be there
I think there are some; but they will be found to be few in number, and of no signifi- cance
No great harm can come of it
'Ilhere are certain names in the country identified with the railroad interests of this country—railway importance here, the Senator from Oregon [Mr
I LANE] should take tho floor and pour out his mis- representations and abuse of the Republican par- I say that that Senator— ty
I regret it
Mr
LANE
If the Senator will allow me, 1 will say to him now that never misrepresent anybody
speak of them just as understand l, kings, I may call thean—mel') of great power in the construction, orcranization, and running of railvvays, yvhose nmnes ought to be in tho bill; but I think I can say that most of those ment.ioned in the bill are gcntlemen of intelligence, of per- sonal character, of individual honor; men of large experience, men of capacity, men who will search out in all sections of this country other gentlemen of character and capacity to be united with them in this movement; and names which are now left out of this bill will be sought for and brought into this work
Sir, this is no small matter
It will takc the united energies of all the men in this country who are interested in the construction of this road to carry it through
But it is objected here that vv•e have no security in regard to the payment of the interest or principal of the bonds which are to be advanced
For myself, I intend to vote for this bill with the fullest •.onviction that the annual in- terest, and the bonds themselves, must ultimately I regard it as a be paid by the United States
very small amount, if a hundred million or a hundred and fifty million dollars can unite the Atlantic with the Pacific coast, and develop the vast interests of this country in the central re- gions of the continent
And, sir, I think if we can have this encouragement, if the proposed to be advanced by this bill can com- plete these- two railroads, I should consider it a cheap way of getting them, even if every dollar of the money should afterwards be lost to the 1 do not believe that gentlemen Government
who invest capital in these roads are to make money
If the roads were finished to-day, and put in good order, I do not think they would be very profitable
Our experience all over the coun- try shows that they would not
But, sir, I have the deepest convictions that it is of importance to commence this work, and that we ought to have commenced it eight or ten years ago
We have not done so
We have waited until this hour; und now the House of Representatives has passed It was reported at the last session of this bill
Congress; reported by u large cornmittee, a com- mittee of intelligence, sought out and selected for It is not so- perfect as I this special pnrpose
could wish it; but it is here; it is before us; and I hope we shall cling to it until wre perfect it, and pass it through the Senate of the United States
Mr
TEN EYCK
Mr
President, 1 do not propose to prolong the discussion ; but as I intend to vote for the motion proposed by the Senator from Minnesota, [Mr
WILKINSON,] I wish to I trust give the reasons that influence my vote
that I am as sensibly alive to tho importance of tl')e measure under consideratiop as nny other believe that this is a gentleman on this floor
measure of vast importance, not only to the coun- try and to the Union, but to mankind
I am in fhvor of a Pacific railroad, and I am in favor of the Govern rnentextellding its aid in the construc- tion of such a road; but, sir, I am not in favor of three roads, as is proposed by the amendment offered bv the Senator from Minnesota [Mr
RICE] to the Mouse bill; nor yet am I in favor of two roads, as is proposed by the House bill
as I said before, in favor of a Pacific railroad, but I tim not in favor of three roads; nor yet of' two roads with double terminations to each of, those roads; and, in one case, by the House bill,double terminations some two hundred miles in length; and, with respect to the southern route, double terminations extending throughout the State of Texas, four, five, or six hundred miles perhaps, and double terminations, or, what is tantamount to that, centerino• at San Francisco , in California, forming a connected chain of railroad almost the entire length of that State
am in favor of one road, to begin Somewhere near the point indicated by the amendment which was proposed by the Senator from Missouri, [Mr
POLK,] and which was carried in the Senate, run- nincr as nearly on a direct line as possible to the city of San Francisco, and there to end
01 do not think that we should, in our anxiety and desire to a railroad, construct two or three beside it in order to effect that end
I do not think we should pledge the revenues of the Gov- ernment to the amount of nearly one hundred million dollars, besides acres of lands to an equal amount, for the purpose of securing one object; and if two or three roads are constructed, in• my humble judgment, it will not only require untold millions to construct them, but to keep them in running order
I am unwilling, standing here as a trustee, having some small part to enact in the disposal of the public moneys, to act differently from the mode in which I would act as an individual dis- I say to the friends of posing of my own funds

the Pacific ocean, without consulting and yielding to all the conflicting interests of the Pacific States and the States borderin• on the valley of the Mississippi, so that they are all to have converg- ino termini, or else their support cannot be given to this bill,' it is asking too much of the Atlantic States who are not so deeply interested, so far as locality is concerned, to vote untold millions for the construction of these roads
Now, sir, I will vote for either one of these roads which the particular friends of this measure prefer the central route, as shall agree upon
the most direct; but I am willing to vote for the northern route or for the southern route, for either of the three routes which mäy be determined upon 
will vote fora Pacific railroad gladly, cheerfully, and joyfully; but cannot, to effect that okiectg vote for three, or even two roads
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
BRIGHT in the chair.) The question is on the motiön of the
Senator from Minnesota
Mr
BENJAMIN
[understand the pending motion to be to commit
The PRESIDING OFFICER
To a select committee of five
Mr
BENJAMIN
[should have no objection to that; but it appears to me that, in order to reach some result, it would be well, before that vote is taken, to indicate the senso of the Senate upon some of the amendments
There are half a dozen or a dozen amendments proposed; and the vote on them would form some indication to the cornrnittee in ',vhat shape to frtune the bill so as to meet the objections made to it
T hc com- mittee will come in—I think it is but fair to the friends of the bill to say so—with some bill re- ported; but then thc same amendments will bo repcated over again to that bill
I think we ought to have a vote on some half dozen of the leading amendments; and then it Can bc referred to a committee for the purpose of perfecting the bill, after the Senate has given a direction t.o the com- mittee by u vote on the arnendnpeutS
I am ready to vote on this proposition to commit
now, if it is desired; but I do not see how the committee, will be directed in its work unless we vote on some of the amendments
Mr
GWIN
The remarks of the Senator from Louisiana are very pertinent to this case; and i would suggest, with all respect to the Sen- ator from Minnesota, that if the Senate agrees to material and vital amendments, so that this bilk will be in such a condition that it has to be Ina- tured, part of it retained, phrt of it stricken out, and additions made, then it niay bc proper for a select committee to perfect'it; but until we ascer- tain by some direct vote what material amend- ments •are to be made to thc bill, it strikes me the Senator will hot accomplish his object by moving for a select committee now
Mr
WILKINSON
1 have no objection to the course now stwgcsted•, and if it will pfease gentlemen better to have that course pursued, I will withdraw the motion for the present, reserv- ing the rirht to renew it hel•eafter if circumstances should make it necessary
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
BRIGHT.) The motion to refrær being withdrawn, the ques- tion is on the amendment of thc Senator from North Carolina, [Mr
BRAGG,] at the end of the first section to add: Nor until said acts of incorporation shall bc submitted to and approved by the Congress of the United Statés
So that the proviso will read: Provided further, That the said persons and their associ- ates shali not be or become vested wit!) any grant, right, ot interest intended to be secured bv the provisions of this act ot.herwise than in a corporate character and capacity, , the ter:ns and conditions of' this act, within the territorial I and State jurisdictions into and through which the railroad eoutemp'ated by this act shall Oe constructed, nor until WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1861
was suggested the other day, in relation to cer- tain provisions retaining control
It was objected the other day t.hat Congress could retain no control over tho details, which it ought to have so far as the manatyement is concerned, and many things of that sort, necessary to the public security
I desire to know whether it is the intention of this amendment to secure the rights of the Govern- ment in that particular; and whether, in the Sena- tor•sjudgment, it will eflu)t it
I have not given particular attention to it
Mr
BRAGG: In answer to the question of the honorable Senator from Maine, I will state that that was my object in preparing the amendment; and while I am not entirely satisfied—for I owe it to eandor to say so—that it will effect the pur- pose which I had in view, and of which I think he will approve, yet think that, in tbe main, it will have that effect
I hope it will have that cfiöc,t, While I am up answering the interrogatory of the honorable Senator, I will go a little further and endeavor tC) answer one or two objections that '*Vere made to the amendment when it was last before the Senate
If I can get the attention of the Senate, thin as it is even on an important bill like this, I think [ can satisfy it that there is noth- ing at all in the objections which were urged to the amendment when it was last before the body
A suggestion was made by the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
by wray, as I understood him, of opposition to the amendment—that it would result in delay
That, I think can show to the Senate, is an entire mistake; and before nroceed further, I hope I may bc cxcuscd for saying .to the Senator from California, who has this bill in charge, [Mr
GM'IN,] that am making no factious opfrosition at all to thc bill
lieve that a Pacific railroad bill, whatever may be my opinion about it, will pass during the pres- eut session
You 'have the strength here in this body to pass it
After some six or eight Senators have left, you undoubtedly have it; you have the and it I.)C- strength in thc otbcr body to pass it; comes us, therefore, to '.vell consider the provis- ions of an important bill like this, and to see if there are not yet
defects which 'nay bo cu red ; and now I will repeat what I said just now, that rny purpose is not to make factious opposition to this bill at all; ram y purpose is to provide remedies fi_n• a great many defects which, according to my humblc are to bc found in the bill
Now, sir, as to the delay, Isa y it •will not pro- duce thc delay, in the first place, which seems to bc anticipated from thcamcndment
Why
Be- cause the proviso, of which this amendment is to forn•) a part, has reference only to the vcsting of the title of the lands which are donated, and of the bonds w Iiich arc subsequently to be issued
it does not interfere at all with the powers pre- viously granted in the first section of the bill to the, individuals who arc designated, or to those who may be designated, or who may form them- selves into a corn pan y, provided the suo-ccstion o
the honorable Senator from Louisiana should prcvail, and it should be loft open as to the indi- viduals who are to unite themselves in a corporate act
The bill provides that those individuals may go on; agree to accept the terms of the act; select the linc over v,zhich the road is to be built; report it to the and the only effect of the pro- viso, to which mine is an amerrdment, is that the title to the lands shall not vest until they have obtained acts of incorporation fro rn the States and Territor.cs through which the proposed linc of road is to be exteridcd
So, thcrcfore, it does not in reality produce delay
To these gentlemen is cömmitted the power of selecting the line
rl*h-cy are authorized to do all that can be done; and they cannot get the benefit of the grant of land until the first fifty miles of the road shall be con- NEW SCREES„..z..No
25.7 of Ohe of them would pup an concepn, being a dissolution of -the parthefShiFö"r the joint ownership
Hehceit was, 'aS I .•undeit- stood, that this proviso was put into the they should be first incorporated before the to the property which is dohated:by the-act shod)d vest in and belong to them
That -is all; and ih- the mean time these gentlemen are allöwed to go on and select the line, aid dö all they could do, with the exception of getting thc title to the- prop- erty
But sup>ose it did produce a -little delay: are we to be told,' in a measure of this importahc@, that it-is to be hucriéd tlii•öüglf', a'fid:evéii delåy Of few months' is not to
be•tålérated Or allowed
That is a strange thing
Thc Senator from California, when he: just now, said that thö, Governmpnt Was: to bé amply secured for the payment of the large arnöub't of bonds authorized to be issued by this bill
The Senator from Massachusetts, who has just ad'- dressed the body, with candor which I com- mend , says he neverexpects that the Government will be reimbursed at all; but that ,shc will the bonds to pay; and no doubt he is right in that particular
Mr
GWIN
Will the Senator to say a word
Mr
BRAGG
Certainly
Mr
GWIN

RICE] this morning, thät the parties might build a pa'rt- of thé roqAd, 'abåti- don it, and thus the Government w0uIdVIös*p 'the In answer to thåt,' who!e of its investment
stated that the Government was to have I'hé first lien ori the whole' property, a first the whole road, arm that if any such tliinø sli6ü1d be done, tho pi•ivate subschiptions woulä bc for- feited
1 differ entirely with the Senat.or from Massachusetts
That is a difference of opinion between him and mc
It is an- old difference of I heard that Senator say •here a fé{y opinion
yez.u•s ago, that he thought it would cost the Gov.- think 'it ernment $10,000,000 to run the road
would be the best stock that npxon•ey ever was•in- vested in
That is my judgment; but I may be mistake i) in it
Mr
BRAGG
1 think that Senator froin Massachusetts is fight; and if thé Sentitor from California Will examinev this" bill with the care—I was going to say which he ought to have (lone, but 1 will not say that— Mr
GWIN
You ought not; because 1 have examined it closer than you-have
Mr
BRAGG
But I VgiJl say, he has riot ap- plied to it that acumen which -he oügbt to halve applied to it
He will séé that the only provisiön for the payment of this money is' out of thé-øcost and the price paid by thc Government for the tra•nsportation of i_ts troops, stores, &C., over and across the line of thc road
say that the mort'- gage to be givcn applies in the very wörds of the bill to the reitnbursement-of the Government in that way
'I'he, whole act—I can point out the lines and the scctions—looks to tl'le reimbu-rsc- I mentofGovernment in that way, and none other; at'id when the Senator from Iowa [Mr
HARLAN] slated the other day that the Government would be fully protected, without the passage of any such amendment as I have offered here, because certain laws and charters had first to be passed by the Territorial Lecrislatures and the Stale Le- I gis}atures; that they would havc to bc submitted to the Attorney General of the United States; and that he was to sce that those laws were sumcient, and that a sufficient mortgage was executed to the I Government
, to protect the Government in re- I spects, and to have it reimbursed for this large i amount of •money, which was to be donated to this company—when he said that, he was cntiéely mistaken ; for, if hc will look to the act, and if lilie the Inean time, these corporate acts Senator fron•l California will look to the said aets ofincorporation shall be suinnitted to and approved structed

Therefore, the mort' : Æ)orate.acts_ shall first bc submitted to us, to ena- yet we hear of such things every day on this side gage, is- narrowed down, not as a first mortgage ble us to- see whether they are right and proper of-the continent; and J so much Is there anything about it, and seeing so much about it every day, in themselves
That is all
on the whole road to securc the Government for that there is some truth in what I do sce and hear, the whole amount of its advancements, but sim- wrong in that
One Senator tells me it will produce delay
for the newspapers are fil\ed with it, that by lobby ply to secure the Government according to the terms of the act, and -in that particular way; and Another Senator says the Government will bc influences, money, and influence of one kind or amply secured, because the whole thing is to go other, schemes are carried through, and after they if the.sum to be paid by the Government for trans- portation does not amount to the interest on the, before the Attorney General
The Senator from arc carried through, and ib is Loo late to defeat thern, we find that it was altogether wrong, alto- and, to -the principal, the Government California says he does not want any amendment, never will be reimbursed, and never can be reim- that he is for a Pacific railroad, he is for this bili gether improper, that any such powers should I and no other; or rather hc is for any bill, and he have been delegated to any set Of men
I But the Senator says he is witling to trust them
burged
Now, I ask any gentleman on the other side to is afraid to amend this bill because, perchance, it he
is willing to ti•ust anybody or any set Is that Yes, sir; make an estimate Of the cost of transporting the puts in icopardy the passage of the bill
a sufficient reason
Is that a reason why we of people if they will give him a railroad to the mails at the highest price paid to any railroad for should abdicate our power hcrc entirely
I protest Pacific ocean, built at the expense of everybody service once daily—$230 a mile—and see whether i think against it
Whenever I or any other gentleman i else than his own constituents
That is it
it will pay more than three or four hundred thou- sand dollars a year
Besides, as the country is offers an amendment here, he is held up as an I may say that without doing any injusticc to the settléd up, if it is ever settled up, the Government enemy of tho bill, and his purpose is said to be to Senator, who has always worked hard for his pcople, has done them a great deal of good service, will not want this immense amount of transporta- tion
I presume that the Senator from California supposes that, in time to come, they will make sufficient supplies on the Pacific coast for all the military force that it will be necessary to keep there
So of the intermediatc line; and whenever that is the case, of course the Government has nothing to pay for transportation, becausc thc transportation is not needed; and so of' the mails
So, sir, for all these reasons, I entirely agree with the Senator from Massachusetts; I think hc is right; that we must regard this bill, although it is intended to be covered up in this way, as purely an appropriation of so much mone.y on thc part of the Government to build this road as a great highway and thoroughfare for the country
That is 11
Covered up, mystified in all this ver- biacre, that is really and intentionally the ob'ec,t of ae act; and gentlemen may disguise it as t ley will, cover it u ) as they will, that is the real pur- pose, the real design, of the 'Whole act; and it is never expected, in fact, or, if it is expected, it isa delusion operating on gentlemen, that the Gov- ernmcnt Will cver be reimbursed at all, or that the interest of this money '.vill ever bc paid
I do not believe one word of' it
Mr
GYVIN
With the Senator's permission, I will just make one statement ill regard to that
I gave it as a matter of opinion that this stock would be profitable, and that the Government 'I'his will be a mortgage that would be repaid
will be cleared off if the profits will QiÄ\ble it to be
But will say to the Senator that, so far as I am concerned—for I do not cover up anything —I would vote for this i)ill if n dollar never was to be returned to the rl'rcasnry, and it the I would best, investment, that
could be made
I wd'uld vote $100,000 cover up nothing
in my to-:norrow to make Pacific railroad, if, judgment, it was necessary
I suppose(l the Senator Mf
BRAGG
so, sir, would; and in using that phrase, I did not intend at all to impeach the Senatm•'.s conduct here in I had no reference to him
the sli"htest degree
I supposed the bili was not by him; t without impulincr anything to him, I hope I be allowc(l herc to aro•uc and slid) w, I can, that bill, without intpeac,hing that is the effect of the him or anybody else
I disclaim anyt.hingof that kind
If such was the of' my 1 can assure thc honorable Senator that it was not my purpose to say or to insinuate anything of the kind here
"l'hat being necessarily the effect of the bill, if a delay result from putting on L his arnendmcnt, is that a eonSiderat.ion that ought to be, weighed 
I have already shown, I think, in point of fact, that there can be no delay; that the persons named in the bill have the right to do all that they could do before these acts of incorporation are obtained
Now, why ought we not to have tho acts of incorporation submitted to us
If this Goverm•nent had the power, would it be pretended that we ought to makc these donations without having a proper bill before us
And NV l) y do we not do iL now
Because it is thoug•ht that wc cannot incorporate these gentlemen in the States and Territories; and that, necessarily, we must refer them to the States and Territories to obtain those corporate acts which are necessary to carry out the purpose of the bill
That is it; simply because it is a want of power on the part of this It is a want of power, it is true; Government
but we can require, we can make it a condition I precedent to the vesting of the bounty of this Government in these corporations, that the cor- 'Ithat was said thc other day

there is the least pertinency in the question he asks, and I think I have answered it alrcady
Mr
BAKER
1 did hoar
Mr
BRAG-G
Ihave answered it substantially; but I have yot to learn that thc test of an amend- ment here is whether a Senator, after his amend- Incnt is adopted, will vote for a particular meas- ure, When, how, or with what propriety is that thc test
I am free to say to the Senator that I do not think I can vote for the bill at all; but is that a reason why I should not undertake to per- Docs that afl"ord sufiicient reason fcct bill to the Senate why they should not perfect the bill, if errors and imperfections arc pointed out
And herc I, and others, on every amendment, that
is (')ffered, are met with that objection: " Will you vole for the bill
you arc an enemy of the bill, and therefore we will keep you at a distance.' and I hope that hereafter they will remember Illim for it
He has been a most faithful hard-working public servant for them
Put I stand in a different attitude; people occupy a different position from his; and I think, when he wants to leave everything without any checks on them to such bodies as the Legislatures of the States and Ter- ritories through which this road luay pass, at least we have the riollt here, those of us who belong to the old States on this side of the continent, to 
ask that before vve are tied hand and foot, we may see the laws which arc passed to carry out
the purpose of this bill, and inasmuch as we cannot pass on them ourselves, to say afterwards if they do not suit us, you cannot have our rnone,y and It is a reasonable prop- our land." That is all
osition; it produces no delay
It seems to me it is all right and fair
The great public interest requires that wc should do it
As to the Gov- crnment's being paid out of its mortcrz•vre, it is a Incre mattcr of moonshine
In every aspect in which I can view this question it seems to me that the amendment ought to bc adopted
It be that I am wrong about it; but submit the matter to the Senate

I am ready to vote for them at any time
It will take me no time to make up my mind in regard to those resolutions
I can vote for them at-any timc
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 cannot think, Mr
President, of voting for the Pacific railroad bill while this other measure is undetermined
It has been said of old that men build as if they never expected to die
We seem to be acting as a na- tion upon that hypothesis; we are proposing to build railroads, providine roads for future gener- ations, when the very existence of our country is in danger
When the Union itself is reeling about likc a drunken man, we are tnaking provision for futurity and for posterity
I cannot vote for any such measure atanySuch time
Build up the Union first; then talk about building upa railroad
Then I will vote for this measure
I want my friends from California to understand that, although I voted to-day for the indefinite postponement of this bill, I am not its enemy
I am prepared to vote for it when you make the Union stable enough to afford thc faintest promise that the work can be executed, and that we shall have a nation to cnjoy the benefits of it
It seemed to mc very solemn before ihis people, that the Senate should sit here legislating upon the of roads for future generations, and for a nation, when that nation IS t.rembling upon a point be- tween life and death
Yet the Senate preferred to act upon a railroad, rather than to act on these measures calculated to give permanence to the Union itself
I ask my friends to consider what sort of intelligence is this to go out to a country that is now trembling with anxiety upon the ques- tions of peace or war, existence or non-existence as a nation, that they should sit here and with quiet indifference to the state of the country take up a railroad bill
Sir, it is not only a neglect, in my opinion, of' the public interests; it is neglect of the public feel- ing, and almost an insult to public feeling
When revolution, and almost war, is going through one half of the country, spreading with féarful rapid- ity, this is the course the Senate of the United States takes in its awful dignity, in its awful pride of party predominance and power
sits here and looks with indifference upon the country, and shows that indifference by attempting to legislate on mere ordinary questions, when the fate of the nation is de jending and in peril
Is it intended, gentlemen, addressing Republican Senators,] to show this spirit of indifference to public anxiety, to public feeling, to the fate of the country, and the fate of the Union
I hope not; and yet noth- ing could mark morc strongly, or secrn to mark more strongly, a tctnper and a disposition of • that sort
Sir, I will vote for no railroad bill while the country is in the condition in which it now is
I hardly know what it is that I would vote for concerning the nation, or touching the great na- tional interest, until I know that I have a country and a nation
Mr
President, I do not want to say anything further in relation to this matter
am the friend of the Pacific railroad
From the moment the American people determined to extend their boundaries by conquest and by acquisition of territory to the Pacific ocean, I sot dosvn that greatness was the object which this nation had determined to attain; and I concluded that it must pay all the taxes necessary to that greatness
must open an internal communicatiön by railroad with our country on the Pacific
I have been prepared from that moment to give my sanction to the ineasure
I never expected individuals to pay the expense of it
I never regarded it as a private speculation
However it might nomi- ! nally assume the form ofa private corporation, I at ways contemplated that the expense of it was to be paid out of the pubke, Treasury
I considered that the nation had determined on that measure; it was necessary to connect the distant portions of our vast empire
We had obtained territory on the Pacific; and in obtaining it we impliedly acquiesced in all the measures necessary to main- tain it and to hold it together; and I am not un- that are now at hazard are dispos'ed of; and until this measure is disposed of, I must tell my friends from California i shall vote against their bill
This is all, sir, that I-propose to say
Mr

I havc but a word to say in an- swer to the Senator from Kentucky
A majority of the Senate having indicated that this measure should bc taken up and acted on, I shall adhere to that until the majority change • , becaüsc 1100k on this bill as of greater importance to the people of California than any other measure which can corne before the Senate; but I differ the Sen- ator entirely in anothcr rcspcct
If a majority indicate otherwise, I will vote for his measurc ull the time; and •I am sorry that he votes acrainst this bill because he cannot have tho preference for his resolutions
I will vote for his proposition when it comes up, whenever I can have a chancc, but certain}! I must stand by this measure as long as the Senate indicate a purpose to do so
, Mr
SIMMONS
What is the question now
'The PRESIDING OFFICER
on this bill until Thursday next
Mr
SIMMONS
trust it will not be post- poned
I think the Senator from Kentucky must havo altogether misapprehended the purpose of those who voted to take this bill up
It was with no view' and no purpose of turning a deaf cat to the complaints of' the people of tllis country on other subjects at all
The time indicated for the considera•tion of this bill had come; and whatever may be our anxiety and solicitude about the country, some of us think, at least, that such a measure as this would have a healing tendency in these troublous times
It has appeared to all the whilc that the tremulous aspect of the Sen- ate was what encouraged troubles abroad
I have not felt these apprchcnsions so keenly as some, I I merely wished to correct any misappre- agree
hension of our motives in voting to take up this bill
The Senator from Kentucky, know, wants nothing more than an intimation from me, that I had no party purpose, or any other purpose than to carry on the public l.)usiness in a proper spirit
W c had this amendment about ready to votc upon a week or tcn days ago, perhaps
did not think there vvrerc threo nien in the Senate who would vote aeainst it
I supposed it was so ob- viously rightw in such a bill as this, that it would command universal assent—I mean the amend- ment ofthc Senator from North Carolina
Now, we have debated it almost half a day; and just as we are going to vote on it, it is proposed to post- pone the whole subject again
The next tilnc it comes up, the debate will all bc gone, over tvain
I That is my experience
What I have seen here convinces me that when ••.ve have up a bill of this importance, we had better do something with it while we have it before us
I believe that to- Inorrow, or next day, the resolutions of •the Sen- atop from Kentucky wilt bc up
It has been my intention, at some time or other, to say a few NoW,'why Will SI not vote for -this bill; iW the present state of-public affairs
' BeCåuSe the mference which I-am compelled iffdraw from the conduct of Senators here,' shoivin•gSüChÆindifféEh cncc, as I understand it, as i'tR will- be i•ead; bytho public, upon -questions -touching its encé ,-induccs ine to bclievc that: othiS' Uniöii -iS altogether, insecure
Until that 'is aésui•éd Ito jüe_, what do I-want with railioads
W, hat do with ail the great improvements that •would be- come a mighty empire, when I see my countiy broken up, and dwindled down intoa sétof petty
republics, it may be
feel mote like-hiding my face than engagin• in great improvements that, as I say, would become tlie Republic in its a-nCicnt glory, and in its still greater future glories which 1 have hoped for
Sir, I am alive to but one subject here, and •that' is, the passage Of measures :that -shall- perpetuate and secure to me and my children the blessings and the benefits of this Union; and -until: you have done that, all your other public affairs are tome as trifles
So I shall consider that remark even this great measure of a råilröad to the Pacific ocean
Let us first make our GOV- ernment secure; rebuild that, and then talk about works of improvement wörthy of it
While you leave
that tottéring and reeling, it is idleness; and the evidence of a perfect indifference, to go for- ward in these works of internal improvement as it' you wore assured of existence
It is like the
man on the edge of the
grave trifling about his little, petty, worldly affan•s
The difference is, great between my position and that of my frimd from California, who says he will vote for my resolutions, taken up whén they may be
him I cannot vote for his
My measures tend to perpetuate the Government; his tend to make tin impeovemcnt thät would be only applicablé to tis as a qreat nation, and useless t-o us•even if com- plcted, and perfectly impractic'ablefor uS to eo-m- plete, if we are broken up—a fate which now so imminently ménaces us
'l'hat is tho difference between us
I cannot votc for his measure until I see my country secured, its existence, its union
reéstablished, or at -any rate secured
Then 1 can vote, and will vote, for this railroad bill; not The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the amendment proposed by the Senator from North Carolina

 388 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, Mr
FESSENDEN.
Let it be read in con- nectioh, so that wc can understand it
The
Secretary read, as follows: Provided further, That the said persons and their asso- ciates shali not be or beCome vested with any grant, right, or'interest intended to be secured by the provisions of this to be first acquired by thorn, or such of them as
shall ac- cept the tenns and conditions or this act, within t.be ter- ritoriar and Statb jurisdictions into and through which the railroad -contemplated -by this aet shall be Constructed ; nor.uotil said acts Of incorporation shall have been sub- mitted to, and approved -by, the Congtess of the United States: Jhd probided further, That, ünder no circum- stances; shall the corporations organized as atmesaid exer- eise any banking pdwers, or issue any paper intended to be circulated -as inoney, nor have a corporate existence exceeding a term of — years
Mr
CLARK
If the honorable Senator from North Carolina will allow,' me, I should like to in- quire who is going to hold the property after the expiration of those years
What is to become of it, and who is to manage it) Mr
BRAGG
suppose it would be like every other corporation
I presume there is not a per- petuity of that kind in this country
Mr
CLARK
I will say to the honorable Sen- ator that the of all these railroads are per- petual in my country
I never knew one of them to be limited
Mr
BRAGG
None of them arc perpetual in mine, and hence the difference between the Sen- ator and m self
Mr
CLXRK
It will create ereat confusion
We provision in our States that the Legis- latutes Inay tiller, amend, or repeal; but we never limit them; and unless there is an occasion for re- pealing them, whiie,h I never knew, the charter runs directly on
The property controlled by the corporators: and it ought to be so hero seems to me
We should provide that we may correct abuses and control the charters, but let the corporations go on
Mr
BRAGG
I was aware of the betwccn Lhc charter or acts of incorporaf.ion wh ich it is USUUI to grant in New England granted in n) y section of' the country, was aware that tho clause which the honorable Senator rncn- tions was usually _inserted there; but in no case is it inserted in corporntc acts with us
Individuals with us, are not willing to accept such te:nns in 'They are not willing to run any corporate act
the risk, an(l hence it is that we usually limit the term för which the franchise is granted by the corporate act to be enjoyed
I was goinr on little further
I do not see how the Iden of t.hc Senator can be carried out here at all, do not suppose that Congress has a right to retain or exercise any such power as he suacrestrs to exist in corporate acts in his section of the country, or.ü* he thinks ought to bc incor- portucd int() this biii
I cannot imucrine, after a company has obtained un act of incorporation frotn one of the Slates of this U n ion , how Con- by any reserved can alter that act
Can it altcr it by tnking away it any {he franc Inses fed by the to, ( away It any of its Such thing as that cannot be done 'V Congress, at least in my h umble
opinion
It has no power tn do it, even with a reservation of such powor in this bill
Such a reservation, being illegal in my opinion, would only bc void
Well, sir, presented to my mind in that aspect, The States are usually careful oti that subject
I libe of railroad and the property would pass to presume these charters will provide not Ohly the individuals having no right to exercise the privi- proper safeguardc with regard to the protection leges which the old company had exercised
I of persons and property, but also with regard to I am coming to that point
Then the honorable the limitation of time, if they judge it necessary; Senator from Maine will see that when, by an but is it a matter really of any interest to the application either on the part of the existing com- United States
They will exist as charters in pany, or on the part of any other persons, or by Territories to bccomc States; not as charters an insertion in the charters of the companies when granted by the United States
they are formed, as they are proposed to be Mr
BRAGG
The amendment having been formed now, their property is sold, it may, when- adopted, which I first offered, I admit I do not I ever it becomes necessary to wind up the concern, regard thc present amendment of that importancc pass into the hands of such new company as may did at first, because Congress will obtain the con- have it, or it may be renewcd to the old company
What I want to guard against is a perpetuity trol, to some extent, over these acts of incorpora- t.ion
But, sir, we are legislating.for a work in v.' bich iVill exist forever
If nothing of that kind which the whole country is intctest.cd
It may i should be done, if no new act of incorporation be that the States and Territories will put the par- should be passed by any of the States or Territo- rics through which this road is built, I admit it would be derelict property at the end of the term if the corporation did not seli it
We know they would sell it, though
It would be derelict prop- i erty afterwards, in whatever way the laws of the i State in which the property was situated provided
I can see no obiection, therefore, to limiting these corporations to a tecm of years
Senators can make it a long one
Without that, I do not see
that this Government will have any control over ties named in this bill, under proper restrictions; but we have no assurance that they will do it
It may be said it will be their interest to do it; but a part of these acts of incorporation arc to bc ob- taincd from States, and a part frogn Territorial Legislatures
We do not what kind of acts rnay be obtained
Wo have undertaken to con- trol them in one respect; and think it will nar- row down the subjects which will have to be con- sidercd by Congress hereafter, upon the approval of these charters, if we adopt the arnendment which now omer, limiting the existencc of these corporations to a term of years
Senators may make it a very long one, seventy-five, one hun- drcd, or more, Mr
FESSEkDEN
Will the me for making another suergestion to him ; because we arc at the same thing, the full under- standing of the matter 
Mr
BRAGG
Yes, Nit
Mr
FESSENDEN
It is this: we are to be repaid by cort.ain services to be pcrformcd by these roads
Suppose there should bc limita- tion, and the charters that are obtained from the several tories and States, whatever they rnay be, should expirc before we ure repaid, before wc havo recei ved back our Inoney: what condilion shall vve bc in then
It strikes rne our intercst is the other way
Mr
BRAGG
1 will answer the honorable gentleman with pleasu rc 
i think not
I differ with him
In the first place, we are to have a 11) ortgae•e on the road
Mr
FESSENDEN
It exist beyond the limits of the charter
Mr
BRAGG
Yes, sir; but 1 will to that directly, if the honorable will have pa- tiencc
In the first place, we are to have a mort- gage on the road
Now, I shall propose further to amend this bill, by striking out that part of it relnt.ing to the mortga«ye which provides that the Government shall be reimbursed by the work (lone for the Government
I want a fun lien, a full first rucn•tgacre upon Ille road ; and I think it ought to be
I know no reason why it ought not LO be
One gentletnan says that he never expects tbc Governinent
to be rcirnbursed
-A 110thcr one ()ne who has ruainly charge of this•bill— says he thinks it will be rcirnbursed
-VVell, sir, let us have this bill in a condition in i which the Attorney General can frame a mort- so that the Government [nay be ultirnately paid; nol that I want to see this work sold out before it gets built and has crone into operation at the next question with mc was, whether wo ought all, or perhaps at anv tiine, but with a mortu•acre to allow company of this kind, especially of the of that kind, and with Lho arnendn'ient I propose very large rncans which it ought to possess, which adopted litniting the c.xislenee of the conunujy for it, is necessary for it to possess, and therefore of honorable Sena lor , a tertn of' y cars, the them; I do not believe you can reserve any power, or exercise any power, to modify any of the cor- porate acts which they may obtain, and you will have no power over thern tit all
While I am up, if I do not over-fatigue the Senate, I mav say another word in relation to another part of the bill, on that subject
provided in this bill, that if this first corporation does not carry out the purposes of this act, and coniply with all the conditions of the grant— what
Why, in the first place, that they shall forfeit all under it
I admit that this Gov- ernment has a right to exact that forfeiture, or to make it a condition precedent to granting the land; and if the condilion is a lawful Oi)e, then she would have a right to withhold the properly that had not been used, and had 1')0t been ex- pended
The land or money unexpended she would have a right to withhold
But the act goes on further to say, that in that case the non-corn- pliance with the provisions of this act shall result forfeiture of the franchises and entire property of the corporation
This Government has no right to exact any such franchise
How would you go about it
Here is a corporation
The act establishing it is granted bv a State
How can the United States exact any •förfeiture of that franchise
How can you take the corporate property that has been acquired by condemnation or by gift from the States
Here is the St.ate of Texas, for instance, which, in a part of this bill, crives sixteen sections of land per mile
You cannot do it, sir
That is all a delusion
It is a proposition on the part of this bill to take from the first corporation and give it to another cor- poration, and upon such ten-ns and provisions and qualifications ns Congress may provide
is ail idle
It amounts to nothing, at least, in my l) t_unble judgment; and I think that every lawyer in the Senate, when he considers the matter, will come to the same conclusion
I-lencc, sir, we must look to the corporation first organized, and see that proper tests and pr(jper provisions are made in regard to the exe- cution of their power
The expectation held out, according to the this bill, that if they do not c,mnply with these terms, whatever is creanted to them, franchises, property and all, or the influence which it would necessarily oxercise, Maine, J
think, will see at one,e, as able a lawyer whatever they ilia y hold at the time they are to have powers granted to it which would amount as be is, that Ibe Crovepnrnent could foreclose that guilty Of the act Of is forfeited, and to a perk)etuitv

It is this: this con- we should guard this bill carefully
It has many he will then see the I-n•opriety of the one I have templates, suppose, or we contemplate in all ofTered•, at least, that it is not objectionable in the objections
I have pointed out some of them
I think it would be decidedly safer, therefore, to these proceedines in regard to it, that the tirne of view which he has stated

Mr

If I supposed this amendment would takc any time, I would give way; but I should prefer to have a votc on t.hc amendment
I simply want to make a sugcrestion, and inquire of tho honorable Senator from Nort.h Carolina if he does not desire this road, if it is built, and if it goes into operation, to continue to exercise its privil- eves and do the business so long as it may be found for the public good
I think hc will say certainly he does
He says at the cnd of a certain time they may sell out
Then I ask him why should he desire them to sell out
Mr
BRAGG
If the Senator will allow me, i will answer that inquiry which he puts to mo
Mr
CLARK
Certainly
Mr
BRAGG
I do not know what may OCCtu•
Every day's experience here—and thatexpericnce has been a very short one—the experience of my whole life, I am sure, teaches me that, to grant powers which you cannot afterwards reclaim, is a thing that ought always to be done sparingly and cautiously
Now, sir, I know 110twliat power this corpo ration or thesc corporations may acquire
I know not how they may wield or exercise them
I have said that, in a certain con tin oency, it might become a crcat, monstrous, overspread- ing, powerful corporation, that would wield and exercise an influence in thc country that has ncvcr I want been wielded or exercised herc bcforc
I do not want it to exist some check npon it
forever—not that would destroy the road, not that f would break it up at all; but at the end of that time, we should be enabled to see how these powers had been exercised
I
they had bccn abused, why, of course, this combination and this power would be broken up, and new checks and new guarantees would be placed over it
have no idca the road will be broken up at all
It might go into new hands; but a great highway of this kind, when once in operation, I Submit 10 the honorable Senator therc is not thc slightest danger that it would ever come to an end
We are talking now about thc public
That is a matter which may concern the stockholders; but so far as thc public is concerned, I have never known
and I venture to say the Senator has never known, a railroad once built, although the first cornpany who built it proved to be insol vent, which was not kept go i n (P
ha vc known several instances of failure; )lave known cases of •railroads down entirely; but they have always becn recon- structcd under some new company, perhaps with some modified powers
Bub as for their ceasing to be public highways, such a thing as that, I think, never has existed in the country, and never will occur
That is my answer
Mr
CLARK
Mr
President, it to mc when we, have provided in this bill that these charters shall be submitted to our approval before this grant could take effect, wo guard against any abusc that may be contained in those charters
Then, if we were to provide in this bill that this grant shall be made upon condition that the Con- gress shall have power to legislate to correct abuses, we put a much morc effectual guard upon it, and onc which may operate earlier than tlie one suggested by the honorable Senator from North Carolina
Mr
BRAGG
Does the Senator think Con- gress has such power
Mr
CLARK
I think it may make the grant I will not make at the cnd of fifty or one hundred years—just pre- l
cisely as much in one case us the other
think it is for the advantage of the Government to have as good a charter as possible, and to have it as long as possible, so that it shall not be subjected to interruptions
Now, I will submit to the hon- orable Senator to let this amendment go for the present, and sce if we cannot insert one of that kind in the bill
Mr
BRAGG
I will withdraw the amendment Wilh a great deal of pleasure
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The amend- ment is withdrawn
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 desire to offer an nmcnd- ment in accordance with some remarks I made the other day, for the purpose of relieving this bill of the featuro of monopoly stamped upon its face, and leaving the right to subscribe to this corporation open to the public, instead of being confined to those persons only named in the bill, propose to strilcc out, in thc or their friends
thirty-fourth and thirty-fifth lines of the first sec- tion, thc words,' "a majority of such grantces• shall admit as their associates, " and to insert the " shall choosc to associate with them, and words, become with thein subscribers and corporators for that purpose, as hereinafter providéd."

 390 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, I take it for granted, that we may upon being secured in their constitutional rights in its purpose

self-preservation: I came here with the hope that •What justice is there in that
Let us, for one such measures might be brought forward by those moment, revert to the history of the Government who had the power to control this question, as to knox,v whether it is just in it to assume the re- need hardly would assure the people of the South that they sponsibility of so grave an act
michtexpect future security for their rights in the •ay that, at the date of the Declaration of Inde- Union
I believe that if the Republican members I pondence, cach of the thirteen colonies of the had- manifiisted, at the beginning of this session I of Congress, a purpose to respect simply the con- I stitutional 'rights of all the States and of their peo- ple, all these diffcultie,s might, before this time, have been settled
I do not mean to be under- stood, in making that remark, as indicating that it would have been necessary for them to have acceded to any extravagant or unreasonable (lc- mands
Such demands would not have been made, unless they deem it extravagant and unreasonable to insist upon plain, spec.ific guarantees of those rights which were assuredly secured to us under the present Constitution as it was formed, and which have been secured to us by the action of all departments of the Federal Government down to this time
This, I believe, was the condition of things whcn Congress assembled at the begin- In view of the fact
that Re- ning of this session
publican members of Congress l')avc held sullei)ly back, abd have neither proposed nor accepted any compromise, but havc declared that they have none to make, four States are now out of the Union; and many others are
in rapid motion to cro out
Unless something can now be done to arrest this movement, there will be but few south- ern States, if any, acknowledging allegiance to the Federal Government on the 4th of March This state of things Having bccn produced , what cun change it
I cannot say now that it is possible It is certainly all but to arrest the movement
It is my (luly to ilnpossible now to arrest it
spea.k on this occasion as I would speak in tho presence of the future—as I speak in the preScnce of the calamities invoked on this people by the action of this Congress, and by a portion of the States of the Union
No men on thc face of the earth, at any period of the world 's history, were ever charged with a morc solctnn responsi- bility tl•xan that which rests to-day on the Amer- It calls not for passion, but for I ican Congress
calm deliberation ; not for the main tenance of Inere partisan supremacy, but for the ascendency of pa- triotism; not
for the domination of the one party and the overthrow of the other, but for a consti- tutional Union based on the action of the people, and on the support of a Government friendly to ail its parts; not nurturing and fostering the one and hostile to the other; but just, and tåir to all alike
These are the great principles which should animate our action if we intend to preserve the Union
On the other hand, if fiftcen States come here—minority as they Inay be in Concyress, in thc popular masses, in wealth and power—telling you of their discontents, and the cause of them, if you tender no olive branch, no conciliation, but sternly deny their constitutional rights, and tender them on the one hand submissi01'l t') ruin, and on the other powder and ball, who is it that does not know wl'l.lt their decision will be, whatever may be the conscquences 
Is there a cause for this discontent
It has been interrogatively suggested that there was none
It has been partially admitted by others that there is some cause
This is no time to come here and suppose that, by special and in- genious statements of the cause of controversy, we can change the judgment of posterity as to the atti- tude of public affairs in these tunes
It is beneath Union was slaveholding
At thc date of the twelve formation of the Federal Constitution, years after that, twelve of the thirteen States of Is it to be the Union svere slaveholding States
presumed that twelve out of thirtcen States made a Constitution which was intended to reccvnize It would be ask- slaves as freemen and equals
ing too much of human credulity to believe such If' anything were necessary to a proposition
repel the idea, it is snpp!ied by the baro fact that the convcntion which framed this Constitution, and gave it to us as thc chat•t.cr of our rights and liberties, provided in it for keepin(' open the Afri- can slave trade for twent.y years after the forma- tion of that Constitution, so that the white race mic ht 00 on under authority of' the Constitution an acquire a larger amount of property in negro slaves
The interests of a portion of the States were found not to require African sbavcry; and i these Stat.es disposcd of their negrocs, not so nu- merous then, it is true, as they were in some of the more southern States
Then they 'mado their States what they call free States
T be southern States raised no objection, and had no right to raise any objection, that these States had chosen for tl)emselves to exclude ne(rro slavcry; but they had rights under the Federal Constitution—thc right to protection arid security—wb ich it '•.vas their duty to insist upon
'I'hat is all they have done
But, Mr
Chairman, I cannot dwell longer upon this portion of our history; but I will ask atten- tion to another feature of this question
I invoke the of Republicans a mmnont„ to what would be the result of the success of their doctrines if they will not cease this agitation until they can rest in the belief that negro slavery is before I do it, put, ill process of extinction
one retnark, not alto«rcther con- I wish to make nectcd with rny argu tnent.•, but which may not be unserviceable
We have for years back heard of' what is t.eru-npd the irrcoressi ble conflict
emanated from men who have been eulogized for ft rested their statesmanship and their Icarnincr
on the idea of irrepressible hostility between the interests and institutions of States of the Union
It hus been invoked for partisan success and for It has culminated too soon sectional prejudice
for its authors
And here, to-day, behold the fruits of' the irrepressible conflict
Every man who looks forward with an eye to the interests and hopes of Lhc country, hns foreseen what the irrepressible conflict meant—that it meant subjugation and hu- miliation to the South, or the dissolution of the Union
You have reached now its logical end
Are you, then, lomrer prepared to eulogize a doc- trine, a l')d eulocrize its authors, which has brought upon us so precipitately such fruits as these But to tbc point to which I was calling atten- I ask Rcpublicans to-day—and I wou•ld to God I could throw my voice to every city and town and village and hamlet in the whole North, nnd could be -heard by every citizen there, and answered by all—to tracc the history of the Af- rican race through all the ccnturics of the past, in every country and cvcry clime, from their na- tive bni•barism in Africa to slavery in Brazil and thc Indies, and everywhere else that you find them, and then coine to the, southern States, and cmnpare the condition of the nem•oes thcrc the dignity of the statesl)lan•, it is beneath the with then• condition anywhere Otse, and answer dicrnily of the men who control events, to resort me if they arc notin the enjoyment of more peace, now to special pleading to misrepresent the cause more blessinzs, and everything that gives con- of the grievances which now exist.
Ellist.ory will II tentme,nt and happiness, than any other portion tell what those causes are
All of you know I Of that race, bor)d or fi•ee, at any other aryc or in any other portion of the world
Will any nmtan to-day what they are
For twenty years the anti- slavery strength has been growing in the free deny that they are
And if they are, is it the citizens in your States
No ! " " no ! " from the Rcpublican side of the House.] You dare not answer me that you would
You ',vould us with all the energy and power of your States for twenty years, before you would submit to it
And yet you demand of us to liberate
them, to sur- render this $3,000,000,000 of slave property, to dissoEvc society, to break up social order, to ruin our cornnoercial and political prospects for the future, and still to retain such an clement amoå)ff us
Again: I 'ask you, do you believe, one of you— I does any Republican in this Union believe this day that, if you could purchase a separate Terpi- tory, occupied by no human being, if you could liberate all the slaves to-day, t:tice them to that Territory, frame a government for thetn, and give them money to start it—do you believe that, for one year, or in any future period, those negroes could maintain a government in peace, givinø security to life and person, and prosperity and repose to society
I venture to say there is not a Republican in this Union who would hazard his reputation by answering that question in the af- firmativc
And yct, in religion 's name, in God's narno, in the name of justice and humanity, you are invoking every feeling Lhat can stir the hearts of the people to press on with your irrepressible conflict; never halting, ncvcr stopping to consider, as all statesmen must
consider, the relative con- ditioh and capacities of' the races; and what is to be the cnd of the conflict which you invoke,•with the certainty, on your part, that it must resultin breaking up this Republic, or in the subjugation and the infliction upon the South of the worst (lcspotism that can be forced upon any country
I address you with all thc earnestness of my na- tare; I address you in the name of humanity, in the name of our common country, and of the causc of civil liberty
if' I wanted experience to prove the Again : truth of In y supposition that such would be the calatuitous cffect of carrying your principles to their ultimate results, the history of the pust fur- In 3793, when red repub- nishes that experience
licanistn assutncd its reign in France, and the wild delusion of unrestrained liberty seized upon the lilin(ls of the Inasses, there was a wretched fanatic who undertook to proclailn the equality of every human being, and he proposed the liberation of thc slaves in the French *West India colonics
The idea chimed in with the popular delusions of the day, and a decree was passed that all the slaves should bc free
T hc colonies would not accept 
the decree, and did not until the army of France was brought into requisition, and tbc slaves were set at liberty
But, what was the result to the colonies
Great Britain, catching the contagion from 
France, determined upon the policy of lib- erating the slaves in her West India colonics; but she was alitlle more humane an(l liberal
She did mako compenstaion to the owners of the slaves liberated, to the amount of, perhaps, one eighth of their value

But what was the fruit of those decrees to the colonies in terested
What was the result of conferring the boon of freedom upon the African race in these colonies
What was the condition of these colonies prior tp the execution 
of these decrees
They were the homes of civil- ization, contentment, prosperity, and happiness; their farms were cultivated, their cities were alive with business, their ports were covered with the canvas of the fleets of all nations, bearing to and fro lhc commerce of the world
Those decrees were passed
'What followed 
The white race was exterminated by all the im- plements and Inodes of cruelty and torture that Increnuity and barbarism could in vent
Yes, sir, exterminated
The fields then glowino• under the hand of industry soon went back into jungle, inhabited by the wild beasts of the forest; grass grew in the streets of their cities, and ships de- i parted from their ports to return no more
And t they have gone on in this experiment of liberty from revokution to revolution, carnage succeeding States of this Confederacy
in recent years it has part of philanthropy to turn them back to the carnage, until at this time they have relapsed into in doing , and pi•esent a spectacle of savage African barbar- become acrerre.ssive
The quuxstion tendered to i • condition of the rest of' their racc, aild, so, destroy the hopes and the social and political ism
Gentlemen of thc Republican party, are the people.- of the South is well expressed ill the futureoffifteen St.at.es of this Confederacy
Then, you now' prepared to on in your aomressions Ian u•uacrc of thc President this agita- tion on until the northern mind shall rest again, I would ask this other question: Suppose until you have inaucrurated the same scenes for these slaves were liberated; suppose the people your southern brethren
I say your brethren, in the belief that slaver v is put in a condition ot of' the South would to-dav voluntarily consent to For hundreds and thousands of th(.un are your ultirnate extinction
Fl'hat

surrender of slave property, and kindred, living in the of the tl'hat is the sentiment of the great leaders o
that l
party
I presume t.hat fliW members of that party send their slaves at their own expnnse into the blessing of the same system of Gpvernment, and would to-day, in their place, deny that such was II frec States; would you accept them as freemen and enjoying the prosperity common to our people

Are you prepared to attempt to forcc us by fire and sword to submit to such a fate as
this
Your people have lived in the habitual violation of the Constitution and laws of Congress, for many years, to our serious injury, and we have never invoked the doctrine of Federal coercion against
your States
Your Legislatures have påssed laws nullifying a provision of the Federal Constitution which ought to have secured pro- r r hc members of your Lc- tection to our rights
gislatures had to commit oflic,ial perjury in voting ftn• these laws
And your Governors had to do I the same thing in sWnin«y and approving them
And a number of your States have passed lav.rs to fine and imprison their own citizens if they should aid in executing the fugitive slave law —a lasv passed in conformity with the requirements of' the Federal Constitution, and which has bcen adjudged to be constitutional and binding on all, by the Suprenne Court of the United States
During all the time your States have stood in open rebellion atyainst the Constitution and laws of the country—and this in carrying out your affo•ressive and hostile policy aoainst us—Mere have heard nothing of Federal coercion, not even from our northern friends who are now so ready to turn But now that the Federal bayonets a«ainst us
the southern States have determined that they can stand these lawless and hostile aff&ressionson their now that they have determined ts no 10 ; not to live under a Government hostile to these rights, and that their safety and self-preservation require of them to resulne tho powers they had delegated to the Federal Government for their cornmon good, but which aro to bc used under Republican rule for t.heir ruin, we hear contil')- ual[y fronl Republicans of the treason and rebel- lion of the South ; and they arc loud and seemingly sincere in their demands for the cn.forcement of the dates by Federal guns
And i regret to sce thal northern Democrats, some ot them, seem to be equally forgetful of our wron«s, and of abolition ao•øressions on our rights, and equally anxious for this gunpowder enforcement of' the laws, against the authority of State sovereignty in the exercise OF their highest and most sacred duties—the pro- tection and defönse of' the rights of their own citi- zens who can no longer look for security or pro- lection under a Government to be administered by hostilc enemies under a violated Constitution

I was goinff on to say that you contemplatc, as a part of the means of your operations, t.he blockade of our ports
Well, I grant that you have the ships, and you could blockade our ports if none but ourselves were concerned
But let me •warn you in advances that like a distinguished general ofa former war, you will find afire in the rear as well as in front when you undertake to do it
Your own people .will not permit you to do it
Your commercial cities will not perrnit you to do it
Your manufactur- ers will not permit you to do it
But suppose your people should bc so demented as to allow you to destroy their interests: do you think Great Britain would permit it
Will she permit you to bankrupt her capitalists engaged in the manufac- ture of cotton goods, and in the commercc grow- ing out of cotton, and to starve hcr millio-ns of operatives
If your own interests, and all the dictates of hurnaniLy and justice, will not induce you to forbear from the madness and folly which must produce such results, Great Brilai]'l and con- tinental Europe will promptly require you to raise the blockade of our ports

You arc not satisfied with the vast tribute we pay you to build up your great cities, your railroads, your canals
You are not satisfied •wvith tl'1C millions of tribute we have beeri payinn• you on account of the balance of which you hold against us
You are not satisfied that we of the South are almost reduced to the condition of overseers for northern capitalists
You are not satisfied with all this; but you Innst wacre

And now you tender us the inhuman alternative of unconditional submission to Republican rule on abolition principles, and ultimately to free nccyro equality and a of mongrels or a war of races on the one hand, or on the other seces- Sion and a bloody and desolating civil war, waged in an atternpt by tho Federal Government to re- duce us to submission to these wron(rs
It was the misfortunc of Mexico and Central and South America, that they attempted to establish govern- ments of mongre[s, to enfranchise, Indians and free negroes with all the rights of' freemen, and invest them, so far as their numbers went, with thc control of those ryovernmcnts

wish this qüestion could go everywhere and sink into cvery heart, and be answered by every human being
HOW' have done wrong
In what have we wronged you 
History is to answer the question; and it IS to answer it in the face of the consequences Which must fbllow
I stand here to-day to say that if there be a soul,hcrn State, a southern man even, who $ould demand , as a condition for remaining in this Union , an ything beyond the clearly specified guar- antees of the Constitution of the United States as I can speak for they are, do not know of it
I think I have had- intimate as- my own State
sociation enough with her people to declare that they have never dreamed of asking more than their constitutional rights
They are, however, unallerably determined never to submit to less than their constitutional rights
Nevet; never, sir! You can rely upon that, Mr
Chairman
I know, sir, that we have been in the habit of listening to each other under the impression that speeches here were made alone for political effect

Mr

to say that we demand nothing but what •were our clear constitutional rights
We will submit, sir, to nothing less
We ask no concessions as a mere favor to us
We demand our constitu- tional rights
That, sir, is the language of free- dorn
We demand them, and we intend to havo them, in the Union or out of it
I regret that in the course of this discussion an assumption is made, and argumen ts are predicated upon It, that it was simply a question whetlier wc have the right to rebel against the Federal Government
Those arguments have seemed' to go upon thc hypothesis that we neither knew nor appreciated the blessings of this Union; but, on the contrary, we hated and wished to destroy it, And here I must say that, on yesterday, I was deeply pained to hoar certain argurnents advanced by the distinguished gentlemen from Hlinois and Ohio, [Messrs
MCCLERNAND and Cox.l Theil' arryuments seemed to proceed upon the assump- was the more pained, sir, tion 1 have stated
because I have scen the gallant battles they have fought against abolitionism and thc " irrepressible I know their experience, their judg- conflict
" ment, and their capacity
know, sir, that they are representative men of a great • and gallant party
I felt profound rcgret to gee such argu- ments, proceeding upon such an assumption, come from those gentlemen
Now, Mr
Chairman, if I can I will correct some of the errors upon which the arguments ad- vanced against us seem predicated
We do rightly estimate the value of the Union
YVe do rightly estimate the value of the blessings of this Govern- men t
We have loved and chei•ished the Union
Nobody has a better right than I have, although I say so myself, to make that declaratiOn
1 have loved the Ünion with an almost extravagant de- I have fought its battles iv:henever they votion
were to be fought in my section of the country
I havo met every sectional issue, at home in my  392 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, section, and in my State particularly, which was ättempted:to be forced upon the public mind, and whioli I thought would mar the harmony of the Democratic party
I have fought the battles of the Union without looking forward to the conse- I have foumht them in times when the quences
result 'for the Union seemed hopeless
If I could believe we could have security of our rights within the Union, I would go home and fight the battles of the Union in the future with the same earnest- ness and energy t-bat I have done in times past
While those gei)tlemen tendér us war as the I alternative, if we do not submit, yet, sir, not onc woyd is Said in the way of rebuke to those of the Republican party who have created the present storm ; no demand is made of the Republican party to relinquish their unconstitutional encroach- ments—to give up pretensions inconsistent with Our system of governmentand our political rizhts
There appeal ougrht to be made, that our rights should be given to us, and that we should be se- cured in the enjoynpentof them
Let that be done, and no arm and no voice will bc raised against, thc Fcderal Union
Deny us our rights, and we will face your messengers of death , ai)d show you how freemen can die; or, living, how they can maintain their rights
Mark that, sir ! Where, Mr
Chairman, is now our hope for conciliation
Pennsylvania and Vermont have already acted on the proposition to repeal thei personal -liberty bills; and they have refused to repeal those obnoxious and unconst.i tucional laws
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr
Cox] stated, yes- terday, that he thought those laws would be repealed in Ohio

Vermont, sir, has not refused to repeal her per- sonal liberty bills
'I'he matter was referred to a commission; and when that cornmission reports, the Legislature will then, I have no doubt, act on the subject
Mr
REAGAN
They have not repealed the personal liberty bill
That was my statement; and that statement is not denied
do not believe that they will repeal them in the northern States
It does not lie in the mouthsofour northern friends to ask us to believe them until they can promisc with certainty that those laws will be repealed
We know that delay is death
We have already experieliced scnne of tho fruits of delays
We want to avert civil war if we can
Yet no effort has been made to give us what, under the Constilution, we ought to have
It is not pro- I posed to give us what will reasonably make the southern people believe that they will have
secu- i rity in thc Union
No such proposition can be made and sustained; because, to gi ve us our rights is to disband the Republican party
Tho exist- ence of that party depends upon the Federal Constitution, and in rnakine war upon the institutions of the South
'I'here is now an irrepressible conflict.; and either the Federal Gov- ern or the Repu l)lican party must end 
not here to palliate or to dodge one of the inevi- I am ready, for one, table dangers that beset us

NV hen we all do that, then we will have a inst understanding of our rclativc positions
You all know that we cannot, and dare not, live in this Union, with our i rights denied by the Republican party
Its as- ; cendency is OUR' destrtacthon•, and, sir, its destruc- consent and agreement, as contradistinguished pendence, when we can no longer live in this Gov- from a Government of force or a military déspot- ism
It is bound to bc one or the other
Which is it
It is a voluntary association of free, repub- -lican States, upon terms of equality, or it is a military despotism, in which the Federal arm, through its Army and Navy, cun subdue the States at will, and force them to submit to any grievance which may emanate from the Federal Govern mentor other States
Which of these posi- tions do my friends intend to assume
Assumincr the principle that the Federal Government has the right to bind the States in all things, they go upon the hypothesis that their interests and position will require them to command the outlet to the Gulf of Mexico and the forts upon the coast of Florida
I do not rise for the purpose of denyino• the right of passage to the Gulf; but I must ex- press 111 y regrets that they talk in advance of cleaving their way to the Gulf by armies with banners, beföre one man from all that country has ever said that they shot_lld have any cause for war
No one has ever intended to deprive them of the benefit of the navigation of the Mis- sissippi
No one intends it to-day; so that if we are trampled upon by force, let me proclaim to them and to the country, that they must place their action upon a different ground, because we intend that they shall never have cause of war upon that account

REAGAN
The gentleman did not say so yesterday; but he did on a former day of the session
Mr
McCLERNAND
Never
M/ OICE
It-was said by the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr
VALLANDIGHAM.] Mr
REAGAN
All I want to say is that our interest is peace, and our hopes are for pcacc
War is in opposition to all our intcrcsts and our hopes
We want no war; and we intend to give no just cause for war, unloss the attempt to sep- arate ourselves peaceably from despotism, and to take care of our rights under a friendly govern- ment—and they would be destroyed undera hos- tilc govern men I—is a cause for war
NM c declare in ad vancc that we will not in t.erfi•rc with your nav- icration of the Mississippi river
We know that is necessary for you; but we cannot, because there may possibly bc some conflict of interest between us, consent to surrender our liberties pather than assume the responsibility of organiz- inga covernment which will cover the lower part of that river and the capes of Florida
The gentleman from Illinois made a statement yesterday, such as I suppose a gallant and heroic man would make, it' his proposition was prop- erly predicated
He said they could not submit to the control of the mouth o
the Mississippi and the capes of Florida by us; that they would rather perish— he said, with crnphasis— than sulnnit to any other Power controlling the Mississippi, and cornmandincr the coast of Flor- If such is his jealousy of the commercial rights only of his own section; if hc feels so keen and sensitive
a jealousy, what would he think of us if, when our commerce, our homes, our prop- erty, our social and political possessions, for aki time to ccnne, arc imperiled, we should, like trem- bling dastards, yield our rights
Ao•realheartlike his would never expect it; -would never exact it
We prefer liberty, and all its consequences, to a teruporary peace without- honor; and the oentlb- man will justify us if, under such circumstances, we tell the North, and tell the world that we ac- cept independence, with all its consequences, in 
preference to base submission, dishonor, and irre- trievable ruin
We shall l')ave no cause of war
My secti01'1 sympathizes with the gentleman from Illinois and his friends
They look upon them as dcfenders of tbc Constitution; and it has been my pride on many a slump, and in many a place, to eulogize by nmne the gentleman from Illi- tion this day is thc only salvation for the Union
nois [Mr
MCCLERNAND] and the gentleman from I will now, for a moment, refer to the arffll- Ohio, [Mr
Cox,J with all their associates, for ments of the distinguished gentlemen from Illinois i I their gallant conduct, their moral courage, their and Ohio, [Messrs
MCCLERNAND and Cox.] As heroic bearing, in standing up against northern one member of this House, I want to give them II fanaticism, and resisting its onward wave to the an assurance that the anticipations t,hey entertain, destruction of the Constitution, the Union, and and upon which they base their arguments, can II our rights
Now, what 'W'ill our people say when never
be reaiizcd
r have been taught, from my \ I these speeches are printed and sent to then'), and earliest instruction in the theory and practice of they see that these gentlemen arc the first in this our Government, that this is a Government of House who say that the assertion of our inde- ernment, shall invoke the cannon, the rifle, the saber, and all the instruments of war
What will I they say when they gee that these gentlemen, who have long resisted ayolitionjsm, defied its power, and been crushed down by its operations, are the very first to surrender at discretion in the face of the abolition enemy
Mr
McCLERNAND
1 belong to a particu- lar association—a great party—that
occupies a distirict ground in this controversy upo•n the sla- very queStion
We hqve been a Union party— a constitutional party—orTanized against the two extreme parties
We will not succumb to either, but continue to stand by the constitutional guar- antees,as have done in the past
Mr
REAGAN
I would always have ex- pected from the gentleman such a proposition
I know the gentleman's position well; and what I ask him to consider is, what has brought ux to our present condition
If our rights had not been denied us—if our condition had not been imper- riled—no voice would have been raised in the South fer disunion
Will you compel us to sub- mit to abolition behests
Will you demand that we shall submit to destruction at their hands
I understand the position of those gentleman; but I ask them to review their words, and determine whether they are prepared to assert to the world and to thc American people, that there is no rem- edy under this form of Government for the griev- ances, vrorws, and outrages inflicted upon a St.ate; that we shall, under this Government, have no remedy; and that it is in thc discretion of the Fed- etal Government to turn against us the cannon and the glittering saber
Is such the Government under which we live
Is such the Government for which Washington and his compatriots bat- tled
Is such the Government framed by Jeffer- son and Madison and their associates
No
It is a Government of consent, a Government of am•eement, a voluntary Confederation, in which no power was conferred to use force aoainst a State, in order to reduce her to subjection
In the convention Y'hich framed it, a proposition of such a character was offered and rejected by the convention; and by the Constitution itself, Con- gress can only exercise the powers specifically delegated to it
I have but one word more to say
I live far to the South
We have a long Mexican boundary, infestcd by hostile and a long Indian frontier, savages throughout its whole extent; and yet this Government has refused for years to defend us against them
We have a long coast, too, open to the approach of a naval force, and we know the consequences of our acts, and we know what may follow an attempt to take care of ourselves and our liberty; but we remember, at the same time, the history the past
Less than twenty- five years ago Texas stood a province of Mexico, with a population of not more than thirty thou- sand, entitled to the privileges of Mexican citi- zens, including all ages and sexes
We lived under the Mexican Constitution of 1824, which the Texans fought to sustain
That Constitution was subverted by a military despot; and our lib- erties were trampled in the dust
That despot came acyainst us with invading armies for our sub- jugation 
He intended to overawe us by thc•dis- play of rnilitary power, as the President and Gen- era) Scott are now attempting to do with the southern States
T be thirty thousand pcoplc of Texas resisted that power foi• the sake of liberty and those ri.«rht.s t.o which we were entitled, trust- ing to the God of battles and the justice of their cause
In that great struggle companies and bat- talions fell to rise no more
They sank nobly for freedom, as freemen will sink again for her cause wherievcr you shall tender to us that alternative
Upon the field of San Jacinto they won their lib- ecty by their brave hearts and their stalwart arms
They vindicated that liberty for ton or twelve years after; and then, as a pledge of•their love to this Union, and their confidence in its principles, and desire for its prosperity and its happiness, that people tendered Texas, a free and voluntary offering, to come in as one of the States of the Union, upon terms of equality with the other States
But we were told yesterday that we sold out••• selves
The gentleman did not mean exactlv what his language would imply; but he must see how II offensive such kind of remarks must be to those  1861
who do not appreciate the use he intended to make of the argument
Texas cost this Government not one cent
She vindicated her liberty by her arms; and redeemed to civil and religious liberty a coun- try as large as the six New England States, and New York, Pen-nsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, and Indiana, ail put together
She redeemed it from Catholic priestcraft and military despotism, and has covered it over with five hundred thousand freemen, a prosperous and happy people; and they are prepared to vindicate their liberties when they are encroached upon again by a despotism of one or of many men
It is true, that war grew out of the annexation of Texas; and I suppose it is that with which thie CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
393 The poisonings were only arrested by informa- tion which came to light before the plan could be carried into execution
The citizens x,vere forced to stand guard for months, so that no man could
have passed through the towns between dark and daylight without making himself known
A por- tion of them paid thc penalty of their crimes
Others were driven out of the country
Thesc things had their effect on the public mind
They were the results of abolition teachings; a part of the irrepressible conflict; a part of the legitimate fruits of Republicanism 
[Here the hammer fell.] Mr
STANTON next addressed the committee
[His speech will be published in the Appendix.] gentleman charges Texas
But this Government I I Mr
A DRAIN
Mr
Chairman, it is now over knew what it was doing when it was acquiring seventy-four years since the Federal Constitution dominion over that country, and adding to t.be was the Union of these Statesformed; and during all that period we have advanced with United States to aid in building up its commercial, the greatest rapidity in population and extent of acrricultural, and manufacturincr interests
But they also acquired New Mexico and Utah, and territory, in the arts and sciences, in c.ommerce, agriculture, education, and in all the elements the great golden State of Califovnia, by that war, II which constitute a nation 's prosperity and glory
and extended their power and dominion to the Pacific ocean
And that is what the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr
Cox,] and the friends of those measures, now sneeringly refcr to in their refer- I was sorry to ence to the purchase of Texas
hear it
Allu'åon has also been made to the fact that $10,000,000 were subsequently paid for a portion of the domain of Texas, to some of which, it is I have no time to enter into said, she had no title
an argument upon that question
The Federal Governmen t took up ou quarrel for that boundary
As our agent, she obtained the title deed for us
No lawyer will say that it lay with her to dispute our title
She then offered us $10,000,000 for a Aud yet, notwithstanding our rapid growth as a nation, unparalleled in the world's history, there is a restless and persistent effort on the part of some of the southern States and people to destroy the very cause of all these glorious results—the Union, the hallowed Union, purchased and ce- mented by the blood and treasure of the great patriots and statesmen who made and bequeathed It to us, their descendants, to preserve and defend
Can it be that they will succeed in their mad and unholy efforts
Are there not conservative, pa- triotic, arid true men enough in the southern States to resist this dark and angry wave of disunion which threatcns to dash against and destroy the part of this land—eighly or a hundrc.d thousand freest and best Governrnent in the world
Sir, I cannot and will not believe that the whole South square miles of it
Texas accepted the offer
is so illfected with thc dangerous spirit of disloy- Shall the Representatives of the Federal Govern- ment now taunt us with the staternent that Texas I alt.y to the Federal Constitution and the Union, has been bought fora price arid paid for
Why, I as to lead it to drag down i,he
temple of American this Governmcnt only bonght•a portion of Texas
It is not in the jurisdiction of She has that now
Texas
This Government proposed the trade
Texas assented to it
Was there anything in this to can for contemptuous taunts
We made no sale to this Government of what is now Texas
But Texas did give to this Government, freely and voluntarily, her sovereig1Üy and the dominion of all her vast and fertile domain, and ought to be exempt from the contemptuous charae of havinff It is wholly untrue, ana self-respect been bought
should prevent the making of such a charge
Mr
Chairman, there are other subjects which I had hoped to discuss this morning, but I will not trespass on the patience of the House by dis- cussing them now
I havc to say in the end, that yet, almost hopeless as it seems, I would be glad to see an effort made toward conciliation
Above all things I stand here to ill)voke members to look upon this qucstion as one whic.h involves the inter- ests and destiny of States; to warn thein that they are rnaking advances ao•ainst fifteen States, Xtvith thirteen million people, and with morc than two thirds of the exports of the country; against a people who understand all these questions, and who are not to -be misled or deceived by special pleading; a people who never intended or wished to raise their voice against the Federal Govern- ment, and who never would have done so if they had been let alone
Remember that we only ask you to Ict us alone—nothing else
Give us secu- rity in the Union
Respect our rights in the com- mon Territories
So act among you rselves as to 
let us know that we need no longer live under continual fear of the consequences of your action
I must say that the very State from which I come, the very district which I represent, has had some painful experience during the last summer, growincr out of the doctrines of abolitionism
We found, for the last two or three years, that the members of thc Methodist Church North, and others, living in Texas, were propaoat.in« aboli- tion doctrines there
We warned them not to liberty, crushing the hopes and happiness of mil- lions of freemen here, and all the fond and earnest aspirations after liberty of the down-trodden and oppressed of earth everywhere
No, no; never never! Men of the South who love the Union, (and there are many such,) and regard it as a great political blessing—the sourcc of all our national prosperity, and the palladium of our liberties—come forth, and say o the rash and 1 'fisguided men, dangerous spirits urnong you: we will not permit you to bring upon us all the horrors of a bloody civil war, and involve the Remem- I whole country in one common ruin !" ber, men of the South, that your fathers and ours, in the days of American Independence, stoo& shoulder to shoulder in achievincr one of the grand- est victories in the world 's history
It, •„vas your fathers and our filthers, by their joint and patri- otic efforts, who established the Federal Consti- tution and gave us the Union; and will you, their descendants, now destroy forever the noble work of their great intellects, lofty patriotism, and un- dying devotion to the cause of human rights and ot• free Government
No, no
Be true to your brave and patriotic ancestry; cherish with un- dying love their sacred memories; recount their many and great services in liberty's cause; and strivc to maintain, in all its grand and beautiful proportions, thc hallowed Union of our fathers— and may I not still say the hallowed Union of their sons.—now and forever
But if the Union is to be dissolved, and men of the South are benton doing such a mad and unholy act, Ict me say to you that it will not be done without a resolute and determined cffort on the part of all true and patriotic men at the North, at least, to prevent it by every constitutional means
The men of the North intend to stand by the i Union, and defend it to the last, while there is a hope for its preservation
In the North, the peo- unnatural and bloody -warfare-I Heaven, forbid it! God, in His ever Mise and protecting -care, avert from us such an awful event, which sickens the he#rt and chills the blood even to contemplate! Oh, may the dark and angry 'clouds of disunionj now gathering and lowering over the souther,Q horizon, be all dissipated before more soberi flection, truer sentiments of patriotism, and higher regard for one common Federal Govern- ment—one vast and mighty Republic, the home — of the free, and the asylum of
the oppressed of every land ! And, sir, I cannot permit this occasion to pass by without an allusion to that dislinguished kon of the South, Alexander H
Stephens, of Georgia, who has raised his- bold and eloquent voice quiet the storm of popular frenzy, and to call back an impulsive and misguided people to a sense of reason and of patriotism,and to those obligations which they owe to the Federal Government, and to the whole country
The gifted, eloquent, and soul-inspiring orator' and statesman, Stephens; -in, coming forth as he has done, amidst
popa.flar clamor and prejudice, in defense of the Umon, and in boldly rcbuking the voice ofdisunion, has added further and imperishable laurels to his already great name and character; and I much regret, and the whole nation may well regret, that his voice is not now heard, as in days past, on this floor in this most perilous crisis of our country's his- tory, rebuking in the severest tones the spirit of disunion, and presenting in all their attractive colors the blessings and glory of one great, free, It is the duty, sir, of and united Government
every lover of the country, who regards her future peace and safety, to allay, and not to excite still more, thc restless and disturbed state of feeling now existing in some quarters at the South
And I hopc I may say nothing on this occasion which is calculated to add more fuel to the flames of dis--
union, which are now sending forth their lurid glare
What, sir, has produced this excitement and alienation of feeling on the part of the South to-• wards the North
Is it not owing to afear on thcir part that the newly-elected President, Abraham Lincoln, will disturb the domestic institution of- slavery in the sou thern States
Before, however, showing the utter groundlessness of this fear, per- mit me, in passing, to observe that southern men have, in a very great measure, contributed to his In the first place, through their threats election
of deserting Mr
Buchanan 's administration , they drove him to forsake the great doctrine of popu- lar sovereignty, and to exert the weight of his official position and Executive power to impose upon the people of a Territory a constitution ut- teriy repugnant to their political feelings and sen- timen Is, and not the embodiment of their true will
And this, we all know, at once led to a wide breach in the Democratic party, and inspired the Repub- lican party with new hopes of making another vigorous and perhaps successful effort to obtain the reins of the national Government
And never did Mr
Buchanan, and never did southern men, make a greater mistake, as far as the success of the Democratic party and peace of the country were concerned, than when they cndcavorcd to force through Congress, and fasten upon an uo- willing and protesting people, the Lecompton con- slitut.ion
And then again, extreme and ultra men of the South broke up the Charleston convention, by deserting the old Democratic doctrine of non- intervention by Congress with the question of slavery, and demanding a new principle—that it should directly intervene for its protection
From , that moment It was apparent, Lo the least observ- ant of the sions of the times, that the Democratic party was doomed to suffer certain defeat
If, sir, the principle of non-intervention had been honestly adhered to—and to which the whole De- mocracy was committed—and a candidate nom- inated at Charleston representing that principle, ple have been educated to speak of and cherish and cordially supported both south and north, the Union as the greatest political blessing cvcr conferred on any people; and they will deiönd it this day, in my opinion, the Democratic party would have been triumphant, and the South with carry on their schemes of producing disaffection a«ainstall assailants, from any and every quarter, among our negroes; but they persisted, and did whenever that defense becomes necessary
But no occasion to send forth their infuriated threats not cease until they had organized a society called I pray God that no other defense may ever be to dissolve the Union because of a Republican victory
Sir, there would then have been no such the Mystic Red
Under its auspices, the night II necessary than an appeal to the sense of patriot- victory
This Republican vietory—and listen to before •the last August election the tow-ns were to isrn und love of country of those who 'yvould at- pray God that the North the truth, ye men of the South, who-have turned be burned and the people murdered
There now I tack and destroy it

Four of them were County seats, cause of your folly and desertion of great political and two of them the best towns in the district
of brother! May my eyes never witness such an  394 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, I pray you, what law can Mr
Lincoln have en- principles, upon which the Democratic party glori- t ously triumphed in 1856, and upon which it could I acted, even if so disposed, to interfere- with and acain have gloriously triumphed in 1860
How I disturb a single southern right
Why, sir,' will can you, then, in the face of these naked truths, not the Senate be opposed to him, as well as the now turn round and claim a Republican victory next House of Reprcscntativcs
Will he not be as a justifiable' cause for the dissolution of the utterly powerless to do mischief, even if he should Union, when you
yourselves have contributed so intend any
Why, sir, he will not
be able even to form his own Cabinet, and start the Govern- much to the accomplishment of that victory 
But, sir, is there any real and immediate dan- ment,withoutthe consent meld approval ofa Dem- i pursuc any course likely to lead to the injury of ger to the South and her domestic institution of W ocratic Senate
Here is a check upon him at the acts of a mere political partisan and onc called upon to preside over and direct the destinies ofa i great and free people
It will be (for who can doubt it.) the great desire and aim of Mr
Lin- coln to promote the highest interests, happiness, i and perpetuity of the country
It cannot be that he would prove even so blind to his own reputa- tion, if actuated by no higher consideration, as to the southern States, and a dismenaberrnent of this time enouoh for Is it not, then, Government

southern men to take their stand, and procruitn their doctrine of secession, when Mr
Lincoln, as President, actually attempts to interfere with their peculiar institution of slavery, and to violate the Federal Constitution
•Whenever he should do slavery

It is true, Abraham Lincoln, a Repub- lican, will assume the reins of Government on the 4th- of March next
It is also true, that he regards slavery as a moral, social, and political rl'here are hun- evil; but in this he is not alone
dreds and thousands in the North and Northwest who fully ngrce with him in sentiment
And i am not far out of the way when I assert that even at the South a similar seritiment is entertained by many
Most certainly Mr
Lincoln has the right to regard slavery asan evil, as well as the great noass of southern men to regard it as a (Treat blessing, " the highest type of civil- and, if you please, as His merely holding, and publicly ex- ization
pressing, too, such an opinion, is a right of which no one has just cause to complain
It is one of the greatcstand most invaluable privileges of our Government, that all men are at liberty freely to express their sentiments on ail political subjects
Tl'his right is one of the chief glories of our Re- public, which will last, I trust, as long as the Republic itself endures
The only real danger to the South would be, whenever Mr
Lincoln should attempt, arid be able if so disposed, to with arid disturb the domestic institution of slavery
But has hc even such a disposition
Tl'his is the first im- portant inquiry
I am not, sir, the exponent of Mr.' Lincoln 's poliLical views, nor a me no ber of the great Republican party which has elevated him to the highest
office within the gift of the But, sir, I intend to do justice to Mr
people
Lincoln, although a political opponeilt, for the sake of truth, to allay o.xc.itmncnt and un- soon follow as thc bitter fruits of your necessary apprehension, it possible, in endeav- orintr to show that his political sentiments arc not as radical and dangerous as represen ted 
has publicly declared in his speeches, long before the thought ever flashed through his mind of be- coming one day President of the United States: I
'I'hat he is opposed to all illlerference with slavery in the States

That hc is opposed to the abolition of slavery in the District of Colum- bia, unlcsj a majority of the people therein dc- sire it abolished; and in the case of t.hose who do not desire it, cornpcnxation should be inade r l'hat he to them for the

How com- plctclv, then, arc Ihasc Inen at tho South without the slighltest cause for all their unhallowed efforts t.o overturn a Governrnent under which they now live, and, in my opinion, can live, in the full enjoyment of all their constitutional rigl'l ts 
'What, then, is the true and patriotic course for Is it to rush madly out of the South to pursue
the Union, and then into a bloody civil war, with all its indescribable horrors
Is that the kind of rcrncdy for cvi]s which they do not really suffer, but only iiuagine may happen
Is it not wiser and safer and happier to remain -in the Union and bear with anticipated evils, than rush headlong into those which will most surely prove to be both real and dreadful

If the I.ederal Constittltion is to be respected and obeyed at ail, it is the duty of all, both South North, to submit to the clear expression of t ho popular will through the ballot-box
It is his political sentilnent.s aro obnoxious to the "reat n•ntss of southern rnen, aud so they are to 'r reat numbers ill the northern States
Rut re- ber, Mr
Lincoln is only elected President for n lin)it.ed and short period time, which will soon pass away with all the exciternent and dan- which his election seems to have occasioned

, as much the interest of the people of the North to respect and obey that sacred instrument as of the people of tl)C South
They cannot tell when, perhaps, it miffht be pecvcrted to their own injury; and hence
it, is the true
interest
of us a]l,• both North and South, East and West, to nytintain Inviolate the Federal Constitution in all its parts
It may be said, " Arc you not aware, sir, that in the North the Federal Constitution is already violated in the passage of acts by northern Legis- laturcs obstructing and nullifying the fugitive slave law 
" Yes, sir, J urn aware of all this, and not only regret, but strongly condemn it
But mio•ht I not retort, if so disposed, by asserting that the laws of the country prohibiting the African slave trade are
openly violat.ed at the South, and that hundreds of poor Africans, torn from their native homes, and all that was dear to then') there, åt•e now in bondage on southern plantations
Bat I have no desire to dwell upon this constant infrac- tion of the humanc laws of the land
"i'he viola- tion of law at the South is no justification of its viola lion on the part of any of the northern States or pcov)le•, and whcncvcr it is done, it behooves all men, both North and South, who desire to live under a Govern nunt of law, to denounc,n and prohibit it
'I"here can be no question that Congress has full power to enact a fugit.ivc slave law, in order to Give practical effect to a very plain provision of the Federal Cor)stitution
Whether the prcsent law is what it should be in all respects, is a dis- puled question
It is objectionable to verv n-lttny on the ground of its not providing for a trial by jury in the case of a master dcmandinff the return of his fugitive slave
But whether right or wrono•, a good law or a bad one, it is the law of land, and ought to be obeyed
And no State has a right to nullify its provisions and obstruct their faithful execution
And wherever this has been done in II any ofthc northern Slates, it cannot be too strongly condemned; and the people of the North ought not to suffer .their prejudices to lead them to enact laws which are direc.lly in the face of t.l-le Federal Constitution
It is nol only in violation of that (lent to the short period of four years, with the, Constitution, but of the plighted faith between the exp•rcss view that the people llkigrbt soon remedy I ; North and t 110

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
tive slave lax.v, I am happy and proud to say thdt New Jersey, my own State, has not followed their bad and prejudicial example
Although a majority of her citizens arc opposed to the exist- encc of Slavo labor on their own sacred and blood- dyed soil, yet they have not been unmindful to observe all the requirements of the Federal Con- stitution, and what is due to the full protection and enjoyment of sou thern rights under that sacred In that instrument a provision was instrument
inserted providing for the return of the fugitive slave to his master; and had it not been, the Fed- eral Constitution would never have been adopted
If there had been no such provision, there would have been no protection to the master of his slave property
New Jersey, then, ever obedient to the requirements of that Constitution, having been among the first to ratify and adopt it as the su- preme law of the land, has never sullied her patri- otic and fair name by the enactment of what are called personal liberty bills, any other bills which conflict with and obstruct its provisions
There may be some, objections among her people to the present fugitive slave law; but all, Repub- licans and all, I 'fully believe, are in favor of its enforcement
And, sir, I cannotbut here allude to one of the most able and distinguished sons of New Jersey, and one of the best representatives of Republican sentiment in that State, who, dur- ing the last presidential contest, maintained in his public speeches the constitutionality ofa fugitive slave law, although he entertains some ol.)jections to the present one
allude, sir, to Hon
William L
Dayton, who is prominently spoken of in con- nection with Mr
Lincoln 's Cabinet, whose tal- ents, constitutional learning, integrity of purpose, devotion to the Union, urbanity and dignity of manner, would, in my opinion, not only grace, but give great strength and character to that Cab- Not only, sir, has New Jersey not tarnished het fair name and records Wilh nullifying laws, but she has adopted a fugitive slave las•v of hcr own, which is full and complete, in all of its pro- visions, for the faithful return of the slave on de- mand and due proof of ownership
It is unneces- saryhere to recite those provisions; but they are all any slaveholder could desire for the protection of his property
Bu_t, sir, she has gone still further to manifist a kind and fraternal feeling towards her sister States of the South, in providing for any person, not un inhabitant of her State, who shall be traveling to or from, or passing through it, or coming into it, from any other of the United States, and having a temporary residence therein, to bring with him or her any slave or servant; and on removal or leaving the
State, to take such the number, however, slave or servant out of it; and frightened than the men of the South
What they do will depend on sober reflection and an honest conviction of right, duty, and just.ice
However objectionable these personal liberty bills may be, yet, in fact, what great injury or loss have they occasioned to the South 
Has not the fugitive slave law, as a general thing, been faithfully carried out
Are not the fugitive slaves, except in a few instances, on demand and satis- factory proof, delivered up to their masters
And suppose a few have escaped: is their number or value of sufficient consequence to outweigh the blessings and worth of the Union, and a suffcient cause for its dissolution 
But what fear is there, as far as Mr
Lincoln is concerned, that the fugitive slave law will not be fulky observed
In the first place, he has declared in favor of such a law; and secondly, he will be sworn to see the laws'ofthe Government faithfully executed; and if he does not, he will prove false to his oath of offce
May we not, then, safely take it for granted, both from his declarations and the oath ofoflice he will be called upon to assume, that the fugitive slave law will be safe in his hands, and that all the fears of the South in this respect are wholly groundless
Another ground of apprehension on the part of soull'kern men is, that they will be deprived of what they conceive to be their just rights in the common Territories of the Government
maintained that southern men have an equal right with those of lhc North to go into the Territories and take with them their slavc property
Now it is all true that the Torritories are open and common to all, from the North and South, East and West; and I should like to know into what 'I'erritory the slaveholder is now prevented by any law of Congress from taking his slave prop- erty
None, sir; none
Nor will there be any such law enacted under the administration of Mr
Lin- coln
The Senate and next House of Represent- atives will be against the passage of any such law; and there is the Supreme Court of the United States to pronounce It, if passed, to be unconsti- tutional, as it has already done
It is the height of folly and mad ness, then, for southern men to be rushing out of the Union, and turning their backs upon the Government, and bidding it defiance, be- fore they are actually deprived of any of, what thcy consider, their constitutional rights
'l'his question of concrrcssiontkl l.n•ohibition is nov.,', I think, at an end
Ido not believe that the Republican party will press it, or make any effort to havo it established as the law of our Govern- ment; for the reason that they must see t.hc utter impossibility of effecting their object without a it is not for mc destruction of that Government
to dictate to that party what course to pursue in of such slaves or servants not to exceed the usual I i the present critical and dangerous condition of number of personal or household slaves or ser- vants ',vhich may bc kept and Inaintained by such traveler or temporary resident
After such an exhibition of fidelity to the Fed- eral Constitution, and of fraternal fccling towards the South on the part of New Jersey, ib ought, at 
least, to satisfy the most infuriated disunionist.that the whole North is not abolitionizcd, as he most unjustly supposes, before he strikes a deadly blow at •the Government, disrupting every t.ie Which binds it together
But it is demanded that the northern States which have adopted these personal liberty bills should at once repeal "them, as a condition of the South remaining in the Union
Now, I wish with all my heart that these laws were repealed, on the ground of justice -to the South, and obedience to the Fed- eral Constitution; but whether they will bc rc- pealed or not is yet to be seen
In my opinion, they will be
Already steps have been taken in some of the northern States for that purpose
Let the country; but I know what would do if •a member of that party
It would be to fall back upon sorne fair and constitutional method, by which the disturbing question of slavery in thc Territories might be settled and put to rest for- Is it not high time, for the preservation of ever
the peace and 'fjerpetuity of the Union, that this was done
This question has long been the chief cause of sectional agitation, and of arraying the South against the Notth, until the country now stands on the very brink of ruin; and as long as we have two great sectional parties—the one de- Inandir,g the protection of slavery in the Territo- ries, and the other its prohibition—there will bc constant strife, vchemcnt declamation, and wild threats of disunion—disturbing the peace and cn- dangering the stability of our R.cpublic
Let us now' arrest this great and dangerous evil; and if once this question of slavery in the Territories is are, not •convertible

Republicanism is subordinate to Union, as
everything_ elSe_ig ;and
ought-r.tO* be—Republicanism, Democracy,every other political na'rue and thing; all are subordinate—and they- öüght: to E disap- pear in the presence of the great questiOn Union
5 Let them, then, and with: fraternal affection sand with eyes.fåstened upon,thät bright constellation which has sp long been our pride and glory, let us swear on the altar of our commop country not to permit one star to go down into endlesS night
i do not yet despair of the Re- public, but still see a ray of light „through- the dark and angry cloud which overhangs us, to en- courage our hearts, and lead us to expect:the full sunshine of joy; and peace, and happiness, to break once more upon our broad and beloved land
I should prefer, sir, that the doctrine of non-in- terventibn by Congr.ess with the question of sla- very in the Territories, should be made the basis of our sectional differences; thereby leaving the jeople to determine that question for themselves, like any other of their domestic institutions.
I have longmaintained this doctrine, as it is founded on the great principlc ofall popular Govern men ts— the will of the people; but in a spirit of conces- Sion and compromise, I am ready to sustain and vote for other propositions which have been sub- mitted
It is not my intention now to discuss any of these propositions; and I would simply signify my readiness to support the proposition of Senator RICE, with some modification, to divide the Térritories into two great States, to be called Washington and ,Tefferson; or the proposition introduced by the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr
ETIIERIDGE,] to extend the Missouri com- promise line;and some others which might name, but which is unnecessary at ther present time
I am, sir, as you will perceive, for M)ncessi-on and compromise; and in cxpressing this senti- ment, T am but reflecting tbe views and wishes ofa great majority of the people of N cw Jersey, whorn I in part represent

New Jersey was Lhc third State, in point of time, to ratify and adopt that Constitution as thc supreme law of the land; and her rnany proud battle-fields are rich with the blood of her heroic sons, freely shed in the cause of American liberty

It requires, too, much more real moral courage to display it than to ad- here persisten tly and doggedly to one's own opin- ion and a particular line of policy

 396 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, Sir, if Washington, and Madison, and Ham- • ilton, and those other great patriots and states- men of that day, -could exercise a spirit of •mutual deference and concession to obtain that great end -—the consolidation of the may not we also manifest a like spirit {Or the preservation of thal Union
If our fathers, and such fathers, could do it, we need not hesitate long to imitate their noble examplc of patriotism and love of country
What they did was for us, their de- scendants, that we might enjoy the priceless blessings of, a free and united Government; and let us so act as to hand down these blessings to our children
The greotest glory of a free-born people, Is to transmit that freedom to their children
But, sir, what is the rcmcdy proposed for the •anticipatcd wrongs of the South
It IS secession— peaceable secession, as it is called—but in fact, rc- bcllion
'Now this idca of a Stat.c going out of the Union just when shc plcascs, and upon whatev_cr cause she pleases, and without any causc at all, is so contrary to all just 'notions of the character of our iörrn of government, that it cannot
and must not be tolerated
Why, sir, acknowledoe the right of each State to do this, and whcrc is our boast.cd Union
It is nothing l.)uta rope of sand, of no strength whatever to hold the States together, and which may be broken at any moment at the mero caprice, prejudice, and folly of the
people
All that a State would then have to do, on the passage of any law of Congress distasteful to her, or the election ofa President of •w;hom she disapproves, or upon a whim, would be to proclaim hcr- self out of the Union, and throw herself back upon hcr offended dignity, and what shc calls her re- served and sovereirrn rights
This whole theory of peaceable seces•si0)') is utterly fallacious, and was ncver• dreamed of by the men w ho the Federal Constitt_ltion and established our fin•nri of If it had been thc intention of the govern rnpnt
framers of that Constit.ution to give to any State this right
of secession, a provision to that cflöct would doubtless hive been inserted in it
no; t hc uut,hors of that
sacred ill,strumenl we re en- deavoring to form a Union not to bc broken, but one that would bo permanent, enduring for ages, and forever
Why, sir, the very first Ivords of lho prcarnblc to the Constituti01') which greet our vision go to show that its establishment, was for the purpose, of forminm "a more perfect Union
" Yes " a more, perfect IJnion." rl'hese are the very words of the Constitution itself
And yct we are to be told that, under that instrument, the work of great patriots und statesmen, ttud madc chiefly to bind the States in onc strong and cn- during bond, any ono State, or tnore, may peaco- ably, with or without cause, withdrn.w the and destroy the national Government
such doctrine is true, then the Federal (.)on- gtitution is a failure , and is fail- who thmn have t terly failed in what, they most, cert ainly in te n d cd , nnd so declared, " a more Union
r.i'his idea of secession, however, is nothing new in the history of the cotilllry
It was started years ago, by one of the Icading and unost gifted ot• the South—John C
Calhourl, of South C,arolina
And ever since his day lherc has been lurkil')R about in th&t
State thc dark and treasonable de- Bign of disunion
South Carolina bas been restless for years, and nothing, it seems, will satisfy her but to go out of the Union, and drag (lown the national Government, in the language of onc of' her talented
but impulsive sons, from turret to foundation stone." And yet this day South Car- oiina is suffering from no oppression, or any ac- tual wrong at the llands of the Federal Govern- The domestic institution of slavery is safe men t
within her borders; and she has no iast cause to cotn plain of thc non-execution of the i'ugitive slave law, as none of hcr slaves, or very few, at least, r l'his idca of secession ever ruti a wav or escape
is claimed on the ground that the Federal Consti- tution is a compact between* sovereign States, and that, each State being sovereicrn,aa withdrasval frorn the (Jnion is but an exercise of their sovcr- ei«ntv
But, sir, I deny that the Constitution was an act of the States, or State Legisla tu res, or cma- inorder, " &c., " do ordain and establish this Con- stitution for the United States of America
" It was the work of the people themselves, and a com- pact and agreement between them, und not the States
And hcncc the people alone have a right to modify and change the Constitution and their form of government
It is not true in fact, however, as contended, that the States are wholly sovereign and independ- In becoming parts of one great national Government, they parted with certain attributes of sovereignty to that Government, for the com- mon good of all the States
No State has a right to make treaties, dcclare war, levy taxes, All these acts of sovereign power can alone be exer- cised by thc General Government
And besides, the citizens of each Stato owo allegiance to the Federal Government, and are bound to obey the Federal Constitution, and all laws passed by Con- gress in conformity with it
In fact, if any State should make a law contrary to that Constitution, her citizens owe obedience to that instrumcot first, as the supreme law, in preference to the of their own State, which they may utterly disregard
It is idle, then, to maintain for a State complctc sovereign power, as if tbc States wore rnasters of thc Federal Government, and could destroy it nt pleasure
Said the great MT ebster, on a great and memorable occasion, in the other branch of Congress: This Governmcnt, sir, is the independent offspring of the populal' will
Nay, rnore, if thc whole truth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established it, and have hithert.o supported it, for this very purpose, :unon" others, of imposing certain salutary restraints on State sov- ctoignties, 'l'hc States cannot Inakc war ; they cannot con- tract alliances ; they cannot xnake cach för itself separate
regulations ot• comrneree ; they cannot lay imposts ; they cannot coin money." The right of revolution is altogether another and diflöéent thing from the right ofa pcaccal)le secession, which is claimed as entirely consistent with the Federal •and our iörm Öf national Government
If those
southerli States which (lcsirc to go out ot' the Union: , and break up the Government, base their action on the inherent right, of revolution in the pcople to chanoe and overthrow the Government under which they live, in case of intolerable wron«r and oppression, no one can dispute this right
Bat they do not claim this revolutionary right; nor is there any such intolerable wroncr and op- 'I'l)is• right of a State or people thereof pression
absolve themselves froin all allcgiance to the Federal Government, without the consent of the rest cannot bc admitted
It was long ago dis- puted and uttcrly exploded in a most rnasterly argument, the nullification proclamation of An- drew Jackson, who was called, as President, to exert his great talents, patriotism, and firmness, in then crushing thc hydra-headed monster dis- In his bold and determined language: right of the people of a single State to absolve f.h(nnselves at will, and without 'he consent of the otbcr Statos, fron) their Inost soltnnn obligations, and hazard tho liberties and bappiness of the Inillions cotnprising this Union, eaunot be acknowledged
Such authority is be- licved to be u tterly rcpuonant both to the principles upon which the General Govennncnt is constituted, and to the
objects W'hich it is expressly to attain." But, sir, in case a State docs secede, and declare herself out of the Union, as has already been done, what then

The Federal Government will still move on, notwithstanding their absence
But there are certain laws which the Govern- ment must carry out, and these appertain to the collection of the revenue
The collection of the
revenue of this Government cannot be interfered with by the people of South Carolina without resistance
That revenue can be collected at the harbor of Charleston, under the flbg of the United States floating at the- mast-head of our ships-of-war, and from the parapet of that im- pregnablc fortress, Sumter, now in charge of thet brave and gallant soldier, Anderso_n, whose mili- tary genius and devotion to the rights and honor of his country have covered his name with im- perishable glory
And, sir, I am happy to have It in my power to commend the President for re- sisting the strong appeals made to him to with- draw that bold and faithful officer from the only safe and sure position where the rights and prop- m•ty of thc Government can be effectually pro- tected
Let the President only retnain firm, now that hc has assumed n bold and patriotic position on the side of the Constitution and Union
unfortunnte that he had not done so at nn earlier day, and placed all the forts at Charleston and along the southern coast in such a complete state of defense as would have dissipated all k idea of their capture
If he had only taken this pre- cautionary step, in my opinion, the onward march of disunion would have been arrested, and the passions of southern men "i ven way to sober reflection and to a real sense of their mad and dangerous undertaking
But even at this late hour, I hail with grateful emotions his patriotic determination to execute the laws and maintain the rights and dignity of the Federal Govern- ment
And in this determination he will be fully and cordially sustained by the American people everywhere who love their country, and intend to uphold and defend a Government which, if once destroyed, can never, never be replaced
I am, sir, for peace; and will sustain any fair and honorable measure to preserve it, as I have already intimated, between the North and South
[n this perilous crisis, it is rny intention to rise above merc party, and act for my country, my whole country, and nothing but my country
No man is more opposed to a war than I am—a war, too, between brothers
.1 could enter with my whole heart, and with alacrity, into a con- test with any foreign Power which invaded our rights, and insulted our flag
But to go into u deadly contest with those of my own land is enough to sicken and chili tho heart, and renders the very thought of war indescribably I'lorrible
And yct the laws of the land must be sustained and enforced
The President has sworn to sup- port the Constitution of the United States, and so have, we
'l'he people of this country expect us to do it with stuct fidelity, at all and every haz- ard
T hc faithful observance of tl'ke Constitution and execution of the is no war
It is no just causo for a war, although a war might result from it
But if it should arise from any such cause, who will bring it upon us
Those States and peo- ple which violate, all plighted faith in coming ifito the Union, and now go out of it, setting the Con- stitution and laws ad open defiance, and boldly seizing upon the property of the Federal Govern- mcnt
Tbc faithful execution of the laws is not only necessary for thc protecti0Y1 of the righ ts and prop- crty of tbc Government; but for the very exist- ence of the Government itself
And if there is not suflicicnt, power in this Government to enforce its own laws, protect its own property, and resist open rebellion to its lawful authority, it is high timc the American people should know ar.d un- derstand the weakness of their Government
this is the case, such a Government is not worth living under or preserving; and I am for another, of morc strenglh, and which has the power to ex- ccutc its laws, protect its property, and preserve its own dignity and character
But, in my opiiF ion, our Government is good enough, and stronm enough
All that is requisite, is, that the men who are placed at its head should be faithful to their high trust, and be vigilant sentii')els on the watch- tower of Americarl libert.y
" The price of liberty is eternal viffilance." Our liberty was won bv the blood and treasure of patriots and heroes, ana  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, 957 it can only be preserved by constant and unceas- ing care, and by a resolute determination to resist every effort to undermine and overthrow' it
The men, sir, who would dare to dissolve the Union, and overthrow the freest and best Gov- ernment on earth, would be guilty of a great po- litical crime
I can conceive of nothing more hor- rible than to be theauthors of such an act
Itwould not only entail upon us all the horrors of civil war, and be the downfall of all popular government, but would crush out forever all the noble efforts of patriots throughout the world to give
political freedom to the oppressed and downu•odden by hi&h-handed t.yt•anny
Oh, what a sad spect.acle it would be for patriots and lovers of freedom to behold! The tyrants aud despots of the Old World would rejoice, and sing peans to the down- fall of liberty here; while the toiling bondmen of European despotisms would weep, as all hope of political ransom dies out forever in their breasts
It is our example of Republican liberty that has fired many a patriot heart, and nerved many a bold arm to strike the blow in freedom's cause
And without citing other marked instances, had it not been for our example, who supposes that we would have witnessed the heroic achievements of one of the, greatest generals of this age—Gari- baldi—to relieve his countrymen from cruel op- pression, and Clothe them with the rights and blessings of freedom
Cease, then, ye men of the -W South, all these unholy efforts to dissolve- the Union
Let your excited passions subside, and come once mbre to regard the people of the North as not all Abolitionists, who would destroy your cherished institutions

It ] may be truly said, that we are in the midst of a hement invective, as the true expression of north- ern sentiment
My honest judgnlent is, that the great rnass of northern men havc no disposition to deny to you any of your just constitutional rights
Soon the period will be here when you will see what the Republican party will do, which you so Inuch dread, and which you would make the occasion of the destruction of tbc Government
Had you not better remain awhile before going out of the Union
and perhaps, after ail, Mr
Lincoln may dissipate all your frats, and give you no occasion for taking the fatal step which some of you con- template
In conclusion, sir, it should be tho earnest and patriotic effort of all men, both North and South, to restore, if possible, that cordial and fraternal feeling which once existed between them
Ali ghould endeavor to live up to, and faithfully carry out, all the provisions and guarantees of the Fed- crreat revolution that is hurryino• us on with fear- ful rapidity to the disruption of all the ties that bind this Confederacy together
The fact cannot be- disguised that we are now standing upon the crumbling brink of political ruin; that this once happy and glorious Union of States is now virtu- ally scvercd; that the ensign of our country 's and glory has ceased to float from the i flagsla[-l' of four sovereign States

all allegiancc to the General Govern- i ment
'I'hat other southern States will follow
in rapid succession, unless some just and peaceful remedy is speedily devised, is undeniably true

It is only by submission to law that peace, good order, and In the despotisin Government itself, can exist
of the Old World, the sword and the bayonet gov- ern and hold the people in check; but here it is their own free will, embodied in the laws of •the country which they themselves have made
And may that will ever be on the side of the Federal Constitution and the laws of the land, and be ever ready to act for the good o
the whole country! But above all, may the will of the people ever bc on the side of the Union, as our fathers made it! In days that are past, this Union has been vio- lently assailed and threatened with destruction; but in every instance with utter failure and dis- comfiture to those who did it
In every time of its danger, there have been good and patriotic men, both north and south, east and west, to rally to its defense, as the source of all our maui- fold blessiucrs as a nation
'I' hus far our noble r l'hat Constitution is the su- How Inany stars arc to be blotted out from the cral Constitution
overriding all other law flag of our Ur)ion time will speedily disclose
preme law of the land, The public mind at the South has been preparing for years for the existing state of thin«rs
With Long have many of us it produces no surprise
we witnessed the gradual developmeht of the causes that would inevitably produce the results that are now upon us
Many of the statesmen and patriots of the land have, again and again, warned our countrymen of the " mining and sap- ping process" that was goinff on, which, if per- severed in, must eventually destrov the noble edi- fice constructed our fathers
gut the voice of wisdom and patriotism has been unheeded; pas- sion, prejudice, and fanaticism, have finaity ob- tained the supremacy over iustice and reason; and unless the sober second thou«ht" of the people of the northern States, or their Representatives here, shall induce them to discard their preju- dices, and speedily award to the people of ihc sou thern States their just and constitu tional righ ts, alk is lost
I .can assure you, Mr
Chairman, that there is an irreversible determination on the part of the ship of State has outlived cvery violent tempcst people of t hc slaveholding States to have this sla- and dangerous shock; and pray God she may yet outride the present boisterous gale
Let us not only pray for it, but work for it
There can be, and ought to be, but one ardent wish and strong determined will, in every patriotic heart, to preserve a Union which has cost so much; around wh ich cluster so many precious memories; and which is the true source of all our nation 's prosperity and glory
In the language of An- drew Jackson, whose life and services as a soldier 5 i very a«itation quieted, this
slavery controversy definitively settled
We have submitted for years I to the assaults, injustice, inequality, oppression, and misrepresentations of our northern neighbors
Unless these things ceose, we are constrained, by our our love of peace, and the secu- pity of our property, to absolve ourselves from all connection witli them
This Government was formed by our fathers, to establish justice, msure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common thegefi* eral Welfare, and secure the blessiå$-ö'f:liberty: to ourselvesand Our po'sterity," somé0fthe-ßé great objects, so far •as the slaveholdiriö• States are concerned, it has utterly failed
O(.ii•• Slaver property is' becoming less secure abd less every day
The guarantees of the Constitution, afford us- but little or no protection
hirnany
Of the slave States we are sustaining heavy
losses every month, with no means of redress, Those losses, with the -present feeling and sentiment: abroad in the land, muSt still igcrease
Many of our slaves are now impressed with-the idea -tha&, after the inauguration of Mr
Lincoln, they are to be free
This impression •makes-them -restle'ss• and discontented; renders our homes, our wives, and our children unsafe
Surely no rational man expects us to live with s'uch a state of -things in our midst
We cannot; we will not
Our devo- tion- to the Union; our veneration for the achieve- ments of our ancestors,- our recollection *Of' •their heroic deeds, their perils and suffpriligs, Caritiöt' induce us to subrmt to the wrongs ahdGDjuries thatare now being inflicted upon us in the' name: of the Constitution and the Union
- We -have borne them for years, still cherishing the patriotic hope, hitherto delusive, that a returning sense of justice would induce the North to recede from the irrepressible conflict." We have again and again asked to be let alone in the enjoyment of our rights and our property; again and again warned our fellow-citizens of the disastrous consequences that must surely ensue, if they persisted in refus- ing to us that peace and security which the Gov- ernment was pledged to afford us
These warn- ings on our part they have regarded as idle threats, and consequently our demands have not onlybeen unheeded, but they have recklessly and impe• riously pushed on In the accomplishment of their unjust and unconstitutional purposes, thereby furnishing us with conclusive evidence of -therF unfaltering determination to destroy the institu- lion of slavery
After the presidential election is over, we hear a distinguished United States' Senator exclaim, " to-night, thanks be to God, we stand With the I say to the* men slave power beneath our feet
of the South, who have been threatening the dis- solution of the Union, who are calkingconventions, who are mounting • blue cockades, go on if you In the face of this imperious threat, they dare
' have dared to assei•t their sovereignty and inde- penden&., and demonstrate that the slave power IS not beneath your feet; and they Will dare to maintain it, be the price ever so costly and bloody
This Senator, no doubt, honestly and frankly uttered the sentiments and expressed the feelings of the great body of the Republican party
What then have we of the Soulh to hope for from a party ascending to power, who, in tones of con- gratulation and triumph, defiantly exclaim, "We stand with the slave power beneath our feet, and '•.ve dare them to continuc their threats:of dissolu• tion
What if they do
The inferential ansWer is, ' 'We are in power, with the Army and 'Navy at our command, and they shall submit; w'e rule and they shall obey." The freeman of the South who, under such circumstances, would not assert I and maintain his just and constitutional rights, in 
the Union if he Can, out of it if necessary, is a I fitter representative of a Russian serf than an American citizen
'I'hese expressions of feeling and sentiment, ex- hibited by the dominant party in all the non-slave- holding States, satisfy us that we are a doomed people in the Union, unless the northern mind should undergo a change; of which, I apprehend, there is scarcely a glimmering hope
The result of this constant and unceasing at- tack upon the institution of slavery has now cul- minated in the election of a man to the Chief Magistracy of the nation who bas not only been ceascless in his opposition to the institution, but who has deliberately declared that this nation cannot exist half free and half slave;" that ' must be one or the other—all slave or all free' elected as a sectional candidate, upon the main idea of his hostility to the institution of slavery, upon a platform declaring it to be a relic.of' bar- barisrn, with a distinct avowal that we- shall be denied all participation in the Territoriés of the United States; that it must be •placed 'f Where the public mind can rest in the* belief thit it is in the course of ultimate extinctiön;" that •it shall never  398 the new confederation

, The North, however, should remember that the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15, to an express provision of the Constitution
And one of these States but the other day—yes, Penn- sylvania, the Keyetone of the Federal arch —soi- cmnly and deliberately, in view of the impending perils that now environ our Union, refused to repeal its unjust and unconstitutional legislation
With- all these evidences before us, and number- less others, of thc ultimate annihilation of our property and the destruction of our rights, is there any class of men so blinded by passion, prejudice, or fanaticism, as to suppose for a mo- ment that we will remain in the Union, and sub- mit to these wrongs
If the people of the non- Then, and I fear not till then, will we have our rights protected, and escape from the continual strife, troubles, and annoyances to which we are constantly subjected by our northern neighbors
But, notwithstanding all those things, our loyalty and attachment to this Union is such, that we prefer to remain a part of this great Confederacy, if our rights can and will be protected, and we permittcd to enjoy oür property in peace and se- curily
If this boon is to be denied us, Mis- souri will not long hesitate to go where her honor and her interest if) vite her to go
I regret, however, that candor compels me to slaveholding States •.vcrc occupy-mg our position, say, that L entertain serious apprehensions that the North will never acrain concede to us our just educated in thought, feeling, and sentiment as we are, with $4,000,000,000 worth of property vested in slaves, could they—would they submit
Never; no, never! Why not, then, exemplify that golden rule, SQ necessary to the peace an-cl happiness of the world: Do unto others as you vvould thcy I am not here to-day to utter threats or menaces —that day has passed away—I am uttering that which you know, and I to be true
You I know, as well as I do, that this slavery agitation is rapidly culminating in thc.' overthrow of onc of the noblest Republics that carth ever bchcld; arid nothing short of the most expansive and ex- alted patriotism, sustained by the most
godlike forbearance on the part Df the people of the slave States, has preserved it thus long
Missouri, the State that I ha-vc the honor in part to represent, though assailed u pon e very side —suffcrino• more injury from the enen)ies ot• sla- very than any othci• State in the Union —was dis- posed to bear these wrongs, so long as there was a reasonable hope for their redre»s, and to the people of the frcc States time to reconsider their action, and finally determine whether their prejudices against our instit.ution, for which they are not responsible, and which should not con- cern theü), are stronger than their love for the Union
If they still value the Union, and are desirous of preserving it, ali they have to do, is to give us that which our fathers left us—peace, security, equal rights, and equal privileges, under the Constill.ltion of our common country
If you will repeal you ' '.pcrsonal li betty bills ; ' recocrn and full constitutional rights—nevcr permit us to live upon terms of peace and equality; that
her hostility to the institution of slavery is, so violent and uncompromising, that she will never again cease to assail it as long as it exists in the Union
of such a com•se is the inevitable dismem- INrmcnt
of thc Union, and the eternal postpone- ment of a reconstruction of the Governinent
Momcnlous events, now thronging rapidly upon us, must surely satisfy you of the unfaltering de- termination of the South, whether in or out of the Union, to defend and preserve her slave properly, at every sacrifice of blood and treasure that may bc dcrnanded
We are told that the difficulties betwccn the North and t.hc South should be compromised, in ord(.n• that tbc Union rnay be preserved
Sir, I greatly dcsirc that this Union shall be saved; there is no personal sacrifice that I would not make to perpetuate this Union, for all time to coine, with the provisions of' the Constitu lion fully and fairly en {t) rc,ed
VVithout the guarantees of that instru- ment, I hesitate not to say that tbc Union is a curse, the Government a despotism
What compromise do you suppose the South will ever Inake, yielding more than is surrendcred by thc aunendmcnts proposed by the eloquent and patri- otic Senator from Kentucky
That proposition is so liberal us to excludc us, with our property, from three fourths of the Territories of the United States, while you are allowed to occupy, equally with us, the rmnaining one fourth, south of 360 I and enjoy an equal ight with us, in the form- properly in sla vcs; enforce the execution of the ation of State constilutions south of that line

I would also suggest, most
respectfully, to the Legislature of my State, in session, that, as a measure of peace, prudence, and safety, the military system of Missouri should be imme- 
diately reorganized
The militia should be armed, and all efficient preparations made necessary to our protection and defense, in any emergency, without a moment 's delay
Mr
C littimnan, I propose now to say a few words to my friends in the slaveholding States that still remain in the Union
We are evidently in the midst of a great crisis, involving consider- ations of the deepest and most profound interest
Never was an occasion presented to intelligent men that demanded the exercise of morc coolness, firmness, deliberat.ion, wisdom, and prudence, than the present
What means this movement in which wo are 
In the language of another, ' it means that this confederation of States shali be broken up,and its fragments scattcrcd; that the flag which has carried our næune so proudly alk over the globe—the signal of hope and protection to the oppressed everywhere—shall be struck, and known no more among tbc nations of the earth; it means the overthrow of our national greatness, the extraction of our national hope." Let civil war attend it, and " it means spreading all over our land social alienations; the sundering of fam- ilics and friends; mistrust, jealousy, commercial derangcrnent, loss, wrong, violence, injury, retal- ; all this it rneans, and much rnore that can iation be imtv»ined." i view of these tremendous consequences, with due deference to the judgment of rny southern friends, I must be permitted to say that the action of the Gulf States is too hasty and precipitate
The step that some of them have taken , and others propose speedily to take, is one not only of mo- ruentous interest to them, but they should remem- ber that it is one which deeply affects the action and interests of the other slaveholding States
It may involve them in the most serious and compli- cated diffcu\ties
While I readily concede the right of a State, at any time, to resume all the powers originally delegated by her to the General Govermnent, I snbnnit,in no offensive sense, that it is not respectful to the border States, nor liberal and magnanimous, thus suddenly and rashly to separate frorn them
It may be that this rapid and the States that
havc lion—you have refused, and I doubt not, will I this Union can be l')reserved•, seceded reunited; and we stilt march on to further attainments in greatness and renown
T hc enjov- ment of these constitutional guaran tees by us docs not interfere with any of your rights, retard your prosperity, lessen the value of your property, or endanger your iivcs, and those of your wives and your children; while, on the other hand, they arc necessary to secure to us these rights and bless- In t.he event of a denial of these constitutional rights 10 the people of ny State, I see no other alternative but servile submission and degrada- col')tinue to refuse, and thereby rend asunder all the ties that bind the Union together
Be it so; the responsibility , with all its fearful consequences, wili rest upon you, not us
My section of the Union have never asked nor than its constitutional rights
(Icinanded more You surely do 110t entertain so contemptiblc an opinion of us as to suppose that we \vill surren- der them at your bidding, and thereby make out- sol ves inferiors in this Government
The major- it y of the people of the free States have presump- tuously, to say the least of it, by the election of almost Inomentary action on your parl will ne- ccssarily precipitate other States into revolution before they arc prepared for such an event
In such a crisis as this, big With events, in- volving the destiny of a Rrea-t people, I think it exceedingly unwisc and injudicious for the slave States to act without concert, union, and harmony
We are one in feeline, one in sentiment, one in interest, and we should be one in a common des- tiny
We ought not to separate from each other in the hour of peril, of danger, and of oppression
We should stand unfalteringly by each other, and unitedly participate in a common destiny, whether for weal or woe; and hope the remaining slave If the self-sacrificing forbear- States will so act

309 been willing at least to consult and advise with them, even if they feared a division of sentiment as to the line of policy that should at once be adopted
It seemed to me that the border States, owinff to their dangerous and exposed position, were entitled to some consideration at the hands of the Gulf States
They should remelnbcr that we occupy the position of a rampart between them and, the non-slaveholdinx States; that we stand at the very threshold of danger; that in the event of a civil war, our border cities arc to be sacked, our homes are to be burned, our fields to be desolated, our wives and children to seek security elsewhere, while the contending armies cnoa(yc in a conflict apoli our soil, mote terrible and last- ing than any over witnessed by the inhabitants of this continent
Our friends of tho extreme South should have remembered that the slave States borderino• on the frec Slates have been the great sufferers in this conflict
We have lost a thou- sand times as many negroes as tho cotton States, in consequence of the faithlessness of a portion of our northern neighbors
The very district that I represent—bordering on the State of Illinois, with her tens of thousands of true constitutional men-—has lost morc slaves through the instru- mentality of the underground railroad than any one of the Gulf States; yea, more, I suspect, than the whole of them combined • , and yct my con- stituents are unwilling to break up this great Con- federacy of States, to separate from our friends in Illinois and other States, w 110 have been ing our battles—who have endeared themselves to us by their noble efforts and self-sawificing struggles in defense of our constitutiona, rights— until further efforts are made to obtain from the non-slaveholdimy States justice, security, and the fall enforcement of the guarantees of the Consti- tution
Am I and my constituents, without further efforts .at reconciliation, to assume a hostile atti- tude toward such men as" MCCLERNAND, LOGAN, FOUKE, ROBINSON, and a host of others, who have beet] our friends and defenders, who have faith- fully and fearlessly discharged all the obligations devolved upon them by the Constitution and good neighborship
We may have it to do
I fear we shall be compelled to do it
But in the name of all the noble and generous impulses of the human heart, Ict it-be the last dreadful alternative; let all reasonable efforts first be exhausted to obtain out rights in thc Union
It is now too late, I apprehend; but, in In y judgment, the slaveholding States should, as the wisest and most judicious policy, have held a con- venli0D, published an explicit declaration of their constitutional rights, and if denied to them by the people of the non-slaveholding States, after allow- ino• a reasonable time for their action; or, inter- fered with by Mr
Lincoln or his adyninistration; have pledged ili either even t-, to our lives, our unitedly to fortunes, and our sacred honors, rcst.unc the powers that v,ve havc heretoföre dele- gated, and which are now being perverted by our faithkoss ao•ont.s•
Such a would, probability, have saved the U Ylion, and secured our rights, peace, and safety

Let none of us deceive ourselves with the flimsy hopc that
after this Confederacy is entirely disu membered , and its fragments partly reunited under one or more confederations, it can ever be recon- stru•cted as a whole
The diversity of our insti- tutions, feelings, sentiments, habits, education, and interest, are such we 'can never aoain &Tree upon articlesof association
The South will never consent to enter into another confederation with New England
We shall part-to meet no more
In view, then, of our unfortunate and embar- rassed condition, and the mighty responsibilities pressincr upon us, Ict us, in a spirit of liberality and wisdom, propose amcndtnents to the Consti- tution; and thereafter, if they shall be adopted, Ict us respect each others rights, cullivate friendly feelings and fraternal relations between the two sections of the Confederacy, and pledge anew our devotion to tho Union

Now, sir, I desire to say that I was surprised on yesterday to hear my eloquent and distin- guished friend from Illinois [Mr
MCCLE.RNAND] seriously attempting to establish the proposition that the southern States, in the event of-a sep- aration from this Government, had not the right to obstruct the free navigation of the Mississippi river; and that such an.act would bc resisted to the shedding of blood by the great Northi•vest
'While 1 admit that he dcmonstrated the correct- ness of his position beyond ali controversy, I must say that I apprehend there was no necéssity for anticipating such an event
I have never heard it seriously intimated that the southern States would attempt the perpetration of an act so un- just
and iniquitous
Surely no man can be found so bold and reckless, whose declarations are en- titled to serious consideration, as to deny that all the States of this Confederacy, whether in oe out of the Union, have not only an unquestioned interest in, but a right to the free and uninter- rupted of that mighty river, of which they cannot rightfully be deprived by any Gov- ernmcnton earth, and which they would be fully justified in maintainin« at the point of the bayo- net
I can assure t.he gentleman that, in the event of Missouri being compelled to unite with a south- ern confederation,she will raise not only her voice, but her arm aoainst such an unwarranted assump- Lion of power and, unjust assertiÖn of right
Now, Mr
Chairman, I desirc to say a few words upon the righ t of" coercion " and secession , and I arn done
It is contendedeby the leaderS of the Republican party, that it is thc'däty of the Federal Government to force to compek a sovereign State to remain ih the Union and sub-  400 mit to Federal authority
It may be suggestive to inquire, whethe.r our fathers who instituted this Government, thought so
History tells us that they entertained the opinion—and so declared —that the bonds of this Union could only be pre- served by the cords of mutual harmony, concord, and fraternal affection among the people of the States and the members of the Confederacy
We learn from the proceedings of the convention that framed the Constitution Of the United States that on the 31st of May, 1787, -a clåuse authorizing an exertion of the force of the Xvhole against a delinquent State," came up for consideration, and that Mr
Madison, and others, in opposing its adoption, observed that— 'The more he reflected on the use of force, the more he, doubted the practicability, the justice, and the efficacy of it, when applied to people collectively, and not individ- uaiiy
A union of the States containing such an ingredient, sce:ned to provide for its own destruction
'l'he use of force against a State would look more like a dcclat•ation of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all pre- vicus conpacts by which it might be bound
Ile hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this re- source unnecessary, and moved that the clause be post- Papers, Debates in the Federal Conven- ti01b, vol

Mr
Ellsworth, upon the same subject, said: Ilence we see how necessary for the Union is a coer- cive principle
No Inan preten(is the contrary: we ali sec and feel this necessity
'I'he only question is, shall it bc a coercion of law, nr a coercion of arms
'I'herc is no other possible alternative
Where will those who oppose a co- erciou of law conne out

A neces- sary consequence of' their principles is war of the States I arn ft)r coercion by law—that co- one against the other

2 On motion of Mr
Madison, the clause was unanimously postponed, and never aøain pre- sented
Now, I wc;nld inquire, what is the rea- sonable inference fi•orn this action of the convcn- tion
Is it not that the Constitution imposed CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 15 of the Government they were coÖstructing, and the character of the people for whom they were, acting
Could thc idea have been drawn from the Constitution, by the most remote inference, that when one of the States felt that they were oppressed and tyrannized over by the Federal Gov- ernment, and attempted to throw off the yoke, they were to be resisted by the Army and Navy of the United States, by the whole power of the Government, and forced to submission, not one of the original thirteen States would ever have ratified the Constitution
You know, sir, that they never would have deliberately forged the chains with which they might be manacled, and a«ain subjected to the yoke of tyranny
We all know that it never was the inten tlon of the framers of that instrument to provide the means of a mil- itury despotism, to hold one or more of the States as subjugated provinces
Sir, such a sentiment is incompatible with the genius and spirit of our It isa libel -upon the humanity and Government
philanthropy, the wisdom and intelligence, of the noble men who achieved our
independence and constructed our form of government
Will you tell mc, sir, that eighteen of the par- ties to the compact may violate every provision of it, trample upon évery right secured to the other fifteen, and that they have no means of re- dress but brute force
Let me tell you, sir, that it is the common law of this land and all civilized countries, that when one party to a contract vio- •lates it, the other party may, at his option, either have it enforced or annulled
Mr
Buchanan tells us very explicitly that a State cannot secede without violating the Consti- tution
While I approve of his message gener- ally, regarding it as a very able State paper, I am constrained to dissent from his views on the ques- tion of secession
What I have to say on this subject will be brief, not having timc within the hour allotted me to entct• upon an extended argu- I believe that it contravenes no provision men t.
of' the Constitution for one or more of the States not by virtue of uny to secede from the Union; power conft•rrcd upon them by that instrument, but in consequence of the States never havino• surrendered it to the General Govern rnent
The Constitution declares that " the powers not delo- gated to the United States by tho Constitution, nor prohibited by it, to the States, arc reserved I to the States respectively, or t_o the people." apprehend that it will be admitted that the States* may exercise any or albof their reserved powers vv'ithout a violation of the Constitution
It; then, they have never parted with their right
to resume then• original sovereignty, when, in their opinion, the Government becomes destructive of the ends for which it, was instituted, it is no violation of t.hc Constitution for thern to secede
If thcrc is tiny clause in the Constitution by which they de- prived themselves of this right, it has cscaped In y observa t.ion
The President, in the discussion of this ques- lion, for thc purposc of showing that a State has right to disrupt its connection with the Gen- erak Government, and that the Union must bc perpetual, enumerates various powers conferred by the States upon the General Government— part of the Union, and submit to its authority If our fathers had understood and jurisdiction
that each State, regardless of the extent to which it might be oppressed and tyrannized over by the other States, should submit and remain a part of the Union, would they not have provided some common arbiter between the parties to judge of each other's rights, and redress them
They did not
Then, of necessity, each must judge for itself, as well of the infraction as of the mode of redress
know it is insisted by some, that the Federal judiciary is the common arbiter between the par- 11 was not so understood I ties to the cotnpact
by the framers of that instrument or their cotem- poraries
Mr
Jefferson said that the several States comprising the United States of America, are not united on the principle of unlimited sub- mission to the General Government; but that by the compact under the style and title of the Con- stitution of the United States, and of amendments theretÖ, they constituted a General Government iör special purposes; and delegated to that Gov- crnment certain definite powers, reserving each State to itself the residuary masy of right to their and that to this com- own self-Governmcnt•," pact each State acceded as a State, and is an in- tegral party, its co-States forming as to itself the other party; that the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final fridge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself—since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact amorig parties havincr no comrnon judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of Infractions as of the mode and measure of redress." Now, sir, I affirm it is evident from a fair construction of the languao•e used by Mr
Jeffer- son, that he held the same opmion now enter- tained by the great statesmen who insist that this is not a Government of force; that when any one of the sovereign States of' this Union feel that ri&hts are their equality is destroyed, that their subverted, they have a right, which they never to peaceably withdraw from this Con- alienated, federation of States, and resu their ori'-rinal independent sovereignty
And hence, hold that South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Flor- i(la are no longer parts of this Confidcracy; that the laws and Constitution of the United States have ceased, rightfully, to operate within their limits; that they should be recocynized by this Government as independent sovereiL*nties•, that the Federal troops should be withdrawn from within their jurisdictions; leaving the property of this Governrnent in the hands of agents until nc- gotiations in regard to it can be efTöcted between them and t.llis Government
By such a course of action you will preserve the peace of tho countrv, and leave thosg States in a frame of mind favor- able to a reunion, at a proper time and upon just terms
Whether secession or revolution be the remedy by which nn injured State is to redress her wrongs, I do not deem it important
at this time and under existin(' circuunslanc,es, further to inquire
Four sovereign States have not becn deterred; nor will il change the purpose of any other States that may such as the power to makc war and to make, peace ; deterrninc to disrupt the ties that bind them to this to raise and support armies and navié#•, to con- clade treaties with foreign Governments; to coin II Union—call it secession or revolution, peaceable money, and to regulate [he value thereof; and to or bloody—it will not delay their action one mo- They conscientiously believe that they regulate, commerce with foreign nations among ment
He also informs us that in order to are now striking for the security of their homes the States
carry the enumerated powers into cffect, Congress and their altars, for the saföty of their wives a_nd their children; and be the consequences never so has the exclusivc right to lay and collect taxes
terrible, they have coolly Eli')d dblibcratcly Inade I would inquire, how long
The rational answer would be, just as long as tbc Union lasts, and up tlléir minds to meet them with that determined ! will and unyielding purpose t I'lat should ovcr char- from the States that continue in the Union
Now, how the inference arises, from the pos- actcrize rncn born, raised, and educated in the at- mosphere of liberty and frccdom—mell who know session of these powers, that the Government how to appreciate their rights and how to defend was designed, under all circunlgtances, to be por- them
The terrors of civil war, now threatened I petual, I am at a loss to conceive
Could not the by their enemies, with all its hideous and dread- nohe other than a voluntary obligation on the part States have conferred these powers for one hun- of a State to rcmain a member of the Federal diled years or one hundred thousand years

It is an imputation upon their wisdom and intelligence
They, sir, understood the nature and principles and therefore the President argues that they rnt.tst, repudiation ofa Government that denies to thetn of necessity, bc perpctual
Now, it seems to justice and equalfty under a conunon Constitu- tion

upon the Republican party

disappear, the
moment one drop of blood is spitt upon southern soil to force any State into sub- mission
That moment every southern star will fall from the FJ2deral constellation, and the scat- tered fragments of this Union will bc covered with a blood-stained mantle, upon which will be written, in letters of inextinguishable fire, the words, " Eternal separation." Then the last shriek of the Am•erican eagle will be heard amid the clash of arms and the din of battle
Sir, I fondly cherish the hope that peaceful counsels will yet prevail; that these dreadful con- sequences may be averted, and that the people of the non-slaveholding States—who alone can save this •Union—will yield up their prejudices and fanaticism upon the altar of their country; and, without hesitation, tender to the southern Statess in a spirit of noble magnanimity and ex- aucd patriotism, what they believe most consci- entiously to be their just and equal rights
Thus this mighty Government, made by our fathers, can be saved, and by no other means; thus the gloom and sadness of this I-hour c.an be dispelled; thus the sinking hopes of a great nation can bc revived; thus the lovers of freedom can be made to rejoice throughout the civilized world; thus joy and gladness, peace and prosperity, may again be restored to the inhabitants of this great Republic, and the echo returned by the patriots of other lands

I lis party was attacked by the Indians on the plaii)S
He defended the property with his life
He was killed, and the property was carried off by the Indians

It was for that reason 1 wanted the Senator to bring his resolu- tic,n up first; because, if it passes, it will super- sede the necessity of acting on, at least, a portion of thc resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky

on motion of Mr
WILSON, the Senate pro- ceeded to consider the followin«r resolution sub- mitted by him on the 14th instant, and it was agreed to: tinue in forec, until the 3d of March, 1871, the act passed the 17th of March, 1800, entitled An act declaring the assent of Congress to certain acts of the States of Maryland and Georgia,' 'and which, by subsequent acts, has been continued in force until the 3d day of March, 1861, so far as it reiates to the act of the State of Maryland, with a pro- viso, that the duty shall not be levied on any vessel more than once in any month
Mr
PEARCE
to state to Sen- ate very briefly that the original act of Mary- land, to which this bill proposes to continue the assent of Congress, was passed in 1791
pealed an act of the Legislature passed prior to the formation of the Constitution of the United States, and substituted for the tonnage duty therein pro- posed the one which has been paid since the pas- It isa duty of two cents per ton sage of the act
upon vesscls of over sixty tons in the 'l'he assent of Corjgress was port of Baltimore
(riven to the act of Niaryland (which was neces- sary) in 1793, but fora limited time
That assent bas bccn renewed at different periods in some six or seven different bills
The last w' as onc which I int.roduced myself in 1850, and which extended this act to 1861
The duty allowed to bc imposcd is only two cents a ton, and tbc purposes to which it is to be applied are those of tho harbor and port—cleaning them out
The ordinary deposit rnadc in the harbor is removed by means of this small fund
I will mention that there is a proviso in this bill which differs somewhat from the bills here- tot•ore passed by Congress
By farmer bills it was provided that all steamboats should bc ex- empted from tonnage duty; that is, all steamboats cncragcd merely in the transportation of passen- gers; but almost all the steamboats which now come to Ealtirnorc arc in the transporta- tion of freight as well as of no good reason is perceived why the duty should nr»t bc paid by thein as well as by other vessels
There IS another dilTcrencc created this bill
All ves- sels arrivino• at the port of' l).ait.imore were liable to this duty, whether they arrived once a week 01' rllhig bill proposes to reduce the once a month
imposition by lilüiting the charge to once month
I hope there will bc no objection to it
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr

The Secretary read the amendment of the House, which was on page 2 of the bill, to strike out from line eighteen to line twenty-six, inclusive, being the latter clause of section four, in the foliowino• words: And that after the expiration of said delay of two years, the said parties named in the first section of this act, their heirs, assigns, and legal represematives, shall be forever barred ana- precluded frotn setting up any claim or right or to said two lots, or any part thereof, under Lhc title de- rived fronl said sheriff's deeds

From the ord it appears that there will be two or ghree spe- Cial orders coming up at one o'clock

The PRESIDING OFFICER
The is on the motion of the Senator from Pennsylva- nia, to take up the joint resolutions of the Senator 'l fi•om Kentucky
The motion was agrocd to; and the Senate, as  1861
in Committee of the Whole, resumed the consid- eration of' the joint resolution (S
No
54) pro- posing certain amendments to the Constitution of the United States
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr
CLARK] offered an amendment in the form of a substitute for the whole body of the original resolutions
The first question, however, will be on the amendment to the original resolutions, which was pending before the motion of the Senator from New Hampshire was made; and that amendment is, in article one of the pt•oposed constitutional amendments, line fourteen, after the word territory," to insert
' now held 01' hereafter to be acquired;" so that clause will read: In all the territorv now held or hereafter to be acquired south of said line latitude, slavery of the African race is hereby recognized, ec
Mr
SUMNER and others
Let us have the yeas and nays on that
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
IVERSON
Is that amendment suscepti- ble of division, so as to vote on the first proposi- tion in relation to the exclusion of slavery north of latitude 360 
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will suggest that the propositions indicated by tho Sen- ator are not contained in the amendment
They are a part of the original resolution
Mr
PUGH
1 would ask the Senator from Kentucky (Mr
POWELL] whether he deems the amendment material
It is a matter of indiffer- ence to me personally, butl doubt whether it will thcilitate the passage of the proposition
Unless it is material, I think if we dispose of present difficulties, without taking future ones upon in- tercst, it would be the part of wisdom
I suggest to him that it really will impair the chance of the adoption of the proposition
Mr
POWELL
1 will say to the Senator that do think it material, and that s.vas the intcl)tion of my colleague in preserltine the resolutions
1 put this amendment in to make it clear and dis- tinct
I understand my colleague to accept it, as it carries out his oriffinal design
Mr
DOUGLAS.' I think the re.solution would bear that construction at this time without the amendment
I do not think it changes the mean- ing of the resolution
Mr
PUGI-I
Certainly not; but as the future acqui.sitions, if have any, will bc by treaty, where a bare number of one exceeding a third of tho Senate are to hold a nco•ativc, it seems to me we had better leave these questions to the future
As I say, it is a matter of indifference t ; but think it will affect some votes, so far I am informed
Mrt LATHAM
I am perfectly i g to vote for the proposition of thc Senator from Kcn- tuck y, [Mr
CRITTENDEN,] or any other plan to relieve the country from the danger in which it is placed
I approve, most heartily of the ori- ginal resolutions as first printed; but I cannot give my consent to the amcndment now pending, pro- posed by the other Senator from Kentucky, [1M r
If it is incorporated into the original POWELL.] resolutions, of course I will vote for them; but I think it is unnecessary—will lead to misconstruc- tion; and, instead of •being a peace-offering, will be a firebrand thrown into the solution öt• this I will briefly state my reasons whole subject
for tlli* opinion, and if I am wrono- senior Sena- tors can correct me
This amendment is intended to apply to all futuro territory acquired by our Government south of 360 30'
'To my mind it is nothing more than amending the Constitution by an irrevocal)le article, saying, virtually, that the American territory shall bc confined within its present limits
ances is an apprehension existinø in the south- ern mind that the Republican party designs sur- rounding the slave States iVith a cordon of frec territory or free Statcs
They protest against being hemmed in by this method, alleging that in a very few years, from the rapid increase of their slaves, they will require an outlet and new terri- tory to profitably and safely employ them
Now, sir, the moment you incorporate this amendment into your Constitution, this object against which they so much protest will be accomplished
Sup- pose, sir, the time does arrive—ib may not and will CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
for slave labor will be required for the reason before stated, how, I ask Senators, can you obtain it
You cannot cret it by treaty, for you cannot get tvv'0 thirds of this body where tho Republican clement is so strong, ever to ratify a treaty which increases the area of slave territory
, If you want it by puéchase, the numerical strength of the North in both branches of Congress is sumcient, if this fanatical spirit continues, to prevent the purchase of an acre where slavery is to be toler- atcd
The very moment the southern States, at some future period, ivould see this disposition on the part of the North to curtail the institu tion of slavery, and confine it to its present limits, we would have a renewal of the agitation of slavery, disunion, secession, revolution, or whatever else you may call our present troubles
To my mind, the adoption of this amendment limits now and forever the area of our empire
If we cxpand, ib must be in a southern direction
It has been a favorite policy of the Democratic party to acquire Cuba, for which we have been willing to pay $200,000,000
We discussed all last win- ter the propriety of assuming a protectorate over Mexico, with the view, in the process of time, as our population increased, to absorb and assimi- late that people, and make it a portion of our nation
Our people are progressive and expans- ive; and I am not prepared, for one, to vote for any constitutional provision which gives the I power to any section or party to say, " thus far shalt thou go, and no further
" I do not think the people of California would ratify any such provision
Why
Because they have been look- eagerly to the acquisition of the State of So- nora, Lower California, in order that we might have complete control, not only of the Gulf of California, but of the cntire trade and commerce of the Pacific coast
The adoption of this amend- ment would forcver dissipate any such hopes
The Representatives of the northern States would never ratify a treaty or vote money to ob- tain citbcr of thoSe States, if they knew that sla- very was to be constitutionally forced upon the people of thosc States during their territorial con- dition
So we could never he able to purchase Cuba, or any portion of N'lcxico
I know, Mr
President, that this amendment may look pleasing to the southern people, and it may givc a truce to our present troubles; but, sir, in conunon with my party associates, I want to sce this question settled now and forever
The people of tl:e South arc getting very little by the cession of New Mexico as slave territory, for it is not adapted to that institution
Slave labor cannot there be profitable; and though it may be admitted as a slave Slate, it will not be five years before it changes its condition
Then we will be arrain met by this same arcrument of the necessity of more territory for slave expansion; and under this amendmcnt it never can be had
A (rail'), sir: it will be an element of discord when the people come to decide upon these amend- ments
Thc Rcpublicans can weH say to their followers that the South will not be content with thing less than an irrevocablo constitutional cnuctment forcing slavery upon all our future ac- quiMl territory in the South, whether the people want it or not
"I'hc distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr
DOUGLAS] received over one million votes in the recent presidential contest, ail of whom bc- lieved and wcrc committed to the proposilion so often and so ably advocated by Ilim, that the people of the Territories, during their territorial existence, should control and regulate this insti- tution of slavery to snit themselves
How, I ask, can they take away any such right by con- senting to this lasting amendment
The sup- porters of Mr
BreÖkinridge never contended for One of the great causes of our present disturb- anything Inore than the giving of protection by the General Government to the institution of slavery, the same as any other property, in the Territory
Even many of them, sir, would be unwilling to vote for this amendmen t, with all its consequences, as I have before stated t bem
Mr
President, suflicient unto the day is thc evil thereof;" and propositions, even though it is incorporated by
4 mtqority of this body: am, not in the of setting up my opinion against
my elders'

have been in the habit of following the lead •of* distinguished Senators upon all: patty questions, I am never unwilling to assume any responsibil- ity imposed upon me, and I am not now; b9t; to my vision, my associates are•ommitting a blun• der by -inserting these words, " hereafter ac- quired," and will not attain the end they have so patriotically in view
Mr
DOUGLAS
As 1 intimated before, 1 am clearly of the opinion that if these words are not inserted, the legal effect will be the same
If 'this becomes a constitutional amendment, it applies-to all the Territories we have got; and if we acquire any more, it will apply to them the moment we acquire them; so I think it does not make any difference
I should prefer that, instead of insert- ing these words, the Senator from Kentucky would move to strike out the words " now held or hereafter acquired, 3' in the previous lines
Then 
it would stand that in ali the territory 'Of the United States slavery shall be prohibited n'oi•th, and so on
The words now held or hereafter acquired," are entirely unnecessary where they now occur in the first article
It applies to the country '„ve now have, and when we get any more it will apply to that when we get it
If we do not get any more, of course we do not want to apply it there
Mr
BAKER
Allow me to understand the Senator from IlliE)0is; I have no doubt he has studied this proposition with great care
Do I understand him to say, that his opinion is that, as the resolution now is, it recognizes and protects slavery south of 360 3(Y in all the territory that we now have, and all we may ever get to the end of the world 
Mr
DOUGLAS
If the Senator had heard what I said, I think he would have no trouble in comprehending it
Mr
BAKEh
1 did not hear it
Mr
DOUGLAS
I say that when the pro- vision declares that in all the territory of the Uni- ted States north of a certain line slavery is pro- hibited, the provision reaches all tho territory we have now got; and if we acquire more, the Con- stitution will apply to all we then have, and
it will apply to the additions we acquirc just as fast as we get them
W c now provide •cor all the territory of the UJ)ited States
The of it is covered by the Constitution
If we enlarge the boundaries, the Constitution will cover the en- larged boundaries
Hence the provision will ap- ply to the new acquisitionS without its being so stated expressly
Mr
BAKER
1 think so
Mr
MASON
Mr
President, it would seem to me, in strict legal construction, if the words rc- ferred to by the Senator from Illinois were stricken out, and this division were to apply in the Ian-
guage of the resolution to all the territory of the United States, it would be cons&rued to be con- fiw•d to the existing territory—the territory as it stood wl'len the amendment passed
minded that such is the way in which the Supreme Court construed the ordinance of 1787
I am sure, from my recollcction of the rules of construction in the courts, that it would apply only to the ter- ritory now possessed—possessed at the time the provision passed
Bat the honorable Senator who drew these resolutions, I prcscnne, acting upon that construction, has endeavored to make it cer, tain; and I presume further, that his intention was that the term, after acquired territory," was to apply to territory ns well south as north of this line; and it is possible, but barely possible, that that might be the construction placed upon it by thc legislativc mind, or the judicial tribunal that was caflcd upon to construcit
Butatlast, it x.vould be a matter of doubt what was the intent of Con- gress in using the precise language that is found in the resolutions; and the houorable Senator from Kentucky [Mr
POWELL] has introduced the amendment, only to make certain what might pos- sibly be the subject of misconstruction
But, -be- let us legislate for our present territory, without that as it may, if this proposition is to have-any the imposition of restrictions upon the future de- l! value as an amendment to the Constitution, and velopment of the country, the consequences of to put an end to the troubles now existing in- the which none of us can foresee
i country, I am sure
I need not say to Senators on either side of this Chamber, that-it •can never be This is the *ight in which this amendment ap- II received by the slaveholding States unless it is pears to In y mind, and I therefore will not sup- ii not probably come in our day—when a new field port it, althouoh I will vote for the Crittenden made so
Now, I '..vill not undertake to say, bc-  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 16, cauke it will require deliberation, what, in my opinion—whatever that may be worth—would be the construction placed upon the languacre as it now Stands; but It would really seem primcfccie to intend to extend the provisions of the resolu- 'ion to all the territory north of it, and not to extend them to the territory souQh of it
Mr
COLLAMER
1 it so
Mr
MASON
The Senator says he understood it so.- I do not know that on a fair interpretation it would bear that construction; but it ought to be made certain, and if it is to be of any value, it must be made so
The language as it now stands is this— The PRESIDING OFFICER
Will the Sen- ator from Virginia•suspend his remarks for a mo- merit
It iB imperative upon the Chair, under the rules of the Senate, the hour of one o'clock hav- ing arrived, to call up the special orders for that hour
They are all at the disposal of n majority of the Senate; but it is imperative upon the Chair to resent the special orders
{r
MASON
What is the special order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chairwill state the questions as they stand
The bill for the admission of Kansas was made the special Inent to be
The proposition was this.' Mr
Ell's- •pardon of the Senator from Virginia
The Sena- tor from Virginia was upon the floor on this ques- worth moved that be referred to the Legislatures tion
Mr
MASON
I knew it was only a misad- I was proceeding to say, vertence of the Chair
Mr
President, that before this pyoæsition, as an amendment to the Constitution, can be adopted by the slaveholding States, I know I speak their sentiment in requiring that it shall be too ex- plicit to be misunderstood ; and unless thisamend- ment prevails, it will, of course, be of no value
I have not said a word as to the general character of this proposition, because I thought it best to refrain from it; and I shall confine my rcmarks upon it only to those questions that may inci- I shall not speak dentally arise in perfecting it
to thc merits of thc proposition, until I scc what may be thc probability of its passage; but there is one clause of it, which I understand now, although offered separately, is a part of the reso- lution to be submitted, to which, of course, I never can assent, nor, I presutne, others
that which requires the sense of thc peoplc to be taken upon the resolutions as a basis for the amendment of the Constitution
Now, sir, I not prepared , for one, to convert this Government from a republic of confederated States into a con- order for to-day at one o'clock
The Pacific rad- road bill', yesterday, was left, and remains, thc un- finished business
The question arose a few days since, as to the priority of t.wo propositions, one having been a spec.ial order for a particular hour when that hour arrived, and the proposition left unfinished the-day preceding
The Chair has had consultation, he fOels bound to say, with the per- manent Presiding Officer of this body, and he will be governed by his decision, whatever may bc his own private personal opinion; and he learns from him that it has been his practice, and such is his construction of the rules, that the unfinished busi- ness takes priority of business assigned for apar- tic,ular hour under the rule
The Chair, therefore, under that ruling, presents the Pacific railroad bill rllhese, questions are ns now before the Senate
now at the disposition of a majority of the Sen- ate, to proceed with such n-uc•asure as they see fit; but the Pacific railroad bill is now the l)usiness before the Senate
Mr
BIGLER
I move to postpone the Pacific railroad bill and all other prior orders, for tho pur- pose of proceeding with the consideration of the resolutic;ns of the Senator from Kentucky

Mr

I would ask if the 2110tion may not be tunended by sul)st.ituting the Kansas bill, instead of the resolutions or the Senator from Ken tuck y 
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It is compe- petcnt for any Senator at any timc to tnovc to postpone all prior orders, with reference to the consideration of any particular subject indicated by him; and that motion is neither divisible nor amendable

If no further amendment be offercd, either to the original res- o}utions or to the amendment offered as a substi- tute by the Sanator from New Htunpshirc, [Mr

The Secretary read Mr
CLARK'S amendment, which is to strike, out the prcmnble, and all of the resolutions after the word " resolved," and insert: 'I'hat thc provisions of the Constitution arc ample for the preservation of' the Union, and the protection of all the inaterial Interests of t,hc country ; that it needs to be obeyed rather than amended ; and that an extrication from our present dangers is 10 be looked for in strenuous cfiört.s to prescrvc the peace, protcr,t the public property, and enforce the Im.vs, rather than in new guarantees particular in- terests, compromises for particular difficulties, or conces- sions to unreasonable demands
Resolecd, 'I'hat all attmnpts to dissolve the present Union, or overthrow or abandon tbc present Constitution, with the hope or expectation of constructing a new one, are dan- gerous, iilusory, and destructive; that in the opinion of the Senate of the United States no such reconstruction is prac- luaintcnance of tho cxisting nd the t•e10re, to t ticablc ; I,lnion and Constitution should be dirccted all the energies of a!! t11C deparunents ()t• the Government, and the eflör.ts of all good citizens

SIMMONS
Mr

I n In opposed to the amendinents of the Consti- tut.i0kT proposed in thcsc resolutions; but before I proceed to point out the particular objections to these amendments, I will try to explain what I ur)derstand to be the Constitution we now' have
The Senator from Texas, [Mr
WIGFALL,] the other day, in gome remarks -to thc Senate, said that when this Constitution was : ran-led, by the aid of Connecticut, seconded by Mr
Paterson, of New Jersey, the franners of the
instrument were, I prevented from making it a nalional system, and throuoh the aid of Connect.icut and New Jersey, I rnade It a federative syste1D
do not intend to prevails, and the, resolutions of the Senator from li argue tl'iat question, whether not, at this day, Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN] are before the Sen- ate; and the question now is on the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr
POWELL.] MASON
1 hope the Chair will recollect —l am sure hc did not recollect—that was inter- rupted in 111 y remarks by the calling for the spe- Cial order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
TheChairbegs I we are livino• under a Confederation or a Consti- but r will state the proposition as made tution; in the
convention upon which he based this dec- laration, and I ask n) y • friend and colleague—as he can see better than I can, and also read a great ! deal better—to read this debate, 'I'here are sev- eral pages of it
I think it explains Inore clearly than could what the fathers intended this instru- 
of the States for ratification; Mr
Paterson sec- onded the motion; and here is thc debate upon it, which I shall make a part of' my speech
Mr
ANTHONY read, as follows •r Mr
ELLSWORTH moved that
it be referred to the
Legis- latures of the States for ratification
Mr
PATERSON seconded the Inotlon
Colonel M ASON considered a reference of the plan to the authority of chc people as one of the most 'l'he Legislatures have and essential of the resolutions
'Ithey are the mere creatures of the no power to ratify it
State constitutions, and cannot be greater than their crea- tors
And he knew of no power in any of their constitu- tions—he knew theve was no power in some of them—that could be competent to this object
Whither, then nnust we resort
To the people with whom ait power remains that has not been given up in the constitutions derived from them
IL was great moment, he observed
that this doctrine should be cherished, as the basis of free Govern•- ment
Another strong reason was, that•, admitting the Le- gislatures to have a competent authority, it would be wrong to refer the plan to then), because succeeding Legislatures, authority could undo the acts of their prc- having equal deccssors; and the national Government would stand, in each State, on the weak and tottering foundation of an act, of Assembly
T.here "'as a remaininn consideration of some In some of the, States, the govern:nents '•,vere not weight
derived from the clear and undisputed authority of the people
This was the case in Virginia
S01ne of the best and wisest citizens considered the constitution as estab- lished by an assumed authority
Anational constitution de- rived from such a source would be exposed to the severest criticisn)s
Mr
RANDOLPH
One idea has pervaded all our pro- ceedings, to wit: that opposition, as well from the States as from individuals, will be Inade to thc system to bc pro- posed
WV ill it not, then, be highly irnprudent to furnish any unnecessary pretext by the Enode of ratitj'ing it
Added ta other objections against a ratification by the legislative authority only, it may be remarked, that there have been instances in which the authority of the ec»nlnon law- has been set up in particular States against that of the Confed- eration, which has had no higber sanction t.han ratification
Whose opposition will be most likely to be excited against the sys•tenl
That of the local demagog!xes who will be degraded by it from the i:nportance they now rj'hcse will spare no cfforts to iunpede that progress in the populannind which will be necessary to the adoi)tion of the plan, and wh ich every member will find to have taken place in his own, i
he will compare his present opinions with those he brought Witb hiln into the convention
It is of great importance, there(örc, that the consideration 0k' I this subject should be transferred fron the Legislatures, where this class of Inen havc their full influence, t') a field in which their efforts can be less Inischievous
It is, more- over, worthy of considcration, that smne of the States arc avcrs•c to any change in their constitutions, and will not take the requisite steps unless expressly called upon, to the q u estion to tl:c people
Mr
GERRY
'I'i:e arguments of Colonel Mason and Mr
']'hey prove an unconst.itution- Randolph prove too Inuch
ality in the present Federal systmn, and even in the State "0 verrnnents
Inferences draivn from such a source must be inadmissible
Both the State govermnents and the Fcderai Government havo been too long acquiesced in, to be now shaken
I-Ie considered the Confederation to be 'I'he last article of it, any State constitution
alterations, rnust consequently be so as welå authoriz• as the o everything done in pursuance of the article musVhave the smne high authority with the article
Great confüsion, he was confident, would result from a rc- currcncc to the people
They would never agree on any- thing
He could not sce any ground to suppose that the people q.vill do what their rulers will not
The rulers will eithcr coniOrzn to or influence the sense of the people
Mr

Some of the Legislatures are composed ot' several branches
It will consequent.ly be difficult, in these eases, to get the plan through the Legislatures than through a convention

In t11C States many of tile ablest men are excluded from the Legislatures: but may be elected into a convention
Alijong these may be ranked nutny of the clergy, who are generally friends to good government
Their services were found to be valuable in the forrnation and establislunent of the constitution of Massachusetts

It would therefore deserve serious consideration, whether provision ought not to be made for giving effect to the system with- out waiting Ibr the unanilnous concurrence of the States." Mr
ELLSWORTH
If there be any Legislatures who should fiGd themselves incompetent to the ratification, he should be content to let thern advise witli their constit- uents, and pursue such a mode as would be con•jpetent
I-Ie thought was to be expected fronl the Legislatures than'the people
The prevailing wish of the people in tbß eastern States is, to get rid of the public debt and the idea of strengthening the National Government carries with it that of strengthening the public debt
It was said by Col- Qnel Mason, in the first place, that the Legislatures have authority in thi* case; and j-n the second, that their enc-  1861

-As to the second point, he cotna not admit it to bc well founded
An act to which -the States,bytheir Legislatures, make themselvespaities,beeomes a compact from SVhieh no one ofthe•parties can recede of itself

Mr
WILLIAMSON thought the resolution (the nine- teenth) so expressed as that it might bg submitted either the Legislatures or to conventions rcconnnended by the Legislatures
He observed that some Legislatures wore evidently unauthorized to ratify the syste:u
He thought, too, that conventions were to be prcförred, as more likely to be cornposed of the ablest men in the States
Mr
GOüVERNEUR MORRIS considered the inference of Mr
Ellsworth from the plea of necessity, as applied to the establishment of new system on the consent of the peo- ple ofa part of the States, in favor of a like establishment on the consent ofa part of the Legislatures as a non sequi- tur
If the Confederation is to be pursued, no alteration can be Inade without the unanimous consent of thc Legis- Iatnres
Legislative alteraticqns not conformable to the
Fed- era' compact would clearly not be valid
'I'he judges would 'consider them as null and void
Whereas, in case of an .appeal to thc people of thc Unitcd States, the supreme au- tborä.y, the Federal compact rnay be altered by a Inajority of them, in like manner as the Constitution of a particular State Inay be altered by a Inajority of the people of' thc State

Ellsworth crrone

Mr
KING thought with Mr
Ellsworth, that the Lcgis- datures had a competent authority, tbc acquiescence of the people o
America in the being equivalent to a törmal ratification by the people
Hc thought with 2M r
Ellsworth, also, that the pica of ncccssity ivas as valid in the one case as in the other
At the same tinte he prc- fOrred a reference to the authority of thc pcoplc, especially •delegated to conventions, as the most certain means or viating all disputes and doubts concerning the legitilnacy of the new Constitution, as well as the rnost fikely n)eans of drawing forth the best men in the States to decide on it
He remarked that, among other objections made in the State of New York to granting powers to Congress, one had been that such powers as would operate within the States could not be
reconciled to the Constitution, and therelöre were not grantable by the Legislative authority
He considered it as of some consequence also, to get rid o
the scruples 'which some mernbers of the State LegisFatures might de- rive ii•mn their oaths to support and maintain the existing constitutions
Mr
h'1ADISON thoughtit clear that tbc Legislatures ',vcre incompetent to the proposed changes
'Ithese changes would make essential inroads on the State constitutions ; and it would be a novel and dangerous doctrine that a Legisla- turc could change the constitution under which it held its 'lthere might, indeed, be s.omc constitutions existence

ße considered the difference between a tem tbunded on the Legislatures only and one löunded on the people to be the trie difl'erence between a league or treaty and a constitution
The former, in, point of Inoral latter; fn point of obligation, might be as inviolablc as the political operation, there were two important distinetiong in favor of the latter: first, a law violating a treaty ratified by a preexisting law might be respected by the judges as a law, though an unwise or perfidious one
A law viotating a Constitution established by the people themselves would be considered by the judges as null and void
Secondly, the doctrine laid down by the law of nations in the case of treaties is, that a breach of any one article by any of the parties, frees the other parties from their engagements
In the case ofa union of people under one constitution, the nature of the fact has always becn understood to exclude such an interpretation
Comparing the two modes, in point of expediency, he thought all the considerations which rec- ommended this convention in preference to Congress, IOr proposing the reform, were in ravor of State conventions, in preference to the Legislatures, tor examining and adopt- ing it

Mr
SIMMONS
Mr
that explains what the framers of thig Government intended on the opposite side-of the Chamber has treated this Constitution as in the nature of a league or treaty
A compact broken in one part is broken in all parts, said Mr
Webster
I agree with that; but did he ever say this Constitution was a compact
Never; never
Quotations are made from emi- nent men, who make speeches either to get votes or to get nominations, and they are adduced here as constitutional authority
I read this very de- bate and another here fourteen years ago, in the presence of the Senator from Virginia, [Mr
MA- SON.] I read what that gentleman 's distinguished ancestor said on this constitutional question
I read it, too, upon another portion of this subject that I shall call his attention to; and, I think, I shali mention what reply hc made about that time; I but I am now upon this Constitution, and upon the fact that every Senator who has made an ar- gument upon this question in favorof the rightof a State to secede, has based it upon the argument, and solely upon the argument, that the Constitu- tion is a treaty, and not a Constitution
I agree thata treaty which is broken in one part is broken in all, and frees everybody
That was Mr
Mad- ison's doctrine; but he said that a constitution formed by the people is not a compact, buta pact that excludes such an interpretation
Yet, every- body on the other side says it is a compact; and the distinguished Senator from "Ilexas says that the old men who made, this Constitution, of all things in the world, knew nothing about it; that they were very good men for generals, and such like, but they knew nothing about the Constitu- tion
Well, sir, they are good enough authority I for me
would rather road their authority than anv other I could get

tions aright, these amendments a•pætö •be adopted if they are approved of by: thw people- fourths of the States, each-State havingkbütöne vote
That is the way I read
the •resolutipfis
One of them, I am pretty sure, says.so.-'.: it yesterday
I agree that the-Senato$ iggright.in i saying that the amendments are to- the people of the States, and that -the original proposition was made to t•h'e people- of the States; and why was it
It was because this Constitu- tion took from the State authorities many -of: -ihe powers that the people had given to their State Legislatures; and they were not going to have a mass meeting, and let the peopleof Virginia take away the rights thathad been given by thepeople ofSouth Carolina to their State Legislature
They must be the same constituent body that granted these rights to their State government, that should take .themback again and grant them to thisGov- ernment
That is the distinction
Nobody élße was competent to take away the tights of i the people of Rhode Island but the people of Rhodå Islan&themselves; and so with all the regt of: (the States
'l'hat is the reason, and the only reason, that this Constitution was sent to the States; not because it was a confederation, as the- Senator reiterates again to-day, but because powers were given in the Constitution to the national Govern- ment, that could not be taken from the States by anybody but those who gave those powers to them; and they took those powers from •the States in ratifying this Constitution, and gave them to the national Government
I have no doubt the Senator from Kentucky, in his resolutions, has provided the same mode that is pointed out in the i call the attention of the Senator from Virginia Constitution, to let the people vote in each State to what he said this morning about referring these I for or against these amendments
Am Emistaken in that
resolutions to the people
He said hc was against letting the pcoplc vote on these resolutions

Mr
MASON
Will the Senator allow me to interpose a word 
Mr
SIMMONS
Certainly
Mr
MASON
What 1 said implied no distrust of the people whatever
What I said referred entirely to the theory of this Government
This Government, as I understand, is a confederation of States; and when the people are spoken of in the Constitution, it means the people of each State separatiin, as a separate independent political com- munity, each Stato being sovereign
Now, I un- derstand the scope of this resolution is to refer a question of constitutional amendment, not to the States or to the people of the States, as separate independcnt political communities, but to refer it to the peoplc of all the States us a mass
I say that the Constitution never contemplated that the people of the United States, as a mass, a homogeneous mass, should be the parties to the Federal Government; and therefore, withoutany distrust of the people in their separate States, never can aørec to convert the form of govern- ment we now have, from a confederation of Re- publics into a consolidated Government
And, interrupting the Senator for a moment longer, I would refer to the fact, that when the Constitution contemplates amendments to be made to it, they arc amendments to be made to it by the States, as States, either by their Legislatures or by conven- tions, as may be arranged; but in each instance the amendments are to be made by States, and those amendments would not be carried by a popu- far vote, but each State would give one single vöte and one only upon the amendments
The state which the honorable Senator represents, with its population, would give a vote equal to the State it should be; and yet naen will refer to that very represented by the Senator from New York—a qucstion there decided—seven aqrainstit„ avid three i single vote
There was no idea of referring it {01 —and say that that decision was in favor of broadcast to the people, as a consolidated mass
making a confederation, instead ofa natltjnal Gov- I i That is all I wish to save ernment; and every argument that has been made Mr
SIMMONS
I aid understand the Sen, , been so good as to introduce a bill here prescrib- ing the mode in which the vote shall beutken•, as it was taken at the presidential election, and
by the same officers
Mr
SIMMONS
I have seen it somewhere in the printed proceedings
That would certaihl$* be the x.vay
There is no other way to do it un- der the Constitution
Every suggestion, -every argument made use of by every man who spoke in this debate in the Convention as to whetherthe Constitution should be ratified by the Legisla- tures or by the people, no matter whether they were in favor of a Confegeration or in favor ofa national Government, furnishes a complete an• swer to all the arguments that have been brought up here of the right of a State to secede
MB Ellsworth, as much of a Federalist as he was) denied that right under the 'confederation; and every national man from that time down has always denied it
Now, Mr
President, having disposed of that question, so far as I choose to speak on it in this connection, I come to the provisions for its amend* ment; and I have to sav to my worthy arid
dis- tinguished friend from Kentucky that I consider his plan grossly violative of the Constitution it- self
He knows that I speak of it kindly; but 1 cannot in my conscience believe otherwise than I I feel as know these troubles
have stated
much regret as I know he feels at such unwar- rantablc troubles brought upon us from so trifling causes, as conceiye; but I cannot vote for these resolutions, because I think they violate the very spirit of the instrument under which we sit here
Here is a proposition to add five new sections to the Constitution, and to make them and two clauses of the present Constitution irrepealable and una• I should like to ask the Senator if 'he mendable
has thought-quite well enough, and is quite cer- tain enough, that these propositions are sound, to make them, like the laws of the Medes and Per
sians, unalterable, in a free Government
I have read them over but twice
I know they are
wholly impracticable in Rhode Island
We have no such thing in Rhode island as a county organimtiön thal you can sue to recover the value of.a slave
You must have eomebody to sue
Yoti must I have not read: them with have an orcranizatiou
a view to criticise them
I am- speaking of them generally
Here is an instrument-founded by our It has been in opeÉaiion, three quarters fathers
ofa- century, and the countryhag flourished under  406 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 16, it as no other country has ever before done under heaven
There is m that instrument but one single-clause irrepealable, and that is the clause which gives the• State o
Rhode Island as many Senators as the State of Kentucky
That you cannot repeal without unan imous consent, and that is the only one that now remains
There was another about slaves, but the time has gone by, and laws have been passed on the subject
Now, I put this coriparison to the Senator from Kentucky: suppose that he and myself and eleven others had concluded to form a business partner- ship under articles of agreement, and we had agreed to pay in $1 ,000 each, for the purposc of trying to raise water-rotted hemp in Kentucky; we inserted in our articles of agreement that any- body who would put in ,000 could come in upon the footing of the original partners, and that the business should not bc altered without a votc of three fourths of the partners
That would be fair
Well, we thirteen wcnt on and took in partners and raised hemp, and divided twelve per cent
That would be a fair business, not as prosperous as this country has been, but it would bc remu- nerative business
Suppose we took in new part- ners until we got in thirty-nine besides ourselves
Then there are thirty-nine new ones, who can make a constitutional majority over the old thir- teen
They conclude arnong themselves, in a meeting in Wall street, (for if it paid twelve per cent
it, would be from there the new partners would come, and •not from farmers, as we are,) and determine, by their vote of thirty-nine against the old thirteen, to drop hemp-raising and go into slave trading
W c should remonstrate.- We should say: That is an illc'ral business; it is profitable, to be sure, but it is ille«ral b , and you have no Fitrht to change this concern into an Ille- gal one.' 'Elit•y say: It was legal when you made this bargain; you old fogies have changed it since, but we had nothing to do with changing this law; it was law fill traffic originally, whelu the contract was drawn;" and they persist in it
We look over the cc)lltract, a [though it is very different our u [Idcrstanding of what x.vc have agreed to do, yet he and I would bc obliffed to submit
We are law-abiding we believe in contracts
Rut suppose, aft.er (rettin«r us into the slave trade, they should make another provision, that this last speculation never should bc altered without the unanimous consent of the whole partnership; that we should continue the slave trade as long as there wasa thief or a liar in the concern
What would he think of that
We would not agree to it, I know
Hc would say: r Phis is carrying the Business too far." Thut is just the proposition now here
We want to aller t.his Constitution from what Lho fathers made it
We wanl to alter the mode of its amendrnent,and put in seven new clauses that can never be repealed, no matter what public senti- mcnt, 171ay be, without a unanimous vote; so that onc single State, if wc have forty, can rn•cvent I "know, when I thc repeal of' any one of' them
address rnysell' as i do to Ille ono rable Senator from that hc would not vote for that proposition hirnsclfunderanycirctunstances
Hc would contrive some other method to heal these troubles; and I would go with hilY1 with all mv heart; but do not let us tear up this instrumcllt under which we have prospered, which hc glories in as much as I do
I do not want to make, a I speech about it; but I know when love my coun- try and its Constitution
No, man can make me believe thul I do not venerate that instrument; that I do not veneratc tbc Union that it fortncd
I am under no apprehension whatever that there f is a man who hears me that doubts my regard for every one of these States in the Union, and their institutions
I love Kentucky
love South Car- olina
I lived among them more than fifty years aco
I have partaken of their hospitalities
I have walked to the same churches with them, and knelt at the same altar; and a more hoyitrable people never lived
But as much as I love them, I say their present conduct is utterly unworthy of them; and the Senator from Kentucky must know that as well as I do
Bccausc they want i to cut up capers, are we goino• to tear up that ago

They were frightened about insurrec- tion
There is always danger, they think
I never was afraid there in my life, The only place where I ever saw any of this necro equality as it is called, was in Georgia
N man kept a hotel in what was formerly the seat of govern- It was a tavern, a very large one, kept ment
by a Frenchman of the name of Posener
He invited me one day to go up and see his wife
I was a boy at the time
I went up, and found she was a great, burly negress
[Laughter.] I had nothing to say about her
'I'hat was the only time I ever saw that, and I was disgusted with it
I never saw it in New England in rny life, much as the talk is about necrro equality there
These Georgia people can stand their own troubles very well; but when there are any troubles down in Massachusetts, they get in a violent passion
They will have amalgamation and negro equality all around them there at the capital of the govern- ment; but I do not want to say anything about it
1 dislike it, to be sure; but it is not best to make a noise about it
The Republican party cannot insert a portion of the Declaration of Independence into its plåt- form, but it is said that we mean the social equal- ity of the negroes
I wonder if Jefferson meant that when he wrote it
These old men that signed it did not think any such thing
It is " young America" that has brought their doctrine into disrepute
Our distinguished Vice President, in a speech last year, read an old resolution of the Republican party of 1856, in which the word equality" was not in
It was left out for some reason or other
It was copied from that old- fashioned Declaration; and he said that careful scrutiny of it would show it meant negro cqual- ity
There was not a word about equality in it
do not know where he got it; but I suppose all that was there was copied from Jefferson
We cannot makc a but what a diseased im- næination can torturc it into anything, especially in t *lese times
I have bccn to tLcsc national cön- ventions ever since [ can always as a dclcoatc
'l'hc first one I went to, Rhode Is- land bad the honor of voting for the author of these resolutions for Vice President of the United States; and if thc rest of then") had becn as wise as we were, we should have had power to this day, in my deliberate judgment, taking what prov- identially happened;' but we caught a 'l'artar
1 have never voted for a Presi(lcnt in my lifö since I was a voter, when I did not prefer a man born in u 'slave Stute to one born in a free State
I have voted for forty years or more, aud I al- ways preferred them; not because they lived thcre, but because they happened to havc done more for their country, my opinion, than the candidates in our end of the country
Whcnevcr I was in a convention, I never voted for anybody that was not born in a slave State; and whenever there has been anybody up för President, and there were electors running in my State for a man bori'l in a slave State, I voted for him withöut caring where hc was born
I was for Mr
Clay acyainst Mr
Adams in 1824; and if therc had been any ticket rnn in my Statc I would have voted for him, al- though Mr
Adams was a good man and gave us one of thc best administrations I ever knew

We have been pestered enough with vetoes since have been here; and I would rather take the veto away from the one man than give it to two
You cannot along with this Government, it seems, unless you let the minority rule some way or other
That is the whole practical question now
The minority want to rule, and they are afraid of the people— literally so
I wish I- could see a proposition that I could hear somebody who was disaffected say would satisfy him
I have not heard one of thcm sav so
The Senator from Texas said if we would do about forty things that he knew we would not do, he would then consider
That is the nearest approach to a settlement that I have heard 
[Laugh- tcr.] If we would stop the pulpits, burn the school- houses, suppress the newspapers, imprison thc Abolitionists, and break up this Government, everythintr that is here now, hc would think about staying in

Mr
President, it is a great question
Those people '.vho have seceded will find a bigger sum than they ever ciphered out before
I want to see how they will cipher it out, before we move
Let those people that are afraid take care
tm not afraid
If I were, I should take care
1 would do any thing in reason to rernove this dis- satisfaction

But I want somebody that is troubled, and wants it relieved, to suggest how we can relieve it
Kentucky is as loyal a State as ever was in the Union
They want something, know
The people havo been aroused by this election, as IS natural
All presidential elections excite a crreat deaf of feeling; and for that reason it is the worst tirne
in the world to try to amend the Con- stitution
They havc talked it so long that they begin to believe it themselves, that tbc Republi- can party Ineans to endanger their institutions
I said here four years ago, when first took my seat under a neur name—I used to come under anot.hcn• name—I was about the samc man I was before—and I said that if i found myself in a party that undertook to disturb the institutions of the South, I would quit that party immediately

I have no such party attachment as would keep me in a party that i lhought meant to break the Consti- tution
As to the President elect, hc is from Kentucky
All his social ties arc in Kentucky
As has been well remarked by a Senator, he has not only said what he would do, but he has said what hc would not do; and I do not believe there cau be two in- fercnccs about that
Smne candidates only say what they wili do ; but Mr
Lincoln has not lcfc you to infer what he will not do

The Senator from New York said, that to throats he would offer conciliation
That I would do

He said that to hostile array he would give the right hand of brotherhood
That is good

It w.ill not come while such incn are here.
They will be disposed of beforc that time conics
The Senator from Kentuc._ky believes with me in that respect
I shall not uttera sentiment that he will not agree with
If I do, I will tuke it back immediately
He and I have lived too long to- gcther for me to say anything disrespectful to I never had any uneasiness in reference to him but about one thing, and that was about my children

I have read ovct• these resoluüons, and have said all that I intend to say about making the pro- I hope L he Senator posed amendment perpetual
from Kentucky will run out in his own mind thc idea that I gave him about that, and will fccr.just as I do tr: regard to it
The scries of resolutions introduced by Edmur)d Randolph into the con- vention, declared that there ought to bc a Gov- ernment which could bc changed by a majority I less than the whole That wa« one of the •cardi- nal principles laid down when this Governnwnt was framed
Now, it is proposed to this proposition so that it cannot be changed
r r I-je Senator from Kentucky loves the Constitution as wcll as I do
He
was brought up under its teach- ings
Hc has illustrated it in every speech he has made, and his whole life hus illustrated it
Guar- antees to slavery are proposed as if the Republ ican party intended to invade the rights of slavehold- ers
i'Vhy, sir, they would not have a corporal's 
guard with them in either House of Congress if It would not bc as large as the they attempted it
Tyler party, and that consisted of but fivc
I made some memoranda when Senators were speaking, for thought I vvould answer some of their arguments in detail; but I never did writea shcct of paperover with notes but it bothered me, for I never can read them
I am sorry it has got to be the fashion to take them at all except by the reporters
Now, want the Senator from Ken- tuck y to turn his mind and his cnergies to some method of composing thee difficulties that shall not destroy the Government
1 am willing to say that any interference with slavery in the Stales by the General Government is not among the powers granted to Congress, and ought not to be granted or exercised for all time
I do not believe that the General Government has anv such power now
1 never did believe it; and if you want to rnake it any clearer I would put that in
'The
powers of this Government are as distinct and as independ- ent as if there x,vere no States
The powers del- egated to the National Government are to be ex- ercised as if there were no States
On the other I hand, the powers that are retained by the States, and the people of the States, are as independent of Lhose as if there was no National Government
That is my doctrine
I am a Slate-rights man as well as a national man ; and the
powers are clearly defined—defined in the book and defined by the practical cxpcricnce of seventy years
1 should like to sce a man bold enough to say that, under t.he authority of the Constitution, the General Government it created could interfere with slavery iii the States in any way, directly or indirectly
I believe in no such doctrine, and I do not believe there is anybody who holds it; at least I have, never scen him, nor do I believe there is a public man in the United States big enough to obtain a vote for President that would ever t.hink of it, of whatever party he might bc
We have nothing to do with protecting it or disturoing it in the States; but in regard to the Territories, I do not agrcc Wilh the new-fashioned notion
I believe we have a right to do cither in the Tcrritorics
have a to (rovern the Tcrritories as we I do not agree in the notion that this please
Government is a trustec of the States for the TCI'- ritories
I never heard of such a doctrine until lately
The Senator from Oregon [Mr
LANE] says that he is for having the equal rights of all the States in this league
Why, sir, they had an alliance in Europe in 1815—1 think it was the treaty of Vicn- na—whcre the five great Powers agreed together to take care of the rest of the world, and formed what was called " The Holy Alliance;" and I be- lievc it is in being yet, and that lhcre was a talk of calling them together to take care of Italy
r l'hat alliance consisted of Enplnnd, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria
If cither of those Poxvvers, during the last forty-five years, had discovered a new country, do you suppose it would give up its own title to it, and say it held it for the alliance
If a treaty of alliance for boundaries and the balance stitution
Why, sir, if theyareunconstitutional, they are utterly void
Everybody knows that; But who passed them
The first personal liberty bill that has been bandied about here al]xover-hthe Senate, was passed -when both Houses of-uthev Massach usetts Legislature were a Democratic Governor approVing of it; and tt.hé negro equality law passed the same month
This negro equality bill came from the fact that
Mas* sachusetts that year repealed the law •which fore bade the intermarriage ot different races, That •was done by the Democrats, and the- next year the Democratic Governor, who tip_proved those acts, 'beat " Honest John Davis.' I went thero and made speeches to kry to elect John Davis; but he was beaten
Our candidate was not elected by the people; nor was the other man in 1842, •but hc was elected by the Legislature, and next year
he beat us one vote
The third year we- had a national fight, and Ive beat them in Massachu- setts; but we were beaten ourselves in the coun- try in 1844; and that same Governor who signed this personal liberty bili and the necro equality bill, •,vas sent into the Senate for the 'best omce.in New England, nominated by Mr
Polk, and every Democratic Senator voted for Ilim, knowing that that was thc fact, if they knew anything about it; but I do not know whether they knew it or If t.hey did, they would notcat•e a fig about not
it, if he v,ras on their side, but they would say; " this man probabbr hud to get in by promising the Abolitionists to do something if he got their votes;" and that is the way he did get in
Their idea is, " it will do very well if out' folks do it; only let it work for the benefit of the Democratic party, and you may pass personal liberty bills or of power in Europe, had defined stipulated pow- ncgro cquality bills to your hearts' contcnt." ers, anything they did they would do in common as we do; but is there any power here to discover I But nowr they getup here and lay thesc bills to the territory
'l'httt is not one of the express powers Republican party, when the first
Republican Gov- granted in the Constitution, and on the theory of I ernor elected in Massachusetts brought •to ahe all these secessionists, when a ship of John Jacob notice of thc Legislature the vcry provisions in Astor's discovered the mouth of the Columbia that bill which wcre wrong, and that Legislature river, and took possession of it, that ter'lory i altercd them, although they had been on the would belong to the Slate of New York
T hc , statute-book twelve years with all sorts of Gov- Constitution givcs this Government no power to acquire territory
Why is not that territory New York 's
Tbc pox,vct• that discovcrs a country by taking possession of the mouth of a river, takes all the slopes that run into it
That is the doc- trine
If you get into a mndhole anywhere, you must take all the country you can sec
Upon this idcn, it, would belong to New York, mani- festly•, but it is power incident to the national soverciønty; and so the sailor himself understood and he hoisted tbc stars and stripes there, It, instead Qfthe flag of New York
What any of those other States to control slavery in that territory by virtue of our being trustees for It is moonshine, utter moonshine

The territory belongs to the Government o
the United States as an incident of its sovereignty; and every sailor that could hand-reef or steer would know what flag to put up on a discovered country, without consulting any constitutional It would bc the national fla«r

My friend from Kentucky knows that
believes it
We acquire territory in consequencc ernors, and nobody ever thought of them until Governor Banks called attention to them
And yet thcsc arc the grave charges thu•.own up herc against Republican party, ntld made tho oc- brealcing up this Government—such camon for kind of things as these
do not care what kind of laws they pass in Georgia or South Carolina affecting us; only I do not like to see those laws imprisoninc our sailors because they are poor iöllows
South Carolina made a law of that
kind; but when she wanted to get trade with Eilgland, ghe repealed it in refer- crencc to forcio•n countries, but kept it on in ref- erence to her own brothers
That is the way they treat, us; but we are not goincr to firht about it, or quarrel over it
Our law in Rhode Island was passed six 01' eight years before there ever was a Rcpnblican party there—and there were more than I six times as many Whigs who voted against it as there were Democrats
Two of the leading Whig mcmbcrs madc speeches against it; but they were bcaten
Aftcrwards, one of those men who opposed it carne to be chicf justice of OUr State
of our national sovereignty
Thcrc is no express He was on the committee to revise the statutcs— to make a code—and hc pared that thing all down, power in tl-i0 Constitution for it
It is an incident to sovereignty, an incident to the war and treaty and got it so that it was inoffensive; and be said that, if it were not for making a noise, he would making powers
YVe own the territory
The strike it out altogcther
They pared it down and, States have no more to do with it than the Em- peror of France—not a bit more; and this Gov- I i when all thc virus was out, it was voted for unan- ernmcnt has nothing to do with their local affairs, imously by a Republican Legislature, after every except to protect them
That we are bound to part of it Illtuevcn savored of unconstitutionality was taken out
We do not want any unconsti- do
We have given them guarantees to take care of them, to save them frotn themselves,ifthcv have tutional laws in Rhode Island, nor do they in I know they have been pretty disturbances among thcmselvcs, and call upon us; Massachusetts

I never did like them any too much
They there is any disturbance
There is no man here but is willing to prevent any invasion of any banished our ancestors, hung the Quakers, and State for the purposes of injury arid annoyance, killed folks for being witches
[Laughter.] I do not believe in that doctrine; but still, Massachu- and to punish those engaged in it
This was brought up against the Republican setts is a pretty considerable State
She was party
Everything that has been done for the thought so in the Lime of the Revolution; and I last twenty years is charged to the Republican madc up my mind, on account of what she did party, which in my State did not exist until four then, never to harbor any hard feeling toward years ago last May
That was the first rnecting her for what she had done before, although she had done a good n'lany bad things
I do not mean they ever hold there under thcir organization— flt•st time they ever got together
When were to have any hard feelings toward any State, or the personal liberty bills, which are said to be an the people of any State, but I cannot go quite as infraction of tl)is treaty, passed
Massachusetts far as the Senator from New York; för think is arraigned here every other day for having the millennium has not come, though have full passed personal fiberty bills infracting the Con- faith that it wili come
I do nob know of a man  408 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 16, in the country who could say as much as he did with as much propriety
It
is something like a pendulum—the further it swings one way, of its own momentum, it will swing just so much fuF ther the other way
I keep pretty nearly right up and down, as well as I can
I do not want to be so straight that I must lean over, although I am bent a little by age; and therefore I do not mean to go very far from my moorings
I have always held' to these opinions, and do not mean to change them if 1 can help it
There may be circumstances which wiil oblige me to do so
But I regretted, more than anything else in this to sec a sort of disposition to heap every- thing upon this Republican party, as if they made this fuss
The Senator from Illinois [Mr
Douc- Lis] says: | told you so three or four years I do not know but he did
There is a ago." great deal of logic in facts, and we have been told so" until we have carried pretty nearly all the free States
A great deal of It came from its being told that we meant to ruin the country
I have said for the last three years to my friends of the South, that I have met at the Springs, that I believe they had got to this pass, that nothing would convince them that we were not a pack of pickpockets and thieves, but for us to get power, and then their stump-orators would cease to be liars; because we should show them we had no intention of hurting them, and nothing else would I consider it providential p_rove it but our acts
thatAVe have got power so that these distinguished men, before we all die out—old fogies as they call us—may see that this Government can be admin- istered by a Republican Prcsident.to the benefit of all •his fellow-citizens in harmony and peace
Now, I make what are called stump speeches in my St.ate and others; butl never make a speech that I would not utter in the presence of every candidate before the people; never
I was told that up in Harrisburg, by a former distinguished Senator from Virginia, Watkins Leigh
Hc said wc must make stump speeches; and as we did not know he told us how
He said that we must not say anything on the stump that we would 110t say before a court of justice under oath as to the truth
That was his rule, and I havc observc(l that rule I sdid on the stump that I knew all ever sincc
of the candidates before the country; and I be- licved they were all eminently able to ad minister the Government
I would not say it now, because I have seen some things which makes it little doubtful
I think some of them are getting to be sectional
Butl said it then, and I believed It; and I' would not be great ways off now if I were to I think they are all good men now; but I think they have got excited, and are a little dis- posed to give up the doctrines that they mnin- [f' they think they were wrong, I tained then
commend them for giving them up
I do not think there is a doctrine in our plat* forn) that is subject to any just criticism; not one
Now, why should we give it up
It says that we mean to protect the States in their rights, and especially the right to regulate their own institu- tiorns• in their own way
We polled nearly two million votcs, and these voters stand pledged to that doctrine
The Senator from Illinois received twelve or thirteen hundred thousand
Certainly they stand pledged to it, and against this doctrme of Interfering for the purpose of protecting slave property in the Territories
There arc three mil- lion three hundred thousand voters opposed to any such intcrference
They are all against it
consider Mr
Bell's vote just as much on the Rc- publican side as I do Mr
Lincoln 's
I count anybody who voted against the other candidate
I wanted our voters, where they could help Bell, to vote for him
That was my feeling
I think him an honorable, high-minded, and good man; and so I may say of the other candidate; but I do not believe he could have got three hundred thousand votes in this country upon the secession doctrine
Out of four million six hundred thou- sand voles, he could not have three hundred thousand in the country upon t 1is secession plat* form, in my deliberate judgment
He did not get morc than one sixth of the votes as it was
A II the rest of the candidates were diametrically op- posed to this doctrine
Those six hundred thou- sand now come here and demand that all the others shall throw up their platform, and break the Con- stitution, in order to appease them
r l'hat is just the doctrine, as I see it
That is i the logic of these facts; APd I cannot get anything else out of them
1 ask the Senator from Ken- tucky, if that is fair
He would not do it
He and I will do anything that is right; but there is no propriety in denouncincr a great party that can poll a million votes and more
Men have prin- •ciples, feelings, love of country, and they will not be outraged by the surrender of their doctrines
We cannot make our people do it
I might get along with them if I could get home; I would talk as well as I could to them; but they would be mortified and chagrined at a surrender of principle
I should like to make a conøt•cssional declara- tron, if it is needed—and such declarations go a great way—and Ict every man put his name on the call of the yeas and nays in favor of it, assuring the disquieted people of this country that they are safe in our hands; that we mean to protect them in their rights; that we mean to do everything that brothers ought to do to brothers
I Will vote forsuchadeclaration
I will do anything that I can to appease these feelings that so agitate the coun- try, and even agree to alter the Constitution to do it, if you do not put so many things in it
But I would not undertake now to road these resolu- tions through, and find out exactly their positions in a fortnight
I want to think ofa thing as much as a week after I have read it, to see how it is coming out, before I am willing to speak on it
The time has been when I could get up here at will and speak better, without knowing much about the subject; give free vent to my feelings, and go it at large
[Laughter.] But I am old enough to know it is the easiest thing in the world to be mistaken
I would now rather look it over awhile
I hope I have some reputation for speak- ing pretty nearly what I think, after I do look it over; and do not ".vant to Iosc it
I have bcen told that there wcrc propositions here that would satisfy some of the old thirteen I cannot help having a little more regard States
I do not want Georgia to leave us
I for them
do nat want South Carolina to leave us
As to one or two of the " bougllten " States, I do not believe we shall miss them much, anyhow
'I'hcy cost us ten times as much as they are worth, and if they went to-morrow, it would not worry me as much as it would to lose one of the old thirteen, in which I have lived
have lived under every Prcsident that ever I,vas clectcd in this country
They were pretty good men
I like the old thir- I do not want Georgia or South Carolina teen 
to go out
I remember, when I talked about their banks in South Carolina, they complimented me very much ; and I received letters every day thank- ing me for defending them aoainst one of their Senators, who never meant t.o say anything about them; but they took the notion that he did
wish I could tall( to them about going outofthis Union
I would beg of them, plead With them, and im- plore them not to go
I would assure them that they should have always a comfortable berth in this country—better than they can get out of it
As to Georgia, I have strong personal reasons for loving that State
because I have lived in it; and i have ncver lived in any Stutc in which I was not well treated
Rhode island has great public reasons for loving Georgia
The soil of Georgia holds the ash'es of one of the noblest of our revolutionary worthies—a man who was sec- ond only to him who was peerless among men
We want that dust before Georgia goes out of this country
We want to place it in his native land, by his kindred
Let not that dust go out of ' the Unton
We want to bring it LO Rhode Islarid•, and when the last mornirv reveille shall beat, that shall summon his spirit to reanimatc that dust, let him rise, with the sainc flag waving over him that was borne by those grateful, mournful, and gallant Georgians when they laid him to rest
It was then, is now, and I trust ever shall be, the flag of the Union
[Applause in the galle•ries.] Mr
ANTHONY
isthequestionon theamend- ment ofün•ed by the Senator from New Hamp- shire
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
MAs0N in the chair.) The question is on the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire as a substitute for the resolutions submitted by the Senator from Kentuckv
Mr
ANTHONY, Mr
President, shall vote for this amendment because believe it to be abF stractky true, and because I would much rather see the existing difficulties settled by a gcneral enforcement of the laws, and by a general obe- dience to them, than by changing the Constitu- tion to make it conform to any sectiohal or other dissatisfaction
Yet I would by no means have it understood that, by this vote, I commit myself against all measures, or what, in my judgment, may be any just and reasonable measure, intended to compose the present difficulties
It does not follow, because dissatisfaction is unreasonable, that it should not be appeased; especially does not this follow when the dissatis- faction is caused by persistent misrepresentation, which we may hope that time and reflection will correct
It is always with regret, and with distrust of my own judgment, that I diffcr from the distin- guished Senator from Kentucky
Particularly do 1 regret am unable to agree with him in a measure which he brings forward to settle the difficulties which agritate and imperil the country
Distinguished not more for his length of service than for the ability and patriotism with which that whole service has been illustrated, I had been taught, beforc I knew him, to regard him as the model of a statesman and a patriot; and my acquaintance with hin, not now short, has fully justified the opinion with which I approacl'ked i him
But, Mr
President, passing over other objec- tions, [ think there isa fatal defectin any attempt to sett.le the territorial question by a constitutional i do not believe that any amend- amendment
ment that would be at all satisfactory to both sec- tions could secure the assent of three fourths of the States
Four States are already out of the Union, so far as t.heir own act can place them without it; three others are waiting irnpatiently for the forms of secession, which shall sever them from the flag of their country
Seven States would refuse even to consider a proposition of amend- ment to the Constitution
'i'his would leave, in all the other States, but one to spare from a con- stitutional majority
To adopt an amendment to the Constitution requires the assent of twenty-five States; only twenty-six States would vote upon It cannot be presumed that, in the present it
i agitated condition of tlle country, the passions of men collld calm down, and the mindS of men could bo brought together with such unanimity, that all the States but one would render their as- sent to •any proposition for scaling the question that has so long and so bitterly divided them
i might refer to other objections
Even if the measure should be passed immediately through the Senate, and should receive the prompt assent of the House—a very doubtful contingency—thcrc is not time, in the Atlantic States, before the 41h of March, to pass upon it with the deliberation duc to so grave a matter
In the Pacific States, the assent of one of which would bc necessary to its adoption, the vote certainly could not be taken and the, result transmitted here within that time
I think, also, that the provision which makes this amendment applicable to all territory hereafter I acquired, will be regarded all over the North as an invitation to fillibusterism and a provocation to war with Mexico
I know it was not so in- tended by the Senator who proposed it, nor by his colleague who accepted it; but such would be the opinion of its practical effect, and in that ap- prehension I confess I should largely share
But, regarding the primary objection which I have stated as sumcient to control my vote, 1 do not care to discuss the others
1 believe, Mr
President, that if the danger which menaces us is to be avoided at all, it must be by legislation; which is more ready, more certain, and more likely to be satisfactory, than constitutional amendment
T hc main difficulty is the territorial question
The demand of the Senators on the other side of the Chamber, and of those whom they represent, is that the territory south of the line of the Missouri compromise shall be open to their peculiar prop- erty
Ali this territory, except the Indian reser- vation, is within the limits of New Mexico; which, for a part of its northern boundary, runs up two degrees above that line
This is now a slave Ter- ritory; made-so by territorial legislation; and sla- very exists there, recognized and protected
Now, I am willing, as soon as Kansas can be
admitted, to vote for the •admission of New Mexico as a State, with such constitution as the people may adopt, This disposes of all the territory that is adapted  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
409 to slave labor or that is claimed by the South
It ought to settle the wholc question
Surely if we can dispose of all the territory that we have, we ought not to quarrel over that which we have not, and which we have no very honest way of acquiring
Let us settle the difficulties that threaten us now, and not anticipate those which may never come
Let the public mind have time to cool; let us forget, in the general prosperity, tho mutual de- pendence, and the common glory of our country, that we have ever quarreled over the question that we have put at rest; an(l perhaps when, in the march of events, the northern provinces of Mex- ico are brought under our sway, they may come in without a ripple on the political sea, whose tumultuous waves now thrcatcn to ingalfus all in one common ruin
In offering to settle this question by the admis- Sion of New Mexico, we of the North who assent to it propose a great sacrifice, and offet• a large concession
We propose to take in a State that is deficient in population, and that possesses but imperfectly many of the elements ofa member of the Union, and ihat will require, in one form or another, cven after its admission, the aid of the General Government
But we make the offcr in a spirit of compromise and good feeling, which we hope will be reciprocated
And now, Mr
Presidcnt, I appeal to Senators on the other side, when we thus offer to over full seven eighths of the frightful chasm that separates us, will you not build the other eighth 
When, with outstretched arms, we approach you so near that, by reaching out your hands you can clasp ours in the fraternal grasp from which they should never be separated, will .you, with földcd arms and closed eyes, stand upon extreme de- mands which you know we cannot accept, and for which, if did, svc could not, carry our con- stituents 
I had not intended to take part in this debate; but since so many have participated in it, I was unwilling that it should close till I had added my voice to the more powerful ones that l')ave been raised on the side of moderate counsels, fidelity to the Constitution, and unalterable attachment to the Union
I wishcd also to express my ap- probation •of the conservative, statesmanlike, and patriotic speech of thc Scpator frorn New York
Tho Senator from Delaware has said that his State, as it had been the first to adopt the Federal Constitution, so she would be t.l'lß last to desert it
That claim I shall dispute with him
The State that I have the honor, in part, to represent, was the last of the old thirteen to adopt the Con- stitution
She will permit no other State to be the last to leave it
She will remain truc to the , American flag so long asa shred of it floats
She I deliberated long, because she apprehended Ihat in entering into the Union she made great sacrifices and incurred great risk of loss
Shc has found I that, instead of sacrifice and loss, it has been all I glory and gain
Mr
President, the times demand wisdom, mor.l- eralion, conciliation
'The Constitution is to bc preserved in thc spirit in which it was framed— by mutual forbearance; by a liberal interpretation of each other's motives, and by a generous con- fidence of the people of every section in the peo- ple of c verv other section
-Whoever attempts to destroy or to impair that confidence points an arrow at tho heart of his country
Whoever at.- tennpts to strengthen or to restore it invokes upon himself the benediction that was pronounced on the peace-makers
However we may be estranged by unfortunate and, I trust, transient causes, we are all brethren Intermarriage and immigra- of one household
tion have given to the families of eitl-ler section representatives in the other
You cannot trace back you e family tree but some of its lirnbs will casb their shadows in evory State
The blood of your ancestors flowed at Lexington , and reddened the sod of Bunker Hill; the bayonets of ours gleamed at the battle of Cowpens; and the sword of a Rhode Island n-:an, to whom my colleague has so eloquently referred, directed the fight at Eutaw Springs
That day he made good the dec- laration that he would rescue the Carolinas, or pcrnsh in the attempt
our fathers achieved the independ• ence of their country; together they laid the {bun- dations of its greatness and itsglorv; together they constructed this beautiful system under which it i's our privilege to live, which it is our duty to pre- serve and to transmit
Together wc enjoy that privilege; together we must perform that duty
I will not believe that, in the madness of popular folly and delusion, the most benignant Govern- ment that ever blessed humanity is to be broken up
I will not believe that this great Power, which is marching with giant steps toward the first place among the nations of the earth, is to be turned backward on its mighty track." There are no grievances, fancied or real, that can- not be redressed within the Union and under the
Constitution
There are no differences between us that may not bc settled if we will take them up in the spirit of those to whose places we have succeeded, and the fruits of whose labors we have inherited
[Applause in the galleries.] The PRESIDINGOFFICER
The Chair will be obliged to order the galleries to be cleared if that noise is repeated
Mr
COLLAMER
As we have probably heard all the discussion that gentlemen desire to make on these resolutions to-day, I wish to suc- gest, as the Kansas bill has los_t Its position upon the Calendar, that it may be taken up, with a view to fix a day for its consideration
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It can only be done by unanimous consent

Mr

I believe thcsc resolutions have never been made a special order at all
Mr

Senator from Vermont will give nie his ear, I wish to suggest to him, if he interms to make ita special order, that to-mor- row, at half past twelvc o'clock, I shall ask the Senatc to take up the deficiency bill
If any other (lay is named, I shall not object
Mr

The motion was agreed to
RAILROAD TO PACIFIC
Mr
BIGLER
I now renew the motion to proceed to the consideration of executive busi- ness
Mr

I ask the Senator to waive that motion for a moment

The motion to proceed to the consideration of executive busi• ness is before the Senate, unless it is withdrawn
Mr

I hope t.he Senator from Penn- sylvania will withdraw that motion, in order that we may take up the railroad bill, and leave it as the unfinished business
After the bill is taken up, I shall be willing to proceed at once to the consideration of executive business

If it creates no diffculty, I will withdraw the motion

These resolutions were laid on the table by a vote of the Senate, and I submit that the motion must be to fcconsider the vote laying them on the table, so as to •et them before the Senate; and then I apprehend, and not till then, could a motion be made to reconsider the vote by which tho aunendment was adopted

Mr
HALE
move that the Senate adjourn
day of answering the speech of the gentleman frorn Texas, [Mr
REAGAN.] I think he perverted my views almost from the beginning to the end of his speech
If he reads my speech, and prop- erly ponders it, he will observe the mistake into which he fi±ll
He took up a remark madc by a colleague of minc [Mr
VALLANDIGHAM] in regard to the people of the Northwest carving their wav to the sea and the Gulf with the sword
'I'ho gentleman from Texas attributed that romark to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr
MCCLERNAND] and n-tyself, and predicated tbc peculiar speech which he made upon that idea, on which ho at.- tacked the gentleman ftorn Illinois and myself
I do not know whether the gentleman from Texas is present; but I have to say this as to that at- tack: every mernber of this House knows very ••.vell the position of my colleague, [Mr
V ALLAN- DIGILAM.] They know that he docs not favor coercion
Yet on a remark Inade by Mr
VAL- LANDIGIIAM, and not by myself, the attack of the gentleman from Texas was hurled against the member from Illinois and myself
The position that I took was simply this: that Ibo President should be sustained
Hc acted on the defensive, not on the acycrressive
The aggression camc from the other side
That is the position which the Legislatut•c of the State of Ohio, composed of both Republicans and Democrats, take in these resolutions
Indeed, that is the position of nearly cvcry northern Democrat on this floor, us '.vill be seen by votes during this scssion
Mr
VANDEVELR

This debate is not in order
Mr
SHERMAN
1 ask that the resolutions be read 
Mr
CRAWFORD
The pur- sued with resolutions presented from State Legis- latures, has been to have them laid on the table and ordered to be printed
I have no objection to that course being pursued with these resolu- tions
But I do not see why the time of the House should be taken up witlfreading these resolutions
I therefore submit the motion that the resolutions T hc motion was agreed to; the Senate be laid on the table, and ordered to be printed, ag adjourned

There is a motion to lay them on the table; and any member can demand that they shall be read
lithe SPEAKER
The resolutions will be read
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 did notundcrstand the remark made by the gentleman froni Ohio just now
Mr
SHERMAN
1 said that, before mem- bers could be required to vote upon the motion to lav the resolution on the table, it is their right to hdve• them read
It is not usually insisted on; but these resolutions are so short, that i think there can be no objection to their being read
Mr
CRAWFORD
only desire that these more, nothi1V less
The resolutions were read, and arc as follows: " ] 
'I'hat the people of Ohio, believing that the preser- vatinti of the unity of Goverruncnt that constitute(l the American peop}c one people, is essential to the support of their tranquillity at home, of their peace abroad, of their saü:ty, of thcir prospcrity, and of that very liberty which they so highly prize, arc firrnly and ardently attached to the national Constitution and the Union of the States
'I'ljat the General Govcrnnnent cannot permit the secession of any State without violating the obligations by which it is bound, under the cmnpact, to the other States and to every citizen of the United States
3
'I'hat while tbc constitutional rights of cvery State in the Union should he preserved inviolate, the powers aud authority ot' tlrc national Govcrnmeut must be Inaintained, and the laws ofCongress fåithfully cntörced, in cvery State and 'l'erritöry, until repealed by Congress or adjudged to be unconstitutional by the proper judicial tribunal : and alt attunpts by State authorities to nullify the..Congti1ü1i0i1 of the United States or the laws 01' the Federal Govern:nent, or to resist the execution thereof, are in their charactcr, and tend to the disruption of the best and wisest system of governrnent ot- the world
4
That the people of Ohio are inflexibly opposed to in- 
ternrcddling with the int.'- rnal affairs and relat ions of oth(.n• Slates or the Union in the stunc rnanner and to the s,-unc extent as they are opposed to any by the people or other States with their (Ioneegtic concerns
"5
'I'hat it is the will and purpose of the people of Ohio to t•tflfill, in good faith, all their obligations under the Con- etitution of Ibe United States, according to the spirit and intent thereof; and they dcnnall(l thc ihitbt•ul dischargc of the sarn(' duty by every State in the Union : and thus, as lar as inay Lie, to insure tranquillity between tbc Statc of Ohio and the other States
"6
That it is incun)bent upon any States having enact- mcnts on their statute-books eonfiicting with or rendering less etücient tl)e Constitution or laws of' the United States, to repeal
then) ; and it is equally incurnbent upon the Gen- era) Govern:nent and !.he several States to secure to every citizen of Lhe Union his rights in everv State under that provision of tho Constitution which guarantees to the citi- zens of each Statc all the privileges aud inununities of' the citizens in the several States, ana thus inspire and restore confidence and a spirit of fraternal feeling between the dill ferent States ot• the Union
"7
'[that the Union-loving eit.izcns of those States WII() have labored, and still labor, willi devotional couragc and patriotisrn, to withhold their States the vortex o
seces- sion, are entitled to the gratitude of the whole American people
"8
That we hail with joy the recent firm, dignified, and patriotic rnessage of the
President ot• the United States, and that the entire power and resources ot• Ohio are hereby pled"cd, whenever nccessary and (lc:nanded tll@ loaitl- ten ance, under strict subord ination to the civil authority, ot• 1.110 Constitution aud laws of the General Govcrnnnent, by •,vhornsoever adrninistered
be requeste(t to forward, forth- 'I'hat the Governor with, copies of the t•oreooinrv resolutions to the President of the nation, and t.() the Governors of an the States of the Union, and to
each of thc Senators and Reprcsentativcs ill Congress f'rom this State, to be by then) presented to cach branch of the national Legislature." Mr
COX
I wish to say but one word in rc- lation to these resolutions
'I'hcy yero not only passed unanimously, both parties concurring, but the Legislature has already begun the work of conciliation
By the action of one of the Houses —the lower I-louse—the fätal stab has already been given to the personal liberty bill, so called, passed at the last session of the Legislature by the Senate
And I am assured by one of the promi- nent members of that body, that the work will go on until every act of legislation of that Statc which can be urged as obnoxious to gentlernen of the South shall be wiped out, and full provision madc for the execution of all the Federal laws of the Union
Mr
HINDMAN rose
Mr
SHERMAN
This motion to lay on the I object to further debate
table is not debatable
Mr
HINDMAN
1 proposcd to ask a question; which i suppose I have the right to do
There is one of these resolutions which, as I un• derstood it from the reading of the Clerk, was in relation to the citizcns of all the States being en- titled to the same privileges as the citizens of any I ask the Clerk again to read that of the States
resolution
The Clerk read, as follows: That it is incumbent upon any States having enact- ments on their statute-books conflicting with or renderino less efficient the Constitution or laws of the United States, to repeal t.henl ; and it is equally incutnbent upon the •Gen- eval Govennncut and the several States to secure to every citizen ot• the Union his rights in every State, under that provision of the C.onetitution which guaranties to the citi- zens of each State all the privileges and iminunities of' the ns in the several States; and thus inspire and restore confidence and a spirit of fraternal feeling between the dif- fermkt States of the Union." Mr
HINDMAN
Now I wish to ask thegentlc- man from Ohio if it is intended, by the latter clause of that resolution, to continue th is work of concilia- tion to the extent of allowing southern mcn with their slavc property to pass through the State of Ohio, and temporarily sojourn there, without being robbed of their property 
Mr
COX
It is certainly not my province to answer that question
The language of the res- olution to which the gentleman refers is almost identical with that ofa provision of the Constitu- tion
I havc merely called attention to these res- olutions to show the sentirncnts which pervade all parties in Ohio, giving assurance that full jus- tie.c will be done
Mr
BURNETT
Iwould like to know of the gentlelnan from Ohio whether, in the measures of pacification the Ohio Legislature is inaugurat- ing, they have initiated any provision for punish- ing thc Governor of that State for refusinff to dclivcr up the trien who stole our negroes
Mr
COX
I think the laws they already have upon that subject are sufficient

ARMY BILL
Mr
SHERMAN
1 now ask for a vote upon my motion to go into committee
The motion was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois, in the chair,) and resumed the consideration of the Army appro- priation bill, upon which Mr
GARNETT was entitled to the floor
Mr
GARNETT
Mr
Chairman, on the first day of this session, the House ordered the ap- porntment ofa committee, 10 be composed of one Incmber from each State, to conster the alarm- ina• condition of the country
Since then, it has been contented to stand with folded arms and si- lent lips, whilo the flames of civil discord daily burnt more fiercely, though it has long since been apparent that the committee can do nothino• to arrest them
And when the history of these tunes comes to bc written, I think the stolid indifference of thc American House of Representatives to the dissolution of the American Union will be recorded as onc of their strangest phenomena
State after State secedes; and yet, though the minute guns successivelv announce that spar by spar, and tim- bcr by tilnber, the mighty ship gives way before
the storm, we still stand, like mere spectators on tbc shore, in helpless bewilderment
I think it time to address ourselves earnestly to the danger; not with ano•er, 01' bitterness, or exaggeration, but with a frank, truthful interchange of views, as- cendiDff above the horizon of party, as men upon whom + rovidcncc has cast the fearful responsibil- ities bclonginø to those exceptional occasions in a nation's lifö, which determine its destinies, and affect the course of the world 's history for gener- ations yet unborn
It is in this spirit, sir, that I ent(-n• the debate
He who traces back the present troubles only to the 6th day of November last, would be but a sha110',v observer
Their causes are to be found, not in the niece election of Lincoln and Hamlin, House, which are understood to be the sarne, in but in the fact which that election disclosed: principle, as those adopted by what is known as II this once equal Union of sovereign Republics had changed into the dominion of one section over the border State committee

printed
 412 This revolution is not the less complctc, because, as in Rome under Augustus, the old forms and names of the Constitutiou are preserved
Such great historical changes are never sudden; nor is this an excepti0Yl
In years past, the anti-slavery party had, after many vicissitudes of fortune, broken down the great historic party of the Whigs, and the even stronger, though more ephemeral, organization of the Know Nothings; but now it has burst through the last line ofouédefenses, and, routing the Dem- ocratic forces, it has seized the scepter of Ameri- can empire—the object of its long ambition, of its patient toil
Under the nume of Republicans, it has obtained every electoral vote, except three, in the eighteen non-slaveholding States, against and over the unanimous voice of thc fifteen slavehold- ing States
Nor is its majority in electoral votes only
Its popular vote is one million cight hun- dred and thirty-onc thousand one hundred and sixty-eight, against one million five hundred and It has a seventy-four thousand and ninety-one
plurality of the popular vote in Orogon and Cali- fornia, and an absolute majority in every north- ern State this side of [hc Rocky Mountains except gallant New Jersey, where alone it was beaten
Nor is this strength a thing of yesterday—a sum- mer cloud which we may hope will pass away as rapidly as it gathered
Since the anti-slavery can- didate, Birney, received seven thousand and fifty- nine votes in 1840, each presidential election has shown a steady growth in the party vote, except in 1852, when it met an accidental and ternporary check
The intermediate State elections show the same progression
'This party, then, now culling itself Republican , has steadily advanced for many years, until it has gained possession of all the northern States, in every r.lepartmcnt ofthcir State governments, with It controls this I•lousc of very fcw exceptions

January 16, another class that does not look upon it as a wrong

'l'he sentiment that contemplates the institution of Slavery in this country as a wrong, is the sentil»ent of the Republican It is the sentiment around which all their actions, patty
all their arguments, circle; frorn which all their proposi- tioris radiate
Thev look upon it as being a moral, social, and political wrona•." " They in- sist that it should, us far as may be, be treated as a wronn • and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong, is to make provision that it Shau grow no larger
'I'hey ajso desire a policy that looks to a Ocaceful end of slavery at some time, as beinc wronn." The omcial platforms of the party confirm these It was first organized declarations of its leader
because no existing party made anti-slavery opin- ions a test in its nominations
The Abolition or Liberty party of 1840—44 was succeeded by the so-called " Free Democratic party," or Buffalo men of 1848—52
Meantime the Whig party had been dissolved by dissension between its north- ern and southern winms on this same question of slavery; and a like fate befell its successor—the American party
Its northern elements, uniting with this " Free Democracy" on the anti-slavery idea, cast over onc million throe hundred thousand votes, as Republicans, in 1856; and have now elected their President
Like every great party, it contains men of various shades of opinion, morc or less extreme; but, as in all such cases, the extreme men, those who carry the leading idea of the party to its logical consequences, and are truest to it, must ultimately govern and control the others
Even the most moderate arc determ- ined to prevent the extension of slavery into any Federal terri tory , because they considerit a moral, social, and political wrong and evil, which they are bound, to the extent of their power, to limit and discourage
As Mr
Lincoln says, any man " who does not think the institution of slavery wrong;" who docs not " desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time, as be- ing wrong;" who does not " insist that it shall be treated as a wroncy," is " misplaced, and ought not to be Wilh the Republicans
it will bc admitted that it is impos- Now, sir, Sible for the people of any southern State to adopt these opinions without at the same time making np their minds to the emancipation, more or less speedy, of their slaves
In other words, it is impossible fbr any southern people to join thc Republican party without conunencing a total rcvolution in then• internal State polity ånd social organizatibn
Therefore -it is, sir, that we justly charge the Republicans with sectionalism
That surely is u sectional party, which the people in fifteen States of thc Union cannot join without committing themselves to a radical change in their State consiitutions, and a complete overthrow of the entire structure of their society
So long as there urc slaveholding Slates which mean to con- tinuc slaveholding States, so long must the dom- inulion of this party be the dominat.ion of the non-sluveholding over the slaveholding section
will enjoy all the of)icc.s arid honors o t' t be Confederacy, except such inferior places as tnay bc bestowed on tirnc-scrvers or traitors in tho South
The sectional majority will wield the entire of the Union, direct its forei.cn alliances, levy its taxes, hold tho keys of the to under the, its leader
II "Ih•casury, and the gates of war and peace—the But
the heart of' the party, activih proo•rcssive purse and the sword—corninand its armies and olerncut, which inte I-penetrates all o t,hers•, and molds and controls thein to its purpose; which gives it vigor in the fight, and rallies popular cn- thusiasm to its cause, is the an li-slavcry scn tunerlt
As Mr
SEWARD said: 'I'be secret
of its lies in the, fact that it is a party of one idea ; but that idea is a noble one, an idea that fills and expands all gencrous souls—the idea of equality, the equa)ity ()t• all Inen betOre hutnan tri bun ills and II uman laws, as {hoy all aro equal before the I)ivine tribunal and I)ivinc laws." Yes, sir, the Republican party is madc up from the disbanded cohorts of the former Whig and American parties, and deserters from the Demo- cratic, brou:yht together by this onc connnon feei- iog
As M r
Lincoln himseifsaid, "the Republican party is made up of those who, as far as they can, peaceably •oppose the extension of slavery, and I w 110 will hope for its ultimate extinction.' made of strano•e, discordant, and even hostile elements, all fused and disciplined body by cninity• to slavery
More into one strono• emphatica]lv still, Mr
Lincoln says: 
in this controversy—the one prcssina upon '*very mind—is the part of one ciass that looks upou tuc institution of slavery as a urong, and of navies, govern its Territories, and control its dos- 'l'hc rainorit,y section wilk pay its taxes, ! tinies
but direct neither their kind, their amount, nor will help to fight your their appro priation
battles, and to cxtcnd the boundaries of your confbdcracy; but yours will bc the sole gain, for ! he new territory will be appropriated by the majority section for its emigration arid settlement, and the new States whose stars appear in the con- stellation of the Union will do bornage to the institutions of that section, and bc so many pillars of its political supremacy
Meantime, the minority section will be in a minority more and more hopeless
Southern ci vi}ization wilt be wallcd in and isolated beyond hope of escapv, and the enortnous pressure of this huge Federal its patronage and power and moral influence, brought down on southern society to bring about the extinction of slavery
I think do not color the picture too highly
I I District of Columbia
I will admit, for the ar«u- ment's sake, that the Republican party is content to confine slavery within its present limits, and prevent its extension into any new territory
It necessarily follows that there can never be a new slåve State
Our present territory, over one mil- lion two hundred thousand square miles, is large enough for twenty States; and we must expect, moreover, large acquisitions from Mexico
The chief present, restraint on the lust of acquisition is sectional jealousy, and this would not bc felt Its ambition when one section is all-powerful would scarcely be checked by the cost, whether in blood or treasure, of wars and treaties whose fruits were to be exclusively its own; fårit would levy the greater part of the expense from the sub- ject and minority section
Mr
SEWARD, in the recent canvass, repeatedly foreshadowed this pol- icy of acquisition for the exclusive occupation of northern society
The time is not far distant when you would have three fourths of the States, and could amend the Constitution at pleasure
Bat the moderate Republicans tell us that they interfere with slavery only where they have the
power, because conscience commands the abate- ment of this wrong wherever the power exists
How then, when future extensions invest you with a power over the institution in the States themselves
That same conscience will not allow you to rest until you have taken measures for its ultimute extinction
You are eager for the day when you shall have filled up the western tern- tory with free States, and you may number the requisite three fourths
When, in 1820, you terdicted slavery in all the territory north of 360 30', you simultaneously reduced the price of the public lands from two dollars to a dollar and a quarter, in order to sti mulate emigration and hasten the formation of new States
Now, when you think you have finally securcd all the Territories, present and future, you incorporate into your platform, as a principal measure of your party, the homestead bill
You invitc all the nations of' Europe to take possession of the Federal lands without cost; and by this donation you encour- ao•e and incrcasc to the utmost forciøn immigra- tion, already numbering annually more than enough for a new State every year
Meanwhile, the Republican party is necessarily confined to the non-sluveholding section; since as I have remarked, no slaveholding community can join iL without ultimately surrendering its in- stitutions
But how long can any people maintain a struggle which it feels daily more hopeless
How 1013g keep up its spirit under the degrading in- flnence of subjection to a Government from whose power and honors it is perpetually excluded
The strength of the defense, the spirit of resistance, would' gradually weaken
Ambitious and active tempers—some, allured by the power or distinc- lions otl')ers by the mere emoluments of ofiice— would first profess a policy of acquiescence, and then an adoption of those Republican principles which open the door to preferment
Anti-slavery doctrines and emancipation parties would appear in the slave Slates, and the dotninant and sectional party in the Federal Government would, of neces- sity, aid and strengthen them by its patronage and influence
Mcantime the dominant section, selfish as unchecked power must bc, would, by pro- tective tariffs and sectional expenditures, encour- age its own labor, and render the labor of the slaves comparatively worthless
Thus the insti- tution of slavery in the minority section would be localized and discouraged," to use the Repub- lican phrase
Undermined and weakened, and its defenders dispirited or divided, it would prob- ably give way, even before the increase in the number of the free States placed its constitutional defenses at their mercy
Thus far I have traced the results of Repub- lican rule, on the assumption that it is exercised by the most moderate members of the party
But such an assumpt.ion is contradicted by all history
Thc law of life in every party is fidelity to the I idea which gave it existence
If the leaders falter, I aspirants for place thrust them aside with profes- sions of more extreme opinions
The responsi- bility of power, it is true, moderates its possessors; will suppose that the so-called tnoderate wing of but in a popular Government, based on universal tho Repl_l blican party prevails in its councils
I suffrage, such moderation is short-lived
The wili suppose that no direct attack is made on the real power is in the popular masses, who feel sale of slaves between the States, or on slavery none of its responsibilities
At the North thc old 
in the States, or even in the forts, navy:yards-, or l! Federalist leaven is widely diffused, and is espe-  1861
cial\y strong in the Republican ranks
Accus- tomed to construe the Constitution most liberally for power, they will perpetually press their Rep- resentatives to use it against what they deem the monstrous evil of slavery
They claim power to abolish it in the forts and the navy-yards, and to prohibit the sale of slaves between the States, or their transportation on the high seas; and ex- cited by victory,.and goaded on by a fanatical pulpit, this power will surely be used—used when the southern people, discouraged by subjection and diyided by patronage, are too weak to resist
The inevitable end is the emancipation of the African race at the South
When will this hap- pen
Thirty years hence, when the slaves num- ber cight million; or sixty years, when they are sixteen million; or ninety years, when their thir- ty-two million outnumber the present total pop- ulation of all the States
Be it when it may, (and the longer it is delayed the more numerous the slaves, the worse will be the consequences when it occurs,) the destruction of southern wealth and industry will be almost complete; for the exper- iment in the British West Indies has proved beyond controversy—what indeed well-införmed persons knew before—that the African will not work without compulsion
You may substitute the slavery of the law—bondage to the commu- lilty, a system of labor enforced and regulated by legal enactment—for slavery to individual mas- ters; but you will get not half work; and in de- stroying the persona] and hereditary tie between master and slave, you have destroyed not only that which makes the industry profitable, but still more, you have broken up the essential condition on which all that is humane or good in thc relation depends
I will notdilate on the incalculable loss to the North or to the world involved in the ruin of the cotton culture and southern comrnerce and indus- try
My interests are nearer home, where see a country oncc animated by peaceful industry, once blessed with happy homes, once advancing undcr the control of the white race, men proud of their position as peers of any under God 's heaven,—l see this country, its industry extinguished, its homes deserted by the rich, its fields overgrown by the thicket, and abandoned to the improvident laziness of the emancipated African, while the poorer class are left to reconcile themselves as best they may to social and political equality, and ultimate amalgamation with the free blacks
In one word, I see the southern States, I sec Virginia and her southern sisters and daughters, reduced to the condition of Jamaica and Hayti, and blotted from the roll of nations
I ask you, sir—I ask any fair man, whether from North or South—can we, ought we to ac- quiesce in this result
or shall we try to avert it while there is yet time
Yet this ruin is the legitimate, the inexorable consequence of acqui- esccnce in Republican rule, as I have shown
How can we avert the danger
Shall wc trust to a change in the northern 2üind 
But on what grounds shall we hope for such a change
A change means, really, not the merc overthrow of the Republican party, but in that anti-slavery sentiment which created it, and which would then create another in its stead, as MY
SEWARD truly said
Truth is mighty, and will prevail; but the truth is proverbially a slow traveler, and before you can hope to work such a change at the North by ordinary causes, the evil will have been done, and our ruin accomplished
Past history shows that the presen t working of our political machinery has been favorable to the growth of this anti•slavery power
Twenty-five years ago it was not toler- ated at the North itself; its public meetings wrere broken up by mobs; its printing ofiices burned down; and northern Governors recommended its repression bv legal enactment
How changed the scene nom.v, when it controls nearly every de- CONGRESSIONAL GLOBI
419 wise 
Or how can we hope to obtain even a hear- ing there
A fev-,r in the cities may listen to us; but the rural millions, how can we reach them 
The schools, the pulpits, and t.be press, all their literature and all their teachers, daily impress on their minds the impolicy and sinfulness of slavery
Some urge active measures to remedy this wrong; others -would separate the practice from the prin- ciplc—a caution not easily taught to a conscien- tious and active people of the Puritan stock
These sons of the Mayflower will never rest easy under a conviction of their neighbor's sins, with- outaggressive efforts for hiscompulsory sal vation
Mr
Calhoun, as long aeo as 1833, predicted that this anti-slavery töeling would dissolve all parties formed on other issues
And wereit pos- Sible to restore the old Whig and Democratic parties, the history of the last twenty•years would be repeated more quickly
rrhis consequence ne- cessarily results from the organization of political society at the North
In populous communities, where all are of the same race, and universal suffrage and apportionment of representation on mere numbers prevail, the Democracy necessarily becomes a government, or rather, a despotism of the numerical majority
There are many whohave to labor too severely for their daily subsistence to devote much attention to political affairs, or to acquire that training which
IS necessary to free- men for an intelligent judgment of the issues of the day
votes are controlled in great part by patronacye and money, directly or illdirect!y used
•W l')ore parties are nicely balanced, that will be successful which commands the largest influences of this corrupting kind
Hence party contests are chiefly fbr the spoi\s; and there
is a 1858, of the whole population- ohe in every sixty« four was the inmate of an almShouse, and one every thirteen and a half in a condition to require relief from Government offcials
It 'must •have been to such governments that Mr
SÉWARD ferred when he said, in his recent Astor House
speech, that not a State could maintain its ization without the conservative influence of-tliå Federal Government
It is vain, therefore, to expect safety, from 'a: change of parties at the North
Still less is the remedy for our present troübles to be found in any mere legislation by Congress; or even in a repeal of the obnoxious personal -lib- erty statutes of the northern States, except it were evidence ofa change of opinion as to slavery
The present fugitive slave lav.' is stringent enough , •.vere the hearts of the people inclined to obey it
How far they are the contrary, the obnoxious personal liberty bills, the forcible rescue of Captured fugi- tives, the personal peril of masters who clann their property, and the continual retreat of slave population from the border line, where it is posed to increasing hazards, all witness
Nor etin; we hope for the peaecfal and regular return of our fugitives, or the suppression of organized con- spiracies to aid and stimulate their escape, so long as the northern heart and conscience are so deéply impressed with the anti-slavery idea
But, sir, I go further, and assert that it is not for the interest of either party 01' section to leave this question open
The continual struggle can- not longer be endured
It swallows up ail others; makes wise legislation on other subjects impos- siblc; paralyzes every department of the Govern- ment; and breeds hatred, overpowering in intens- constant tendency to increase the number of of- i ity, between the sections
For the interest oc both, it ought now to be finally settled
And for fices, the amount of expenditures, and contracts, and jobs—in one word, to swell the spoils
the South especially, it is neither safe nor honor-- this state of things, when a party appears like i able to depend for security on the mercy of the the original anti-slavery party, animated by fa- North, or the vicissitudes of party warfare
The' natical zeal for a single Idea, each of the great fiftccn southern States cannot safely or honorably divisions of the spoils parties of l)ccessity begins hold their four million African slaveS, their social to bid for its vote, and, instead of resisting, to and political institutions, by the forbearance of yield to its errors
Thus its pril)ciples are grad- ually diffused through the masses, until at last, adopted openly by one or anothcr of the regular parties, they conduct it to victory, and gain Ibr it the coveted spoils
Meantime, the educated and conservative classes, with a few honorable excep- tions, give way to an unfortunate, but natural disgust for political contests conducted by such low arts, and determincd by such unworthy means
They, the natural leaders of society, withdraw themselves from public affairs
They grumble at, but pay, the enormous taxes which support extravagant municipal and State expend- itures
They forget politics, e*cept on rare oc- casions, and are contented to accumulate wealth, to exhaust invention in new modes of luxury, or to indulge as dilettanti in art or literature
The vulgar concerns of Government are lefts fbl' the most part, to political intritrucrs, and corrupt cau- cuses, who control the rowdies and thc ignorant
How strikingly does every day's experience verify this reasoning! I-low different from the men of old is the race of men who now appear in our public councils! I-low inordinately have our expenditures increased! How little regard is shown, or even profössed, for the letter of the, Constitution! In fact, how few even know what it is! How corrupt is our Government in ITearly all its branches; and how little northern constitu- encies scem to care for it! Congress is reduced to the open shame of accusing and-oxpelling its own members for coi•ruption, to be reélected, however, soon after
Scarcely a claim is allowed, or an appropriation made, without the taint of suspicion ; the eighteen northern
thcrefore, that ihe people of the South have judged wisely, when they accept the recent election as proof that the time, long foreseen, has at last arrived, when, the machinery of partyehaving l)ccome impotent for their protection, they must look elsewhere for safety
And in pronouncing this judgment, I would say to our conservative friends at the North, whether of the I)emoeratic or Bell party, tl'lat we fully appreciate their gallant services In defönse of our rights under the Constitution
We admire their constancy under defeat, and their moral courao•e in boldly fighting' aTainst increas- ing odds; and we shall regret that our safety does not permit us to await the chances of other and future battles in conjunction with such noble allies
But we plainly see—and we are sui•e their own candor will admit—that the game would be too hazardous for such momen tous stakes
Even an I occasional party success would but delay for a short time the inevitable crisis now upon us; and it would then be likely to find us weakened, di- vided, and less able- to meet it
On the contrary, we beg them to see that it is the part of prudence to be timely bold, and now, once and forever, to remove these vexed and dangerous interests from the slippery arena of party strife
The public rnind, agtecino• x,vith these views, i is evidently disposed to seek a remedy in amend- ments to the Constitution, which would place the whole subject outside of Federal control
There are two kinds of amendment possible—the one, consisting of declarations that Congress shall or shall not exercise certain powers; the othero:nak
and the army militant of contract-jobbers and ing a new distribution of power between the office-seekers, in national conventions, make the Presidency itself almost as much a subject oftraflic as was the Roman empire in the days of Didius partment of Government, State and Federal; and Julianus

I ask no bettor proof of the firm hold this anti- slavery feeling has ou the northern heart, than the recent disruption of the Democratic party, which was clearly due to the general aversion to slavery, and the determination that it shall not be extended to an V new territory
How could it be other- Governor, and judges, stood convicted of corrup- lion so universal, that there was nonc left to pun- ish it
The New York press, of all parties, is unanimous about ono thing only—the superlative corruption of their In unicipal government, and of their Legislature
But this u nanimous sentiment does not avail to change cither, for they are the governments of more numbers, working by uni- versa! suffrage in a cornmunity where, according to the official report Qf the Secretary of State, in sections
I do not look very hopeftllly on the former
For the most part, promises without the power to enforce their performance, are not worth müch
And if such amendments succeed in closing the controvcrsy on the issues now prominent, yet who can foresee the various
forms in which the anti- slavery feeling will make its future attacks
How can amendments of this character secure theSöüth effectually against the malign influences of the" patronage of the anti-slavery party.- How can they obtain for her a fair share in•thehonors, the influence, and the expansion of-our empire

At the same time, I believe a more radical and therefore more per: manent adjustment would be better for both sec- lions, the North as well as the South
'l'he present Constitution, as our fathers madc it, was all suffcient while it protected kindred and friendly States, and would bc so still, were all disposed to fulfill its obligations with a good faith inspired by mutual good will and respect- There is danger that new declaratory clauses or promises would bc regarded no moro than the old

To secure all this, the South must have an absolute veto -in every departmcnt of tl'Le Government

Let the North condcqnn and the South approvc African slavery
But let both rcn)ern ber that the only safe Union between powerful States, where such opposite exist, is an absolute equality

It would not even involve that quasi-recognilion of slavery, which the Republicans a chic

Surely in the nineteenth century, and here umong this chosen people, " foremost in the popular election- would expel them from their Territories by the northern government, and per- places, and substitute for them men -of larger and more patriotic views
But this would be a work t of time, and meantime the building is falling to pieces over our heads
Nor can it be accom- plished, even when new elections offer the oppor- tunities, if t.he people of the North have ahy rea- son to distrust our sincerity or earnestness of i purpose
Their Republican leaders have sedu- lously taught them that our warnips were empty gasconade, and that the Union was in no danger; and therefore they havc ncvcrscriously considered demands which they did not believe the South i was very serious in pressing
i But their attention is at last roused by the im- I minent peri!.s of the country; and a hearing, would hope, is secured

And lot no man doubt where she would be in the final disruption

The picture would be reversed for these States in a southcrn confederacy, and especially for Vir- ginia, the oldest and the largest; whether she con- siders her material interests or the ties of blood which bind her to her children, scattered in thou- sands over the entire South

The great st.atcsman of the Republi- can party traccd its lineao•c to Plymouth rock, and celebrated its victory as the triumph of the Massachusetts school of politics
He was right
Plymouth and Jamestown, the Puritans and the Cavaliers, Massachusetts and Virginia, arc the great origins of the opposite systems of Ameri- can policy and society
You of the North seem to prefer the Massachusetts school, as you have It rests on the infallibility of majori- ties—the divine right of the greater numbcr to rule absDlutely the lesser
It carcs morc to strengthen the community than it fears to dwarf the indi- Its ultimate tendency is to depend more vidual
on Government and less on individual wisdom or energy; and its final word must be a despotism of nurnbet•s under a military dictatorshil), after the French model
'The Virginia school, on the contrary, is more English
It reduces govern- ment to its tn.i•ninuuqn of power, and relies upon the powers of the individual man for its strength, its prosperity, and its glory
Its motto is, not the Benthamite heresy of the greatest good of the greatest number, but the greatest good of all
F'ounding its society on the subordination QI' an inferior to a superior race, it would combine
the lofty spiril and culture of an aristocracy with the equality of a democracy
If Virginia could forget her material interests, she could" never forego, iOr her sons, the interests of empire
She will never consent to close for them the possibility of playing their equal part in the, drama of civilization
Shc knows that to her school of politics this Union owes its Constitulion and its noblest achievements; a nd that whenever the Massachusetts school pre- vailed, whether under the elder or younger Ad- ams, as at present, the country v,' as broueht to the verge of ruin
Hers were the Eastern portals whence tbc dawning day called forth that morn- ing of American greatness— whose brightness broad hath blazed ; M" hose glorious, 'Flittering li"llthath all Lnen s cyes arnazed." She will never abandon her principles, or those southern States which, sprung from her loins and formed in her similitude, have multiplied her honors, and endowed the Old Dominion with a youth ever new
But, sir, I have wandered from the strict line of my argument
1 have endeavored to show that the real cause of the present difficulties is the
dit•- fercnce between the social systems of the North and South, and the amyressive character of the an ti- slavery sentiment that controls the former, and which has made the Union the U Elion ofa dom- inant, and a subicct section; that tho South would have sought a remedy in constitutional amend- mcnts, had you .of the Republican party shown any disposition to give them
But your hearts are hardened like Pharaoh 's in your pride; and the South could not safely await the slow and uncertain chances of new and distant clections
Some of her States have resorted to the only re- maining course—an excrcisc of the right of seces- Mon, withdrawing from the U l')ion in the smne manner und by the saine authority they entered it
And thus, whether you acknowledge it or not, the Union is dissolved
For, even if you resort to civil war, that very war is in itself an end of the Union as a union between equal States; but with peace, reunion becomes possible
Peace, sir, means reconstruction; it means Union, in sorne form or other, while force is war and inevitable, eternal separation
After blood- shed, and all the evil passions and bittcr hatreds which must follow, it would be vain to hope for I cannot believe that Inany are any reunion
to be found who really wish for the untold woes that follow in the train of civil war
There
may be a few fanatical, or wicked men, whose vindic- tive natures would revel in the blood of their countrymen; but trust that most of those whose perrnitted to keep their slaves, what would become i i sullen indifference now threatens to bring these of their increasing population, shut out from the misfortunes upon all, are acting blindly
They  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
415 deceive themselves with words
They talk of the at home
You are doubtless as brave as we are, enforcement of the laws, and are obstinately blind though not more so; but your soldiers would be led to the fäct that this euphonious phrase is, under on by the unhallowed lust to bring brothers be- present circumstances, but another name civil neatll their yoke, while ours would strike for their war
When you undertake this enforcement ill) South Carolina, or the other seceding States, you will find yourself met by constitutional obstacles on every bail)d, as was well shown in another place by Mr
BENJAMIN and Judge DOUGLAS
In 18132, the case was very different; then the State undertook to nullify only a part of the Fed- eral laws; in all other respects shc acknowledged Federal authority, and her own pcople were di- vided into your enemies and your friends
Now, your authority is in all respects denied; the people are unanimous a(rainst you; you have no party; no officers; neither courts not' juries
How, then, will vou sctaboutthis enforcementofthe laws, this sworn duty as you call it, which, however, you are willing to neglect in all regards except the collec- tion of taxes
You answer, by holding the forts, and blockading the coast
But, if this blockade is to be considered as an act of peace, where is your warrantin the•Constitution
How hypocrit- ICal will seem your zeal to enforce the laws, w.hen your first act is to violate that plain provision of the supreme law, which declares that vessels bound to or from one State, shall not be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another
Or, if you wrested the authority by considering your block- ade an act of war, then the true character of your pretended enforcement of the laws is revealed ; you are at war, and being at war, you have acknow- ledc»ed the government of the seceding State, at least, as a de facto government, the very acknow- lodgment you now refuse to make for the purposes of peace
But, sir, is such a blockade possible
I will suppose you have the naval force necessary, and the revenues, without resortin'Y to loans or direct taxes to maintain it
I will suppose the southern people quietly submit to it even for a year; and nnagine not that their hearts would grow weary, or fail them, once embarked in the great cause
They are the sons of rnen who endured and suf- fercd under the entire military power of England for tcn years, and by endurance came out COI'I- I homes and their altars
I know that fanatics daily depreciate to the northern people•the exertions of the South in the Revolution, and teach that, as slaveholding is the sum of all human villainies, so is it the source of incurable weakness and im- potence
But before they believe such teachers, let them read history
Let them rcmembcr that the words of that noble epitaph at TheFmopylæ: " Go, stranger, and tell our countrymen that
we lie here in obedience to her laws," were the words of three hundred slaveholders; that the imperish- able gkory which still gilds the rocks of Attica shone around a nation of slaveholders; that slave- holders carried the Roman eagles over the wrorld, I and bequeathed the Roman laws for the guidance of all the comil')g generations of Christendom
Above all, and first of all, let them reflect that a nation of slaveholders, but little moro than a fourth in number of the present masters of the South, defied thc power of England, and that to them southern States are garrisoned fbr
their subjuga- tion
The illustrious old soldier A rmy, I regret to bea.ri t said ; has forgottenjiis•tdl-é- giance to his native State, and talrnisheshis laurel's by devoting the last sands of his life to devising plans for her subjugation and the conquest of -the South, and his military aids post with eeeret or- ders in all directions to car*y out their schemes for a military revolution
Yes, sir, let the end as it may, you will find that«you- have waged it at the expense of your own liberties
-Would it not be better to acceöt without cost, at once and peaceably, all, and more than ally it can give
What is the difficulty
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr
STANTON says, the insults to the flag, the denial of Federa authority, the seizure of the forts; he says that the South may perhaps get out of the Union peaceably after a protracted process; but it cannot be done suddenly without war; that it is your sacred duty to maintain the authority of this Government
Now, sir, I take it -that wherevera controversy is settled, each party must allow to the other the benefit of his own point Of view
You regard the act of secession as an act we owe our independence and our Constitution
of rebellion, and each successive step as an ag- Ycs, sirs, when you invade us; when, denying us gravation; but the seceding States claim that they the right of self-government, you seek to make oti\ have acted rightfully; and if they seized the forts, our States dependent provinces, and baptize your i it was only an act of self-defense; in response to accursed tyranny in your brother's blood, I in- your threats of garrisoning them for purposcs of E vite you to be bold in crirnc•, crown it with an coercion
If we desire a settlement, no matter of unheard-of infamy; choose for your battle-fields what kind, it is •„vorse than vain to areue upon Eutaw, Guilford, New' Orleans, and proclaim what is already done
We must facts as they your conquest on tho heights of Yorktown
A y, i sir, before that day comes, the blood of our men, of our '.vomen, and of our children, will have in- carnadined our mighty seas and rivers, and our country shall return- to primeval desolation
Such are the inevitable results of what you call peace— a peaccable enforcement of the laws
Peace ! peace, sach as the tiger gives to his prey
Peace, such as the old Roman gave to his conquered foes—ubi vocant ! I But, sil', no sane man believes that we could be conquered
Ifwc have no ships-of-war, you have vessels in abundance who would accept our let- ters of marque and reprisal; and the same north- ern capital that now engages in the slave trade qucrors
During that period of blockade they I could be transferred to privateering on your com- would have abundant provisions; for every who has studied the statistics of the country knows that the South produces more food, in pro- portion to her population, than the North
For her, it would bc the loss of income only; and while her cotton was thus held up for a single year, what •.vould be the consequences to New England, whose whole supply is drawn from the South; to France, where southern cotton furnishes employment directly to some two hundred and seventy thousand persons, and indirectly to Inorc• than n million
Abov.c all, what would bc the effectofthis withdrawal from Great Britain of three If we did not invade you, we could at merce
least repel your invasion jand cut off your attack- ing forces
Patience alone, on our side, would insure a victory
But will not contemplate such scenes
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr
STAN- TON] yesterday adrnitted that it was impossible, and wrong if possible, to subjugate the South, or hold her States as provinces
Ele agrecd that war must inevitably end in permanent disunion, with the usual treaty relations bctwccn neighborint-r In Göd 's name, I solemnly adjure you, nations
why not accept, without war, this which you coa- cede must be the end of war
Is v,zau• in itself so fourths of the cotton she uses, upon which , as the pleasant, so desirable, or will it make our subsc- London Times lately estimated, four million of quent relations moro advantageous
-Without her people depend for daily bread
Rely upon war, you may rebuild your Union; and if we can- it, sir, that, bitter and unreasonable as her preju- not agree on the terms for that, you have at least dices tnay bc, the same causes which have recon- two friendly nations
war, you can have cilcd England to the use of slave-grown sugar and nothing rnorc; nay, you will have less, for you cotton, would nevcrsuffereither France or herself will have two unfriendly nations
Reflect also, to acquiesce in this blockade
The South nccd pray you, that you cannot wage such awar with- only wait patiently and silently, with absolute i out a revolution in your own Government, for i assurance that those great Powers would bc forced I \ never was a political system less suited for civil to an active interfcrence
And then, sir, how war than this
You will go il'lto the wara Union would you conduct the war
of free Republics; you will come out a consoli- are
Four States have already seceded, as they say; rebelled , as you term it
In a few days three others will join them
A population of more than five millions, inhabiting a country of five hundred and twenty-threo thousand two hundred square miles—a country twice and a half as large as France, nearly as large as the French and Aus- trian and Prussian empires together—utterly de- nies and repudiates your authority
Eight other States, seven million four hundred thousand peo- plc, in a country of and thirty thou- sand square miles, deliberate whethef to join them
Attempt force, and their decision is cer- taim in the affirmative
How absurd to ignore such facts, or to treat such popular movements— movcments by organized and acknowledged gov- ernments, and over so vast a scale—as rebellion; or if they be rebellion, then you are still forced to recognize it, to treat with it—by negotiation, if you are wise; by open, regular war, if you madly prefer it
But i address myself, not to madmen or fanat- ics, but to sensible men
I invite them to do what proud old England did before the Revolution; x.vhat even Austria did for the Hungarians and Italians in 1848; what yourselves did for the Mor- mons two years sil)ce
I invite you to negotiate
First secure a truce, and then seek for terms of adjustment
Do not inquire who has been in the wroncy•, accept fucts as they are
Let both parties allow the forts everywhere to remain in their present status; suspend the execution of the Fed- cral laws in the secedino• States, until otherWise fou will thus prevent the ordered by Congress
possibility of present collision and the outburst of war
'I'hcn, by sending commissioners, as I proposed in a joint -resolution the other day, or by other means, you Ilia y negotiate and give time for the sober second thought of the people to fix the terms of friendly adjustment, whether friendly separation or friendly reunion

that every day's experience -will show mope plainly that such is the surest and speediest way to reunion
Meantime other States—perhaps all the slaveholding States—may secede and join the southern confederacy
Virginia, for one, would desire a voice informing that confederacy in which her lot will be ultimately cast; but this would only define more cleari y what I have before indicated as the only proper basis for reconstruction—the re- cognition that this being now a Union of sections, cannot be safe or happy except as.a Union of equal sections—equal in rights and in the power of self- protection
What the final result would be; what form the new Union would assume; whether it would be a reconstruction with a single Federal Government, on the
principle of this, or whether it would be a league between separate confedera- cies, I know not
But this I know: that, like the •present Constitution, it would be the peaceful development of natural forces; it would be the logical sequence of causes and powers long pre- paring in history; and such I know has been the orioin of all permanent and great political organ- izations
For my part, when I imagine a northern and a sout.hern con (Z•deracy, the one composed of slave- holding, the other of the non-slaveholding States, each homogeneous; each with a complete and in- dependent government; cach with its own line of expansion and its own internal policy, and both united by a customs Union, by a postal treaty, and conventions regulate patents, coins, weights and measures, and by a defensive league aoainst all tho rest of the world, I see most, if not all, the advantages of our present system without any of its evils
You would have that: internal peace and free
trade; that unrestricted commerce and in tercoursc; that consolidated strength against for- eign foes, which this Constitution was designed to secure; and yet perfect independence would preverlt the possibility of or dissen- Sion on the interests of slavery, or thc recurrence of the distracting contentions it now excites
Would not such a system be prcförablc for all, to the present never-ending strife, to this forced Union of discordant sections, wh ich cannolo a '•yree
to live together except us rulers and subjects
would it not be a great advance In [hc Nay, sir, American idea of perfect self-government, which consists chiefly in so (leccntralizik)ff and dividing thc functions of government that each Shull be administered by those only who have the same interest in its exercise
e ilhe philosophic historian hereafter may remark that out' infant settlements remained under the British Crown so long as its power and influence in the world were needed to protect our title to the mighty wilderness against all foreign races, and wllile we were as yet too few and t-oo dispersed to unite among ourselves
He •will notice when our numbers and intelligence qualified us to undertake the guardianship of the continent which it was our providential mission to people, out' institutions assumed a new forin, and we proclaimed our independence,
and fÖrnocd our Union

GARNETT had finished his remarks, his hour having expired, On motion of Mr

Mr
SHERMAN
Before my colleague pro- cee4s with his remarks, I desire to ascertain the sense of the House in reference to the termination of this debate
i propose that this general debate sl'lall terminate to-morrow night, and that on Fri- day the Army •bill shall be considered as a special order, under the five-minutes rule
Mr
BOCOCK
For the purpose of enabling me to form an opinion upon that proposition, i wish to ask whether there was not some agree- ment that when the report of the honorable gen- t]eman from Ohio [Mr
CORWINI came before the House, there should be an opportunity for debate upon it for a few days 
Mr
SHERMAN
Undoubtedly
Mr
BOCOCK
Then I have no objection what- ever to tl)e proposition the chairman of the Com- mittcc of Ways and Means now makes
Mr
FLORENCE
The chairman of the Com- mittee of •ways and Means proposes to consider the Army bill on Friday
take it for granted •that we are not to have any consideration of the Private Calendar during the present session
Fri- day is objection day
We might proceed a good distance down the Calendar; and it does seem to me that we ought to devote that day to the pri- vate business of' the country
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair understands that Friday is not objection day
Mr
LOVEJOY
Is not Friday of this week objection day
We were told last Friday that that was not objection day
The CHAIRMAN
The rules make the first and thc fourth Fridays of cach month objection days; and as ncilher last Friday nor next Friday ccnnc within that rule, they are not objection days
No objection being made, it was agreed by the committee that general debate upon the Arno y bill close to-inorrow
Mr
SHERMAN
1 desire to ask further, that when debate shall close, if I shall see fit to occupy the hour to which I an') entitled under the ru.es, it shall be considered that the same latitude of debate shall be, allowed as bcförc
A general assent was expressed
MF
GURLEY
Mr
Chairman, as 1 do, from the most populous free Stale city in the West, whose commercial and moneyed interests are more strongly and generally interwoven with the interests of the South than any other; a city which casts nearly five thousand more votes than any in the valley of the Mississippi, I must re- gard it as a duty which I owe to my constituents xnadc for not quite four million people thir- teen Slates on the Atlantic slope, of l,vhich twelve were slaveholding, has organized and disciplined I the Anglo„Saxon host in its westward march, marking its successive encampments by the found- aüon of free and powerful Commo)'lwealths
He will not wonder that this wise instrument, first designed for a small and hotnogeneous people in their work of colonization through the wiiderneSs, is no longer sufficient the numcrons millions, the permanent occupants ofa vast continent, who, from one have grown into two peoples, with dif- fercnt social systen'l,s, different pursuits, and, from the immense foreign immigration at the North, to indicate in a few words to this body and the country, what are tlueir views ånd intentions in reference to the present crisis in our political {Fairs
Sir, for nearly a quarter of a century I have lived upon the very line of freedom and slavery, in or near a city from whence you can almost toss a stone to the Kentucky shore; and I must there- forc l.)elieve that I have a fair knowledge of, not only the political opinions of my own neighbor- hood, but of the ninc or ten million people west of the Alleghany mountains
And here, in pass- ing, I will take the liberty to say that, during the W'ho\e period of my residence the West, the inhabitants of Kentucky and Ohio, in the neigh- borhood of Cincinnati, have lived toøether in the most friendly intercourse; and, come what may, we mean that this state of things shali continue
Many of our young men have been so fortunate as to become the husbands of the fair daughters of Kentucky, while many of our young ladies different in race; and he will regard our pt:esent i I have made the hearts of Kentuckians more than I travail but as the painful birth of new organic thrice glad by consenting to become their brides; forms for nations to whom the old were no longer and if gentlemen here could only see the extraor- dinarily fine broods of rosy-chéeked and healthy adapted
And he will declare that, in following the natural law of our development, and convert- children which we raise upon either side of the incr a close into a looser fcdcratiou, our friendly river from thcsc happv umons, they would bc at relations were preserved, and a new career of no loss to realize the bond of friendship that unites progpeyit_y and power secured for either divis- us too•ether•, nor could they W'0f)der at the rmnark- ion of our race
Let not theirs be a contention able Increase of population in our fertile valley
with blood-stained arms, but a generous rivalry i Indeed, sir, truth compels me to say that such is the good understandil'lg of thc people in all that in the arts of peace; and there will open up for our name and racc a new order of the tuyes, and region, that if our citizens were to hear of a slave a new procession of American achievement and I insurrection on the opposite Bide of the river—of which, i am happy to say, there is no fear—en- dangering the lives of the mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters of that State, they would fly to their relief as they would to the rescue of' the inmates of a burning building in our own city
And what more signal evidence of the fraternal feeling between tho people of 'I'ennessee, Ken- tacky, and Ohio could be given than that furnished by the meeting of the legislators of those States last winter at Columbus, the capitol of my own State, where they addressed each other in words of warmest friendship
Surely if any political heresy existed in our State it must have bcen quite as apparent then as now
* But there was none against wl)ich the lawmakers of Kentucky and Tennessee protested
They met and rejoiced together like brothers dwelling together in uriity
Mr
Chairman, from the location of my county , it might be supposed that its people are among the most conservative of the free States; but whether they are so or not, one thing I do know: they arc for the Union, the Constitution, and the enforcelnent of the laws, at all hazards, and at any cost
At the same time, we are for render- ing justice to all sections of the Confederacy
We.are for the faithful execution of ail 'laws upon the national statute-book, and not for infringitv upon asinglc right of the southern people
Who does not know that their rights are as sacred to them as ours to us
And as to the subject of slavery, as it exists by State laws, they have it
It is a business that belongs exclusively to thern , not to us; let them takc care of it in their own way; hands off! That is all wc ask
But, sir, while affirming these facts, I must frankly add some rernarkg on another subject of great moment and peril, in reference to which we I refer, Mr
Chairman, to the are almost a unit
now boldly' preached doctrine of State secession —a doctrine so absurd to our minds that we aro of the opinion that it is a waste of time to seri- it is ously consider it
What is it
Why, sir, the wildest, the very wildest, phantasy of the nineteenth century
Who does not know that if one State can go out of the Union, so can two, or three, or haif a dozen, until we find ourselves with twenty or thirty potty sovereitrnqies, with clashing intereste, and waging each against the other a horrible internecil)e warfare
'l'o say that our fathers contemplated any such secession, with its necessary fruits of blood and carnage, is to cast the foulest slander upon their memories
It is suffcient for us to know that we live under the very Government which their wisdom and sagacity founded; the, best and freest in thc world
That it was established, not by States as States, but by the people of all the States
By them the Constitution was framed; and by them it was rat- ified, in conventions called for that purpose is enough to know that it is recognized by the whole world as one of the great political Powers of the earth; and that, as such, it contains all the elements of self-preservation
It is a Governinent of internal as well as external power; of law, of justice, of order, and supreme authority
It has the undisputed right to declare war, to make peace, and to do all things that a great nation may do in order to secure the peace and the happiness of its citizens, Ithas the right todefend itselfagainstfoes, whether they come from without or from within its borders; from traitors at home, and enemies abroad
Othcrsvise, sir, that glorious flag which now floats over our heads, and is regarded as the emblem of power everywhere, and the shield of our safety, would soon trail with dishonor in the dust
Who says that such a Government, one of the strongest political Powers of the world, shall be disrupted by and rebels in arms
Remember, ye who now seek its destruction, that it has stood up strongly, proudly, gloriously for more than seventy years, while the revolu- tions of the Old World have swept away more than adozen thrones
It has encountered tl'ie perils of war with a powerful forei«n nation, and sev- eral times grappled with rebellion at home, and in every conflict has come off more than victorious; and it will do it nov,z
Mach has been said aboutcompromises-in both Houses; but pray, what care
the rnen who have carried their States out of the Union in their way , and stolen United States property, about com- promises
Who does not know that they laugh and mock at the attempts made here and else
where to bring them back by some bargain or com-  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C

promise
Who does not know that the control- ling men of the cotton States spurn, and arc ready to spit upon every proposition looking to the restoration of peace and good order
They are too mad with rage to reason
Sir, they have already seizcd upon our forts, upon our armories, our custom-houses, our post offces, and magazines; and to crown all, have fired into a vessel in the service of the United States, carrying at its mast head the flag that every- where elsc is a shield of protection
What else do 'sve hear
The telegraph tells us that they have planted cannon upon the banks of the Mis- sissippi river to interrupt the navigation of that river; to stop our steamboats or blow them to pieces
They insult the men from the North- west who tradc upon thc Mississippi; indeed, they treat them as a conquered people! Our most honored merchants are ordered home from Louisi- ana, and our most prudent business men arc mal- treated, for no other crime under heaven than that of voting just as every free citizen of a free re- public is entitled to vote
Anarchy rcions in por- tions of the South; and men from the free States have far less liberty than they would have under any despotic Government of Europe
Sir, •we have had one impressive illustrati01i of this fact thio•norning in this House
A gentleman came forward, and asked that the name of a steam- boat should be changed from that of John C
Frémont to sorne other name
Why was that
Why did the owner of that boat come here, and ask for the change
I wili tell you, because I had it from his own lips.
He said he could not go to the, South with tlMff boat; that the people there would not permit him to land; that they would not permit him to put ashore his careo•, that they said " away," upon peril of his life
And this; in the freest Republic of the world, as you call it; ay, sir, the model Republic of the world
The next thing
you will hear will be that we must change our t•mmes, if offensive to the South, before we can travel thcre
Sir, it is time to stop the work of these traitors, and vindicate the laws
T I-ley must
prevail, or the Government must put them down by its own strong arm
The trial cannot come too soon
For- bearance towards thenl has ceased to be a virtue
The people are everywhere asking, " Have we a Governmeht I say, if we have, that the cominø struggle to maintain it will demonstrate that it is a Government of power and overwhelminT force! against thc ommders of the law
If, ever, we havo nothing more than a sort of' mutual admiration society in this House, and in the other, it is timc the people understood that fact also
It is better for them to understand that now
If there is any truth in the doctrine of the, secession- ists, our Government novcr had any vital power; and it is, and ever has been, as they expound it, the merest rope of sand—a
cheat and a swindle against those who havc hitherto sustained it
The people have been spending millions of money every year under the delusive idea that Congress was making laws that they actually meant should be obeyed; and, at this late day, they awake to the reality that those laws were only submitted to the consideration of offenders to see whether they would like to obey them
We sce treason and cold-blooded rebellion cul- minatincr in thc destruction of the richls of thc law-abiding people of the land; but we are coolly told that the Army arid Navy must not molest them

Lest they should become offended, and then possibly somebody migh t be hurt
A wful ! It is said, too, that if you attempt to execute the laws, war will be the result

ernment
Anarchy is worse
The loss of honor, and the loss of public credit, and a broken and shattered Government, whose laws arc derided an(l trampled under foot: these are worse than 'var to maintain the most favored and glorious and blessed Republic that the sun ever shone upon
But no war will come if we are prepared to vin- dicate the laws
It is the very absence of prep- aration that invites troubles like those which now surround us
Let the Government act witw firmness and vigor, and all will be well
The present is no time for temporizing
Men insane with passion have risen up in arms acrainst the Republic, and their causeless rebellion has already attracted the eye of the civilized world, and tho leading Governments of Europe arc looking from their high places intently upon us, to sce if our instituti01')s can survive the shock of well-organ- ized treason
Liberty-lovinff men of all countries are watching us with the interest that more than seventy years of successful experiment has spired in their minds; and for the action which we now take, civilization as well as higtory itself will hold us sternly responsible
Sir, we are now on trial before the whole world, to see whether freemen have the right to choose t.heir own rulers, or whether a factious minority shall dictate terms and men to the majority
If those in arms against the laws may force the Government into dishonorable compromise, we have no security for our Government fora single presidential tern-r, for the people of any section, if they happen to dislike a President elect, can easily vote themselves out of the Union, and again and again compel the law-making and the law-ex- cutino• power to surrender to their absurd and unjust demands
The precedentonce established, whatis the elective franchise in this country worth
Absolutely nothing, and less than nothing
It is a shadow without the substance
Those who stand up against the Government, and in open rebellion a(rainst it, although it se- cures to thcm higher privileges than any upon the face of the earth, seek to excite sympathy and attract support, by drawincr a comparison between their political condition under it, and that of the colonists under the King of England; but a more absurd comparison, in my judgment, was never instituted, as we will show
Mr
JENKINS

The gentleman speaks of enforc- ing the laws and collecting the revenuc at any extreme, and at all hazards

I am for executing the laws
Mr

I ask the gentleman, iftwcnty Stat.es should secede and confederate together, whether he would propose that the other thirteen should subjugate them
Mr
GU n LEY
When they go out, I will answer that question
was sayiilg that those who stand up now in open rebellion against the Government, do so al- though it secures to them higher privileges than would be secured to them by any other Govern- mont upon the facc of the earth; and that thcy are exciting sympathy by drawina• comparisons between their political condition under it and the colonists under the King of F,rvland
But, I ask, did the colonists create the Kinff
Did they set against anybody, much less a(yainst any State

Did they elect the Parliament
We only ask that the laws be duly executed Did they oven elect and control their own Govern- against individual offenders

Who does not with the exception of some colonies, had to shudder at the contemplation of clashing arms receive the sanction of the Encrlish sovereign be- among a people of one blood and country

If at all, by thc Gov- ernment which they themselves -have helped to create, and have controlled, as they openlyboast, for fifty years
It is their Government; and what do they propose to do now
Trample upon ethe very laws they have made W'ith their own brains and with their own hands
They assume to lay violent hands upon •their own work, and commit political suicide
They will overturn the Government because it is not certain that they can control it in the future as they have controlled it in the past

Mr
Chairman, my own State contains a larger wh ite population than five soutli- ern States which J
can name; and wo have two Senators and they have ten! But with all this iræquality in favor of the South, they comc to us and demand new guarantees of fidelity to their peculiar institution, if not positive pledges of sor- vility on thc part of the free States
They go further, sir, and actually ask that our people walk up *to the polls and record the edicts of a few hundred men at Charleston or Baltimore
And if we refuse to do that, what do they say
What have they said in this House
They will pull down the pillars of this great Republic and look to the-ir guns for justice and rio-ht." The moment we dare to cast our votes AS freemen should, and select the man of our deliberate
clioice for President, in correspondence with the Consti- tution and the laws of the land, we commit an unpardonable sin, and there is an end to free government
On this principle, we can have no higher political privileges thah the people of Aus- tria or Russia
We are required to become the obedient servants ofa cottonocracy, and sink the freeman in a craven political dependent
I maintain, sir, that there is no excuse, no apol- ogy whatever, for rebellion acrainst a Government where thc people themselves male and control it
Violent revolutions are justifiable against kingly despotism, without doubt; but not against our Gov- ernment, where each man is himself a ruler
Rev- olution against that isa high crime
It is a leap in the dark
It is wild anarchy; and, if success- ful, must end in military rule, in *neral war, and Mcneral oppression
If we fail to preserve the present Confederacy, a reconstruction upon the basis •that will be den-randed is impossible; and twclvc months will not pass from the time of its overthrow before we shall have upon us all thc horrors of Mexican warfare
'i'his great Union and Constitution are now in the keeping of tho people's servants'- here, and they have the control of the Army and the NAVY

January 16, feeble, pusillanimous cowards that ever disgraced a free country
But, sir, let us look at some of the results of If States may breaking up our Government
separate at will, where is your public faith
What better are your treaties than the naked parchment upon which they are written
Wh then will become the purchasa•s ot your bonds
In what condition will be your widow and orphan and benevolent societies that have placed their all in the public credit
What man would' trust a people for one dollar who wodld tamely permit traitors to insult their flag and steal their property with impunity
One thing is certain: if the organized Government here does not vindicate its honor and regent its wrongs, and anarchy comes, the people of the free States will do that work most thor- ouglily
Mr
Chairman, so long as gentlemen confine themselves to the harmless busmess of dissolving this Union upon paper, and setting up in their poetical imarinations a Government antagonis- tic to that of the United States, I certainly have no disposition to break in upon their dreams of wealth and glory consequent upon the new order of things; but if the attempt is to bc made to make these mere dreams the basis of action against ours great temple of republican freedom, reared by patriotic hands and minds; if, indeed, they should take a practical form, and result in the actual in- vasion of the rights of our General Government, as illustrated in the conduct of those who have recently seized upon its property in the South, then, Sir, I am for using every means N.vhich Al- mighty God has given us to maintain the laws, the Constitution, and the Union
This, sir, I am sure, is the sentiment of the ten million people living in the West and Northwest, with here and therc an exception ; and I would now rnost respect- fully suggest to the secessionists of the South, and to all who arc disposed to break up this great and glorious Confederacy, that it would bc at least an act of prudence to consult those ten nnillion
They arc nowa powrer in the nation to the extent of one third; and they mcan to be heard, and if need be felt, on this impending question
not say that no traitors will be found in the free Stntes west of the Alleghany mountains; but if any, they will be as one to twenty tories in the Revolution
And now, sir, is there a single man so beside himself as to suppose that these ten million hardy pcople will look calmly on or take a neutralpsiuon, und see State, after State leave the Union, and the Mississippi rivcr pass into the control of a foreign Govcrnmcnt
I deny it
No, sir; they gcttled up that country with a clear understanding that that river and its various tributaries should forever flow in the United States of Ainerica, frec for a commerce that already rivals that of the Atlantic coast—the great unob- gtructcd highway to the ocean
Heaven have xnercy upon the Inen who attempt to make it any thing else, or placo single disability upon its trade or comrnerce I know the spirit and the temper of thc people of the West, and know also that they never will submit to the Mississippi river being controlled by any power except that of the Union
Sir, there isa gathering storm in the West
The South may not see, and if they see, may not heed it; but a mighty Btorm is coming nevertheless
Our peoplc are slow to anger, and will bear much before they strike down the invaders of their rights; but there is a point of endurance beyond which they will not co
work o'driviv our people from territory where they have ouarantied rights as American citizens; this work of planting cannon upon Iha Mississippi river for treasonable purposes; this work of personal violence in New Orleans and other places, all must cease, or tons of thousands of men will rush to the combat and sweep the entire coast of Mississippi and Louisiana; and, their just indignation once fairly aroused, no power this side of I-leaven can prevent them from making the foundation of New Orleans the bed of a lake where fishes will dwell instead of men
I now wish to call the attention of qhe commit- tee to some outrages committed on thöcommerce I ask to have a short of the Mississippi river
e x tract read 
'The Clerk read from the Chicago Tribune of 14th instant, as follows: A few days since one of our hcavicgt wholesale gro- cery firms doing a iargr: business with tho city of' New Or- leans, had occasion tosend a large shipnent flour to that city
This they proposcd to do in their usual iOrtn of insur- ance—an open policy
But at the last moment comes the intelligence by teiegraph that the, New York insurers have cahceled the policy, and refuse to insure cargocs on the Mississippi river
The firm have sent their flour to New York for occan freight to New Orleans
Simultaneously with the above, the wholesale grocery houses arc advised by our Chicago underwriters that they rnust largely advance rates of insurance on shipments of sugar from New Orleans—a rate which will tell heaviW against the advantages of New Orleans as a sugar market, and, with the rcasons for this change, will do much to divert trade to the seaboard
Now, all this is the result of the action of the seceding State of Mississippi, which gives three hundred miles of a doubtful, perhaps hostile, coast, to be added to the risks of river navigation no slight addi- tion to be sure; for who bolieves that the traitors who are arnning Mississippi against the Union would stick at sup- plying a scanty coniinissariat by a seizure of northern prod- uce
Underwriters and capitalists do not consult polit- ical demagogues as to their business interests
Capital is quick to takc alarm, and is most sagacious
Thug, by a single blow at the hand of traitors, Chicago and New Or- leang ate put wide asunder by the interposed foreign State of Mississippi." Mr
MAYNARD
I should like to ask the gentleman from Ohio, if this occurs in the pres- ent state of affairs, what would it be when the Union is dissolved and the Government broken " If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry Mr
GURLEY
If the Union be broken up, and war follow, let the consequences fall on those who are rcs )onsible
Do southern geritlcmen expect that tle people of the far West will fold their hands in indifference, and see their com- merce interrupted, their steamboats fired into 
How long do they expect us to submit to it
Sir, no foreign Government on the face of the earth could commit such outrages against this nation without an immediate declaration of war
And now I say, that with strong hands and stout hearts our people settled up the West
With their own right arm they leveled thc forest, and prepared the land for themselves and their children
The very hardships they have endured make them strong and brave; and woe to those who attempt by force to take from them a single right which they possess upon any river that flows toward the sea
In conclusion, sif, I will say that I am for prac- tfcal and speedy legislation to mcct the exigencies of the times
Give us a bill permitting the Pres- idcnt to receive volunteers to sustain the national Govcrnment
Pass it; let it become a law at once; and if you need fifty thousand soldiers from the West you will have them; a hundred thousand, and you will have them
And then, if the worst comes to the worst, and the stars and stripes are still in danger, ask for five hundred thousand, and they will be at your command
Do any call this an extravagant statement
Sir, we have in Ohio alone nearly three hundred thousand able-bodied rnen who arc subject to military duty by our laws
they will defend They will defend the Union; the Government; they wili defend the Capitol; and t.hey will our glorious flag as long as they have a loaf of bread to eat or a gun to fire
Peace and harmony we all desire; but we will never purchase them with dishonor and the sur- • ofself-respect
'l'hosc who make war upon the vernment without any just cause must bear the responsibility and punishment which belongs to rebels and traitors
It has l)cen supposed that the people of the West are divided in sentunent on this subject, and that a large number of them side with those who are now seeking todestroytheGovgrnment
This, however, wiil be found to be a great mistake
The resolutions of the Legislature of Ohio, as read from the Clerk's desk this morning, show that the people of Ohio are all but unanimous on the subject of maintaining the Government
These resolutions passed the Senate unanimously, by the votes of both Democrats and Republicans
Sir, when the question comes up of fidelity to this Union, and svhcn the Government is in danger, we of the will never stop to talk about names
We will overleap all party lines
We will, if need be, sink all party names Deeper than did plummet ever sound." we will come in solid phalanx
We will rally as one man to defend the Union and maintain our glorious flag, which gives protection to our citi- zens in all lands
It now floats proudly, triumph- antly over this Capitol , and it shall never be struck down by rebels at home or enemies abroad
Mr
HOLMAN
Mr
Chairman, the fact can no longer be concealed, sir, that we are in the midst of revolution
'The American people are compelled to behold a spectacle which, in the confidence of long years of peaceful security, they have deemed to be •impossible—the Union, established by the sacrifices of their fathers, and sanctified by imperishable memories, quivering in the very agony of dissolution! Who, sir, can stand unappalled in contemplation of the fact 
Who can but regret that he is a part of the gen- eration which, while bearing onward the flag the Republic, seduced by the unworthy passions of the hour, has suffered its sacred folds to be trampled in the dust
I will not discuss, sir, the merits of the questions which have given rise to this alarming condition of public affairs, or in- dulge in crimination upon the North or the South
These, sir, are swallowed up for the timc by the Travcr question, whether the Government itself shall continue to exist; whether the Censtitution by which it is created possesses the inherent power to resist its own destruction
If, sir, a State possesses the right of secession; if the strength of the Government is founded only on the voluntary concert of its various parts; If any part of the nation can withdrav,.r from the common Confederacy at pleasure, without refer- ence to the irreparable injustice that may result to the other parts of the Confederacy; then, sir, is ours the weakest Government on the face of the prosperity of its people at the the carth; mercy of every storm of human passion; its ap- parent greatness a miserable delusion, as baseless as the fabric of a dream
It is urged, sir, that if' a State does actually secede from lhc Union, the question whether the right cxists, or whether it be an act of revolution, or an exercise of power without right, is wholky immaterial; that the consequences arc the same
The proposition is not Vue
If the right exists, the rcmaining States must acquiesce, whatever may be the consequences to their material inter- est
If it does not, they may determine, x,vithout aggression, what policy may be necessary to vin- dicate their own rights agamst the consequences of thc act of thc seceding State
But beyond this, sir, there are tribunals to which States and nations are responsible
The question vvhether the overthrow of this Government, by an act of secession, be in conformity with the compact by which ib was founded, or an act of unwarrantable violence, in derogation of public faith, may de- termine the judgment which the civilized nations of the earth, and the, friends of freedom
through- out the world, may pronounce upon the act of its destruction
But above all, sir, it will determ- ine the judgment of that tribunal from which no State or generation of men can escape—the im- partial judgment of posterity
If this Republic IS to perish, and furnish another argument for kings and consolidated power; if the proud ex- pectations of the illustrious men who formed it are to bc disappointed; if' the Government which is at once the hope and the pride and the glory of down-troddeu millions is to become another mockery of human aspirations; if the ark of the covenant of our fathers, with the visible evidence of the approbation of' Almighty God still resting upon it, is to be dashed to pieces, Ict that final tribunal detcrminc the character of the act, and denounce the sentence of its vindictive wrath upon the memory of the guilty
In the midst, sir, of the horrors of national ruin, if they shall come upon us, the question whether they have resulted from an exercise of rightful power or from violated faith will not fail to enter into the judge ment which even the present generation will pro- nounce
1 deny, sir, the right of a State to secede from this Umon
The whole history of the country, from the first suggestion of a union ulnong the American colonies to the present hour, disproves It is disproved by thc Articles of Confedera- it
tion and the events which led to the organization of the Government; by the history of the present Constitution, and the opinions of the great states- men who formed it; and, above all, by the very terms of the Constitution itself
The Union formed by the Articles of Confederation was in the nature of a compact or league between States
It did not It was a Confederacy of the States
sufficiently unite the American people as one nation
The Federal authority was msuflicicnt
 1861
And, although it was declared to be " a perpet- ual Union" between the enumerated States, our fathers, to form " a more perfect Union," and give strength and effciency to their Government, or- dained the present Constitution, founding its au- thority, not upon a compact or Icague betwccn States, but upon the original source of political power; not upon the sovereignty of States, but upon the original sovereignty of the people: We, the people of the United States, in order to fonn a more Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for thc comznon defense, protuote the general welt%are, and secure the blessings or liberty to our- selves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Con- stitntion for the United States o
America." The form of ratification cannot change its char- acter
The people themselves, through their agents and representatives, declared it to be their own act, not as the people of separate and inde- pendent States, but as the people of the United States of America: The political history of the world, sir, does not furnish an example of a more explicit exercise of sovereign power in organizino• its elements into one indissoluble nation
The authority, then, on which the Government of the United States rests, is exactly the same as that on which the governmentsof the States are founded; both are cqually created by the people, by the exercise of their original sovereignly
Certain powers are invested in the one' government, and certain powers are delegated to the other, and cach is equally sovereign within the limits of r rhe people of the several the powérs conferred
States are not more united for the purposes of dornestic government, than the people of tl-je whole nation are for the purposes of national government
While jealous of their reserved rights, the people declared tile Government of the IJnited States, as to the powers conferred upon it, to be the supreme Government
To it was con- fided the power to provide for the common dc- fense and the general welfare of thc whole nation ; and the Constitution {hus created, and the laws and treaties which should be made in pursuance with its authority, were declared to be the su- preme law of the land
But the powers not dele- gated were reserved to the States or the people
But, sir, was the power reserved to the people of any State to destroy the Government
To annul the powers necessary to tho well being and com- mon defense of ail of the contracting parties
To withdraw their consent that tile common Consti- tution,and the laws made under it, should be the supremo law, not of one State, or a part of the States, but of all the States
No, sir; such reservation would have been utterly inconsiste)'lt with the wholc in'strument
The wise statesmen of the day, farming a Government which they trusted would endure through ali time, would never have placed it at the mercy of the passions of the hour
The whole Constitution, from its title to the last section of its amcndments, bristles with denials of this colossal heresy "—the right of u part of- the people who madc the Constitu- tion to destroy it
No, sir; all of' the States to- gether, except so far as they may represcnt the sovereignty of thc whole people, could not annul the binding force of the Constitution
To present the evidence, sir, that the right of secession is in conflict with the opinions of the men who formed the Government, would be to present almost the entire history of the Constitu- I content myself with the authority of a few tion
of the most illustrious men, whose names have become household words, and whose statues dec- orate your Capitol
In the ever-memorable farewell address of the Father of his Country, it is said: The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and alter their constitutions ofGoverrnnent
But the Constitutionwhiell at any tinie exists, untik changed by the explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." Mr
Madison, in his letter to Mr
Trist, on the 23d day of December, 1832, said: is retnarkable how closely the nullifiers, who make the name of Mr
Jefferson the pedestal for their colossal heresy, shut
their eyes and lips whenever his authority is ever so clearly and enlphaticaliy against them, You have not-iced what lie says in his Ictters to Monroe and Carring- ton (.pp
43, 203, vol.2) with respect to the power of the old Congress to coerce delinquent States; and his reasons for preferring för the purpose a naval to a military force ; and, moreover, his reniark that it was not necessary to find a right ta coerce in the Federal articles, that being inherent It is high time that the clåim in the nature of a cotnpact
to secede-at will should be put down by the public opinion
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
419 Mr
.Pincknoy, of' South Carolina, in the con- vention that framed tbc Constitution, said: " i apprehend that the true intention of the StateS in uniting is, to have a firnn national Government capable ot effectually c.xccutill'f its acts and dispensing the benefits In it alone can be vested those powers of its protcetiotl
and prerogatives which Inore particularly distinguish a sov- creign State." President Jackson, in his celebrated proclama- tion, said: It [the Generai Government] is a Government in which ail of the people are represented, which operates directly on the people individually, not upon the States
They re- tain all the powers they did not grant
But each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to consti- tute jointly with the othcr Statcg a single nation, cannot, from that period, pass any right to secede, because such secession does not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation
But if, in defiance of right, by a violation of public faith, on pretense of intolerablc oppres- sion—for thc rcmcdy of which no appeal has been made to the national Congress, to thc Federal judiciary, to the States, and the people of the States—a State, upon her own rcsponsibility, does secede from thc Union, what, sir, is the remedy
My answer is, sir, the constitutional enforcement of the laws
The General Government, charged with thc duty of providing for the general welfare, cannot shrink from the responsibility of prevent- the act of' seccssion from impairing the just rights of the remaining States
As tbc acrent of the whole people, it may not hesitatc in the per- fonnance of its duty
It cannot abdieatc Got'ern- It cannot abandon the trust it has ac- ment
ceptcd
But how' shall the rights of the remaining States be vindicated
By levying war on the secedincr States
No, sir
'The people have not investeä the Federal Government.with power to recognize the ris-rllt of secession
As to thc General Gov- ernment, the act of attempted secession is a mere nullity;
The Government cannot wage war upon one of its parts; but it must execute the laws, so far as their execution involves the interests of the But gentlemen say that this is whole people
coercion
What is meant, sir, by coercion
If you mean by it that, if a State shall refuse to pcr- {Orm those duties which, in the very nature of things, must be the result of voluntary action, and which morat obligation can alone enforce, the Government of •thc United States, by the Army or Navy, shall compel their observance—then, sir, am I against coercion
If you mean, sir, that t_he mailed hand the Government shall be laid upon a State to compel her, as the only cscape from violence, to elect members of Congress, her citizens to perform the offices.of judges of the Federal courts and tbc duties of jurors, to act as collectors of the revenue and postmasters—then, sir, I am atrainst coercion
Thesc are duties which even tyranny cannot enforce; and their pert•orrn- ance, however desirable, is not indispensable to the general welfarc of the Union
If a State aban- dons the benefits of the Union, so far as the act affects herself only no onc may complain
But if you mean, sir, by coercion, the cnforccmcnt of the laws necessary to the welfare of the whole Union—laws enacted by the authority foundcd on the original sovereignty, and involving the con- stitutionak rights of the whole people of the United States; if you mean, sir, by coercion, the consti- tutional enforcement of these laws as they have been from the , sir, I in favor of coercion
If you mean, sir, by coercion, the col- lection of the public revenues as they have been collected for throe quarters of a century, and which are necessary to the very existencc of thc nation, or the protection of property purcbascd by the common treasure, and for the general ben- efit of the whole people of the United States; if these, sir, are acts of coercion, then I am for coercion; and the right and duty of such coercion by the General Government, by the oxcrcise of all of its constitutional powers, no State, however blinded by the passions of the hour, can deny
But these, sir, are not in strictness acts of co- ercion, but the Qrdinary cnförcement of the laws by thc twencics agreed upon by the common con- sent of tbc whole people in the formation of the Confederacy

But how does the question stand upon author- ity
I have already
presented the opinion of Mr
Madison on the power of coercion and confirme ing the views of Mr
Jefferson
Mr
in one of the letters referred to, said, as ra reason for providing a navy to coerce the Barbary States: It will arm the Federal head (the old Congress) with the safest of all instruments of coercion over its delinquent members, an*d prevent its using what would be less safe." [Manifestly referring to military force
I—Jefferson's letter to John ddatns, July II, 1785
Again : will be said there is no money in the Treasury
There never will be money in the Tteasury until the Confederacy shows its teeth
Every rational citizen must wish to see an efli2ctivc instrument of coercion, and should fear to-see it on any other element than the water
A liaval force can never endanger our liberties nor occasion bloodshed ; a land foree would do both
"—Jefferson's tetter to Cotonel Monroe, .nugust n, 1786
Again : Jt has been so often said, as to be generally believcd, that Congress has no power by the confederation to enforeU anything; for example: contributions of n.oney
It was not necessary to give thern that power expressly ; they have it by the law of nature
"—Jefferson's Letter to Carrington, dugust 4, 1787
To whose opinions, sir, can the American peo- ple appeal with rhore confidence on such a ques- tion as this than to those of the statesmen who, of all others, gave form and character to the Con- stitution, and were alike enemies of consolidated power, and the sleepless friends of the reserved rights 
But I present another authority, sir, which even the people Of South Carolina may not refuge to hear; a statesman whose devotion to South Carolina was only surpassed by his love of jus- tice and attachment to the American Union; a inan, sir, who as a patriot, statesman, citizen, and scholar, was an honor to the race
At the nulli- fication period of 1832, hc was, I bblieve, a mem- ber of thc Legislature of South Carolina
I pre- sent a part of his address to the öeoplc of Khat State on the subject of secession, not as an au- tbority only, but on account of the vigor of the ar(yument: Suffer not yourselves to be deceived by the idea that the Gcneral Govermnent will recormize your title to be out of the Union
It is perfectly ciear they cannot
51'.hey have no authority to abandon any portion of the Union
Tho 'Perritory of Carolina was committed to their jurisdiction by a joint action of the States; and nothing short of the absolute necessity imposed by an unsuccessful war can release them from the obligations of that trust
They are comrnandcd and empowered to *nake all laws necessary and proper to protect Ihe custom-house and the post odice, their courts and judges, and all their officers
Can you doubt that they will do it
They must treat Carolina asin the Union, whatcver shc may say to.thc contrary
If a State employs a power wbieh is revolutionary as to the Union, and, of course, belligercnt in its character, the Union must possess and will exercise a correspohding right or retaliation

"—Crimké's Letter to the People of South Carohna, December l, 1832
Sir, the right of secession does not exist
The If the duty of enforcing the laws is imperative
sacrifices of our fathers shall bc found useless; if the Union of the States, which was formed by their wisdom, prescrved by their fraternal for- bcarance, and defended with their blood, shall be- come a mockery to their hopes, a dishonored monument to their memory, and a stiffrna and reproach to their children, the imperfect judgment of the present generation, and the severe and un- erring judgment of posterity, will not suffer the plea of right to palliate the crime of its destruc- tion, and will brand this Government with the r I'he suffciency of thc powers conferred by the infamy of broken faitt), if it shall, in the hour of people on the General Government for maintain- Ing the majesty of' thc law, cannot be called in peril, abandon the sacred trust committed to its question

The Congress shall have II But while, sir, there is no right of secession, a duty imposed
 420 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 16, and although the people have imposed upon this Government the duty of enforcing the laws, no American statesman will question the right of rev- olulion as a remedy for intolerable oppression
Can any State of- this Union present a case, she herself being the judge, that ',viil justify a resort to this final remedy
From what Government would she revolt
Certainly not from the gov- ernment of the States; for each, as to local gov- ernmcnt, is independent
Revolution, then, could only be the overturning of the Government of the United States
Can any State assert that that Government has been oppressive
'The gentleman from Missouri [Mr
ANDERSON] dis- cussed this subject yesterday
What showing, sir, did he make against the Government
Its powers are wisely divided into three departments
Which of these departments, sir, has
oppressed a State of the South
The judicial
Why, even the gentlman himself eulogized that department as eminently wise and just and impartial
The legislative
No State lias sought to impeach it
From the beginning, no law has been enacted to which the South has not given her assent
The executive
No State of the South will charge it with one act of oppression
Where, then, sir, is the right of revolution
T hc popular voice is unfriendly to the South
Why, sir, in the recent expression, a majority of a million of voices, even by the gentleman 's admission, were raised in de- fcnse of her constitutional rights
But the policy of sister States has beon unconstitutional and unjust
The majority 
No, the minority; for every south- ern State admits that the fifteen States of the South and four States of the North have been true to their engagements
No, sir; it comes to this: that, by the constitutional action ofthc people, onc of the threc departments will be controlled by a policy unfriendly to the South; and that, too, will be controlled by the others, ao•ainst whiqh the South raises no complaint
No, sil , at the bar of impartial public juslgnncnt, the casc would ut- terly fail The Government has been eminently wise and patriotic and just
A.nd such will be the judgment of history
'Rhc opinions of a minor- lty of the American people are ullfricndly to the domestic policy of the South
Is this intolerable oppression
No, sir; the right of secession is de- Ined by the Constitution ; and there is no oppression to justify the right of revolution
Ifthe Govern- ment is overturned, thc act will be without justi- fication or excuse
The evils that exist—the want of fraternal comity between the two sections of the Union—admits of remedy without invoking the prescncc of the destroying angel, and calling down the Divine vengeance upon our heads
But, sir, are not States amenable at the bar of public justice
For cighly-two years the people of the Unitcd States, in the application of the public revcnucs, have acted on the theory that they were one people, and that any tax lcvied upon the common industry of the nation was im- posed for the common good, and not, for t.hc bene- fit of particular States
Uncounted noillions have been levied upon the labor of the American and cheerfully paid, to provide ftn• the defense and general welfare of the whole country
For the benefit of the general commerce houses have been erected on cvcry coast
To protect the Republic from invasion, forts have been built at every exposed point upon our bor- ders, not for the protection of onc Statc, but of all the States
Is it possible, sir, that any part of the American people will consider it consistent with good faith or national honor, that these results of national industry shall be appropriated to the exclusive use of particular States
Sir, övery citizen of your teeming millions, wherever he may have been—in your marts of commerce upon the borders of tho oceans, or in the secure and peace- ful valleys of the distant West, upon your ships in remotc seas, or in the huts of the trapper in the gorges of your mountains, on the borders of the Rio Grande, or by the' lakes of' the North— wherever he may have been, or whatever his pur- suits, has felt that the honor, the well-being, and the defense of the nation, his care
What citizen, sir, has not contribfited to the building of i your light-houses and navy-yards and arsenals and dock-yards and forts, and providing muni- I Lions of war
These workS, sir, for the national welfare and defense, have been erected wherever dered to the Government in New York and Mas- sachusetts, Virginia and South Carolina, and else- where, notfor any particular State or for its bene- fit, .but for the purposes of the whole American people
I ask again, sir, can any State, without a flagrant violation of good faith, appropriate the common industry of the nation to her own exclu- Sive use 
The great West, with her industrious and peaceful people, devoted to agriculture, and deriv- mg no direct benefits from duties on foreign com- merce, receiving no other benefits from the tax on her labor, save protection from foreign invasion, has cheerfully contributed millions to erect works of national defense on the coast of the Atlantic
Can any State think so meanly of the manhood of her people as to suppose she will tamely submit to the appropriation of these works by particular States
The defense of New York and Charles- ton, of Boston and Savannah, has been the com- mon care of the nation
We have removed mount- ains of granite from New England to the port of Charleston to erect barriers against a common en- emy
The common toil of the American people, in the confidence of national faith, has made the coast of South Carolina to frown defiance on the enemies of thc Republic
Can these cities enter- tain the belief that other portions of our people can consent to their assertion of exclusive owner- ship of these works in derogation of the corpmon Can South Carolina, whose chivalrous sons tire sensitively alive to everything that per- tains to their own honor, or the honor of their State, consider it possiblc that the other States of the Union, equally sensitive of honor, equally brave and chivalrous, can submit to the startling wrong of her appropriating to her exclusive use the works of national defense upon her borders as though they were thc work of her own hands 
Can she think so poorly of American spirit and of the national scnsc of honor
Sir, they Will not
They cannot submit to it consistently with honor or justice
These works were not built for South Carolina, or for herexclasivc defense
Congress, even according to the doctrine of her own states- nien, never l')osscssed the pot,vcr of appropriating one dollar of the national treasure except for national ol.)jects
Those works were erected by the common con- sent of the nation, witli the con-nnon treasure of the nation, in the faith of the national integrity, and for national defense; and, sir, the honor of the nation is involved in their appropriation to the purpose for which they were designed
That honor, sir, will not be sullied
Yet, while it is n goodly thing, sir, to have a giant's strength, it is tyrannous to use it like a giant
The very strength of the Government will induce forbearance
It is inconsistent with the spirit of the nation to treat a State, a member ot• the political household, how- ever hostile hcp attitude may be, as a revolted province
South Carolina and sister States, who have resorted to this extraordinary method of redressing alleged grievances, will be wooed back into the sisterhood of States, even in tf'ie spirit of maternal kindness—a spectacle unheard of in the history of the world
But let her and them beware; ihe comrnon mother is not the less powerful because she is tender and pacific and fbrbcaring
Let theni not provoke the terrors of forboarance of this the parent's wrath
Government will correspond with its irresistible strength
The honor of the nation is dear to every patriot's heart; the flarr of the Ropt.lblic
is sacred
Can South Carolina and her conföderate States believc that the sell)se of honor has died out in the hearts of the American people; that manhood and come again dear to her heart
But let her remem- ber that her sentiments of honor and justice and courage are the common sentiments of the Amer- can people; let her not remain estranged from the heart of her country until she shall cease to be embraced by her sympathies; for no terrors, sir, can equal the terrors of a parent's wrath
Sir, the questions of this hour are of fearfu! importance to the brave, yet industrious and peace- ful people whom in part I have, as you have, sir, the honor to represent—the people who have es- tablished an empire in the great Northwest
the disruption of the Union, if such a terrible calamity should come upon us, the immediate in- terests of our industry are peculiarly involved
We, of all others, sir, cannot coment to the dis- solution of t.he Union
Let tho South and the North remember, sir, that our highways to the Gulf and to the ocean cannot be obstructed
The energy and fortitude and courage and enterprise which have established that empire, will never consent that tribute shall be laid upon their labor
Whatever misfortunes may befall us, I trust, sir, I that that never wrill be attempted; but if it should be, sir, the mighty flood of the " father of waters" is not more resistless than would bc the aroused spirit of our people
I speak the more freely, sir, on these subjects, because I am one ef the million and a half of rncn in the free States who havc defended and will still defend the constitutional rights of our fellow- citizens of the South, many of whom seem now willing to desert us to the tender mercies of our common political opponents; and because, sir, if some of the States of the North have reversed the teachings of our fathers, and adoptcd a policy de- structivc of a just and fraternal comity bctwccn the States, anu have inaugurated, as is asserted by the South, the present perils, and furnished at least a pretext, if It were possible, for extenuat- ing the crime of national destruction, the State of Indiana, which I in part represent, is nota party to the offense
Hor fertile soil, the gift of Vir- ginia to the Union, herself a chidd of that Union, she has never wavered in her devotion to the Con- stitution and the Union of the States
stat- ute-books have never been dishonored by an act of nullification, nor her people by resistance to the enforcement of the laws
By the beautiful river 011 her southern border, she is indissolubly united with Virginia and Pennsylvania and Ken- tuck y and Ohio and Illinois and tho great States upon the borders of the Mississippi, and no State or citizen of a State can charge her with tan act of violated faith
She is devotcd to the Union, not only because of its illustrious memories and countless blessings, but by the ties of kindred and of blood
Her children must go to the valleys ot Virginia and the coasts of Maryland, to Kentucky and Tennessee and the Carolinas, to the hills of New England and the shores of the Hudson and the Delaware, to visit the graves of their fathers and the homes of' their childhood
She has received no material aid from the Union, save protection to the peaceful industry of her citizens
With near a million and a half of people, she has neither dock- yards, nor navy-yards, nor arsenals, nor forts; the General Government has scarcely furnished her a stand of arms
She has been
content that her defenses should be the defenses of the nation
For fifty years her people have cheerfully borne every burden which the wisdom of twe General ' Govermncnt has thought fit to impose upon them, and millions upon millions of treasure coined from the sweat of their industry have poured into the common Treasury ofthe.Republic, for the general welfare and common defense
She has kept her manly courage, and the sentiment of justice, exist faith; she has broken no covenant; and with clean no more in their sister States
South Carolina hands she will resist the breaking of the most may insult the honor of the nation; she may seize sacred covenant ever sanctioned by mortals—the upon the and covenant sealed with the blood of our fathers— trample upon the ensign of the Republic—an act the compact of the Union
which, if done by the combined and countless For myself, sir, as a Democrat, while I have millions of Europe, armed to the teeth, would be resisted and deplored the sectional policy of the resented upon the instant, even i
it involved every dominant party of the North, I have not been able hamlet and village and town and city in this broad to forget, sir, that the spirit of the northern De- land in indiscriminate ruin—yet the nation will mocracy was crushed and stricken down by a bear all this, for the Marions and the Sluntcrs corresponding policy of the

I yot I see, sir, upon the ocean or upon soil voluntarily surren- may, whén the passion of the hour subsides, be- the partial success of the Republican the South, party, upon which is predicated this suicidal pol- is attributable to the feuds in icy of secession, the ranks of the hitherto indomitable Democracy ; in the election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency, nothing to justify this extraor-  1861

dinary remedy
Who could have imagined, sir
that in a free Government, where diversities of I opinion are inevitable, the election of a Chief agistrate peacefully and by a constitutional ma- jority, and before any act is committed or policy is announced, should furnish an excuse for over- turning the Govcrnmcnt, and that Government still the best, sir—infinitely, infinitely the best, upon which the beneficent smiles of the Father of mankind have ever rested
If it were possible, sir, to look at the question in a mere partisan light, I should complain with bitterness that our southern brethren, by whom we have stood so long and so faithfully, desert us, even while we still control the policy of the Government, while no act of the nation is the subject of complaint, and leave us to fight our battles alone
But, sir, why this precipitancy
Will our brethren of the South destroy the Government and involve us all in indiscriminate ruin, without even giving us an opportunity to consider the evils of which they complain
Are they less intcrested in its permanency than ourselves
For myself, sir, I wiil sacrifice
any pride of opinion to save the Union
I should reluctantly touch the Consti- tution—the work of the grand old master work- men
should reluctantly im pose restrictions on popular freedom in the Territories
I would con- sent to it, but only to save the Co•nfederacy
What sacrifice would I not make to save it
When I have stood , sir, upon one ofthosc beau- tiful hills that overhang the waters of the Ohio, and have taken in at a glancc the distant hills of Kentucky and Ohio, and of my own native State, descending in fertile valleys to the vcrgo of that noble river; and further off, the waters of the M.iami disappearing in the distance, and the whole scene covered with farm-houses and cornfields and ffrcen meadows and vineyards and rising villages and prosperous towns; while the tones of cheerful labor, in a thousand voices, swelled up and min- gled together, and God 's blessed sunlight gilded the whole landscape, I have thought of the dark- ness and agony of that hour when thc storm which our unhallowed passions have been arous- ing should sweep over the glorious prospect, a messenger of' ruin; when the sounds of industry and the cheerfui voices of childhood should no loncrer float on thc river, or its waves bear south- ward the fruits of the låbor of many prosperous States; butarmed men should march upon its des- oiated borders, the soundsofwarshould floatu its waves, reddening with fraternal blood; anc its bosom, instead of ihe peaceful keel, should bear the munitions of war, and the labor a'nd hopes of years become the prey of the spoiler
And I havé felt, sir, in my very soul, the value of this peace- fuj Union, and that that man who should contrib- utc to its destruction would be, of all mortals, from the flood to tho final fire, in the sight of God, the most guilty
I can speak for the patriotism of my immediate constituents; and I believe, sir, that I am able to express the sentiments of the Statc of Indiana
I 'believe, sir, she would cheerfully sanction, as a measure of peace, the propositions of Judge DOUG- L AS, or those submitted to the country by the committee of the border States; and I have every reason to believe that an overwhelming majority of her people would sustain the propositions sub- mittcd to the Senate by the Senator from Kentucky, whose venerable years unite the past glories of the Republic with its present dishonor
She does not expect, sir, that this great Republic can be preserved , except by the exercise of the justice and wisdom and forbearance in which it was formed
The interests involved are too great to justify the mastery of prejudice or passion, or the supremacy of the mere pride of opinion
I believe, sir, that shc will conccdc and concede and concede, and compromise and compromise and cotnprmnise, to preserve the blessings of a peaceful IJnion; that shc will go to the very verge and utmost bound- ary of every demand which justice may make or honor may grant
She wili do morc, sir
She will entreat and implore her sister States, of the North and of the South, by a remembrance of our common orioin and thc ties of our common and kindred blood; by our common memories and our common hopes; by the graves of our fathers and the cradles of our cliildren; by the consider- ation of all that wo have been, of all that we are, and of all that we may be as a nation if the bless- ings of the Union shali continue, to forbear from the work of destruction
Yet, sir, she will never consent, by her voice, by her acts, or by her si- *ence, that this Union shall be destroyed
She will stand the more firmly by the altar of the com- mon Union as the storms may deepen around it
She will account that hand the hand of an enemy that shall be raised to tear down the temple of the Constitution
And if, sir, it shall involve her sense of justice and honor, and no other sacrifice will avail; if it must be, in its defense she will command her brave and hardy sons to dare the peril of perishing beneath its ruins
Butl cannot despair of the Republic
I would still believe, sir, and trust in God that the héart of the American people, North and South, though filled with the bitterness of passion, is still de- voted to the Union, and still glories in the flag of our common country, though its stars grow dim in the gathering darkness
I trust—though it is hoping against hope—that they will still say to the gallant ship that was läunched by our fathers on the ocean of human passions in the midst of so many hop-cs and fears: 'Thou, too, sail on, O ship of State, Sail on ; O Union, strong great, Ilumanity, with All its fears, With an the hopes or future years, Is hanging breathless on thy iäte, In spit'é of rock and tenipcst roar, In spite of false lights on the shore
nor fear to breast the sea; Sail on ; Our hearts, our hopes, arc all with thce; Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, Are all with thee—are all with thee." May the Lord God of Our fathers shield the gal- lant old ship from the fiercc waves o
the impend- incr storm

Mr
HUNTER

The Secretary of the Interior estimated for to pay for obligåtions already incurred, and $450,000 rnorc which he thought would bc due by the end of the fiscal year
The Committcc on Finance agreed 10 appropriate for oblicrations that had already becn incurred, and struck out so much as was intended to cover the amount which the Secretary of the Interior said would probably be required by the 1st day of July, 1861 That is the amendm»t

The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
in the chair.) T hc question is on thc amendment of the Committcc on Finance
IVIV
FESSENDEN•
1 doubt whether it is advisable to concur with the committcc on that presume, however, that the difference will not be very great
The recommendation was for $900,000
Apart of this sum is now due, and the part which will become due, the other $450,000, it will be imperative on the Government to pay during the present fiscal ycar
Rathcr for a technical reason than any other, the half which is not due at the present time, and thcrcforc, pcr- haps, is notstrictlyadeficiency, was struck out
I did not think it was necessary to strike it out at the time; and the committee, I think, did not at first
This was agreed upon after I left the com- mittce-room
I do not suppose it will make any very great diffcrcnce, cxcept that wc may havc thc matter all over again In another bill at this s•ossion
The chairman is perfectly aware, and will no doubt admit, that if we do not leave it in ido not this bill, '•,ve, must put it into another
sco that it is neccssary or to delay it
As thc Inonoy must be paid, why not do it now
Mr
HUNTER
i have no doubt that more moncy will have-to bc paid than t.hc I do not know, though, whether so much as $900,000, that is will bc required; but it to me it is obvious that some, legislation is necessary in order to protect the public 'T'reastn•y
As things are, now goill(r on, there is no telling, unlcss something is dorie to regulate the matter, what these appropriations for suppressing the slave trade will amount to
1 am very wilting to malcc any appropriation that is necessary for that purpose; but I um surc tho Senator from Maine will hirnsclfadmit that sati.•guard is required ('or the safety of the Treasury; and I thought wc had better make them brintr in another cslimate and then add that safeguard
We have not time now to rnaturc it; it will require consultation
W c ought to get a chance to throw some pro- tection around the Treasury
I think it bcttcr to have a sccond cstimato in the annual bill
T hc Senate, however, can do as it chooses
Mr.
FESSENDEN
admit that new legis- Intion Inay be necessary with reference to this it is cyctting to be a very scvcte burden mattcr
on the Treasury
What that legislation Inay be, or will be, or can be, I have not now any idea; but it is very clear that the obligation is incurred
Sincc the $450,000 werc decided upon as neces- sary, two slavers have bcen captured, and pro- vision must be madc for them; and I have reason to suppose that thcrc has been very great difli- culty, absolute suffering, indccd , on account ofthc delay occasioned by the non-appropriation of the money to carry our own laws into cffcct
There can bc no doubt whatever that thc ad- ditional will be required, and we shall pass no law to avoid that necessity; and therefore I say, with reference to our owrn business, that, to save additional trouble arising out of an appropriation in anew bill, in my judgment, it is vcry much bet tcr to leavc it whcrc it is; and such was at first tho opinion of the committee
adhcrc to it, and I hopc it will be retained
Still, it is not a matt.cr of so very great inujortance that we need waste much time about it
The amendment was rejected; there being, on a division—ayes 17, noes'18
The next amendrnent of the Committee 011 Finance was, to insert at thc end of the bill: For compensation and rnilcage ot• Senators
$13 000
The amendment was agreed to
T hc next amendment was, to add to the bills For the contingent expenscs of the Senatc ; for miacek- laucous items," $3,000
The amendment was agreed to, Mr
HUNTER
I have onc more amendment to offcr from the Committee on Finance
It is to add at the end of the bill: To enablc the Secretary of the Navy to carry out the ditionat contract made by him with thc Chiriqui Improve- ment Company and Ambrose W
Thompson, on the 21st day of May, 1859, for purpose of securing to the United States certain valuable privileges and rights specified in said contract, and which said contract is hereby approved, $300,000
Here is a copy of the contract; and' if any Sen- ator dcsircs to know what the provisional contract is, I have a copy of it
Mr
FESSENDEN
It is while to read it unless some one calls for the reading
It is very well understood, I think, Mr
ANTHONY
It is stated very currently in the newspapers that the title to that property I should like to have the chairman is defective
of the committee, or sonne othcr friend of the It is stated that the titlc to amendment, explain
this property has been pronounced invalid by the supreme court of Now Granada
Mr
HUNTER
that is not so
our Attorney General ,has given an opinion that the title is secure
The appropriation was postponed at onc session on that account
We became sat- isfied of that
At the next session it was postponed to havc a survey of the harbor and the route; and we have had that survey, and the report is emi- nent.ly favorable—morc favorable than the repre- sentations at the Department
The question being taken by a division on the amendment, resulted—ayes 21, noes 5; no quo- rum votino•
Mr
HUNTER
There is I hope gentlemen will vote on one side present
or the other
Let the question bc taken acrain
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will put tho question again
fl'hc quc.cgtion being again put, the result was— ayes 26, nocs 6; no quorum voting
Mr
CLARK
I ask for the yeas and nays
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
ANTHONY
1 wish that some Senator who is familiar with the nacrits of this casc would explain it to the Senate
We arc voting $300,000 at, time •when certainly the rrrcasury is not over- flowing, as I understand, to purchase another 1 should like right of way across the Isthnms
to havo the mnerits of the case explained; and if no Senator can do it, I should like to have the contract road 
Mr.HUNTER
Rhode Island ask why we want another right of way across the Isthmus 
Mr
ANTHONY
Yes, sir
Mr
HUNTER
I suppose the more rights of way that are open0d the better
We do not want to bc subjected to the monopoly of one route— that across the Isthmus of Panama
But that is
not all: we got the
use here of the finest harbors on the Isthmus; the surveys prove that they havc magnificent harbors on both sides; and sve can buy coal so near to the anchorage of ships that it can be thrown almost into thc hold
The repart of the geologist and of the en«inccr shows not only that this coal is in great quantity there, and of finc quality, but also that the route itsqlf is vcry practicable
The probability is, that it is the best we shall havc aöoss tho Isthmus
It is healthier, and a finer harbor; and, all things considercd, the best that is offered to us; and wc ' get the whole of it for $300,000
Mr
FESSENDEN
the real ques- lion, and all the question, in this case—I am sat- isfied of it from all the examination have given - to it—is, whether we shall omit to avail ourselvcs of \vhat probably will bc, I think unquestionably will bc, a matter of immense advantage to the l: country, for tbc of keeping a monopoly in tho hands of the Panama Railroad Company
I i \ think that is the whole question; and the opposi- ; I tion to this measure, whatever it may have been, that has been made here, has, I apprehend, come fron'i that source, and that source alone
The con- tract which has been made is a provisional con perföctly guards the rights of the tract, which his contract, which is 10 furnish the route, furnish  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

CLARK
I did speak against it in the been made
In the House of Representatives, how- Senate; but I desire to did it from a ever, they saw fit, under the opposition that was good motive, because I was not satisfied that the made there—and I do not question the propriety harbors had been suffciently examined, or that of it—instead of passing a bill confirming the oon- they existed, or that there was an abundance of tract, to provide that a further examination should coal there, or that there was a good route; but I be madc under Government auspices, under Gov- did then satisfy myself that if these harbors did ernment direction, to see whether the facilities exist and .the matter was as it was represented, could be furnished that were represented to exist, I would give• it my support
I now desirc to say and which were contracted for by the individual that I am fully satisfied that the harbors do exist, that the coal does exist in abundant quantity and who made the contract with the Government
T hc report made by the Government offcers is of good quality, and that the route is a good one
conclusive in all particulars
Thero is no doubt I therefore now give the measure my support about it; there is no question about the correct- without an reference to the Panama railroad
Mr
HALE
This propositon takes me alto- ness of the report
It shows that here are the fincst harbors, or as fine harbors as can be found gethcr by' surprise at this session; I have some on .the face of the earth, on cach side, and a per- recollection of the discussi0D on the subject at the fectly practicable route for a road across, and coal last session; and I shall bc glad to have thc pro- in any quantity of the finest quality—I have seen priety of putting this in the deficiency bill ex- some of it burned myself—directly on the shore, plained
What is thc necessity of loading down where it can be furnished to the ships
The cal- the deficiency bill with this appropriation 
culation thqt was made last year was, that we Mm FESSENDEN
The answer to thatques- should save, in the price and storagc of coal, in tion is obvious
In the first place, this is a con- the course ofa couple of years, I believe, all that tract made which has long bccn pending; and, we pay for the privileges we get
Everybody although it is a conditional contract, if it is to be knows that on the Panama route there is no har- affrmed, it ought to bo affirmed immediately; and bor that is worth having; that we are exposed to it cannot without an appropriation of the money

Already offers have been made for it
We Mr
HALE
I confess that I shall bc obliff0d, if I vote on this subject now, to vote in the Rark ought by all means to secure it, if our commerce and our travel in these seas be worth anything altogether
The honorable Senator from Maine intimates that thc opposition to this appropriation to us
Now, sir, when the matter has been thoroughly comes from the Panama railroad
I hate to votc ox-amined•; when a good, satisfactory, and on those subjects where I find that I have got to contract has been made; one which secures the decide between two jobs—I think that is very Government as to the performance of it, and in- much the case here—and the jobs are Chiriqui and Panama
I have not had' timc; and I have sures an these advantages; when under the direc- tion of Congress an cramination has been made not seen the, documents referred to
I very much with reference to it, and the reports that have doubt the propriety of any such appropriation as been previously made more than confirmed, it is this to answer any public ends
That there is, to remarkable to me that there should be any hesi- use a popular phrase, money in it," I have no tation whatever in putting it in the power of the
doubt—not the slightest; and although my vote, Government to close this bargain
I was about I know, will not
do any good, and possibly no to say that it was the only thing; but I will not hurt, I shall be obliged to vote against it until I say that; at any rate it is a good thilP, which, if have better light than I have now
adopted, is creditable, highly credita%le, to this Mr

1 am not disposed to de- Administration of the Government; and I hope batc this subject; but I will simply remurk ill we shall ncA fail to carry it out
reply to what has fallen from the Senator from i rose merely for the sake of making these gen- Maine, that I have never been approachcd on this i subject by any person connected with the Panama eral remarks
The matter was discussed fully a.t the last session
It is a question whéther we railroad that know of
I do not know that I shall spend a little money for what, in my judg- am acquainted with more than one gentleman in- ment, will return us tenfold, and in a very short terested in that road, and I have not seen him for period of tune, in the way of saving to the Gov- two or three years
My information on the sub- ernment itself in actual expenditure, and will re- ject is derived wholly from the reports connected sult in incalculable advantages to our commerce, with it, and cspecially the reports made in the if we are to have a commerce
Especially does House of Representatives by the majority and minority of the Committee on Naval Äffairs
it become, in my judgment, men from our section, who are interested in the commcrcc of the coun- believe we have alrcqdy three routcs, and I do try, tb avail themselves of this without the slight- not sce apy necessity fbr paying money for a I fourth one
est hesitation
Mr
GREEN
merely wish to say that 1 Mr
FESSENDEN
1 am very sorry that it concur in every word said by the Senator from is necessary for me to explain again
i am as- Maine, and I give expression to this concurrence tonishcd that gentlemen here arc so very sensi- not accidentally, but from a close and careful ex- tivc in regard to a remark which I once explained, amination of all tho facts connected with the case
and in which I said I had no allusion whatevcr to any gentlemen in the Senate; but if anythine I shall, therefore, make no further remark
Mr

1 do not think the from could make rnc suspect gentlemen, it would bc Maine was quite just in ascribing all thc opposi- this extreme scnsitivct)ess for fear they should be tion to this measure to a desire to give a monop- I said most distinctly that I had no suspected
Oly to the Panama Railroad Company

Now, Mr
President, I the opposition that had been made, the stories opposed thiÆ measure at the last session, and I that had been got up, the attempts that had becn made to defeat the measure—not by any Senator; did it from no such motive as is ascribed to mc and if I thought any Senator was concerned in it and others, if he means to ascribe that motive— I should not say so, because it would be unparlia- Mr
FESSENDEN
My friend, 1 hope, will mentary and improper—and therefofe I have ex- i do not say that voting not misapprehend me

There has E plained once what I did moan precisely; and gen- tlcnlcn ought to take rny explanation, and not been an active opposition outside and about, and that I ascribe precisely to the cause I mentioned

II Mr
CLARK
1 am satisfied
Where gentlemen choose to votc against a bill Mr
FESSENDEN
Now, sir, if the Senator because they are not satisfied about it, far bc it from New Hampshire [Mr
HALF.] docs not know from me to ascribe any motive to them but 'lthere anything about this, it is own fault

has been a report made, and a full one, stating all the advantages to the Government, incFudingthe money that the Government would save..m It has been argued in the Senate once bofore ec*tainly in full, and all these' matters were then explained; If the Senatof does not kliow anything it, it is because he has not looked into it; that is all.' Mr
HALE, I do not know that I-have the least sensitiveness in the world in regard to the remarks of the Senator from Maine
I am, sure I did not feel any, nor do I feel the- slightest, un-a der thc threat that he has made, that it I do not keep still, he will begin to think I act from im- proper motives
Mr
FESSENDEN
That is another derstanding
Mr
HALE
He said it
I do not know whether he meaMt it or not
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 did say it
Mr
HALE
Very well; perhaps he did not say anything
I said, sir, that I- feared, and be- lieved, and had a suspicion, that-this was a con- test between two jobs
One has already got rights, and the othcr is striving to get thcm
I,do re- member tho discussion that took placo -in the Seu- ate last session; and my impression of that de- batc is, that it was advcrsc to any action; and that it was postponed; but I may be mistaken about that
As 1 say, this comes upon me sud- denly now; and, under these impressions, I shall, without more light than I have had—gcntlemen have put the papers before mc since 1 got up— vote against it; and I vote against it without feel- ing particularly called upon to apologize to (ny- body for the reasons that influence me
While I think I nevct• made an insinuation arrainst the integrity of anybody on this floor, I feel as easy as most people do under those which are thrown at me for any such motives myself
I neither cast anything of that sort to anybody, nor
do I feel vcry restive or vcry sensitivc under it from anybody else
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will call the roll upon the amendment

The Senator from New Hampshire recollects the conclusion hc arrived at, I supposc, and forgets the process by which he arrived at it

It will be fccollected that at the last session of Congress a joint resolution was passed changins-r the present system of printing, and providing  424 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17, the erection or purchase of a Government estab- lishment For that purpose
That erection or pur- chase was directed to be made by the Superin- tendent of Public Printing, and whateVer contract hc made w'as to be confirmed by the Joint Com- mitteqpn Printing
He purchase(h, it appears, with the unoffcial aid and advice of the Secretary of the Interior, upon the grounds, as alleged in a letter from himself, which I now have in my hand, that a building could not be erected in time .suffcient to enable him to comply with the law, which was to go into operation on the 4th of March
It was impossible for him to erect a building and put in it the necessary material in order to commence operations within that period
Acting under the advice and with the assent un- offciaily of the Secretary of the Interior, he pur- chased an existing establishment; The purchase, according to the law, was referred to the Ccnnrnit- tee on Printing
After due examination of all the papers, the Joint Committee on Printing unan- Imously confirmed the contract, believing it the very best thing that could be done in the premises for the Government
The report of the pu rchase was made by the Superintendent to the House committee; but as appears from a letter of the chairman of the House committee, it came there too late to be inserted in the deficiency bill, thc proper place for the appropriation; because other- wise the money cannot be paid until after thc 30th of June next, and the law requires the establish- ment to go into operation on the 4th of March
I mmy add, furthermore, that the printing of the House, it is understood, is not now promptly executed; and the Superintendent and the House committee desire this establishment to be put into operation for the benefit of the House printing
The contract, and all the papers in the casc are here, and can be read if any Senator deSires to have them read; butl believe 1 have given a full, thou«yh brief, sti.ttcmcnt of the facts
Mr
CAMERON
Every Senator present, I suppose, knows that I have always been opposed to the establishment of a Government printing offcc
I think it wrong, and I believe tirnc will prove it; but I have paid some attention to this subject, ana I am satisfied that the wisest thing thai could have been done under the circum- stances, was to buy this office
This printincr office of Wendell is the Inost perfect printincr office, not only in the United States, but in the It cost a much larger sum than the Gov- world
crnment has agreed to pay for it, and you have saved great
many jobs by rnaking this purchase
I um satisfied that from seventy-five to one hun- dred thousand dollars have bccn saved by making this arrangernent, and God only knows how much rnm•c you save from what would be cx- pended, if you v,rere to go on and erect a new building
I think that everybody who is in favor of the interests of the Government, and who is in favor the constant plunder in the shape of' I-n.tl)lic printino•, ought at o race to vote for the appropriation to buy this office
Let us try this cxpcrimcnt, and get done with it as soon as I belicvc thc experiment but I we can
am satisfied that this is a wise measum in regard The qucstion being taken by yeas and nays, resulted—yeas 37, nays 9; as follows: YEAS —Messrs

I move to postpone all prior orders

Mr
G WIN
Iam ins ructed by the Committee on the Post Office an Post Roads to offer an t the end of the bill the amendment, to insert following: 'l'o Cornelius Vander t, for carrying the mails from New York, via Panmna, to San Francisco, three times a month, from the Istot' July, 1860, at the rate ot• $350,000 per annuli), from which sutn shall be deducted the amount re- ceived for postages on said route ; and the Postmaster Gen- era) is hereby authorized to contract with said Vanderbilt, to carry the mails in the manner as aforesaid until the 30th of June next at the san'le rate or coinpens;ltiön ; and so much Inoney is hereby appropriated out of thc ']'rcasury of the United States, as Inay be necessary to carry out the said contract
At the last session of Congress no provision was made for carrying the mails by the ocean route
The Postmaster General made a contract, suuject to the approval of Congress, to curry those mails at the compensation stated in thö amend- ment, until the 4th oc March
The committee thought it proper to extend the privilege of carry- ing them at the same ratc of compensation to the end of the prcsent fiscal year
This gives us a mail three times a month for $400,000 less than was formerly aid for the samo service
Mr
LATI-PAM
1 should like to have that amendment so modified as to vest the power in the Postmaster General to settle with the contract-k ing parties
Mr
Vanderbilt is not the Only person who has discharged this service
His contract only extends from the city of New York to Aspin- wall
The railroad company have carried the mail across thc Isthmus, and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company upon the other side
When Congress makes this appropriation, I should like to see a proper recognition of their services made; for when the PostOflicc Departmentfirst wished to make this contract, Mr
Vanderbilt peremptorily refused to carry the inail
The Pacific Mail Steam- ship Company were perfectly willing to do it
They brought all the mail from San Francisco to Panama, upon the other side, where the old con- , and it was left upon the Isthmus, Mr
tract cn (led Vanderbilt
refusing to carry it to New York
'I'llC railroad cornpany •were also willing to carry it
My colleague and Inysell', as he knows very well, while in New York, waited upon thc agent of Mr
Vanderbilt's company, and ho declined to carry the mail in the absence of legislation, or to huvc anyth ing to do with it
The Pacific Mail Steam- ship Company wore perfectly willing to carry it after Congress had faded to make the appropria- tion last year, and the same is true of the railroad company
Now, I ask that the amendment be modified, so that their services may bc recoffllized, and that Congress, in making this appropriation, will not give the sole and entire credit of carryin«r thc mail from San Francisco to New York and back again to this individual
These companies entitled to n recorrnition of their services
I think the amendment should bc so modified
Mr
GWIN
Tho is drawn in ace.ordancc v,'it.h t.hc recommendations of the Post ()ffice Department
The coritract, as I undcrstand t.hc Postmaster General, was made wit.h Mr
Van- I-lore is a letter from the Assistal'lt Post- master General, stating that he had made con- tract with MI'
Vanderbilt, and he has asked that this arncndment should be passed in this form
It c,quue frorn thc Post Oflice Department to me
What my colleague has said in regard to throwing out the there, is correct; but I took it for o•ranted the Postmaster General had made it in the u•oper forni covering the whole case

Mr
GWIN
1 to have the letter of the Assistant' Postmaster General read, in which he says that he made this contract with Mr
Van- derbilt
That is the only information I have on the subject
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The letter will be read
The Secretary read it, as follows: POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT, Deccmber 15, 1860
SIR : I hoped 
ere this to have had a full conversation with you on the subject ot• Commodore Vanderbilt's present contract for carrying the California and South A Encrican mails
But I may, perhaps, say all that is necessary in a few words
You are aware that I was in New York and took an active part in getting him to conscnt to take charge of these inails early in July last, several cart-loads of which were then lying in the New York office, and I pledged-- myself to exert any influence I possessed toward securing to a titir remuneration for the service
Under the old contracts iOr semi-monthly service on this line, including branch from New ()rleans, the annual cost was $738,250, at a timc when the expense of the Isthmus conveyance was but $100,000 ; and for a period when this conveyance cost at the rate ot' $160,000, the entire expense reached the surn of $798,250
At the expiration of these contracts, it will be recollected that Cornmodore Vanderbilt ent.cred into a temporary con- tract iör twice-monthly service, nine months, up to June 30, 1860, at t.he rate of $250,000 per anntun, cæclusive of the Panama railroad service, which was continued at the former contract pay of $100,000 ; making the wholc cost $350,000
'I'his being a re(luctfon of $388*50 on the previous cost, was regarded as exceedingly reasonable; and in adjusting thc compensation under the existing contract, I heg leave to suagcst that, in vicw Of his performing tri-monthly ser- vice, embracing thc Isthrnus conveyance, if he will be sat- isficd with thc saine rate of pay, ($350,000,) it seeins to Ine there should bc no hesitation in granting it
It is true the branch from Nevv Orleans is otnitted ; but this is inuch Inore than offset by tho third monthly trip
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient HORATIO KING, servant, First dssistant Postmaster General
Hon
S
COLFAX, House of Representatioes
Mr
HUNTER
As 1 understand it, sir, this amendmQnt was designed to meet a provisional contract made by the President of the United States with Mr
Vanderbilt
It turned out that, under existing laws, owing to the failure of Con- grcss to pass an appropriation, he could get noth- ing but the postages on printed matter
That would not compensate him , hnd hc threw thc mails out
I-Ic was under no obligation to carry them; but, at the request of the Postluastcr General, he agreed to carry them upon his avowal that he would simply rocommcnd Congress to appropri- ate
There is no law•by which
we are bound
He carried them at a great saving to the Govern- ment as compared with the prices which had formerly been paid
That being the case, it seems to me we ought to make up the sum which he promised
Iam willing to go as far as..the Depart- ment recommended, because they have examined it; but I am not willing to amend it and go fur- thcr, becåusc I do not know whether it will be right or wrong
As far as they have proposed, it is manifestly just
If they made this bargain with him—and a good bargain it turned out to be —and hc carried it upon mere faith, there being no obligation that Congress would pay him, 1 think it ought to pay him
T hc portion of that amendrnent which the Department did not recom- mend is that which provides that the President or Postmaster General may contract, after thc 4th of March, at the same rate
'I'hat was left out origin- ally; because, at that time, it was supposed they would make another arrancrement by law in the I-louse for the period of time intervening between the 4th of March and the 1st of July next
Upon consultation with the chairman of the Committee on the Post Offce and Post Roads of the House, he suggested that we had better put in this amend- ment, in order to secure the carrying of the mails, if they failed in the House to carry out the plan which they have there, and which he thought they would fail in carrying out
That portion is not according to thc estimate, but is according to tho principle of the former contract, and was put in for the reason that I have just stated

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
I like, with the indulgence of the Senate, to have it would be wise and expedient to continue this arrangement to the 30th of June, 1861, and to that letter road again
I was interrupted by a make the payment ofa part conditional upon the consent of the contractors to carry the whole on this pay to that time
That was the Mr
GWIN
Yes, sir
Mr
HALE
I think, then, if the Senator from California will consent, we should insert after the words 1860, the words to the 1stJuly, 1861
Mr
GWIN
1 agree to it
Mr
LATHAM
1 do not object to that
Mr
HALE
I propose, then, to insert after the words " 1860," the words " to the 1st of July, 1861." Mr
LATHAM
The objection 1 made does not go to the merits of the amendment, either as to the sum or the contract
I have no objection whatever to them
I think, W'ith the Senator from Virginia, they are perföctly correct
If the De- partinent has made this contract with Mr
Van- derbilt, of course it vv'ill settle with him; but I do not think it is proper for Congress to recognize the peculiar services rendered by this gentleman, by naming him in this amendment
I think the persons ought to be left in blank; and the Depart- inent itself can pay those who have actually ren- dered the service
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The first ques- tion will be on the amendmcntoffered by the Sen- atop from California to the amendment of the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads
Mr
LATHAM
It is to strike out the name simply, leaving the appropriation for cari'Ying the mails between New York and San Francisco
Mr
HUNTER
I wish to suggest to the Sen- ator from California, that it is for the benefit of his country
We are willing to go as far as we know it to be right
What we do know is de- rived from the Post Offce Department
They make a statement which shows it to bc right to pay this sum of money to Mr
Vanderbilt for that period, because he did the work at their request, upon the hope of getting an appropriation
They havc not explained any other contracts that they may have, and we do not know how to deal with them; and I am opposed to going any further than they have recommended
I will vote for the amendment as it now is, but if it is altered shall not
I am willing to go as far as I understand the Department want us to go
I understand that to be right
They promised Mr
Vanderbilt, if he would take the IMils, that they would recom- mend Congress to appropriate the money; and if he did the service well, and executed it ata much less sum than has heretofore been paid, it seems to me we ought to pay him as they reconnnend
Mr
POLK
As I understand the amendment offered by the Senator from California, [Mr
LATHAM,] it is altogether in accordance with the views of the Senator from Virginia, as hc now express6s them: that is, the Senator froin Cali- fornia desires that the whole service shall be paid for, to meet the amount specified in thc amend- ment offered by thc chairman of the Committec on the Post Office and Post Roads, [Mr
whereas, if I understand correctly,' the Sen- ator from Virginia opposes the amendment, so that the sum shall go to Vanderbilt alone, when there may be others who are equally entitled with Vanderbilt to receive the money; and we may have -reclamation from them, and claims presented from others for the service they may have rendered
shall vote for the amendment offered by the Senator from California, because I am willing to appropriate this an-wunt for all the service rendered; but I am not willing it shall go to Mr
Vanderbilt alone and afterwards that other persons shall come forward, who may bc equally meritorious, and as much entitled to com- pcnsation as Mr
Vanderbilt is, and make claims In addition to what we now' vote
Thercforc, act- inm on the same reason—at least.,as I understand the reason presented by the Senator from Vir- ginia—l shall vote for the amendment offered by the Senator from California, although the Sena- tor from Virginia will oppose it
It seems to me that t,ve leave ourselves, by the amendment offered by the Senator from California, in a condition in which we pay for the service rendered, without any opportunity to be subjected to reclamation hereafter against us for the same service
Mr
HUNTER
There is misunderstanding, either on my part or on that of the Senator from Missouri
It may be that am mistaken
I should gentleman comin(.r to talk with me while it was being read, and I did not hear it all
II iVir
GWIN
If the Senator \vill permit me, it is said expressly there that
the contract was made with Mr
Vanderbilt
Mr
HUNTER
so 1 understood
Mr
G WIN
That is my only objection to the amendment of my colleague
The Department have informed us that they contracted with Mr
Vanderbilt for the entire service
If they have led us into a mistake about it, it is not our fault
Mr
LATHAM
Conceding what gentlemen say to be true, and they may be right about it— I cannot gainsay it—if the amendment is adopted, as I want it to be, the money goes, of course, to i this gentleman, if it turns out that the contract has becn made with him
Now, I know it as a a fact, that it is utterly impossiblc for Mr
Van- derbilt to carry the mail from San Francisco to New York
His line only extends from New York to Aspinwall
I know, further—I have not got the documents showing it in my possession now, but I can have them -durino• the day—that the mail on t.he other side during t le whole of the time for which payment is to bc made, ',vas car- ried steamships belonging to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and could only get across the Istlnnus by being carried by the Panama Rail- road Company
I propose to strike out his namc, and leave the amendment so that the Department itself can adjudicate this matter
If he alone has made a contract, the Department will pay him
But as it is now, whether he has performed the service or not, whether there is a contract with others or not, the atnount of money has to go into his hands; and if other persons have performed the service, if the Pacific Mail Steamship Com- pany and the Panama Railroad Company have performed the service, they may havo a claim against the Government, or they may be com- pellcd to proceed against Mr
Vanderbilt to get their proportion of it
As I said at first, I do not think Mr
Vander- bilt ought to be dignified by the insertion of his name here, as though he were the only man who could carry the mail between New York and San Francisco
When the Government failed to make the appropriation last year to carry this mail, he put his foot down, and compelled the Postmaster General and the President of the United States to come to him and humiliatingly beg of him to carry the mail matter
He had a mere link in the chain of communication, and thus had the Government in his power
If he has gone and made this con- tract so that he has the whole matterin his power, I presume, probably, the Post OMce Department and thc Government rnay be compelled to settle with him
However that may be, it rnatters not
1 know that the Panama Railroad Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company were will- ing to carry the mail without any contract, rely- ing solely and alone upon the honor of Congress to make an appropriation to pay them
I know the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, as I said before, brought the mail down on the other side after the expiration of the old contract, and at Panama it lay over, and Mr
Vanderbilt refused to bring it on this side to New York
Now, you propose to dignify him, and appropriate all this sum of money to him, as though he was the only man who rendered servicc to my State or to the country
I protest against it
I say that no in- justice is done to him by my amendment; but if the contract was made with him, I presume the Department will settle with him
Mr
HUNTER
1 would suggest to the Sen- ator from California, that I think hc made a mis- take in the eunendment
The $350,000, according to the estimate of the Postmaster General, included $100,000 to the Panama company, and $250,000 is for Mr
Vandcrbilt
Hc gets at the rate of $250,000 a year
The #100,000 gocs to the Pan- ama company, by agreement
are not asked to appropriate for that
It is paid under the old law, as I understand the letter
Mr
LATHAM
'Chat shows exactly what I have been arguing, that the only thing proper for Congress 10 do is to appropriate so much money for carrying the mail between the two points, and let the Department adjudicate to whom it shall go
Mr
POLK
1 ask the Senator from Califor- I nia, who offers this amendment, whether the amount mentioned in his amendment covers the, whole claim for carrying the mail betwixt New York and San Francisco, or whether
it is only such amount as Mr
Vanderbilt claims 'to % be entitled to
Mr
G WIN
I have but lately taken charge, of the Post Office Committee, on account of the former chairman of the committee having ceased to act; and therefore I am not fully informed-a's to all these details
I just stepped in as the esti- mate was handed to me from the Finance Com- mittee
I have no objection to the amendment of my colleague
Perhaps it is better to havo it in that way
There may be some diffculty in this matter, unless we put it in that shape
For iri* stance, the Senator from Virginia makes a sug- gestion in regard to the $100,000 to the Panama Railroad Company
I think the amendment of my colleague had better be adopted
The item was sent to me in the form in which I offered it; but I accept thc modification—that is, to pay the leave out all names
Mr
POLK
What I want to get at is one other fact, which will ask the Senator from Cal- ifornia; and that is, whether the $350,000 covers the whole
Mr
G WIN
Yes, that is all we appropriate
Mr
HUNTER
1 understand the $350,000 covers $100,000 to the Panama company and $250,000 to Mr
Vanderbilt
That is the sum stated in the letter
Mr
POLK
Then, of course, Mr
Vander- bilt's name ought not to be there
The amendment of Mr
LATHAM to the amend- ment was agreed to; and the question recurred upon the amendment, as amended
Mr
COLLAMER
1 desire the amendment as amended to be read
The Secretary read it, as follows: For carrying the mails from New York, -via Panama, -to San Francisco, three times a •nonth, from the 1st of July, 1860, at the rate of $350,000 per annum, from which sum shall be deducted the amount received for postages on said route, and the Postmaster General is hereby authorized, to contract for carrying the mails in the manner
aforesaid until the 30th of June next, at the same rate of compensa- tion, and so much money is hereby appropriatcd out of the Treasury of the United States as may be necessary to carry out the said contract
Mr
HALE
There was an amendment which I proposed, and which was assented to by the mover
Mr
GWIN
Yes, sir; 1 agrce to that, and it ought to be inserted
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The amend- ment of' the Senator from New Hampshire is to insert after the words the 1st of July, 1860," to the 1st of July, 1861." Mr
HALE
That is it
The amendment, as amended, was agreed to

The amendment was agreed to
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended , and the amendments made asin Committee of the Whole concurred in, and ordered to be engrossed ; and the bill was ordered to be read a third time
It-was read the third time, and passed

The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr

OFFICER
Upon tion thc yeas and nays have bccn ordered
Mr
COLLAMER
desire the reading of that the lilan- part of thc bill which is referred to as ner hereinafter provided." The Secretary read the first section of the bill
Mr
HALE
Asc the Senator from V cnnnont, has had that read, i wish simply to say, that as I understand thc bill, if this arncndmcnt is not adopted, it cannot have my vote, and i am a friend of the bill
The bill, as It stands, makes a close corporation, confines all its privileges to u few men, and icts iR to the enjoyment of t11C fran- chises only such persons as they choose to vote in
This amendment opcns it to the citizens of the country who to subscribe under the conditions limited in the bill
I hope the amend- ment will be adopted
If it is not, the bill cer- tainly cannot have my vote
The Secrctary procecdcd to call the roll
Mr
LATHAM, (when his name was called.) I merely want to say, having indicated to the Sen- ate that I should oppose all amendments that were offered to this bill when it was first presented to the Senate, that inasmuch as other amendments have been put upon the bill, and the Senate has undertaken to perfect it, I regard this amendment as one of the most just and proper that has yet been offered; and I shall, therefore, change the vicw I havc adopted , and vote for thc amendment
T hc result was announced—yeas 34, nays II; as follmvs.• Binghinn

Mr

• I move an amendment to perfect the bill, as this amendment has been adopted
It is in line forty-three, after the word named," to insert " and their associates." T hc amendmcnt was agreed to
Mr
RICE, I offer an amendment in line seven, I section one, to strike out the words " on the west- i ern border of Iowa, " and insert " from Superior i City, Wisconsin, via St
Paul, Minnesota;" so that it will read : That to insure the safe, certain, and speedy transporta- tion of Inails, and public stores from the western border of what is called our westcrn States, by railroad, to wit: starting frotn two points, one on tuc wcstcrn border of the State of Missouri, at the nM3t1th of thc Kansas rivcr, and proceeding thcnee up the valley ofthc said river to the vicinity of Fort Riley, and the other fronl Superior City, Wisconsin, via St
Paul, Minnesota, &c
And on that I ask for thc yeas and nays
The yeas and nays wore ordered, and tho Sec- rctary proceeded to call the roll
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will suspend thc call of the roll
The general prev- alcnce of conversation on tho floor of the Cham- bcr and in the galleries is such as seriously to interfere with the progress of busincss, and must bc suspended
It is impracticablc to presidc with so much confusion
The offccrs in charge are directed to rcmovo the persons from the galleries who shall violate the order of the body
Silence having been restored, the Secretory pro- cccdcd to call the roll
Mr
POLK, (when his name ••,vas called.) I wristh to say that I shall vot.c yea," but at the time to state that I shall vole for an amend- n')cnt, which will thc advance of money to the Tcrritorics exclusively, and not extend into tbc States

Mr
DOOLITTLE
1 purpose to vote for the amendment that I expect to be offered by the Sen- ator from Minnesota, in relation to tho northern route; but this proposition, as I understand, is to mako a road from Lake Superior down to the central route

So thc tuncndment was rejected
Mr
RICE
I have another amendmcnt to offer
I suppose there will bc no objection to it
It is, ill linc forty-niho of the firstsect.ion, after the word to strike out the words " at the occupied," date of passing tl'lis act," and to insert in lieu at
the time of the comple- thcrcof thc words tion of the survey of said road, whether said occupants shall reside in the Indian country or elsewhere;" so that thc clause will read: And when the United States have disposed of any such sections, or for any other reason cannot convey title thereto, or when the same shall bc condemned by the United States surveyor as worthless, and his decision be approved by the Secretary of' the Interior; or when the saine shall be 'nincral lands, or if the sanie, shall be occupied at t.he time of the coxnplet.ion of the survey of said road, whether said occupants *hail reside in the Indian country or elsewhere, the deficiency shall bc Inade up by selections made within six miles fronl said road from lands of the United States to which nonc of the aforesaid objections apply
ri'he object of the amendment is simply to pro- tect the settlers in the Pike's Peak region, a'nd other portions of the country in which the Indian title has not been extinguished
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the Senate ready for the question on the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 ask to have the ment reported again
I had prepared an amend- ment to the same portion of thebill, and I should like to hear this amendment acain
The Secretary again read it
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 had a rather different amendment to offer to this clause of thc bill
T hc necessity for an amendment, here is apparent
Of course, the Senate would never consent that the men who may occupy portions of this territory at any time prior to its even being pointed out as the line on which the road shall run, should bc turned out of their homcstcads by the selection by the company; but supposc that at the date when the company have pointed out their line, and made application to the President, their occu- pancy ought to cease, so as not to interfere with their operations; and my amendment was—I will suggest to the Senator from Minnesota whether it is not more just—to mako the time for occu- pancy cease at the time of the application to the Prcsidcnt to withhold the lands from settlement
I think, whenever the company has made this application Mr
RICE
Might not the company make that application prior to survey 
Mr
BENJAMIN
The company is bound to make the application according to a further clause of the same section of the act: That so soon as the terms ot• this act are accepted by the parties undertaking to perform the services herein pro- vided for, it shall be the duty of the President of thc Uni- ted States, upon the application of said parties, to cause the public landg for six miles on each side of so much of such road as the parties may indicate to be from settlement
Now, when the company has determined wherc its line is to be, and calls upon the President, des- ignating that line, to withhold the lands from set- tlement, I think they ought to be so withheld
Mr
RICE
I will state to the Senator that on several occasions companies have applied to the President to withhold lands from the market, des- ignatine as nearly as they could the probable line, and he has so withheld them; but when the sur- veys svere made, it has been found that they havc deviated some throe or four miles either way
In that case we ought to protcct the lands to the set- tlcrs
When the line shall have been run, each I fear the settler knows exactly his position
application will bc made bef8re thc designation of the line
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 tho application would have to designate the line, in order that the Prcsident might know what was to be withheld
Mr
RICE
They designate itinformally
They say, from one point to another
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 would rather bc particu- lar in thht
Mc
RICE
I have seen the practical working Mr
DOUGLAS
I wish to make a suggestion on that point
It strikes me there is force in the objection made by the Senator from Louisiana
If settlers are allowed to follow the surveyor, and find out about where the line of road is to be, and taka cach a town site, and get possession before the final location of the road, I do not think the grant would be worth much to the railroad
I think, therefore, there should be no settlement allowed to be made after they had designated the general course of thc road; and thc land should bc reserved from market
It strikes me that un- der the amendment as it now stands, speculators would follow the surveyors and take all the best lands before thc road was finally located, and be guided by the surveyors in the location of the road
It seems to me that would greatly impair the value of the grant
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 will offer my amend- ment as an amendment to that of the Senator fronn Minnesota
Mr
RICE
There is a misunderstanding in regard to this amendment, I am sure
My only object is to protect the settler
Suppose the com- pany should apply to the President to withhold the land for a distance of thirty miles in the Pike 's Peak region, and he should do so: hundreds and thousands who are upon their way would get thero bcforc they could reccivc the news of thc withholding of the land; they would have made their settlements and invested their all upon the  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
427 land ; and in ninety days or six months after, it is withheld from settlement
I think itshould be the first duty of the Government to protect the poor men
It is truc, a few might follow the surveyor
on the land, and get valuable sections or quarter sections; but with the liberal provisions made in the bill for the corporators, I think some little attention should be given to the settlers
Mr
LATHAM-
I will inquire whether the Senator from Louisiana can offer his amend- ment
This is an amendment to an amendment, is it not
Mr
BENJAMIN
There has been but one amendment offered, and this is an amendment to that amendment
Mr
LATHAM
Offered as a substitute
Mr
BENJAMIN
his an amendment to the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota
It becomes a substitute, Of course
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Louisiana proposes the following amcndL ment to the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota
Mr
BENJAMIN
By way of substitute
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The amend- ment will be read
Mr
BENJAMIN
To carry out my amend- ment, it will only be necessary to strike out the words passing this act," in the forty-ninth line of the first section
The Secretary read the amendment in line forty-nine of the first section, to strike out the words "passing this act," and to inscrt in lieu thereof the WOMls "•the application to thc Presi- dent to withhold them from settlement and salc as hereinafter provided;" so that the clause will read: And when the United States have disposed of any such sect!on.s, or any other reason cannot convey titic there- to, or when the sa•ne shall be condcnmncd by thc United States surveyor as worthless, ;tnd his (lccision be approved by t.he Secretary of the Interior; or when the sani(' shall be mineral lands, or if the stune Shau be occupied at the date of the application to the Presidcnt to withhold them from settlement and sale as hereinafter provided, the defi- ciency shall be made up by selections made within six miles from said froin lands of the United Statcs to which none of thc aforesaid objections apply
The amendment to the amendment was agreed to; and the amendment, as amended, was adopted
Mr
LANE
mere is amendment pending to the first section of the bill, that was offered by me somc days ago, and ordcrcd to bc printed
L ask to have it considered now
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senötor from Oregon offers an amendment to the first scc- tion of the bill; which will bc read
The Secretary read it—to strike out all after the words " Great Salt Lake," in the eleventh line, of the first section, to the word " California," in the thirteenth line, and to insert the followiryr: To the navigable waters of the Sacra•mcnto, in the State of California; thence, by two diverging lines, one to the

The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from Oregon accept this instead of his own amendment
Mr
LANE
If I understand it aright, I think I will
My object is to provide for a branch of this road to extend to Portland, Oregon
The PRES(DING OFFICER
The Chair understands, then, that the question before the Senate is upon tho amendment offered by the Sen- ator from California, and accepted by the Senator from Oregon
Mr
LANE
I desire to make an inquiry: whether, comino in at that place in the bill, that branch road will be entitled to all the benefits that any other portion of the road is entitled to, and the same amount of appropriations
Mr
GWIN
Yes, sir
Mr
LANE
Then 1 accept the amendment in place of mine
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the amendment offered by the Senator from California, accepted by the Senator from Oregon in place of his own
Mr
BENJAIVIIN
This amendment is carry- ing out that principlc in this bill which is most objectionable to those that endeavored to have it amended; it is that part of the bill which provides for the construction ofa railroad by this Govern- I propose to offer, as a ment within the States
substitute for•that amendment, striking Qut of the bill the words, in the cleventll and twelfth lines, " to the city of San Francisco; or to the naviga- ble waters of the Sacramento, in the State of Cal- ifornia;" and inserting, " some point on thc east
crn boundary of Caliiörnia;" the purpose boing to mark, by it VOLC of the Senate, its sensc in rc- lation to this principle of appropriatin«r money to build railroads in the States; because it is obvious to us all, that if we are to begin constructing rail- roads in t.he States of this Union, cach State of the Union will ask for its fair share of the public treas- ure towards building a road within its own limits
Hitherto the action of Congrcss upon this subject of building railroads in the States has been con- fincd exclusively to cascs wherc the road runs through public land, and a portion of that 'land was given to the company, or to the State, by t.hc Government in its capacity of proprietor of the land—a part given in order to enhance the value of the rest; but this, I think, is the first direct attempt to get.an appropriation from thc public Treasury of the whole of the United States for the purpose of building a railroad in a State
Now, sir, the proposition made is to build so much of this railroad in the State of California as intervenes between the city of San Francisco and the eastern limits of the State
As now amended by the Senator from Oregon, according to the suff- gestion of the Senator from California, we are not only to build a railroad across the State of Cali- fornia to the city of San Francisco, but we arc to build a line of railroad on the Pacific, up the coast from California to Oregon, and, o
course, after- wards down the coast; and, in that way, provide the Pacific coast with a system of railroads al the That is, after it strikes the navigable waters of expense of thc national Treasury
It appears to me this is too monstrous a proposition to be sup- the Sacramento river— north through the valleys of Sacramento, Rogue river, I ported for an instant
Hitherto all attempts to Uznpqua, and Willamette, to Portland, in Oregon; and for make, or to induce the assent of Congress towards making, this Pacific railroad, have been confined the construction of this branch , a grant of alternate sections of land for six miles on each side of said road is hereby to that portion of the road which passes through Inade, to be selected in odd nullibers from the nearest un- the public Territories
This is the first time that occupied and' unappropriated agricultural lands." I suggest to the Senator that it would bc better any serious attempt has been mado to go into the States and build a railroad by the Federal Gov- if he put his amendment in that form
ernment and to appropriate lands and' the•public treasure for that purpose
So far as the grant of land has 'been concerned, as in the case of Illinois, the grant was put upon the express ground, and only passed upon -thit ground, that the Government of the United' States being a landed proprietor, having the same under theConstitution , to dispose advantageouSlY of its land as any other proprietor would have, had the right to give away a part of -the land, as a consideration Tor a road which, built through the land, would make the remainder belonging to the Government equivalent in value to the •whole before the improvement was made
But"now the proposition is, not simply to improve the public lands of California, by giving a part of -them, to enhance the valuc of the rest, but to give •money out of the Federal Treasury, in advance, for the purpose of building a road, in order that, when that road is built, it nhay be used for the purpose of carrying the mails and troops
That argument will apply to every State of this Union
There is no earthly reason for selecting the State of Cal— ifornia, more than any other State, for thé appro• priation of Federal funds in building a railroad
The amendment which I offer, marks distinctly this principle, and I shall ask the vote of thc Sen- ate upon it by yeas and nays, that we may dis- cover which of us it
is that supposes this General Government has the power, under the Constitu- tion of the United States, to appropriate the Fed- cral treasure for building railroads within the If it has such a power, it will certainly States
be used, and u€ed to an extent that will absorb every possible source of revenue that the public Treasury can ever expect to receive
dangerous power to initiate the exercise of, if we had it; butl believe gentlemen will search in vain for any pretcxt in the Constitution for the exer- cise of such a power
T hc Senator from Missis- sippi, [Mr
DAvzs,] who, for a series of years has done evcrythint" he could for the purpose of having this railroaa built, who inaugurated the system of surveys, who has backed this project of a Pacific railroad With all his strength and all his influence, cvcr held that point sqcred: that the Federal Government had no right to go into the States and appropriate the Federal treasure for I have, therefore, again to repeat that purpose
that I move to strike out all thatpart of the twelfth and thirteenth lines which provide for this road being built to the city of San Francisco; and to insert instcad of them the words, " the eastern I move that as a sub- boundary of California." stitute for the amendment
Mr
G WIN
The Senator from Louisiana, of course, has observed that, from the beginning, tho building of a Pacific railroad has been advo- cated as a military work necessary to the military defense of the country; and this amendment of the Senator from Oregon is eminently proper in that respect; because It is absolutely necessary to the military defense of that portion of the Pacific coast that the road should approach it
-In the evcnt of a war with any powerful maritime na- tion at present, the whole Pacific coast would be cut off
Even if we had this railroad -to San Fran- Cisco, in the event ofa war—and we have a very formidable neighbor (Great Britain) in that im- mediate vicinity—it would be impossiblc to send any succor or any defense to that portion of the Pacific coast that is intended to receivo military It is on that protection by this amendment
ground that the Senator from Mississippi, a strict constructionist, has always advocated It; on the very ground that, in the State of Louisiana, the Government of the United States might build a railroad from the Mississippi river to Fort Pike, and the other forts that are intended to defend the entrance
That is the obicct of this amendment
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will take leave to suggest to the Senate that between the amendment offered by the Senator from Ore- (ron and the amendment to that proposed bv the Senator from Louisiana, there is u palpabfe in- consistency that renders it impossible to enter- tain the .latter proposition as an amendment to the former
The amendment of the Senator from Louisiana proposes to strike out a portion of the original bill not reached oraffected by the amend- mont offered by the Senator from Oregon; and to insert other words instead
At the same time, the Chair will remark that the adoption of tho amendment of the Senator from Louisiana would  428 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17, supersede the necessity of action upon the amend- ment proposed by the Senator from Oregon; but that of the Senator from Oregon being first pro- posed, is first in order
and must first be acted upon
Mr
GREEN
I suggest to the Senator from Louisiana that at the proper time he change his proposed amendment, and say that the money consideration or the bonds shall not apply to any State through which any parb of the road shall pass
Ido itfor two reasons
The southern road passes through Texas; a portion of the central road passes through Kansas; and the probability is that Kansas will be a State before this road can be built
I want to be just to all; and therefore, when he proposes his amendment, I should like him to so frame it that the money grant shall apply to no State through which the road shall pass
Mr
BENJAMIN
I am perfectly willing to accept that suggestion, and would have offered the amendmentin that shape but that the course which the Senate has pursued hitherto has been so to amend the first section of the bill, which contains the principles on which the measure is based, as to determme the whole theory of the bill itself; and when we have got this first section so amended as to suit the Senate, put into such shape that it can pass the Senate, then we can make the like But I am per- amendments to the other sections
fectly willing now to adopt the svgestion of the Senator from Missouri
I think, if my friend from Oregon will permit me to say so, that the vote ought to be taken on my proposition before his; because, if the Senate refuse to go into the State of California at all with this grant of money, it is obvious that his amendment will have no appli- if hc will withhold his amendment fora cation
moment, to sec whether the Senate adopts the principle which I suggest, if mine is voted down, then his cornes in properly
Mr
LANE
propose to do that in a moment, after q,vord or two of explanation, with a view of testing the sense of the Senate on that subject
My own opinion has always been that this Gov- ernment has no power, under tbc Constitution, to make roads ii the States, except wllcre tlucy are nccessary for the defense of the country; and I am inclined to think that if a road can be inade in any State where it will cver be necessary for thc defense of the country, it is in the Pacific States— California and Oregon; and especially in Oregon, if this road goes to California
As understand the provisions of this bill , tho whole amount of the aecurities issued by the Government for making the road will be repaid, or the Government will bc reimbursed by service rendered in the trans- portation of troops, supplies, and the United States mails, No portion of the road ever could bc used so, necessary for these purposes, ns the porti01') that, I desire to provide for between the Sacramento rivcr und ()regon
If war should ensue, and supplies should be necessary in Cali- fornia, no portion of America can produce wheat in such abundance; in no place could flour be bought so cheap, as in Oregon
This day the ••.vheat crop of last year, and half the crop of the year before, is still on hand
Then, sir, if a road of this kind can bc built with a view to the defense of the country, this branch is necessary—this portion of the road is important to the Government, and will enable it to protcct the frontiers of that portion of our coun- try adjoinil'lg tho British possessions
In thc event ofa war with any ftn•eign country, it would be very necessary; and I will say to the Senate that i could only vote for a bill appropriating money to make a road within a State upon the ground that it was necessary for the defense of the country
That is the ground I have always put this on; it is the groundl stand on now; und If gentlemen can satisfy me that it will not be ne- cessary for the defense of the country, I cannot vote for this bill, nor even for the amendment which I have offered
I know that the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, [Mr
DAY1s,] fbr whose opinions I have, great respect, and whom I look upon as sound as any man in the nation on this question, regarded a railroad to the Pacific States as neces- sary for the public defense; and he caused sur- veys of the various routes to be made with a view to the defense of the country
am not aware, to vote an appropriation of money for making a railroad within a State
BENJAMIN
1 will inform the Senator froneOregon, that he always made that objection, and arvavs confined himself to the Territories where owned the land
Mr
IÄNE
That meets my own views pre- cisely
It has always been my opinion that we had not the right to do it, except för the defense of the country
Mr
GWIN
But the Senator from Mississippi also contended that the power existed within a State, if it was necessary for military purposes; and he gave the very instance I did, that you could buil(Fa railroad from the Mississippi river to the forts which protected its mouth
Mr
LANE
I think therc can bc no doubt about that
If a road was necessary for the de- fehse of the country, Congress would clearly have the right to make it, as it would to make any provision necessary for the defense of the coun- try
I am not quite certain about this matter
1 would like my mind, my conscience especially, to be easy on the subject; but I say, if it is right, if it is proper for the defense of the country to build a railroad into California and to San Fran- Cisco, then certainly it would be right and proper and necessary to extend it on to a portion of our country which is very much more exposed than California; and it was, indeed, with the view to the defense of the country that I proposed this amend- ment—ivith a view of furnishing supplies, x,vith a view of affording facilities for thc transportation of troops, and everything else necessary for the defense of the country
On that ground my amendment rests; and if it is the sense of the Sen- ate that they have the power -to make the road into California to the Sacramento valley, certainly they havc the power and it is their duty to ex- tend it on to Portland, in Oregon
At any rate, if the road goes to San Francisco, or to thc naviga- ble waters of the Sacrmnento river, it ought to be cxtcnded to Portland, and my amendment ought to come in; but I am willing to withdraw it for the mmnent., so as to afford the Senator from Lou- isiana an opportunity to test the sense of the Sen- alc upon lus amendment
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Oregon withdrawing his amendment for the time being, the question recurs on thé amendment proposed b the Senator from Louisiana
Mr
GRÅEN
1 have but one word to say on that
I shall votc for it; for the principle is clearly right; and I should like the Senator from Oregon to remember that there is a vast difference between a work necessary for the public defense, and a work convenient for the
public defense
I admit that his proposed road would be convenient for the public defense, and there is not a railroad in the United States but what 'is convenient for the public defOnse
It subserves a useful purpose in tirne of 'vvar; but what do we understand by " ne- ccssary 
' ' Are wre to understand that everything that is merely convenient and accommodating, and can subservc some useful purpose, is a ncccs- sary thing to the public service
I do not so un- derstand It, and will not so vote
I will vote for a great main trunk linc through the Territories of the United States; for I regafd that as necessary, not merely convenient, but indispensable; and I justify my course because it is
an indispensable necessity
But when I come to the border of a State, and vote a large portion of the public lands to assist thc State in the construction of the road, it is enough
It is as much as Illinois, Indiana, or Ohio, or any other State has had; and it is as much as I would give to California to construct this main trunk road; and the ordinary course of human events will make the links; and if it does not, the proximity will enable troops
and munitions to be transported with so much facility, ease, and speed, as to disprove the necessity, and to show that it is not a necessary rncans of de- fense, but it would be a convenient means
My only purpose was to explain thc difference bc- necessary," as understood under the tween Constitution, and " convenient." Mr
DOUGLAS
Mr
President, if the amend- ment proposed by the Senator from Louisiana shall be adopted, we rnay just as well abandon the bill
I suppose it will utterly annihilate the bill
The southern road certainly will be worth nothing if all that portion of it which lies within however, that he, at any time, ever stood ready II the State of Texas is to be stricken out, and you are to begin it at the El Paso on the Rio Grande, eight hundred miles from navigable water or from any railroad communications
Mr
LATHAM
Will my friend allow me to interrupt him right here
While the Senator from Louisiana was arguing, I made a calculation of that which, under the amendment, the southern It would get just $15,000,000, route would get
instead of $36,000,000, if his amendment be adopted
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 have no objection to its only getting $5,000,000, if that is constitu- tional, and $15,000,000 is unconstitutional
Mr
DOUGLAS
Then if the idea of the Sen- ator from Missouri, which I understand to be ac- quiesced in by the Senator from Louisiana, shall be adopted, that Kansas is to be exempt from this grant, too, inasmuch as she is about to become a State, that no money is to be advanced for the construction of the road in any State, although it Inay be a Territory now, if it becomes a State before the road is completed, I take it for granted 'vve shall never have a road at all
It is equivalent to an abandonment of the whole project; and I would therefore just as soon vote against any bill and every bill for a road, as to vote to recognize the principle asserted by the Senator from Louis- lana
I have been accustomed to hear a great deal about a distinction in the powers of Congress between a State and a Territory, and I have heard it so long, and from so many, that sometimes I have rather acquiesced in the idea myself, as if it was really true; but I have never yet found the Senator who has pointed out the distinction be- tween the powers of Congress over the States and its powers over the Territories
Congress has certain delegated powers; they are enumerated: to coin money; to support armies; to collect rev- e:nues•, to maintain navies
Each one of them applies alike to the States and to tlle Territories
I do not know what power you have to make a road in a Territory, more than in a State
If we have the power to make this road, I suppose it is on the ground that it is necessary to the military defense
I believe it has always been put on the ground that it was necessary to the defense of the country, and the right to defend the country applies in the States as well as it does in the Ter- ritories
The right to build a fort or to establish dock-yards or navy-yards, or to do any other act essential to the public defense, applies everywhere under the Constitution
Hence, if you are going to make this road under the military power, that power is coextensive with the country covered by the Constitution
If you are going to make the road under the commercial power, that power is coextensive with the Constitution
If you are going to make the road under the postal power, that power, also, is coextensive with the Rcpub- lic
I care not under what power you are going to make this road, it r•nust be by virtue of one of the delegated powers in the Constitution, and each one of those delegated powers applies to States and to Territories alike
Therefore I do not see '*there t.his distinction is
Congress hag no powers except those which are delegated; and each delegated power applies to every foot of American soil, whether it be in a State or in a Territory, or in the District of Columbia
We have no right to appropriate money to make a road at all, unless it is embraced by one of these delegated powers
I support it because it is ne- cessary for the military defense
It is Convenient to commerce; it is convenient for the transporta- tion of the mail; but I believe it is essential to the military defense; and whether you put it un- der the one or the other of these powers, it applies alike to the whole country; it is the same in the States as in the Territories; but the necessity is not the same in the old States as it is in the new States and Territories
I say, then, that unless we can recognize our right to make this road as necessary to the public defense, and that power is applicable to States the same as the Territories, we may as well abandon the whole project at once
Mr
BENJAMIN
Mr
President, the line of argument suggested by the honorable Senator from Illinois surprises me somewhat
It brings up the old question, to be sure, to a certain ex- tent, of the power of Congress in the Territories; and yet, to the extent to which the Senator's Ian- guage would go, I am satisfied he himself would not fot a moment maintain it
He begins by  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
429 asserting that he has often heard discussions in the Senate of the United States in relation to the dis- tinction in the power of Congress bctwecn the States and Territories, and says he never been able to find any one that would point out where the distinction was
Now, one thing, sir, is very certain, that the Senator himself constantly votes for the exercise of power and for an appropria- tion of funds in the Territories, which ho would be the last to vote for in the States; That Sena- tor would never vote to pay the Governor of a State his salary out of the Federal 'I'reasury
That Senator would never vote here to appropri- ate thc Federal funds for the Legislatures of the States; and there are a thousand other appropri- ations of that sort, showing that there must be somewhere a power in Congress over the, Terri- tories that does not residc in Congress as applied to the States
It appears to me, sir, that the distinction be- tween the power of Congress in the States and in the Territories is so broad and marked, that I am quite surprised to hear the Senator say he is un- able to distinguish it, and has never heard any- body make any explanation in relation to it
The States have, on the theory of the Constitution, all powers of sovcrcignty not expressly delegated to the Federal Government
The Senator assents to that, but he further says that the Congress of the United States have none but delegated powers, and can exercise nonc but those delegated powers, whether in the States or in the Territories
Well, sir, that depends upon whether the Constitution has made a distinction in this delegation
So får as the States are concerned, the Constitution has made that distinction
The Constitution, in ex- press terms, provides that the States retain all powers not by them expressly delegated to the Federal Goverrnnent, but there is a distinction be- tween that delegation of power between the States and the District of Columbia, very certainly, for the Constitution, at the same time that delegates certain powers to Congress in the States, delegates to Congress far more extensive powers in the Dis- triet of Columbia
It grants it powers of exclus- i ve legislation in this District
Now, sir, in all the discussions which have hitherto taken place as to the power of Congress in the Territories, the sole question was whether *Congress had power to legislate for the Territo- Upon that subject Congress has certainly assumed pox,ver; and • the Senator himself, upon repeated occasions, arid for a series of years, has brought in bills here by which not only has the Congress of the United States assumed power over the Territories, but has assumed parental power over them, giving them a government, orcanizing them, providing how they are to b overncd, «iving them Legislatures and Govern s; and in former times this Government gave them legisla- tive councils—another means of government—for their legislation
Surely all these powers do not exist in the States
The power of the United States over the Territories IS subject to none of the restrictions which the Constitution makes in relation to its power over the States
the very nature of our Government, there arc certain provisions which would strike evcry onc at once as inconsistent with its true principles, as applied to the Territories
Aithough there is no special statement in the Constitution in relation to the exercise of power in the Territories, nobody sup- poses that Congress would have power to create titles of nobility in the Territories; but in relation to the government to be exercised in the Territo- ries, there is no other source of power but the In the States the government is car- Concrress
ried on upon all subjects not expressly by them delegated to the General Government, by their own State Legislatures; by the powers vested in the people of the States themselves
But, sir, if we are to believe the decisions of thc Supreme Court of the United States, and the constant and uninterrupted practice of this Government from its foundations, the Congress of the United States has powers in the Territories far exceeding, on all subjects, those that it can possibly exercise in the States
I think that at the present time it would per- haps not be very wise or very judicious to go but I desire to go into this discussion at length; back to the precise point before the Senate in the bill, and that is in relation to the exercise of the power now disputed, in the State of California; and first let me say to my friends from California that I think they are runnmg uselessly a very great risk in relation to this bill by insisting on a grantof money by the Congress of the United States for the building of the road within that State
At onc time it is very probable that it would have been impossible to make the connection between the ',vestern limits of this road, if it sü)pped at the eastern boundary of California and the city of San Francisco; that the means would not have been adequate; but the events of the last eighteen months have satisfied me that the people of Cali- fornia now possess the amplest means for making the connection
Some eighteen months ago, per- haps a little longer—I cannot state the precise time—just outside of the eastern boundaries of the State of California, and within the Territory of Utah, a range of mineral deposits was discov- ered in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, prob- ably the richest on the face of the earth
I heard such fabulous stories of tile richness of that min- eral district, that 1 took special pains to visit it when in California
In forty-four hours from the time that I left the city of San Francisco I was in the plains of Utah
In the space of some six months the people, in consequence of the dis- covery of those silver mines, had settled along the entire road; and from the point where the steamboat landed me, upon the Sacramento river, to the Washoe mines, there was scarcely a mile upon which there was not a settlement of inhab- itants
Two ranges of mountains had been crossed; the people had thrown themselves by voluntary association into companies, and every twenty or thirty miles they had built graded roads across the mountains; the passenger was required to pay a quarter or half a dollar for driving his horse across; and so, from the point where I left the Sacramento river, to the Washoe mines, I found one continuous graded road, over which I drove in a buggy with a pair of horses, and made the entire distance in förty-four hours from San Fran- cisco to the Washoe mines; the only difficulty in the travel being, tl'lat from end to end the road was so covered with teams bringing back ore and carryinrr up provisions, that we were sometimes detaznea hours at a time to get by them
I saw a statement a day or two ac'0 in one of the New York papers, showing that probably there was no inveslment on the fhce of the earth that would bc a more payin•y irivestmeiit at this moment than a very short road crossing the Sierra Nevada, on• grades since discövered and perfectly practicable, for the purpose of connect- mg the trade between the Washoe silver minincy district and the city of San Francisco
Why, sir, I went up there into thosc mountains after crossing two ranges of the Sierra; I saw spots •where, in the month of May—I was informed by credible witnesses, United States officers—there were
but a few canvas tents, and I found cola lected at the mines a population of nearly ten thousand people; I found three-story brick and stone houses; found a very large number of comfortable frame houses; and tbc whole district around was crowded, and daily being more crowded by the influx of a population all attracted by these immense mineral deposits
We have the news by every mail of the carrying down to San Francisco of silver ores from that region worth two or three thousand dollars a ton
There is a trade, a commerce, a population, and an im- provement there that secures to the State of Cal- lfornia the means of building that road within its own limits, without calling on Congress for the exercise ofa disputed power
I therefore say to my friends from California, that if they wish forever the defeat of this bill, they have only to insist on keeping in the bill a provision that Congress shall spend money in the State to build the road
Let Congress make the road across the public Territories; let it exercise its governmental powers across the Territories, where none dispute •those powers, and let the States that desire to connect with this great pub- 
lic enterprise connect with their own means, and not ask Congress to make appropriations
In relation to what the Senator from Illinois I has said about the proposition as regards Kansas, T did not intend, in makilog tho remarks which I made in response to the Senator from Missouri, to suggest that 1 was willing to put in this bill a provision that the benefits of this Federal sub- scription should cease as fast as the Territories became- States
I suppose:that; if we exercise the powers-over the Territories now *eStéd fairly, the act of Congress would not become peaied bv the organization of a Territory into a State
But I shall certainly insist upon: striking out every provision in this bill that has refereåcö to the road being built by Federal funds, riot only within the State of California, but with-irb the State of Texas
I am perfectly willing, when thiå bill shall 'have been so guarded as to prevent its being turned into a job—being made a specula• tion to be sold in Wall street for few men to make money out of it; when the bill shall khave been so guarded as to insure us the early comple- tion of a railroad across the Territories which intervene between the
Pacific and Atlantic States —to go for it, as that seems to be the will of the American people; but I shall never cease oppos- ing the passage of any bill which carries the Fed- eral funds into the States for building railroads in them
I believe no more corrupt source for destroying the morals of the people could be opened; nothing that would do more -dämage to this country,• than a commencement, by CongreSs,: of appropriating the funds of the United States to the building of railroads within the States
Talk of the military power, sir! Is it any more a military power to build a railroad in the State of California, or in any State, because it be useful in time of war, than it would 
be to do a -thousand other things which everybody would at once admit to be unconstitutional
Suppose we were to say—and I have very little doubt that such would be the case—that if you would put ten thousand good fighting men into the State of Oregon, and twenty thousand into the State of California, they would be an excellent protection in time of war for those States: yet, sir, as there is no war now, I presume very few would be will- ing to vote the funds of the General Government to pay men a premium to go there and settle for the purpose of defending those States in case war should break out
And, so far as the States are concerned, I can see as little power in Congress to build in advance railroads which are intended for passenger and commercial purposes, u nder the military power, simply upon the suggestion that they would be usefGl If var broke out
I do not put the right of making a road through the Ter- ritories exclusively upon the military power
[t is a fair exercise of the military power within the Territories
I put the power of the General Gov- ernment to mukc the road in the Territories, on the ground that Congress has the right to govern the crerritories; that it must govern them as the Legislatures govern States, always with due sub- ordination to such principles of the Constitution as would prohibit the cxet•cisc of the power unequally as regards the rights of the different States
I desire, sir, not to detain the Senate on this subject; it has been very fully debated before; and I was only tempted into what 1 have said by the remarks of the Senator from Illinois, in relation to the distinction between the powers of this Gov- ernment in the States and in the Territories
Mr
DOUGLAS
Mr
President, feel called upon to say a few words in reply to so much of the argument of the Senator from Louisiana as impeaches my position
I do not acknowledge that it is a very conclusive argument on a question involving constitutional power, to show that I or somebody else has exercised some power which now it may be thought ought not to be exercised
That-is an argument ad hominem, rather than one involving the real question
-But, sir, theinstances that
the Senator has taken to show inconsistency on my part as an argument in favor of the exist- ence of the power in the Territories alone, are those in which there is a specific grant
He and I agree that Congress has no powers except those delegated in the Constitution
Among the powers delegated is that to admit new States
The Su- preme Court in the Dred Scott case has determ- med that we acquire territory for the purpose of its being made into States under the power to ad- mit new States; that we govern it under the same clause under which we acquire it; but that con- fers the authority to go only so far as is' necessary to the admission of new States; that.is, to insti- I tute new governments in the Territories therc ac- quired until they become States
Underthat clause, it is true, I have reported bills to pay members of the Territorial Legislature, to-pay the salaries of  430 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17, territorial Governors, and to pay the other ex- penses growing out of the government instituted m the Territories
That does not reach the ques- tion whether your military power is any greater in a Territory than it is in a State; it does not reach the question whether your commercial po wer is any larger in a Territory than it is in a State, or whether your postal power is any larger in a Territory than in a State
Whatever you do in a Territory you do under the power to admit new,' States, and as incidental to it
The other clause, which has been so often quoted, that Congress may make all needful rules and regulations con- cerning the territory or other property belonginff to the United States applies to States as well as It is under that clause that vou to Territories, sell your public lands, not only in Kansas, blit in Illinois; not only in New Mexico, but in Louis- iana
The military power applies to States and Territories alike; the commercial power applies to States and Territories alike; the Post Ofiice power applies to all alike; and so does each other dclcgatcd power in the Constitution, if you ex- cept the one for the admission of new States; and that of course is to be exercised upon t.he partic- ular locality where the new State is situated
Hence, I think the Senator from Louisiana has failed in his attempt to show that you have any more power to make a road in a rrerritory than you have in a State
Where do you get it
Where does he get the right Lo make military road anywhere, unless it is under the war power
If hc gets it under the war power, it applies to Territories as well as to States
The war power applies everywhere within the dominion of Amcr- ica; and I do not see on what rule or construction he is going to get any larger powers to bc excr- cised by the Federal Government in a 'I'et•ritory than he finds in a State, unless he can point me to the clause of the Constitution contu•ring those er)larged powers
Mr
BENJAMIN
Will the Senator mc a word
Mr
DOUGLAS
Certainly
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 have either stood him, or he has misunderstood me
I cer- tainly did not say, or did not intend to argue, that Congress had any larger powers in the '['crrito- rics than in the Statcs in relati01'1 to military affairs and commercial regulations; because, in those mat- ters, the States have expressly delegated power to Congress in the States; but I had understood the Senator to say, in his first remarks, that there was no difference between the powers of Con- gress in the Terri tories nnd in the States, not, con- fining il to tbc question of those powers expressly delegated
Mr
DOUGLAS
On the contrary, I said, so far as the delegated powers in the Constitution were cotuyn•ned, tbcy applied to Territories as well as to States, because they are general, will)- out any exception of locality
alluded to tl'lem, and recited them
The power to raise, revenue applies to States and Territories alike
The power to coin money applies everywhere within our ju- risdiction
So of the power to establish rules of naturalization; to provide punishment for coun- terfeiting the coin of the United States; to pro- mote the useful arts and sciences; to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court; to pun- ish piracies and other felonies
So of thc power to declare war; to raise and support arrmes•, to maintain navies; and so of each one of the del- egated powers
They are all general, and apply everywhere within the United States of America, whether in States or Territories or the District of Columbia
I want the Senator to show wherein hc gets greater power in a Te.rritory than in a State, and that, too, with reförence to the making ofa road
The Senator from Louisiana admits our power under the Constitution to make a railroad through the rrerritories; but hc denies the existence of that power in a State
Now, where does he get the power to make a railroad in a Territory
That he admits, but where does hc get it
He must get it under the war power, or under the com- mercial power, or under the postal power, or him to make
one in a State
The grant, as I have heretofore said, applies everywhcrc throughout I deny America, in States and Territories alike
that this Federal Government can exercise any powers in the Territories, except those contained m the grants of the Constitution
The only one of those grants which authorizes Congress to do things in a Territory that it cannot do in a State, is the one that provides for the admission of new States, and certainly he is not going to make a railroad under the authority to admit new States
I then subrnit that we htive to assume that this railroad is necessary to the public defense, •or to the execution of some one of the delegated powers in thie Constitution, or otherwise we have no right to make it
And here may be permitted to re- mind the Senator from Louisiana, that this is not a bill to make a Pacific railway
The bill does nöl propose to appropriate money to make a road
It is a bill to authorrze contracts to be madc for the transportation of troops, rnunitions of war, Navy supplies, and mail matter of the Govern- I suppose we havo a right to contract for t
the transportation of munitions of war as well in a State as in Territory
It often happens that when we make a contract for Government trans- portation, we require the mode of conveyance to be specified in the contract
From the very be- ginning of this Government, it was our custom, when we had no railroads, no steamboats, to make a contract for the transportation ofthc mails, specifying that they should be carried in four- horse post-coaches, with certain description of boot for protection
Nobody denied that we had a right to mukc a contract for the transportation of the mail from Richmond to Washington city, through the State of Virginia, requiring the con- tractor to perföPEn the service with four-horse coaches, and to furnish his own coaches and his own horses
So we make a contract for the trans- portution of the Inuils from Mobilc Lo New Or- leans, or from New York to Panama, and thence to San Francisco, by steamers built in a particular form and of a particular model, and of a certain amount of tonnage, for which we pay so nuic,ll
When we make a contract with Mr
Aspinwall, or with Mr
Marshall O
Roberts, or Mr
George Law, or any other of the steamboat men, we are not making a colitract f0r the construction of but making a contract for the transport- ation of the mails by steamers of a particular model, and the contractor furnishes his own steam- ers
So this bill provides for the making of a con tract for the transportation of the United States mails from the western border of Missouri and Texas to the Pacific coast, by railroad, the con- tractors furnishing their own road
This is a mere contract for transportation; and in the con- tract we provide that the transportation shall be done in u particular manner, and by particular Sind of conveyance
'I'llis is nota new principle in our Government
I have shown that in the mail service it has ex- isted froin the beginning of the Government to • this day
In all your contracts for carrying the under some one, of the other specific grants of the Constitution
Under which one of these grants does he obtain the power to Inake a railway in a Territory
If he will show me the Frant that authorizes him to make a railroad in a rerritory, I will show him that that same grant authorizes mail by steamers, you have prescribed the model
of tlie steamer
Nor is that provision of this bill which advances money to enable the contractors to make the road, a novel principle in the con- tracts of this Government
In your" contracts for the transportation of the mails upon the sea, you have been in the habit of making appropriations in advance to enable the contractors to construct the vessels in which the mails are to be carried
Here, too, you make your contract for transport- ution through a period ofa quarter ofa century ; you pay so much for the performance of this transportation, and you pay in advance, so as to enable the contractor to comply with the contract
It involves the same principle that was in the con- tract with Mr
Collins for carrying the mails to Europe; the same principle that was in the con- tract 'evith thc Pacific Steamship Company, owned by Aspinwall and his associates; the same prin- ciple that was in your Panama railroad contract, and in all your steam contracts
It involves the same principle which has been in every mail con- tract, from the beginning of this Government to this day, where you specified the kind of vehicle in which the mail was to be transported, and made an ad vance of means to enable the contractor to comply with his contract, by getting his coaches or other modes of conveyance
I did not intend, sir, to be drawn into the dis- cussion of any constitutional question on this bill, nor did I intend to discuss the merits of the bill- itself
My position in regard to the Pacific rail- road question has been known for Inany years
Probably no Senator has devoted more time and thought and effort to securing a Pacific railroad than I have
I was willing to allow others to shape this bill, ånd give a silent vote for it; but when I found an amendment offered by the Sen- ator from Louisiana, so plausible that it might gain support, and yet which, if adopted, would •destroy the bill itself, and defeat every Pacific railroad bill, I felt bound to expose what I thought was an error in respect to the powers of thia Government
There seems to be a strange im- pression abroad that this Government, which has but a few specified powers, so far as the States are concerned, is omnipotent in the Territories of the United States
i deny the omnipotence of the Federal power either in States or Territories
This Federal Government has those powers, and those only, which arc delegated to it in the Con- stitution; and I repeat again, that the powers delegated apply to the States and Territories alike ; and you have no morc right to interfere with the domestic concerns of the people, or with their roads, or with their local institutions of any kind in a Territory than you have in a State, unless you can point out the clause of the Constitution which confers that power
I apprehend that you can find no special clause that authorizes you to make a railroad in a Territory and denies you power to do it in a State of this Union
Mr
BENJAMIN
I merely desire to say that I refrain from continuing this discussion, because I do not wish to appear to defer the passage of this bilk by entering on extraneous discussion
At tho same time, I must say that I do not agree with the Senator from Illinois in what he has just said
1 will, however, waive any reply to him
Mp
GREEN
When 1 made the suggestion to the Senator from Louisiana, it was made to apply to California, or to apply to Texas, or any other State that may be formed before the bitl I I was accurate; nor did takes effect
l, by that suggestion, intend to express any opin- ion on the propriety of the proposition itself
I will now, howevcr, say that I consider it very proper and very right
When the Senator from Illinois says that this principle has been acted upon by the Government in making advance payments for the construction of steamships of the Collins line, the George Law line, and the Aspinwall line, he is entirely mistaken
Every advance payment made in the case was as an adjunct to t.he Navy, and it was in the Navy bill; and I venture the assertion within his hearing, that he cannot point to a single.stance in which a quarter of a dollar has ever been paid to any mail contractor in ad- vance to buy coaches or to build steamers, or to devise any obher mode of conveyance
He is entirely mistaken
At the time the system was inaugurated for the construction of mail steamers, they were considered a part of the Navy, and they were to be inspected by naval offcers and commanded by naval officers, and so arranged that, on a fesv days' notice, the upper decks could be removed and an armanent placed upon them, and they be made useful in defense of the coun- try as a branch of the naval power; and it was With reference to the building up of a Navy, not for postal service, that any advance was ever made
He has forgotten the whole history of the transaction
He has forgotten how it was Inaugu- rated on the application of Mr
Thomas Butler King
On his sug&estion, it was first inaugurated as a branch of the Navy, and not as a means for the transportation of the mails; and there has not been, from 1789 down to the year 1861, this pres- ent speaking, a case where one single dollar has ever been advanced to a mail contractor under any circumstances as such
The duty of carry- ing the mail has been recognized, and cornpensa- tion provided when they did carry it: that has followed, and that has been the consequence
This case is of a peculiar character; and I jus- tify a vote for the railroad upon the principle that it IS necessary for the public defense
Just to the extent, therefore, that It is necessary, I am justi- fied; and where that necessity stops, I am not jus- tified
If a proposition were made to construct a road from the city of Washington to the city of San Francisco, I could not vote for it
Why
The necessity does not exist for a large portion of the  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
+431 distance; and the necessity must exist or my right said property shall not be taxed except as Con- to vote for itdoes not exist
How far, then, does gress permits; he has said the property ofa non- that necessity exist
Not so far as the convenience resident shall not be taxed more than that of a might exist; for the convenience would exist from II rosident; he has said they shall pass no law incor- the city of Washington to San Francisco, and all porating a bank
Can he say that to the States; over the Union; but how far does the necessity i does he say it to a State
Would any man rise in exist
Just over that space, where, in all hunntn the Senate and utter a sentiment like that in the Senate Chamber, that we can command a State probability, without our aid, it will not be made
How far is that
Frorn.the confines of one State in that manner
And why not
If the power of Congress is the same in a State and in a Terri- to the confines of the other; from the twenty-fifth parallel of longitude west from Washington, tory, we can put these prohibitions and these in- which is the proposed western boundary of Kan- hibitions upon States as well as upon Territo- sas, to the eastern boundary of California
Why
ries
But experience, common- sense, the nature if our Government, demonstrate that this notion Where there is good land, where there are settle- ments,grants of land will construct the road; and is all wr01V
When we acquire territory, if we know it, for they have done it in every other it be acquired in a constitutional way, and it Stale up to the limns of' those two States
As is constitutional either b' purchase, or treaty, or there are no means of construction from the limits by conquest, it results from the necessity of the of the one to the limits of the other, and there is casc that we can take care of it; and what is tak- a necessity for havin«r the road, there is a neces- t ing care of it
If we allow people to sctt\c upon I it and survey the lands, we can give them an or- sity for our action
Within the limits where it will be made without our aid, the necessity does ganizution if we choosc
We may vest the gov- not exist; and none of us are justified, according crning power in a judge, in a Governor, In a to my conception, in voting for it; and there is Council, or in Legislative Assembly
We can the distinction that make
prescribe their powers
We cannot give them These collateral brailches of argument into unlimited power; and the idea of the Senator from which the Senator fron-l Illinois has run, I shall Illinois, that he who claims right to take care not notice
When hc undertakes to say that the of and control Territory is advocating unlim- Federal Government has as much in the ited power over a Territory, another o•ricvous States as it has in the Territories, he is entirely at error
Nobody contends for that
I will venture fault
This Constitution, with its provisions, wag the assertion, that there is not a man, woman, never made by a Territory, never assented to by or child in the United States that ever uttered the a 'Territory
It is a Constitution between sover- sentiment
If it was ever uttered by anybody, eign States, each one being a unit
The Territory it was by a giant
Then why refor to it! W c is no party to the Constitution at all; it is outside, all contend that the Federal Government is u lim- so far as the guarantees are concerned
How, then, ited authority
'We have disputed as to the ex- does Congress govern the Territoriet
Not be- tent of the limitations, as to the extent of the cause the Territories are parties to the Constitu- authority, how far it did extend, the boundary tion; not because they have assented to the Con- line between the limitations and the authority; stitu tion; not because they have entered the Union; and in all governments there frequently arise dis- for the Territories are not in the Union
What, I puted questions on points like these
It is very then, is the Territory 
It is property belonging to easy to take an extreme case, and say this is the Union
Where is your power to govern it

outside of the authority;" and it is very easy It results from your right to acquire; and thig to take another extreme case and say " this is within the limits of the authority;" but as you miserable idea, that your power in the Territory results from the fact that you have the right to approximate and come up to the boundary Ime, admit States, is, to me, the most extraordinary honest men, true patriots, distinguished men, frc- that ever .1 heard uttered
I know the Supretne quently differ
So that differei')cc sprang up on Court, in one case, gave a little countenance to it; the slave question; but shall not refer to that, I know that distinguished men have predicated because it is not pertinent to this bill
I am only their whole political action upon it; but there is showing that the power to o•overn Territory no truth in it
The power to admit a State does results alonc from the fact that we have the right not include the power to create a State
Every to acquire; and the duty necessarily and inevita- State that comes• into this Union forms herself bly follows from the right to acquire
It is in- into a sovereignty, and there can be no sover- cluded in the right to acquire; but yet all the eignty without that self-action
If a State were prohibitions of lhc Constitution apply, and why 
created by another power, she would not be sov- Because, being acquired, this Government bc- erei'-rn
Sovereignty results from self-action
If councs the possessor, thc owner, and the sover- any State, therefore, ever is created, it is by self- ci'rn ; the stamp of its charactcrmust bc observed action
Others assent to it; others agree to it; over the whole of its dominions; it must obser c others acquiesce in it; others acknowledge it; but it every principle and precept there which ma its individuality as a Government; and hence it is always self-action, else it is no sovereignty
So States created themsclves, and the power of Con-• can do nothing conflicting with the rights of any State, as in a Confcdcration of States all the Statcs gress to admit them is just clearly this: you can open the doors ofthe Union to letanother siSter in; must be protected alike, all thc Statos must have that is au
You cannot create; you cannot takc in- opportunities alike; and so you will observe, cipient steps of creation
What, then, can you do when you examine this question, there is not a in a Territory
It is no party to the Constitution; particle of difficulty aboul it
it has never assented to the Constitution; but it is Mr
President, I shall not run off into that sub- property belonging to the United States
It is ac- jcct
i come back to the beginning
We are anx- quired in a constitutional way by treaty, by pur- ious for the construction of a road where the in- chase, or by conquest
The righttoacquire of itself terests of the Government demand it, and m.ve feel necessarily includes the power to govern and take justified in extending to it this proposed aid where careof

In no manner conflicting it is necessary

Why
Because that power is pro- E It will be made as quickly, as succcssfully, and hi bited by the Federal Go vernznent; it is conflicting as usefully, with a grant of land in the States, us it will through the Territories with a grant of with the principles of the Federal Government

Why 
money
I propose to givc it
It is suggested to me that we have not given the lands to California
Because that is inconsistent with the principles of the Federal Government
Put whatever is con- Yes; we give thein SIX sections to the mile
Mr
LATHAM
The Senator will allow me sistent with the general tenor of the Federal Gov- to interrupt him
want to suggest that the very ernment, that Government can enforce and carry necessity upon which he justifiés the building of out, and no other power can do it but the Federal a railroad to the border o
California wili compel If a territorial Government, except by consent
the Government to extend it to the Pacific
If it or•anization is o•iven, look at the nonsense of say- 
is essential for military purposes at all, it is essen- ing, " we have no power there, and yct we will tial that it shall bc built by the Government to charter you." Look at the absurdity of the idea, where it will reach that portion of thc State which we have no power to control you; Lut.we say you shall not control yourselves exceptsub onodo;" 'l will need the means of defense, or where it will syive the facilities in time
of war which have been for in every bill reported, advocated, and sustained dwelt on by the Senator
He says he proposes by that honorable Senator, he has put in prohibi- giving to the State He has tions upon the Territorial Legislature
Mr
GREEN
that -the Senatof should reply to me after I am through
I thought.he was only going to-ask me-a question or makesdn- explanation
Mr
LATHAM
I want
to call your attention to a fact; that is all
He says he propöses*-to give the State of' California lands to build {this road
He forgets that nearly the lands that lie along the line of either of these ably with the exception of u portion of the south- ern route, are mineral' lands
It is barren grant; for those lands are expressly re- served by the terms of the bill
Mr
GREEN
So far as that is concerned, my recollection of the bill is that it gives six sections a mile, from the time that the road strikes the line of California until it reaches San Francisco
Mr
LATHAM
Excepting mineral lands
Mr
GREEN
And wherever mineral lands are selected out, others equivalent 'to them may be taken
Mr
LATHAM
Within a certain distaiee, Mr
GREEN
And that distance comprehends enough to cover the whole; so •that they will get the lands anyhow
They are allowed to select other lands within fifteen miles
Mr
LATHAM
You might go fifty miles, and still find all mineral land
Mr
GREEN
The southern road will, 1 sup- pose, cross the Colorado a little above Fort Yuma, and run some four hundred miles, to San Fran- cisco
Mr
LATHAM
Then r will state to the atop, so far as that Jine is concerned, it goes through the Colorado desert
Mr
GREEN
well, sir, if one road strikes,a desert and the other road goes through all min- era! lands, let us strike the land grant -oat alto- gether
Will the Senator accept that
If the land grant is worth nothing, why not strike it out 
Sir, the fact is, that this land grant is as good in California as it has ever been In any other State
Look at your rich ranches, producing sixty bush- els of wheat to the acre; your immense herds, fattened by nature's productions, without any care except the he•rdsmen
All this is done in California on such lands as the Senator now calls waste
Mr
LATHAM
I tell the gentleman that all those lands are claimed under Spanish grants; they are occupied already, and are reserved from the rovisions of this bill
IVI•
GREEN
Then 1 suggest again, let the Senator strike the land grant out
If the lands are ull gone, what do you put it in there for
Mr
LA'I'EIAM
Because we expect to build the road by the money the bill gives
Mr
GREEN
Then strike out the land grant, and I wilt say no more about it
They expect to make it by the money, do they
San Diego is nearly opposite Fort Yuma, the point where tho son thern road will cross the Colorado
Why do you run parallel with the Pacific ocean not fifteen miles from it, for four hundred miles, to get to San Francisco
Military defense
It is a matter of convenience, I admit; but is it necessary; is it so indispensable a.s to justify us in taking money out of tbe Treasury
Now, take the central route: suppose it strikes Carson Valley, of which the Senator from Louisiana has spoken
You say it will never be made, We will make it across there
He says he can go in forty-eight hours from there to San Francisco
Now, is there any great necessity for spending #60,000,000, when there is a good graded road where natural facil- ities are offered, and when the people of Cali- fornia, if they are as energetic and enterprising as take them to be, will make the road before we get it in the Washoe mines
Does that degree of necessity exist which will justify us in appropri- ating money out of the Treasury
I want to fa- cilitate the road; but I want to keep within what I consider to be the pale of the Constitution
I wish to aid it in every possible way
I intend to support it as far as I possibly can; but while the military power of the Government is alike over all the States and Territories, the necessity- does not exist alike over all the States and all the Ter- ritories
eCongrcss has never undertaken -to make but one single road in a State, that was the national road; and that was predicated upon the idea that it would promote and facilitate immigra- tion, and settle up the public lands, bring them into market, and replenish the public "I'reasury
 432 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17
Mr
PUGH
The Senator will recollect that road was not made from public money
It was made with money that was obtained by a stipu- lation with the new States that they should not tax the land of the Government in the hands of pu rchasers
Mr
GREEN
- A portion of it was; but not all
Through Maryland none of that applies
Myfriend from Ohio is mistaken in that
Through Virginia none of it applies; but through Ohio and Indiana it does apply; and he is correct
Mr
PUGH
My friend is mistaken
It was supported in the ease of Ohio and other new States on tho ground that a certain proportion of the proceeds of the lands sold within her limits should be applied in Virginia and Maryland to make the road to Ohio
Mr
GREEN
1 am aware of that
They did not confine themselves to that
They made other large appropriations out of the Treasury gener- Mr
PUGH
They were vetoed
Mr
GREEN
They were subsequently passed; and it was, in fact, done just as I have stated, until the Government got tired of the concern, threw it up, and surrendered it to the States
the Territories we have made many roads
I think we made one in Florida
I think we are making one now in New Mexico
W c made one across the South Pass
I think we are making one west of Minnesota
We have made a number in the It is a common thing
And why 
Territories
Because those Territories are subject to the juns- diction and control of the Federal authority, and nobody else
W c therefore seek to protect them, and promote settlement, and devise means of com- munication; and we make roads, build bridges, build court-houses, build State-houses, none of which things we dare undertake to do in the States
Mr
PUGH
Ido not propose to encracyc ill this at least
The Senator from debate at any lengtl-) , Louisiana anticipated me in omn•ing this arnend- I anticipated him with a like mnendment ment
some years acro
There is not a shred of novelty It
was debated by the ablest in this question
men the country has seen fin• thirty years
Mr
Jemn•son's influence wras strong enough his presidential term to prevent any bill of this character for internal irnprovements within a State being passed
'l"hey were passed in Mr
Madi- son 'B time, and he vetoed them
'They werc passed in Monroe's tin-it' , und he vetoed then-n
They were passed again in the time of John Quincy Adams
They were attempted•in the tirne of An- drew Jackson, and he vetoed them; and Jackson 's veto message of the Maysville road has been a part of the platform of the Democratic party from that day to this
Now, sir, two years ago I road a sentence from that veto, in whLYh General Jack- son recited the substance of Mr
Madison 's veto: Regarding the bill as asserting a power in the Federal Governnnent to construct roads and canals within the li.nits ef a State in which they were n:ade, he [Mr
ob- jected to its passage on' the ground of its unconstitution- ality, declaring that the assent ot- respective States
in the mode provided by the bills, could not contor the power in question." Now, it is not even pretended we have the consent of California, nor the consent of Texas; but, in the case of the Maysville road, it •was pro- posed that Kentucky should consent: That the only cases in which the consent and cession o!' particular States can extend the power ot• Congress, are those specified and provided for in the Constitution ; and superadding to these avowals his opinion
that a restriction or thc power to provide for the conunon defense and gene- ral welthrc' to cases which are to be provided tbr by tbc expenditure of money, would still leave within the legis- lative power ot• Congress all the great and rnost ilnportant measures Govenunent, rnoncy beinrr the ordinary and necessary means of earrying them into execution." Now, gays General Jackson: ".1 have not been able to consider these declarations in any other point 01' view t.han as a conce*sion that the right of appropriation is not limited by the power to carry into effect the rncasurc for which thc money is asked, as was fonnerly contended." i regard that ns a conclusive answer to the whole argument made by the Senator from Illi- nois
He may succeed in provinø possibly that it is unconstitutional to make this road in Ter- ritory; but he has certainly failed to prove that it is constitutional wfthin the States
If the amend- ment of the Senator from Louisiana be voted down, I shall not rnerely vote for the amendment of Ale Senator from Ch'(.bgon, but I shall vote to extend it into the State of Missouri
Let us bring it to the city of St
Louis
Where is the argu- ment for making a road in the State of California that is not good in the State of Missouri
If she cannot make the road from her border to the city of San Francisco, why not assist Missouri to make it from the western border of Missouri to the city of St
Louis
Why not assist Iowa to make it through her limits, and through the limits of Illinois, until you reach the city of Chicago 
Or, if necessary, why not make it to the city of Washington 
Oh, gentlemen* say, the road cannot be made
If it cannot be made according to the Constitution, If it be of the high and let it never be made
mighty importance that you say, amend the Con- stitution so as to have the power to make it
Do not attempt, under thc argument of necessity, to put down not merely all the safeguards of power, and all the rights of the States, but to overrule what I said was Democratic doctrine, contended for by the fathers for thirty years, and supposed to have becn settled for thirty years more

I have only a word to say, in reply to my friend from Ohio
I think he will find it very diffcult to prove that there is anything in this bill departing from the doctrine of our fathers, and especially from the doctrine of any of General Jackson's veto messages
As I have before said, this bill is not a measure to make a road
It is a contract for transportation with par- ties who will carry the Government supplies, mails, and munitions of war, by railroad
It is merely a contract for transportation, not for con- struction
Certainly hc will not deny that the right of transportation exists in States as well as in Territories
It is true, it will be necessary for the contractors to make the road before they can carry the mails and Army supplies upon it, just as it is necessary for a contractor to build steam- boat before he can carry those supplies by boat; just as it is necessary for a mail contractor to make his coach before he can transport the maiks
in four-horse post coaches; and yct the contract is transportation, and not for the construction of a
work
the objection to making internal im- provcrnents within the States by the Federal Gov- ernment has been that the right to construct and to use il carried with it the right of exercisino• jurisdicti()!) over it, and thereby excluded the juris- diction of the State by assumino• it in the hands of the Federal Governmenl
'I'here is nothing of that kind in this bill
The jurisdiction remains under the local authority
'T hc road, when made, is under the local law, and local authority
It is managed under local law and localauthority
The only authority the Government holds over it is in regard to transportation
Hence it does not violate any one principle laid down irf the most angent veto message that General Jackson ever maule upon the subject of internal irnprovements
I have had occasion to say, in former times, that I indorsed cvcry one of the limitations that Gen- oral Jackson imposed upon the power of Congress over internal improvmuonts
If 1 were to make, a disscntin«r opinion from those of that great pa- triot, it would be that he carried the doctrine of the Federal Govern ment over making internal im- provemcnts to a greater extent than I should be wiliing to vote
Ele did not carry his restrictions and limitations on the power far•cnough
But gentlemel'l arc arguing here twainst the right of making the road within a State
I ask them to show first, what power there is in a Teu•ritory that docs not exist in a State, so far as this bill is concerned
I have not heard anv one answer that proposition
YVil] gentlemen tell me —they all concede the power in the Territory— i under what clause in the Constitution they get that principle
If they tell me, under the military power, then that applies to the States as well as to the Territories
If they tell me, under the post showing what the doctrine of the fathers: was, and wherein this departure takes place
But my friend from Ohio said he was going to propose to extend this contract through Missouri, through Illinois, and through the other States, if we allow it to go into California
Well, sir, if there is the same necessity in Missouri and Illi- nois and the other States that there is in Cali- fornia, I will vote for his proposition
If there is astern necessity from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and there is no such necessity on this side of the Missouri river, I do not see how he is going to justify his amendment
Merely because you have the pover to do a thing, is no reason why you should do it, unless there is a necessity for the exercise of the power
We may have the power to make contracts to an unlimited extent; but it would bea great abuse if we should make contracts where there is no necessity, and thus squander the public money
We may abuse the rightful exercise of power; I am speaking of the powers that we legitimately have, properly and rightfully executed
Hence, I merely repeat, without going into the discussion, that, in my opinion, no Senator has shown any authority in a Territory, so far as this bill is concerned, that does not exist in a State wherever the necessity exists
I shall not go into the argument of the Senator from Missouri, in regard to the powers of a Ter- ritorial Legislature on other subjects
I discuss them when they come properly before us
not intend to raise the question how far this Fed- eral Government had power over domestic ques- tions in a Territory
It is well known that T hold the Federal Government has no power in a Ter- ritory over a domestic question that it has not in a State
That does not shov„r that this Govern- ment has power over domestic subjects in the States; but, on the contrary, the absence of the power in the Territories
I shall not go in to that question now
It is enough for me in this con- nection, first, to show that this is a question ofa contract for transportation, and not a question of construction of internal improvement; secondly, that the right of transportation exists in States as well as in Territories, and it ought to be exer- cised if necessary; and thirdly, that the
necessity docs exist frorn the Missouri river westward, and does not exist eastward
Mr
PUGH
Senator from Illinois is mis
taken in his assertion, that the 0101 y question relalivc 10 internal improvelnents in the times of Madison, Monroe, and Jackson, was in regard to the legal jurisdiction within the States
it was tried in both forms, and in both forms those fathers of the Democratic party repudiated it
He is mistaken also, in saying that this is any more a contract for the transportation of the mails or the transportation ofsupplies than the Maysville road bill
That proposed that Congress should subscribe for a certain amount of stock on condi- •tion, I think, that they would curry troops aud munitions free forever
That was the best sort of If this be a contract for carrying the a contract
mail, why do you give the alternate sections of land within a certain distance
Why give them so much per mile of the road 
Why not so much per mile for carrying
Every Senator knows that this isa mere deceit; that it is a mere pretext; that the Government now has its mails carried; that the Government now has its troops and ail its Inunitions of war transported to the Pacific; that we have never had any diffculty on the subject; that there is no necessity shown for a perpetual appropriation, in its character; and therefore, with due respect to my friend from Illi- nois and my friend from California, nobody is deceived by this
It is to build a road, and noth- ing else; and as they have no means of paying back the moneys which you give, you give them to the day of judgment to pay it back in the trans- portation of troops and public property; and you office power, that applies to the States as well as littvc a mort.'-ra(re on the road which, as rny friend from North Carolina has shown, will bc fore- the Territories
If they tell tne, under the naval power, that applies to the States as well as the Territories
Ifit be tho power of commerce, that applies to the Tl'erritories and States alike
Under which power is it that they are going to carry on this transportation in • the Territories
Whenever they designate that, I will tell them which power enables you to carry it on in the It will not do to tell Ine that •wre are de- States
II parting from the doctrines of the fathers, without closed and become duc somewhcrc about the aftcr- noon of' the day of judgment
Now, wo understand we
are giving this tnoncy to the Pacific Railroad
The Senator from Illi- nois asks kne whereabouts I find the power in the Constitution to build a road in the 'Territories
I have not answered the question; and if he presses me, I will acknowledge, if it werc a new qnestion I would say there is none
But VI-file you may  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

RIVES, WASHINGTON, D

THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, 2n SESSION
prove to me that it cannot be done in a Territory, that does not prove you can do it in a State
As far as a State is concerned, I said before, and say acrain, that that
question was debated for thirty years; and thirty years ago it was settled
As to the Territories, the question was not de- bated
Still, Congress has gone on many times, as the Senator from Missouri truly said, to make military roads
If you will show me that this road is of a military character, so far as it goes through the Territories, I may submit to prece- dents; and I certainly will submit to them where the nature of the soil is such that probably there never would be any fixed population
have not yct said that I believed it was strictly consti- tutional to make it through the Territories
On the contrary, if it were a new question, 1 should stand in very great doubt
On that I submit to precedents; but as to the States, I have no doubt
Mr
DOUGLAS
one word only
The sen- ator now comes to the point; and not being able to show any authority in a Territory that does hot exist in a State Mr
PUGH
I thought the Senator was going to show it
He is a supporter of the bill
I staud on the defensive
Mr
DOUGLAS
What 1 assert, then, is that the power adequate to do it in the Territories is adequate to do it in the States
No man has been able to show the distinction
The proposition of the Senator from Louisiana now is to limit this to the Territories of the tJnited States; that is, it admits the propriety of an appropriation in the Territories, and denies it in the States
I did not on to detnonstrate tll.e necessity of the power in the 'Ilerritories, for the reason that it stood con- fessed
i went on to show, when confessed in the Territories that that carried with it the right in the States; and touched only on that point
But what I rose, to answer was this: the Sena- tor from Ohio says if I
can show the necessity of this road for military purposes in tho Territories, he will vote for it
Sir, if 1 did not believe it was necessary for military purposes, I would hot vote for it
do not believe you can defend thc Pacific coast without this Pacific railroad
Whenever you have an Indian war, it costs you marc for transportation than it would to make a road to transport it on
The few months that you were in war with the Mormons cost almost as much as it would to make a railroad half that distance
Mr
PUGH
How can thc Senator say that
W c or)ly appropriated $10,000,000 for that war, and hcre is a bill appropriating Mt
DOUGLAS
1 will show how
Here is a bili for $96,000,000; but this biti is for two railroads clear across to the Pacific
Mr
PUGH
It appropriates for one, and the rest for the other
Mr
DOUGLAS
The across to the Pacific
Salt Lake is only half way on one of the lines, and that half would be the chcapest part of the road
The first eight hun- dt•cd miles of this road going to Salt Lake can bc made very chcap indeed
The expense is on the mountainous part beyond
But, sir, I did not intend to go int.o that sub- ject
The DOint is this: is this road necessary It is con venient for corn- for nationa defense

railroad
You have got halfa dozen railroads in the States now for that purpose
It is true they ate but a few yards long
Why
Because it IS only a few yards from your building-house to where you are going to launch your ship; but you make it just as far as it is necessary to perform , the objeöt required by the Constitution
If we were nt war now, and it was necessary to trans- port troops over a mountain that was impassable, we should have a right to appropriate ten,fifty, or a hundred millions to make a road across that mountain in order to transport the troops
You have got the power to make roads, to make wao•- ons, or buy them, or to do any other act neces- sary to national defense
'I'he only question is whether it is necessary
I repeat that
it is neces- sary from the Missouri river to thc Pacific ocean
It is very convenient on this side, but not neces- sary to the national defense
Mr
G WIN
am very much astonished to hear the Senator from Ohio quoting the fathers, especiaily the leaders of the Democratic party, against the right to construct a military road through a State
Why, Mr
President, in Jeffer- son's administration they appropriat.cd money outofthe Treasury to build military roads through the States
Mr
PUGH
Where
Mr
GWIN
Through Georgia and Tennes- see, goingLto Louisiana; and I can give him au- thority after authority, and will turn to the very line where the very fathers of the Democratic party have made such appropriations
MP
DOUGLAS
My friend from California will allow me to remind hilü that they appro- priated for the national road from Cumberland, in Maryland, and from Maryland through Virginia, through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois
Mr
PUGH
I can get the cases and prove that the Senators arc mistaken in every one of them
Mr
G WIN
There is no mistake in what I say
They appropriated money fora road through Georgia and Tennessee, and got thc money out of the rrrcasury—Mr
Jefferson hi:nself propos- ing the law, which passed Congress, and using it for a road
I could refer to the laws, if I bad an opportunity to do so; and if I had expected a de- bate on this subject, I would have had them before me

BIGLER in the chair.) The question is on the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana to the tune.udment of the Senator from Oregon

LATIZIIM
the yeas and nays on that amendment
'l'he yeas dnd nays werc ordered
Mr
LANE
Nir
President, shan vote in favor of this amendment
I'vfy mind is very clear upon this question
I am satisfied that Congress has no powcr to make ariY system of internal improvement within the States
I believe it only has the power in the 'I'crritorics for necessary military purposes, for the defense of tbc country
Now I tun anxious for a Pacific railroad
I want it to extend through California into Oregon; and I am sure it is practicable, if tixc road can be madc to the Sacramento ri ecr, to make it on to Portland, in Oregon
If it is right, if it is necessary for the defense of the country, to make the road to the Sacramento, then it is necessary to make it into Oregon
Millions have been appropriated and is essential, expended for the purpose of placing California is essential for national defense

Ido not admit, tion of our country in a state of defense in the sir, that we could not even make the road in a l! event of war
The fortificationsat San Francisco were not necessary at the' time they were built, State if absolutely necessary foc national defense
Wherever a fort is necessary, you have the right but they Inay be; and it was right and proper that to make it in a State
Wherever a navy-yard is they should be constructed, in order that the Gov- ernment rnight be able to defend that entrance necessary, you have

the condition in the country is now
am fully With the soundness of-the doctrine held bv the Senator from Ohio -and the • Senatoi• from Louisiana, upori th'c poweps Of-the Government
Still, I am hardly satisfied that this work may not be done as necessary for défen"s of the country
But, as the Senator frmn Olifo says, there is no use in concealing this thing— there is no use in whipping around the stump;' the object of this bill is to niake a railroad
lidVe always been in favor ofa of making un appropriation ordonation' of-lands for the pur- pose; that had been donein many CaseS; this bould bc done now, for the
road within the States an-d many in the Territories
To say that we are •n'Qt approprialing money for the conStruct.ion of a rail- road is to cn'dcavor to deceive ourselves and to deceive the country
I do nod like that way of dealing
I like to deal plainly, honestly, and truth- fully; then why not say that this appropriation is for making a railroad
Have we the power to do it
The Senator from Illinois says we have
The Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Louisiana, as well as thc Senator from Missouri, think wo have not
I have very great doubt about it myself
As fully as I am convinced of the necessity of doing something -to place Oregon in a state ot• deferise, still I am not satisfied _that have the power in advance of troubles to do it
I would do anything and everything that was in my power to secure the making of a railroad' to that portion of our country
If this amendment shall bc adopted to stop the appropriations at thc eastern boundary of Califorma, then I-will ask an appro- priation of land in alternate sections of sufficient value to make the road within California to the navigable waters of the Sacramento, and then a like appropriation of land to continue the work into Oregon
Mr
PUGH
I hope my friend does not un- der.staad me us opposing the appropriation of alternate sections
I am willing to give them to California, Oregon, or any other State where we have public lands
Mr
LANE
Then the safest way, ac.cording to my judgment, is to ulopt the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana, and stop the appro- priation of.
money at the eastern border of that State, and then provide an apt•oppriation or dona- tion of land sufiicient to make the road to San Francisco, and to continue it to Portland, in Oregon
will vote with the Senator for that amendment, upon the convicti0E1that we have not the power, unless it was in case of War', and he- cessary for -thc irnmediate defense of the country, to appropriate the money of the
whole people of the United Statcs for the purpose of malcing a railroad in any State

The of our in the House should be to promote the general welfare of the country
To effect that object, a harmonious feeling should predominate, if possi- ble; but I must say that tbc character of the debate which has preceded has not bcen to my taste
Yct, sir, we must conform ourselves to the cir- cumstanccs by which we arc surrounded; and, with a view of dischargin<" my duty, I desire to submit somc rcmarks to tho consideration of the committee, upon the subject which now so seri- ously engrosses public attention
This question of slavery has ever been some to this country
Yet our fathers weré$n- abled to dispose of it, and to dispose of it in such a wav as to secure; not only our fibertics, but the estabiishment ofa Government which has led to a happiness and prosperity of our people unex- ampled in the history of the human family
When the Declaration of Independence was framed, every State of this Union was a slaveholding State
They went through that war, and this trouble- some
question troubled not the council, the camp, or the battle-field
We conducted that war to a successful termination, and to the establishment of In process of time, when our our independence
convention assembled to establish a constitution, we had twelve slave States and but one froe State
There was then in the northcrn mind a hostility to slavery
We frequently hear from the other side of this Chamber, the position taken that they want to CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
We find that when the first rough draft of •the Constitution was submitted for discussion, it gave Congress the power to abolish the slave trade any time after 1800
A proposition was then made that that trade should be extended to 1808
Ma- ryland and Virginia voted against that extension
A distinguished member of that convention from Connccticut (Rocrer Sherman) said that the south- ern States were essential for their welfare, and that they would rather tolerate tho slave trade than part with two States—Georgia and South Carolina; and on a vote upon the proposition to extend the slave trade eight •years, New Hamp- shire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut voted to give that extension, and, by their votes, the prop- osition was carried, and the slave trade extended eight years beyond the time to which someofihc slave States contended it should be limited
And 
now what do we see upon this occasion
Nota single mem bcr from ei of those three States will tolerate a southcrn State in removing one single one of those slaves, or their descendants, which were imported during those eight years, into any one of our Territories
But we pass on
We find that those fathers accommodated this matter among themselves; and they established a Cotl- stitution which has eminently served its purposes for nearly thrcc quarters of a century
What is the history of' the Government aftcr- wards
Your Washington, your first and greatest President, approved and Signed bills to appre- hend fugitive slaves, and to admit slave States into the Union
Your second President, John Adams, of Massachusetts, approved and signed a fugitive slave bill for the District of Columbia, and "bills reco&nizing slavery in the southwestern Territory
Your Jl)fl'crson acquired the Terri- tory of Louisiana, with its slave property, and he signcd and approved a bill to regulate the coast slavc trade, by which slaves were permitted to be taken from one section of tho Union to another for sale
And, sir, every President up to the pres- ent hour has approved and signed bilks in con- formity to the news which are contended for upon the part of the South; and it is only within the last few years that this opposition to the institu- tion of the Soüth has advanced to its present for- midable and threatening position
And why is it
It may be traced back to a morbid—pardon me, for I intend to say nothing intentionally offensive— in my judgment, it may bo traced back to a but, morbid sensitiveness npon tho part of the north- ern mind upon this subject
This hostility to slavcry at Ol'i*in attracted little attention at tho North, and fi..iW fft.tve countenance to it; but it I gradualiy got into the school-houses, into the school-books, into the pulpit, and into all the va- rious modes of education, and into all the Ineuns used in thc formation of the moral sentimcnts of It has been continued; and the pres- the people
ent generation have been brought up and edu- cated from the nursery in a feeling of hostility to this institution, which wras thus tolerated by the fathers of the Revolution in evcry State of' the Union
This system of education has gone on until a large majority of tbc people of the Norlh have up to manhood under such influcnccs
And what is the result
It has formed political associations, and a political party which now pro- i poses to take control of the Government of thc country, and to do it upon the one single, isolated idea of hostility to southern institutions
In 1856, this party first assumed a prominent and threat- ernng attitude toward the South
And what do we find them declaring upon that occasion
When they formed the Republican party, in 1856, they formed it without regard to past political diffcr- ences and divisions
When they carne to lay down their principles, they announced that as their cardinal doctrine
In that body we find men who had been Whigs, Democrats, and Americans • men who had belonged to all tho political parties of the count.ry',' but all their past party predilec- tions were to be laid aside, and the new party, i without regard to them, was to be formed
It bring back this Government to the principles of was so formed, and their declaration was: It would be well for those gentleuncn Resolred, "I'hat the Constitution upon Congress i its fathers
who desire to effect that object, to look to the power over t,hc 'l'erritorics the United States spirit which actuated those wise and patriotic is both the right and the
duty of' Congress to prohibit in all fathers of ours while assembled in convention
the trcrritories the twin rclics of barbarism—polygquuy• and What do we find them doing then
Why, sn•, In 1860 tho same party again laid down their the slave trade was then in existence, and was I tolerated by many of the States of this Union, and platform; which was as follows: " 8
That the, nonnal condition of all the territory of the sorne southern States were averse to its abolition
Ünlted; States that freedom
That as-our repübH&ai fathers, when thcy had aboimled -slavery in out "Atiopal territory, ordained that no person BhOujdlbe deprived life, liberty, or frroperty, without due process becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever güCii tion is maintain this provision tution against all attempts to violate we authority of Congress, ot• a Leg[SIatwe, or individuals
to givc 'legal existence to Slavery ih tory of the Üniied States." When that party, in 1860, in convention, came to look out for representative of the principles which they intended' to inaugfråte in theGovei-n- ment, provided thOy succeeded, it lookedälF oijéi' the country for sueh Rn indi€iduai
The •twd most prominent and eminent men who presented themselvcs for that nomination were Hon.- Mr.- Seward, of New York, and Mr
Lincoln, Of- the State of Illinois
Upon the first ballot Mr
Sew- ard received a large plurality of the votes
But he was not nominated; and Mr
Lincoln Was finally unanimously nominated and elected by that party; and it is now ope'nly dcclared to -the country that the former gentleman, Mr
Seward, is to be the prime minister of Mr
Lincdlå, -the successful candidate of the Republican party fOi• President
These gentlemen owe their elevation to office to their opposition to southern institu• tions
They were selected and voted for, not for personal predilections, but for their devotion to the doctrines which they wore known to have advocated, and for opinions they were known to en tertain
Now, I call the attention of the committee and of thö country to what, in brief, these opinions were
Mr
Seward declares: Slavery can be limited to its present bounds ; it can be it can be, and it must be abolished, and you ameliorated ; 'Phe task is as simple and easy and can and Inust do It
as its consummation will be beneficent, and its rewards It only requires to follow thiS simple råte of ac- glowing
tion : to do everywhere and on cVery occasion what •We can, and not to neglector refuse to dO what we can, at an*y time, because at that precise time, and on that particular occasion, we cannot do more
Circumstances determine Lxtcnd a eotdiat possibiiities." welcome to the fugitive who lays his weary limbs at your door, and (Ictönd him as you would your paternal gods
" Correct your own error that slavcry has any constitu- tionat guarantees which Inay not be relcased, nnd ought not * You will soon to bc relinquished
bring the parties of the country into an effective aggressiofi upon slavery." Again, hc declares: What
a commentary upon the history of man is the raet, that eighteen years after the
death 01' John Quincy Adarns, the people have for their standard-bearer Abraham Lincoln, contös.*ing the obligations ot• the higher law , which the sage of Quiney proclaitncd, and contending, for weal or woe, *'Or lito or death, in tbc irrepressible conflict between freedom and slavery
I desire only to say tl'lat we are in the last starre of thc conflict, before the great triuntphal inaut•uration oc thig policy into the of the United States." Now, sir, Mr
Seward was the highest candi- datc on the first ballot, and is to be tho prime minister of tho incoming Administration
We no'.v come to thc declaration of the candidate who •vvas ultimately nominated unanimously by that convention
What does Mr
Lincoln declare
And it is such declarations •as these -that have given him his present high position in the coun- try
He says: What I do say is that no man is good enough to govern i say this is another man without the other man's consent
the leading principle, the SHEET ANCHOR of american Re- publicanism." Again, •in Chicago, on the 10th of July, 1858, he said: should like to know if, taking the old Declaration af Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and maxing exceptions to it, where will it stop
If one rnan says it does not inean negro, why not another say it does not mean sorne other than 
If that declaration Is not the truth, let us get the statute-book in which wc find it, and tear it out

It is not that he ei ther favored or was opposed to a protective tariff; not that he Wits for one policy or the other, dis- connected with slavery
I ask
you whether, if there had been no slavcs in the: United Szates, and  436 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17, if he had entertained similar opinions about sla- very in Cuba or Brazil, would such opinions ever have been considered when the nomination came to be madc
No, sir, that nomination was made solely, mainly, and particularly, on the ground of hostility to slavery
It is one of his open declar- ations that he hates slavery as bad as any Aboli- tionist
It was that very hatred which gave him the confidence of the party that has elected him to power
Then, how do we stand
Here is a party com- posed of men of the northern States alone, of whom not one single individual owns a •slave; and probably not one twentieth of those who voted for Mr
Lincoln ever saw a slave
They have none of the evils or advantages of that in- stitution among them
And yet they chose Mr
Lincoln for his opinions in regard to an institu- tion with which they have no connection, and in which they have no practical interest
He was selected because of Ins hatred to slavery
In other words, he was selected, not for any partic- ular views of policy that he has in regard to northern institutions or northern interests, but because of the views which he entertains in re- gard to southern interests
He .was elected, not io govern the North, but to govern the South; to govern a portion of the Union in which he has no party, and where there is no respectable portion of citizens who, for a moment, tolerate his elec- tion to offce on such principles
So far as the South is concerned, we of the South have had no more to do in the election of Mr
Lincoln than we have had to do with the election of the Emperor of France
He is to us a foreign ruler
He is elected by men who have no sympathy with us, who are hogtilc to our great interests
I submit to the consideration of every candid mind, if any court on carth would appoint a guardian ovcr a property where the application was made for t.hc sole purpose of destroying the estate; whcrc the applicant was hostile to the in- tercst,ofwhich he desired to l)avc the control, and, only sought tho trust for its destruction; is the re interest in the country, and should share the com- mon weal or common x,voe of -the country, like other great interests
I submit to the committee and to the country, what reason can be given, from a review of his- tory, for so bitter a contest against this institution of the South
Has slavery madc such rapid strides since the foundation of this Government as to alarm those philanthropists, if philanthropists they be
At the time of t.he treaty of peace in 1783, the States now,' called southern owned ter- ritory to the extent of 638,016 square miles, and the northern States 169,662; or the South owned 468,354 square miles more than the North
Vir- ail over the country
This idea that the South, or the Democratic party , or any party at the Sou th , are slavery propagandists, by and through tho Federal Government, is a mistake, and northern politicians have misled the public mind of the North when they have atternpted to promulge such an idea
The only position taken by any party in the South is, that we of the South are equals in this Union, and that when Territories are acquired our citizens have the right, under our Constitution, to go there, and that no power short of the people of the Territories themselves can at any time exclude them from this right
There is some division among us as 10 when the people of ginia ceded territory to the extent of 239,558 a Territory should act—whether they should do I it while in a territorial capacity, or whether they square miles, and excluded slavery therefron-r, , should wait until they form a State constitution; thus giving the North 409,220, and reducing the 
but all agree that there is no power which can ex- South to 398,458 square miles
The South was then strong, and the North was weak
How has elude the South from her rights in a Territory that generosity and mao•hanimity been requited 
but the people who settle that Territory
We are in favor of the largest liberty to the people to go How is it now* proposed to be requited by the to the Territories that are acquired by the com- northern States
The very States of the North- west, of the territory thus generously ceded by mon blood and the common treasure of all the the State of Virginia, are this day enlisted in the States and of all the citizens of all the States, and ranks of our adversaries; and a large majority of to stand upon a perfect equality in relation to their their Eepresentatives on this floor are votincr and rights in those 'I'erritories
acting to-day with the party Lhal is attempting thc to deprive the old mother Commonwealth, mother of those States, of any right in the Terri- tories thtft have been subsequently acquired, al- though they were acquired by the joint blood and treasure of' Virginia with all the
Slates
But, sir, Ictus follow out that idea: By the Lou- isiana purchase, we acquired
1,136,496 square miles
Of this the North has secured 977,602 I square miles, and the South 333,624—the North acquiring 643,978 square miles more than the South
13y the Florida purchase, the South acquired 1 59,268; and by the annexation of Texas, 274,356; total by these last tV%Z0 acquisitions, 333,624 square By the N'Texican treaty, the total acquisition is , | 665,486 square miles
Of this the North has Cal- n court on earth, clairning to know what equity ifornia, containing 188,981 square miles, leavincr and justice is, who would for moment think of i 476,505 square INiies in New Mexico and Utah I c MT hat objection can the North have to that
It is not that slavery will go up North
Every I man who knows the character of the northern people, knows that they look well to their own Interests, and they have abolished slavery in the northern States; and in doing that, they have shown by their example that there is no fear that slavery will ever go where it is unprofitable ']'his being so, why is it that there is this hostility in the public mind at the North agaii')st this insti- tution of slavery
Sir, they have got ingrafted on their minds an idea that slavery is sinful, and that this Governn•ent is responsible for the sin of slavery, if it be tolerated
Doubtless a large majority of the
people of the North are devoted to the Constitution of this country, and arc iVill- i ing to give us our constitutional rights, if they In my hum- were not misled upon this subject
I ble judgment they have been, whether intention- ally or not, grossly misled
They have been tauo•ht that the Constitution of t.he country docs not recocrnize thc right of property in man, and appointing him 
And yet you are determined to place the guardianship of the rights of the South in the hands of men who on the slavery question, come here declaring their hostility to slavery, and claiming the right to take charge of that institu- tion to which they are hostile, aid on the destruc- tion of which they are determined
I submit to the consideration of this cornmittee, and of the country, whether it is an American principle, t.l'iat the party who has no interest in the subject-inat- ter should selecta guardian for it, and choose him from mnong those hostile to it
But it may bc said that our Government is one of majorities
True: in one sense it is a Govern- to bo settlod
And the present effort of your party is to cxc.lnde the South from the whole of this; that it slavery is permitted to into any of tho while the South only asks equality in it
And, i sir, may remark, in relation to that territory, that it is the most barren, blcak, mountainous, and unproductive territory that this Government has ever acquired
The soil and climate of that territory are such that your own distinguished Daniel Webster declared that slavery could never go there; that the law of nature prohibited it; and that, to enact the Wilmot proviso in regard to it, would be only to reénact tbe law of God
I will refer again to the statistics that I have collected frorn the report of the Commissioner of the Land Office: But Mr

this idea of majorities crovernillff Again, sir; ought to be limited to the peoi)le who arc inter- csted in the subject
The people of Massachu- setts or the people of Virginia might welt submit, a subject to the will of their respcctivc States, and be governed by the majority; but the principle does not hold good where the question is sub- mitted to those who have no interest whatever Upon the subject, of slavery, or any local in- tcrest of the South, I maintain that if majorities in the North, or if every •man in the North, were in favor of hostile legi.;lation, it would be anti- American , and contrary to all the principles of our Governrnent for them to asstnne to govern such local institution , and especially to govern it in such a way as to bring about its destruction
Why is it that the northern people have felt it incumbent on them to join in a crusade against this instit.u-

Why, sir, we must look to ghe that
at.tend('d our Declaration Of and the formation of this Consti- tution
&fhe ships of the INorth and of the South were then engaged in the African slave trade
'i'hey were going to Africa, and there buyincy or I kindnapping negroes, and bringing them to the United States, ai)d selling them to the citizens of the Union as slaves
A proposition was Inade to abolish that trade, or to give Congress the power to abolish it; but the North, tbc States of Massa- chusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, said I that they wanted t.he trade extended, at least until 1808; thus giving them twenty years more to bring this species of property to the United States, sell it, and pocket the profits of the sale
It was the idea entertained then, universally
Nobody thought of any thing else than that they wore legally bought and sold as property
But, sir, when you carne to organize the Mis- i ; sissippi Tcrritory, you put in your bill, that any man being the owner of a slave might take that slave into that Territory and there reside
And every Administration frcnn that day to this, and II every President of the United States, has recoff- nized the same idea
Congress has aoain and again recognized it, and directed slaves to be paid for as property
Your treaties have recognized And, sir, not only that, but your courts have it
again and again recoo•nized it
Your Governnunt In seventy-six years the South has gained but l; in all its branches, executive, legislative, and ju- 252,962 square miles, and the INorth, in the sarne II dicial, have been treating slaves as property up to period, has ,nuined 1,406,141 square miles

We are often told that the slave power has is now abolished

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBD
State, unless it be a right conceded under the Con- stitution, that hye has the sole and exclusive con- trol over the services of the slave tons full an extent as he has over anv Other species of prop- erty, real or personal, not inconsistent will-x the laws of humanity 
The gentleman from Ohio, [Mr
STANTON,] the other day, contended before this I-louse that the admission that slaves were property would in- volve us in interminable dificulties
•Why
He objected to the admission of the right; for the rea- son, among others, that, if a unan in trans'itu through a free State with his slave should die, and die indebted to the citizens of such free State, an administrator in- such State could not inventory the slave as property, or subicct him to the pay- ment of such indcbtcdncss
Why, sir, if tho gen- tieman from Ohio had reflected upon the result of that provision of the Constitution relating to fugi- tivc slaves, according to his own construction of it, hc would have seen that the samc• difficulty might occur
Suppose a slave escaping from Ken- tuck y into Ohio is pursued and apprehended by his master, but before his return his master dies, owing dcbts in that State: the slave could not be sold there; a writ of Jieri facics could not reach him; but he could bc taken back to •Kentucky, and there be sold in the marn-ct
Suppose the slave escapes, and is apprehended by his Owner in a free State, where the master dies: surely his per- sonal representative—his heirs or administrators —would have the right to carry him hack, and apply the proceeds of his sale to thc debts of his deceased owner
But ao•ain: the gentleman from Ohio says, sup- pose the *naster, while in transitu through a free State, kills his slave, or his slavc kills what is then to be done
Precisely the sarne dißiculty would api.se
in case the owner of a ve slave having apprehcnded him in a frcc State, should, While returning, in the exercise of his authority, 'l*he gentleman 's kill, or bc killed by the slave
State should for such a contingency; and if they have not legislated upon the subject, it is not my fault
And so in respect to all the diffcuities which QUr friends of the North find growing out of the recognition of t.he 1•Wht of property in slaves
T herc are no difficulties which did not exist in the minds of our fathers who framed the Consti- tution, and which were not fully met by them in
the instrument framed by them, with the intention of comprorrusirig and settling them upon princi- ples havino respect to tho rights of ali the States of the Union
Now, sir, when we look at thc history of this country and sce its procress; when wc see the diffcultics which have froin time to time comc up and been scttfcd by the wisdom of our fathers, is it not strangc that
our friends in the North should unite in such numbers upon an issue that has so little in it, afibcti'ng not only their own' welfare, but the welfare of i.he whole country
Why, sir, if we are permitted to take our slaves into tbc common Territorics of the country, it does not I add a single one to tho number; it docs not brin«r another slave within the limits of the United It only authorizes the master to change States
his location;- it docs not bring him ncarcr to you
Most likely it will have thc effectof removing him further from those gentlemen from t.he North who aoainst our fathers in the war of the Revolution; while you refuse to permit the descendants of General Green, or of any of thc heroes of the Rev- olution in the South, to go there and take their property with them, Call you this fair dealing
Is this loyalty to us or to the memories of the Revolution
Is it that spirit that actuated the framers of the Con- stitution, when they, compromising all the diff- culties before them, framed the Governmentunder which we have cn•own up and existed as a nation so long and so prosperously
Sir, these difficulties arc continually thrown in our way
Atletcrmined disposition is manifested to take
that territory from us, to circumscribe us within our present limits; while they will permit homesteads to be granted to the descendants of our former enem ies, and will populatc it with men who cannot even speak our language, and to whom they should bc bound by no stronger ties of affec- tion than they should be to the me)) of the South, who shared in all the dangers and hardships of its acquisition
I have no hostility to foreigners; but, sir, when I sce the legislat.ive bodies of my country legis- lat.ing with a view to give them precedence over t hc descendants of the revolutionary sires of the South, I feet that it is timo for us to speak out— to demand at least the rights of the peoplc of the South
There can 
be nothing wrong in that
W c do not claim any exclusive riglit m any of t.he Tl'el'l'itorics
We only claim the samo ri«rht in those Territories that are secured to the people of the North
We demand nothing more; we can submit, sir, to nothing less
We do not ask to exclude one of the northern people, or any specie.s of property possessed by the northern But
you propose to excludc us, unless people
we divest ourselves of our household servants— a property which is cndcared to us from our ear- liest recollections, and for which we have higher regard than for any othcr species of our prop- crty
The relations which exist between thc mas- ter and servant create a sympathy unlikc that which you fecl for your homestead and your fartn It is a kind of friendship
110t•ses and wagons
It is a devotion of follow-feeling characteristic of that institution, which never has been, and which I fear never will be, justly appreciated by the North
They arc a part of us
They sympathize with us, and we sympathize with them
Our rights are their rights; and when wo prosper, If we can go to a country whcrc they prosper
we can do bcttct• t ban where we arc, the slaves that go with us are bettered in an cqual propor- it is that wee Hence, sir, tion with oursclvcs
claim all the ricrhts of equality ill this Union
But, Mr
Chairman, lhc time has gone by for the discussion of this qucstion at length
We have passed from tbcoriesund come to facts
Such has bccn the character of the dealings ofthc North toward the South—all of which 1 have not the time, in the few minutes left mc, to refer to—that the South feels her rights are 110 longer safe in this Government without some new guarantees for their protection
Underthatfeeling,fourStates have already seceded from the Union; and, sir, probably while I arn addressing this committee, t.he fifth will take its leave of us
These are the facts that stare us in the, face
Disunion has taken place
Many of the great minds of the South represent that section upon this floor
But have taken the ground that the right of secession is a right ovcr and above the Constitution —but a tlemen tell us they want these Territories for free right recocrnized by tho peculiar manner in which labor
Mr
Chairman, I submit that thcrc is that inst.nunent was framed
have not the time much in the conduct of this party at thc North calculated to break up and forcvcr destroy that on this occasion, nor do I think thc great body of the South going to take time to investigate the feeling of friendship which once existed, and must again exist before we can sustain a united Gov- very nice and very able legal arguments made on I this subject.
We go back to first great principlés
ernment
The Territories of the Government arc the common property of all the States
No man ! t It is enough for the people of the South to look will say that the South has failed to contribute to the Declaration of Indcpcndencc
We believe her share in their acquisition, whether it be in When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing cash or blood
No man can say it
invariably the saine object, evinces a design to reduce them Then why should we not have a common right under absolute despotism, iL is their right, it is tllCir duty, to that territory 
What are you gentlemcn of the I to throw off such governmcnt, and to provide new guards North ihdicating by your policy in this House 
for their futurc safety
It is not to secure the territory for your own chil- T hc ground is taken here, that wc cannot and dren
You do not expect to populate it by your will not bc permitted to scccde peaceably from If thc action in the Senate yester- ox.vn offspring; certainly not in the present day

You have, during thc present session, passed a bill day means anyt.hing, it means that
This thing giving an inheritancc in that territory not only to of secession is not to be permitted

He étyé; The suggestion that the Üniqp can .be maintamed' by
the nu:ncrical predominance and military proiveS$ot• onc section, exerted to coerce the other into-submission, -IS, 'in my judgment, as seitlcontradictoryüs it is dangerous
-It; comes loaded with the death-smell from fields wet with
brothers' blood
Iftbe vita) principle Of all rcpub)ican gov- ernment is the consent of the governed,' much more does a union of coequal sovereign States require, RS its-bases, the harmony of its members and- their -voluntary coöpcration in its oaganic functions." Mr
Chairman, thc people of the South regard Tl'hey believe that this that as the true doctrine
is a Government founded •in the consent of the people governed; and that all efforts mad(5 to coerce a sovereign State will be deemed ah attack upon the great body of tho South
-Whehöver such efforts are made, I venture to say--—and with no desire to indulge in boasting; it,is my solernn con viction—that every State from this to the Rio Grande will unite as a band of brothers, and as band of brothers will resist to the last; resist any and cvcry blow struck against a seceding State to compel her to remain in the Union
Mr
Chairman, we regard the Constitution of the United States as the casket in which our fore- fathers deposited the jewels of justice; of the in- surancc of domestic tranquillity; of provision for thc common defense; the promotion of the general wclfare, a_nd the security of the blesSings of liberty to oursclves and our posterity
Those were the iewels deposited in the casket
When you rifle It of these treasures, do you suppose that eulogies upon the glorious Union will attach the people and the States of the Smith to it
ND, sir; thev Will dash it from them as an unholy thing
It 'is the trcasurc that givcs it value, and not that, in •,vhich the treasure is contained
But .1 have hcard the idea frequently thrown out that vou do not mean to make war upon the seceding States; that all you mean to do is, to Ict tl'hem do without the United States courts and' post: It is dcclarcd that this Government will' offces
let the sccediog States do without the advanta«res of this Union, while they will bo compelled to pay their share of the revenue
Thatisthe sort of coer- cion whicl'l Georgc Ill attempted to put in force acyainst the revolted American colonies
Hc made wuu• upon them for no othm• purpose but to com- pct them to pay the tea tax and thc stamp duty
Is such a war consistent with tbc principles of American freedom
if so, then you can prose- cutc your war for the purpose of collecting the revenue, and yet usc no coercion
Suppose the Constitution of the United States made it the especial duty of the Government to coerce every State that was not willingly såbject' to its control.' what would you do
You would only cnforcc the law; the very thing, sir, you now claim thåt you will do, and yet you will' not coerce
Mr
Chairrnan, let this thing be attended to; not that I invite it, but let it bc attended to; who can imaginc thc terrible consequences that must result
Is it not known that one; five, or fif- teen States cannot bc conquered and held in sub- jcction
It cannot be done; nor do I claim that We can conquer the North
What did it cost this Govcrnmcnt to get fifteen hundred Seminole ',var- ri.ors out of the everglades of Florida
We ox- pcnded more than thirty million dollars out of the public Treasury in that little war; and when you talk of conquering States, the whole arithmetic fails in figures to count the cost that I submit this, not as a will follow the attempt
threat, but as the plain consequences of an act of If such policy as this is to result this character
in no good to any portion of the Union, but in interminable evil, I submit, why is it necessary or expedient
And let me say, here, that all that is said or done upon this subject of conquering, or using force, or coercion, hut
adds fuel -to the If this Govern- flame through the whole South
men t had manifested a more peaceable disposition , and had, from the commencement Of this excite- ment, proclai med through Coogress .that no force would be used, I believe that not more than one State would have been out of the Union at this  438 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 17, time
We should have had more time for a set- tlement of these diffcutties
'I"he remedy, if remedy there be, is in concilia- tion
Read, if you please, your writers upon the subject of national law, and they universally con- cur in the idea that the true and proper mode of putting down civil war is to grant to the people what they ask
And what has the South
asked which should not be granted
She has never come into the Congress of the United States and asked for the passage of a law favoring and estab- lishing slavery upon any portion of the continent
She has only asked that all the rights we have shall be protected by the Government
We do not get rights from this Government
We have them over and above the Government
The Gov- ernment does not create rights, but only protects them
Governments are established to protect rights; and we on!y ask that Congress shall pass laws to protect rights which we already possess If this matter is to be settled—and possibly it yet may be—it must be done by a concession
And what do you yield
What do our northern friends yield
Nothmg; absolutely nothing
They will have the same rights in the Territories which we will have
The feeling all over the South is, equality in (hc Union, or independence out of it." That is the watchword
That is the feeling of our people of all sections, so far as my inform- ation extends
My constituents have not been, not have I been, for secession
We have hoped for safety in the Union; and have desired that all means to effect that end shall be exhausted before a resort is had to disunion
But while we waited for your returnino• sense of justice towards us, disunion has overtaken us; four, and perhaps five, States have seccdcd; and the forts and arsenals, from North Carolina to the Rio Grande, are nearly all in possession of the seceding States
W c can be content with no adjustment that will not unite the South with us
'I'•he southern States have a common interest and a common destiny
You censure the southern States for their pre- cipitancy
Upon this subject we of the border slave States have more reason to complain than you
They and we have told you for years, in the most solcmn manner, that we could not sub- mit to your aggressions, and entreated you to for- bear; yet you have not heeded, but have insulted us and told us that it was with us mere boastful- ness
You complain that the seceding States have seized the forts and other public property
These forts were permitted to be erected in these States for their defense, and the arms that have been taken were placed there for thc same purpose
The Federal Government has no right to use this property for any other purpose
And whenever the pcople who had granted the sites of the forts for their defimse discovered that tl'ley were to be used for the opposite purpose—of an attack upon —it was not only just, but wise, fbr them to them sec that they were pse,d for their defense, thc lc- gitimate purposc for which they '•.verc erected
You complain that Florida and other States were purchased and paid for, and that they cannot, therefore, scccde

The hour is late, the committee is wearicd, and I ask the gentle- man from Ohio to give way to a motion that the committee rise
Mr
GROW
I understand that the agreement yesterday was, that all general debate upon the Armv bill should close to-day, when the commit- tee should rise
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state that such was the nnderstanding
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM
Inasmuch as the chaii•man of the Committee of Ways and Means has thc right of an hour to reply, trust that, by unanimous consent, my colleague shall be allowed to Proceed in the morning
The CHAIRMAN
Chair will state that yesterday it was agreed, by general consent, that general debate should cease upon the bill to-day
Mr
GROW
I shall object to any change of the agreement while the chairman of the Commit- tee of Ways and Moans is absent
The CHAIRMAN
Is the proposition of the gentleman from Ohio objected to
Mr

If of Commit- tcc of Ways and Means were hero, I would leave the matter to hill); but as he is absent, I must ob- ject to any change

I have no objection to continninæ this debate to-day as long as the conunittce desire
Mr

The committee can consent that my colleague may go on to-mor- row
The CHAIRMAN
Penn- sylvania objects to any change of the understand- ing of yesterday
Mr

1 appeal to him to withdraw his objection
Mr

I must insist upon my objection, since the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means is "N.)t pi•esent
Mr

we shall have an abundance of tirne to-morrow

Mr
LOVEJOY
I object to that arrangement for to-morrow
Mr
SHERMAN
I understand there are quitc a number of gentlemen who desire to speak to- night
Mr

Mr
SHERM'AN

The CHAIRMAN
Does the gentleman from Ohio insist upon the motion that the committee Mr

do
Mr

It understood yester- I day that discussion on thc Army bili should close to-day, with the exception that the chairman of tl-ne Committee of Ways and Menns should have I see no good reason for changing the an hour
arrangement which was made yesterday
Mr
PERRY
I wish to say to the gentleman from Ohio, that if he does not desire to proceed to-night, I have a few remarks I desire to sub- mit, and I am prepared to eo on to-night
Mr
PENDLETON
With the permission of my colleague, will resume the floor, as I do not see that the object he has sought to accomplish is likely to be attained
I do not desire to detain the committee at a time when they are worn out; but if it is their will that I should go on to-night, I will do so, rather than lose the opportuuity of speaking
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM
Then 1 withdraw my motion
Mr
HARRIS, of Maryland
I understand that several gentlemen are willing, and prefer to go on with their •speeches to-night
The gentle- man fronl Ohio does not desire to do so until to- morrow
If the centleman is compelled to pro- ceed to-night, is It the understandi ng upon Lhe part of the committee that dcbate upon this bill shall terminate to-night
If not, it is hardly worth while to compel the gentleman to proceed now
CHAIRMAN
The tho commutee vesterday was, that general debate u pon thc Army bill should be closed at the rising of the committee to-day
Mr
COLFAX
1 desire to make an appeal to my friends upon this side of the House
The gelltleman from Ohio has always been courteous to our side of the House, and I think it is no more than just to reciprocate that courtesy
If he dcsires to speak to-morrow, the chairman of the committee will have the opportunity to respond, and there will be one speech on each side
Let that be understood; then, if other gentlemen de- sire to proceed tö-night, they can do so
Mr
JENKINS
Is it the that no business will be transacted this evening
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state that there was no such understanding
Mr
JENKINS
lhope will be such an understanding, so that members may not be obliged to remain hcrc

If there is an un- dorstanding that no business shall be transacted, I presume this debatc can "0 on this evening in- definitely
'rhe CHAIRMAN
Is any objection to thc gentleman from Ohio having the floor in com- mitteo to-morrow morning
No objection was madc; and Mr
PENDLETON yielded the floor for to-night
Mr
PERRY
Mr
Chairman, 1 rise to speak for New England and tbc Union
i arn acitizen of the United States, and to its Government i owe allegiance
While I am proud to acknowledge this, I cannot forget that I am a son of New Eng- land; that I was born and reared among the hills I love the Union, that circle her happy homes
but I love New England none the less for this; it is a part of my country, and as such has added to lier past glory and renown
I atu not unnfindful of the fact, that the land of the Pilgrims has for many years becn made thc point of attack from her sister States in this Con- federacy
She has been accused of treason, fanat- icism, and disloyalty to the Union and Constitu- tion
And now, when treason and rebellion are stalk- ing abroad through the land; when men are turn- ing to each other and anxiously inquiring for some plan, some scheme, or compromise, that will avertand drive back the storm, but few amonc the Union-savers inquire after New England, or consult her Representatives as to the terms of set- dement to be agreed upon
'6 Slowli her off" seems to be a favorite idea with certain gentlemen on both sides of Mason and Dixon's line
We hear much said about a southern confederacy, a great central confederacy, and a Northwestern confederacy; while a com- mon idea seems to take possession of the minds of all these political schemers that New England shall be left out in the cold
When gentlelnen sit down to cut and carve up this great and glorious Union into petty , contemptible confederacies; they draw their lines and mark their boundaries with a view to the utter exclusion of the six North- eastern States
More especially do our southern brethren, when speaking Of Yankee land," put on lordly airs of derision and contempt, while they disclaim ail desire any longer to maintain  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
439 Federai relations with the descendants of the Pii- grims
Standing here in this great council cham- ber of the nation, and speaking for the brave sons of' New England, most emphatically declare to all who would try the experiment, and dissever the tics that bind us together as a common peo- ple, -we can live without you as well and as long as you can wichout us
For tnore than three quarters of a century we have lived with you in the Union; not as your in- feriot•s, not as so many dependencies, but inde- pendent sovereignties, subject to the obligations and lirnit.ations of a c.omunon Constitution, to which wc have been loyal both in peacc and in In all that Inakcs a nation great and pow- crful, prosperous anti happv, respected and hon- ored, at houue and abroad, none have contributed more than the six New England States; and if ever the time shall come when the demon of dis- union shall makc you onc people and us another, history wili record the fact thal six of the bright- est geins t.hat over bedecked our national diadem were found in thc great Northeast
In defending New England from the vituperous assaults that have long been made upon her, I deal in facts and figures, and not in empty declamation: the forme:• appeal to the jud«ment and reason; the latter pleases the ear, but seldom enlightens (he understanding
To elaborate the proposition that the people of New England have been and still are a pat.riotic eoynmunlty—that they love their country, tho constitution, and tbc Union, would bc like an argument to prove that the sun shines at noonday
The memories of the past dispel thc idea
So long us the plains of Lexington reverberate the echoes of the' first guns that inaucnn•ated the American Revolut.i0Fi, and covet the ashes of the horocs that fir.st laid down their lives in defense •of their country; so 10 Fig as the tall shaft, that lifts its awful form" from thc heights of Bunker II-lilt, shall siynal the spot whcrc rcpose in majes- tic silence the bones of Warren and his brave who fell ficrhting for their homes and firesides; so long as the rcmcmbrances of old Fan- euii Hall, whcrc liberty was first cradled, and whose walls once echoed with tlieeloqucnt trumpet ton-cs of the fiery Otis and the impetuous Adams, shall linger in American minds, until all thesc cherished recollections shall fade away in the dim distance of the futuce and be forgotten, the sons daughters of the Pilgrims will need no cham- pion, hei•e or elsewhere, to vindicatc her honor or repel assaults upon her valor and patriotism
The bones oc her heroes lie buried beneath the sods of every battle-field of the Revolution; while itberc was not a• scene of conflict in the second war of indepen.dencc where her sons did not fall, stars and facing the foe, under the canopy of' the Not a battle was cvcl' fought upon the stripes

Southern gontlemen remind us that we live in •a •region of cold, that boisterous winds and chill- il)2 frost.s are our constant visitors; but do thcy not know that the mountain breczes and invigo- rating air of New Er:glaud breathc into her inhab- fitants the very elements of a hardy, athletic racc

No, sir, no such bai•barous in- evet• disgraced the soil of New England
heain: we arc accused of entertaining stron• and decided opinions, upon questions of religion, 
morals, and politicaå economy, To thi„k; we plead gui'lty; and when you demand a surrender of these I God-given ri:zlits we answer, no—they wiil only wealth and industry
In doing 'hiss- shall use I esor!dd to I the standard of conzparison, so oftel to settle questions of this kind
In order that the House, the country, and the world may judge between us, 1 shall institute the comparison between New England and her most vehementaccusers
LetSoutliCarolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Louisiana, stand up and face Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine
New England has a -territory of 65,038 miles, and a shore-line upon the ocean of 4,003 miles, being more than a third of the whole Atlantic coast
She has the best navigable waters and •har- bors in the world
Her inland streamsabound in water-powers and facilities for drivi ng machinery
Her population, by the census of 1850, amounted to 2,705,095
But as I prefer to deal in results rather than theories, I shall pass at once to my In my references to statistics, am next point
obliged to refer to the census of 1850
Thc re- ligious habits of a people can be dctetmincd by the attention they give to the well-rccognizcd in- stitutions of Christianity
The regard paid to the Sabbath and the institutions of the Sabbath are correct index from which to iudge the religious character of a community
"By the census of 1850, the value, of church property in New Eno•- land was $19,875,948; value of same in the SIX In aforementioned cotton States, $7,729,046
Now England there were 11.31 churches to every 100 square Illiles; in the six cotton States, only 2.18 to the, sanie area of territory
From the samo authority it appears, that in the New England States thcrc is an annual circula- tion of copies of newspapers, while the six seceding States circulate but 28,348,051 copies
In New England there are 50,911 inhab- itants who can l'ieithcr read nor write; in the six cotton States 129,126
In Now England therc arc 14,905 public schools, ] 9,470 teachers, an d 632,759 scholars; in tlle six cotton Slates, 4,732 schools, From this 4,920 teachers, and 141,543 it appears there arc four times tbc number of schools and scholars in t.he New England States From the tbcre are in the -six seceding States

England has ten as many libraries and about six times as rnany volumes as the six cotton States
New England has more than onc fourth of all the library volumes in the whole Union; the whole amount to volumes
I prefer to make no further commcnts upon thc statistics, but leave them to speak for t.hernsclves
I now pass to speak of the wealth and industry of New Lngla.nd
I admit that its soil, as awholc, is not naturally so productive as that of inany the Union; yet New England other Slates in abounds in acrricultupal products
fl'ake, for cx- ample, ber crop of hay in 1850, 3,463,150 tons, worth $27,000,000

"Che six cotton States
have but 67 mills, .capital invested $3,363,256, with a product amountingto $3,346,062
The difference between thetwo sec- tiqps in the manufacture of woolens -is '-even, greater
New England has -483 woolen• mills, with a• capital invested of -$17,667,895; the six cotton States have but 3 milks, with a-capital of only $68,000
The facts show that New England hasl,047 cotton and woolen mills; the cotton States 70- Thc former a capital ih of over the latter only-about three millions
The whole cotton crop of 1850, in all the southern States, was Talk about its being •king," •when the products of Now England manufactures in- clusive amount in millions more annually than your whole crop! In 1850 New England had 298,304 persons employed in manufacturing estab- lishments; the six cotton States 30,917
I now turn to the commerce of New England
By a reference to the letter of the Secretary of the 'Treasury, on tl'1C commorcc uld navigation of the country, I find the following returns for the year ending Junc 30, 1859: The number of Amencan and forcign •vessels which entered the ports of New England, for said year, was 5538; the ton- nage upon these vessels was 1,170,297; and they were manned by 45,149 men and boys
In the cotton States the Bumbcr of vessels entered was 2,069; the tonnage, 1,100,811; manned by 34,400 men and boys
More than- half of this latter amount, to wit: 661,415 of the tonnage, was at the port of New Orleans, which takes the' commerce of the Mississippi from thefrce States in the North- west
Of this number of vessels which entered the ports of New England said year, 3,396 were forugn, and 2,340 American; and of the number which entered the ports of the cotton States, 721 were foreign, and 1,348 American vessels) show- ing a great preponderance of the foreign trade to bc with New England
In 1850 New England had engaged in sea and riVcr navigation 43,018 the six cot.ton States 6,698
More than men; l)inc tenths of all the persons navigating the occan, in the whole Union, are from New Encrland— 42,154 being from this section, and 4,987 from all intimately connected with commerce arc the In 1850 fisheries of the United States
capital was invested in the fisheries of the United States; and of this sum, $8,202,060 was from New England, and only $13,975 was from t hc six cot- ton States
These fisheries employed 20,704 men ; of which 17,676 were from New England, and only 98 from tlv cotton States

Dur- ing the same time the cotton Mates built 31 ves- sels, carrying a tonnage of only 3,079.25
In 1860, 89 ships and barks were built in the United States
Of this number '78
were built in New England
The great mass of the Shipping for the whole Union has been built, for years, by New England mechanics
In works of internal improvement New Eng- land comparatively is ahead of any other section of the Union, and far in advance of the cotton in 1854, New England had built and in States
operation 3,353 miles of railroads, and 165 miles In these works she had invested of Canals

The whole capital invested ill) railroads and canals in the United Statesin 1854, was $489,603,028
In 1852 the States of this Union owed in the aøcrreoate the sum total of Of this amount the New Eng- land States owed only $6,854,905; bcil')g only about one thirtieth part of the whole debt
T hc six cotton States owed , in 1852, $28,697,592; more than four times the amount of indebtedness on the part of the New England States
The currency of New EnglancPis the soundcst in tile Union
In 1850 she had 500 banks, having a capital invested of $119,590,423
They had in circulation, in loans and discounts, #179,992,420
The six
cotton States had at the same tillie but 62 banks, with a

If It is said, New England docs not bcar her full proportions of the public burdens in thc Con- fedcracy, let me give you a rnathcmatical dmnon- Ntration which blows away all such charges like i cite it to show how chaff before the wind
other portions of the Union suffer pecuniarily in conscqucncc of their Federal relations with New England
The Postnmster General, in his an- nual report made to 2 ho last session of the present Congress, gave us a schedule of the receipts and expenditures of each State in that Department for the year ending Junc 30, 1859
From this it ap- pears that there was an excess of expenditures, over the receipts, of $6,376,733 04; but when you take the schedule for New England, you -will find not one doliar of this excess can be char«ed to her
On the other hand, New England paid all hcr own bills, and had an excess of"receipts over her expenditures of $67,556 07; which sunri went into the common fund to relieve the States havinc a deficit
How was it with the six cotton States
Their receipts •,vcre $772,987 24, their expenditures $2 289,583 17; leaving the General Government to pay jor t.hern the nice' little sum of $1,566,595 83 ani'l!lally
The Federal Government pays them three dollars, where it receives one back
No won- der the " Kingdom of South Carolina graciously allows the United States to keep up its postal after it has, nrrancvement within the through fire and sword, marched out of this ac- cursed Union." And I
suppose the other seced- ing States will allow " Uncle Sam" to do what they cannot do themselves—carry their rnails at an enormous expense, cven if it be in föroign Gov- ernments
Massachusetts, the most wealthy New England State, pays all her bills for carryin!t the mall and for post office accommodations, with an excess of $157,622 51; while Georgia, thc most
wealthy of the six cotton States, pays into the Treasury *168,664 73, and draws ont $358,180 03

Chairman, I do not make these compari- sons for the purpose of assailing any of the States of this Union, but I do it to vindicate New Eng- land from the eternal clamor that has been raised against her by her sister States in the South
I ask our brethren of the South, and of the middle States, of the Pacific coast and of the great Northwest, to lay aside your prejudices; and .as the great oncc said of Massachusetts, I now say of New England: " there she stands, look at her." Look at her ships riding upon every ocean, and her commerce wllitening every sea; look upon her beautiful harbors, hef broad, ex- pansive bays, her glassy lakes, her flowing rivers, and gurgling water-falls; look at her fertile val- leys, her gentlc slopes, and cloud-capped mount- ains; look at her magnificent cities, teemincr with lifö, activity, commerce, and trade; at her beauti- ful villages, •where the charming notes of industry greet each comincr morn and salute the partin«y day; look at her thousand farm-houses and white i cottages dotting her landscapes ; her bleating flocks and lowing herds roaming upon thousand hills; look at her lofty spires, from whose sounding domes thc church-going bell greets each relurnil)ff Sabbath morn; at her halls bf science and erudi- lion; at her school-houses, where Presidents and Senators and warriors are Inade; look at her gi- gantic mills, VI hose busy htun forcvcr chants the dignity of labor and cheers on the hand of indus- try to a rich reward; look at her asylums, her hospitals, her splendid humane institutions , where the blind arc restored to sight, the lame taught, to earnest look at that goodly heritage lcft us by our fathers, and then tell mc if, in the honesty and hearts, you cannot exclaim: sincerity of your bravc land Qf the Pilcrrims, " Wilh all thy faults we love thec still!"

Notwithstand- ing wc have a common history, a common in- heritance, our brethren of thc South, in a hostile manner, threaten to cut asunder alk Federal rela- tions with their brethren of the free States, and especially of New England
New England has an interest in the preser- vation of this Union beyond mere love of a common country
Her hardv sons are found in every State and Territory
They have cone out from the old northeastern hive to build the commerce of your cities; to navigate your rivers, , lakes, and seas; to clear your forests, and people your prairies

Amoncr the distinguished statesmen who, in times past, have shed such a halo of glory upon the country and the world , New England has fur- nished her full share

And now," we arc told by our southern brethren that all these fraternal relations, which have so long becn fostered, chcrisbcd,and loved, must be broken off; that the old flag, which has for more than eicrhty years been floating upon the land' and thc waters; which has been the pride and protec- tion of the citizens of this Republic, at horne and abroad, must be pulled down and traunpled in the dust, and the palmetto, with a wriggling, crawl- ing snake, substituted in its stead
Mr
Chairman, this leads me to a few reflections upon the fearful crisis which now seems to be upon us
Ninety days ago, this nation was in the very flood tide of prosperity
Never before wore thc people of the United States in a condition to he happier or better contented
This bright picture In the North, business is now vailed in gloom
is deranged, labor is depressed; while an uncer- tainty as to the future paralyzes its industrial In the South, the peaceful avocations pursuits
of life are laid aside; quiet no longer reigns around the fireside; bright hopes and glowing aspirations gloom
Commerce has been driven from her cities; her marts of trade gradually disappear before the measured tread of martial array
Civil war lifts his ghastly head and rattling bones, while the very heavens are black with rcvolution and do- mestic strife
What is all this for
But one answer can be It is because the people of the United given 
States have, under the forms.of raw, and in strict conformity with the provisions of the Constitu- It is because Mr
Lin- tion,elcctcd a President
coln, and not Mr
Douglas, or Brcckinridge, or Bell, has been elected
" Rule or ruin' only policy that rules the hour in a portion of the South
How shall it be met by the friends of the Union
The real question at issue is whether we have ever had a Government; whether, as a na- tion, we have even had any of the elements of self-preservation
If the doctrines we hear from men of South Carolina politics are true, the whole country has been under a delusion for seventy If, under the Constitution, a State has a years
right to go out of the Union at pleasure, then a city in a Statc has a right to secede from a State; a ward has a right tb secede from a city; and any individual in a ward, if he feels himself oppressed by thc restraints of law, has a constitutional right to secede and declare himself indcpendcnt of all lawr and all government
The constitutional arcrument of secessionists, if they are good for anything, go to this extent
They contend that secession is a reserved constitutional right, and that it is found in articles nine and ten in the amendments to thc Constitution: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitütion, nor prohibiied by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Under this rcscrvatlon thc people, or one man from amoncr the people, both or cither, have just as clear a right to secede as a State
The doc- trine of secessionists goes to this extent, that the people, when they made the Constitution, reserved the right in the instrument itself, to destroy it at pleasure
•This theory is destructive of all gov- ernments
If' we have a Constitution and laws framed in obedience thereto, neither havc any inherGnt power or vitality to protect themselves against a mob, a banditti of lawless men, who choose to exercise their reserved rimhts, and set up rebellion
There is another idea advanced by secessionists, in connect,ion with the one already noticed, which to my mind, is cqually illogical  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
and absurd
They contend that -they not only have a right to secede from the Union, but they claim it shall be a peaceful right
Tbc only logic to sustain this position is found in the assumption that necessity makes law." But it is no part of my purpose to argue the constitutional right of secession
The whole the- ory is a modern invention—a political heresy, 2•e- pudiated and condemned by a long line of eminent Jurists and statesmen
Secession is rebellion and revolution
No fine- spun theories or abstractions can ever change the fact
Again: the statesman who denics the right of secession and at the same time contends there is no remedy against it, stands upon equally un- tenable grounds
An observance of the laws im- plies force, for one gannot exist without the other
Che seizure of the Un ited States arsenal at Charles- ton by an unlawful armed force, was just as much treason as was the attempt of John Brown to do the same thing at Harper's Ferry
Thcrc is but one tenable ground upon which the secessionists can base their attempts at secession, and that is to fall back upon the rigbt of revolution; and by this rulc will they be judged by posterity
Mr
Chairman, the North has another demand made upon it for concessions and now compro- The laws of Congress have been set at nuscs
" defiance; our arsenals have been plundered; our forts wrested from us by violence, and our own guns turned upon American citizens, peacefully sailing under the American flag
Under these circumstances, New England and the North are called upon to concede, to givc up, to surrender
As to overtures for peace, I can only judge of thcm when they come up for action
I reserve to myself the right to vote for or against any bill that may find its way into this House
'I'here are, however, certain principles which will gov- I never will orn my action in all these matters
vote for any bill, or amendment of the Constitu- tion, which will, by implication, cither directly or indirectly, or otherwise, extend slavery over a single foot of free territory, or that will sanction or establish itin any of the Territories of the Uni- ted States
Thosc issues have been squarely and understandingly submitted to the American peo- ple, and they have passed judgment upon them, and by no act of mine shall that solemn decision be reversed
I will vote for no amendments to the Constitution which will " convey the idea" that that sacred instrcufient " creates property in man
" " idea" ought not Mr
Madison thought such an to be incorporated into it; and Lhave no ambition to set up my opinion against his
With the Gov- ernor of my State, I believc it right that the per- sonal liberty bills of the several States should bc examined, and if found in conflict with the Con- stitution, they should be either modified or re- pealed
As an offset to this, I would have the fugitive slave law so modified as to secure to the fugitive a jury trial
While I would leave each State to the free and fall enjoyment of its own domestic institutions, and give them adequate remedies against invasion or lawless mobs coming from other States, I would demand and have full and complete pro- tectior' for citizens from the free States, when traveling in the slave States
Southern gentlemen complain of us because we fail to turn out and catch their runaway negroes, and for this would break up the Union; yet, at the same time, they suffer our own citizens—the white men of the North—who have never cotn- mittcd any offense against any of their laws or regulations, while peaceably traveling in their States, to be seized on merc suspicion by armed any reasonable concessions that would not involve a sacrifice of principle or be construed into an abandonment of the doctrines of thc Chicago plat- form
To the rebels in the cotton States, who are preaching and practicing treason, who are tramp- ling the national flag in the dust, who are seizing our forts and stealing our arms, I have- no com- promises to offer
They ask for none, and I would offer none
So long as they stand with arms in their hands; so long as they stand point- ing their weapons of dcath at American citizens; so long as they forcibly resist the laws of om• common country, my voice is for war
That Government which negotiates with traitors or surrenders to armed rebels, deserves the contempt of the whole civilized world
Mr
Chairman, I desire to make suggestion or two, ofa practical nature, and I have done
I am not among the number who believe our Gov- crnment a weak Government
The powers dele- gated to it under the Constitution clothc it with suffcient authority and power to protect itself against foes without and foes within
The pres- cnt perilous condition of tho country has not arisen from any inherent defects in our Govbrnment'to execute its own powers and functions; but from the vacillating, timid, truckling, treasonable con- duct of those charged with the execution of the laws
What can vv'e expect, when the President of the United States retains openly avowed dis- unionists in his Cabinet for his constitutional ad- visers; when he makes acn•ecments with men that he knosvs arc plotting the overthrow of the Gov- ernrnent, that he will not place the forts belong- ing to the Union in a state of defense
What can wc expect, when the Chief Magistrate of this great nation sits down to parley with men in open re- belli011 against thc laws and against the Govern- ment
1 answer, just such a state of affairs as now exists
In almost cvcry speech that has been madc in Congress by the disunionists, at the present scs- sion, we have had strong and earnest appeals made to the friends of the Union
to allow the seceding States to go outin peace
*YVhile the Represent- atives of the cotton States havc been eligaged at the Capitol in crying peace, peace, their constit- uents at home have been sounding the tocsin of war
The property of the Government, which they have bought and paid for, has been seized; our forts , arsenals, and rnunitioos of war have been 
taken forcibly from tho hands of our own officers; American guns have been turned upon American citizens; and the great highway of the Mississippi blocked up by armed mobs
Mcn may cry peace; but
there no peace
And shall we sit here under the sy ren song of peace until revolution and rebel- lion has done its work
Shall we bc lulled into a false security until the gums of the enemy are thundering at the gates of the Capitol
We are now dealing with stern realities, and not with imaffinary evils
W c are told we have no constitutional right to make war upon a sov- ereign State
In the name of fairness, I ask who has "dono it
Who fired tho first gun in CharlOs- ton harbor—the, Government or those who are acting to overthrow it
The grave question forces itself upon us, what shall be done when a State makes war upon the Government
Can the vio- lators of the law—the men who are making war upon the Government—when called upon to an- swer for their offenses, hide themselves behind the specious 
plea of State sovereignty
These are questions that must be settled—not theoreti- cally, but practically
While I would exhaust every constitutional remedy for the sake of peace, it is my fixed and discharge of this duty,: he is met; by foi'd% would place at his commånd the Army aid 'Ndvy• and purse of the nation
Sir, this
Union must* and shali -be preserved
The experiment of self-' government is not yet exhausted
•It-would be 'A shame, an everlasting reproach to' Ehe Ameriéah name, to allow it to be destroyed by the hand- Ofc domestic violence
Every' citizen of this—vast Republic has a direct interest in itspreservation-
To say that this great, this mighty and powerful Republic has no power to perpetuate its own ex- istence, to protect its property and citizens, is to manifest a weakness of which we -never
have been suspected at home or abroad
The great heart of the American people beats responsive to the preservation of the Union.• Madness may rule the passing hour, yet reason will ere long re- turn and resume it wonted sway
Men, frenzied with an unhealthy excitement, may raise the hand of violence againstthQ best Government the world ever saw; but the hallucination will: pass away, and they will then wonder at their own folly
Gloom may hang over us like d dark por- tentous cloud; the deep shadows of night may gather around our dwellings at noonday; yet; in a little while, the thunder ceases its loud roar, the clouds flit away before the splendor ofa me- ridian sun, the
rainbow of promise again spans the political heavens, and the angel ofpeacc again spreads his dewy wings over a happy land

The business upon this route seemed to require a daily mail from Pitcher to Cortland, as well as on the return to Pitcher

Representatives, and is precisely like two other bills, which have heretofore passed both Houses, for the repayment, to certain miners upon the min- eral lands of Wisconsin, of rent illegally exacted before the lands were purchased of thc Indian tribes
An agent of the Government illegally in- sisted upon the payment of certain rents by the rniner; and this is a bill providing for their repay- ment, because they were illegally cnforccd by the agent of the Government
Ät the last session a bill ofa similar kind passed, and also at tho ses- Sion before
It does not involve a large amount
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Wisconsin asks unanimous consent to con- sider the bill, to which he refers, at the present time
Mr

1 have no objection, if he will let the morning business be disposed of
I want to offer a resolution; but I do not wish to object to this bill at all
The bill was read
Mr

I think the bill had better go to the Committee on Indian Affairs, or Claims, or some other committee
I think it ought to be ex- amined
From the" reading

No facts are pre- sented in regard to it
I believe there is no report I think it ought to be accompanying the bill

ask now that that subject be taken up, and that the Senate will vote on .the motion to reconsider, hoping that the motion will be carried, and the q he PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Kentucky moves to taEe up the motion of the Senator from Pennsylvania, to reconsider the vote by which the resolutions of the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr
CLARK,] as a substitute for the original resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky, were adopted
Mr
CLARK
I hope that will not be done now
I hope the vote on the motion to recon- sider, ut any rate, will not be taken when thc Sen- ate is not full, and when it is not expected
I have no objection to taking up the motion and fixing a time for its consideration, so that every- body may understand when it is coming up; but I object to voting on it at the present time, when the Senate is not full
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on taking up the motion for consideration at this time

Mr
FESSENDEN
Read the bill
The Secretary road the bill, which proposes to direct the Commissioner of the General Land Offce to pay to Robert A
Matthews, attorney of Charles W
Tosh , the amount received from Tosh for one hundred and fifty-five and sixty-two hgn- drcdths acres of land, entered by him at the land offco at
Sioux City, in the State of Iowa, on the 2d Oct.ober, 1856, as per register's certificate and rcceivcr's receipt, both numbered four hundéed and fifty-five, thc cntry having since been can- celed as embracing land within the limits of the railroad grants madc by Congress by act ap- proved 15th May, 1856
The motion to take ui the bill was agreed to; and it was read thc second time, and considered as in Committee of the Whole, and reported to the Senate
Mr
FESSENDEN
That bill comes from a committeé of which i am a member; but I have no sort of recollcction of it, and I should like to have some explanation made of it
Mr
PUGH
Is that a bill to refund money a falsc entry of land
Mr
IVERSON
Yes, sir
Mr
PUG [-1
1 should like to hear an explana- tion of it
The practice of the omce, and, I be- lieve, the law, is to repay the money wherever the entry is canceled, unless there arc some par- ticular circumstances
Therefore, if it is nary cøse, do not see the necessity of the bill; and if it is an extraordinary case, should like to have a little cxplanation
Mr
IVERSON
from the •per- son who is attorney in this case—Mr
Matthews —that the Land Office cannot 01' will not refund the money
do not know on what ground, uniess that they have not power, and it requires an act It was reported from the Commit- of Congress

Several SENATORS
It is discharged
Mr
GREEN
That committee has not been discharged
The chairman informs me that it has not
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It will bo so referred 
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 wish to say a word in reference to the resolution—not to debate it— but to signify to the honorablc gentleman from Missouri that feel mysclfa littre constrained in respect to this resolution
I would gladly perform sent of the Senate, but the Senator from Kentucky I bent on the Chair, at this time, to call up¯the interposing an objection, the question of refer- I special order of the day
The Chair will state to ence is now before the Senate
Mr
GREEN
1 beg to make one re- mark
I thought it had been referred
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator had a right
to make such an inference, from the action of the Chair
The Chair remarked, sup- posing it was by common consent, that it would be reförred to the select committee
Objection being interposed, however, the question is still before the Senate
Mr
GREEN
1 think the objection of the I honorable Senator from Kentucky is not well founded
The public mind expect.s something to be done that will lead to a pacification
We know not what that thing will be
Every expedient that human ino•enuity can devisc ought to be resorted to
I desire this to remain in the committee until we see the fate of the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky in the Senate
They are but rec- ommendations to the peoplc at last
They do not pronosc to amend the Constitution by a
two- thirds vote here, but to take an informal, illegal, unauthorized vote of the people, to sec whether they will take stops to amend thc Constitution
'l'hat is all
The proposition that I make, and which I shall urge, if we cannot do any better, is not to dissolve the Union, but to resort to every expedient to save it on terms of equality to all; and if that should fail, then to take the next best thing
And what is the next best thing
Peacc- ful, honorable, equitable separation
And how is that to be done
As the Senator says, not by the Senate, not by Congress; it must bc done by the action of the several States themselves, in their sovereign capacity
T liere is nothing novel in this idea
The old of the Confederation passed a similar resolution; which led to delegates being sent to I)hiiadclpl'lia the fm:matiÖn of the cxistino• Constitution , and thc establishmel')t of the present Union
'l'hat Congress of the Confederation had no more power to malcc such an invitation—for it is bat an invitation to the States—than we have, to Inalcc this invitation
It laid the foundation of our past prosperity, our ffrowth, and our promi- nence as a nation among the family of nations
It may be possible that this may lead to it, it everything else fails
If anything else l.)ettcr cal- culated to stop the current of fanaticism and of folly—if anything better can be devised to regtore peace and harmony, together with security, will go for that other but the public mind is now in expectation of some movement being made that will concentrate public opinion; dnd thc public mind, as thcy are ail but mere voluntary acts of the people, even if we pass them, ought to have these several subjects up for consideration and to reflect upon
net them, from Maine to Florida, reflect on all the •ropositions, and see which is most feasible, anc which is best calcu- towards him, and towards every other of my lated to accomplish beneficial results; and when brother Senators, any act of' courtesy that lilight i i the people shall have acted, and the States in be suitable; but I cannot vote for a resolution, in their sovereign capacity, I shall bc content with any forrn, to make preparation for the separa- that action, whatever it is
the Senate that there are two special orders as- signed for this hour
One is the Pacific railroad bill, so called, and the other the bill for the ad- mission of Kansas
The Pacific railroad bill, as the unfinished business of yesterday, takes pre- cedence, and is now before the Senate for consid- eration
Mr
COLLAMER
1 move that that be laid aside, and the Kansas bill taken up
Mr
GWIN

Monday has been assigned for the resolutions of the Senator frorn Kentucky, and Wednesday for the tariff bill
hope the railroad bill will be taken up on Tues- day

Mr
COLLAMER
have no objection to that suggestion, and I modify my motion in that way
The PRESIDING OFFICER

GREEN to strike out the proposed boundaries of the State as defined by the bill: Beuinning at a point on the westerli boundary of the State of Missouri, wherc thc thirty-seventh paiallel of north latitude crosses the same; thence west on said par- allel to the twenty-fifth meridiari of iongitude west froin Washington ; thence north on said rneridian to the fortieth parallel ot• latitude ; thencc cast on said parallel to the west

the north- ern boundary or tbc Osagc lands, and the prolougat.i0E1 of the stune, to thc twenty-fifth meridian of longitude west VVashington ; thence north on said :neridian to the place or beginning
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President, i discussed this question somewhat at the last session of Congress, and I shall not now go into any general debate on the subject
I do not intend to interpose ob- stacles to the action of the Senate upon this ques- tion; but I think, owing to the space of time that has clapsed, I ought
to make a little explanation of it before the vote is taken on the amendment
It wili be observcd by an examination of the constitution adopted at Wyandotte, now ponding before the Senate, that about one third of the Territory of Kansas is cut off on the west
'I'hat incli.ides the Pike's Peak region, where tho first (YOId discovery was made, including the Gregory tion the States of 'this Union

The vote of the people tory; which none of the other constitutions ever ognize the probability, or even possibility, of of the States which he calls for is nn informal, I did
Owing to the character of the country, that such ai) event
I will not vote, cven in this indi- illegal vote
No rnan can be punished for perjury reduces it to small compass to constitute a good rect manner, for a proposition that implies its dis- at that election; no man can bc forced to open the State

446 desire this annexation to Kansas
I have a me- insuperable objection, if it is not one that cannot morial here, which was examined, setting forth be got over by any possible plausible reasoning, I the reasons why it ought to be so; and think am totally deceived in my own judgment
The-In- that but for political considerations, creating great dian lands ought to be excepted; and the best way anxiety to bring Kansas in now, right or wrong, to except them is to run the southern boundary It is only a short dis- we should all assent to this proposed change of north of the Indian line
It ctgs off but a small space of land—but boundary
In some six or eight cases of States tance
admitted heretoforc, we have done the same thing
We changed the boundary of Iowa; we changed the boundary of Michigan; and in regard to sev- eral other States, if we did not change the bound- ary we made other chauges, which required the constitut.on to go back to them to receive their subsequent assent
r rhe question now is this: is it right, asa prin- ciple of political economy, as wise legislators, to add that portion of Nebraska to Kansas; or is it not
It is not whether it will delay the admission of the State; for that consideration never did op- eratc upon the minds of Senators in any other case; but the question is: is it right, in parceling out the territory, in shaping States, and leavirv territory to be shaped into future States hereafter, that this should be annexed to Kansas
I think it cminently proper; 1 think it proper from the character of bhe country
When Kansas was originally owanized, the policy was to extend the States westward
There was then no discovcrv of gold in thc Rocky Mountains
Now a change of policy is indispensably necessary
A separate govcrnmcnt must be established for the Pike's Peak region'; and hence, as we cutoff that portion little territory; and we add on the north that which is below the Platte; and it makes a beauti- ful State, capable of sustaining a heavy popula- tion, and enjoying much prosperity and peace— I trust more hereafter than they have had in the past
That is the object of this amendment
There is still another diffculty; and I shall in- sist, whether this amendment bc adopted or not, upon a resubmission of the constitution to the people of Kansas; for I deny the right of Con- ) gress to change any constitution; I deny the right I of Congress to put qualifying expressions in it which will change its import, and force them It is forcing to take it without their consent
upon them a constitution they never made
*Now —I ask the question in all-candor—have the peo- ple of Kansas, in person or by Delegates, ever assented to this exception that the House bill puts in
If not, it must be resubmitted to them; and, if resubmitted, had*wc not better shape thc boun- darics in that .nanner which we think most con- ducive to the public xveal
Mr
DOUGLAS
Mr
President, 1 should be very willing to add the country south of tbc Platte river, as proposed by the Senator from Missouri, of Kansas, we ought to add an equal portion on to Kansas, and incorporate it with that State, if it could be done without postponing its admis- the North
I am willing to vote for an amendment to Another consideration: the present population the effect
that the people on the south Sidc of the of Kansas is not equal to the ratio of representa- tion
The census has been taken in the legal form, : ' Platte, within the boundaries speeificd by him, I and shows a deficiency
Adding this of not now included in the State of Kansas, shall vote for and against annexation; and that, in the Nebraska to it, gives it an adequate population
It then comes in as a good and substantial State
event a majority of them are in favor of being in- As to its political character, I know nothing and cluded within the State of Kansas, they may be If the present change , so included
But, whil& I do that, I must admit would not stop to inquire
of boundary shali bc made, I shall votc for the Kansas unconditionally as a State, and leave the admission
i desire to get rid of this question as question of the enlargement of the boundaries to bc determined by a vote of the people afterwards
soon as I can, and I therefore wiH most cheer- fully and heartily vote for its admission
But this is not the only atnendment have to offer, for the present pending au-lendment proposes another change upon the south boundary
It will be observed that the constitution of Kansas includes the Indian reservations, the Cherokee lands, the Seneca lands, and I think a portion of of the Quapaw lands
Treaties were made with those Indians, when wc sold lands to thc Chero- kees, especially providing tluey never should bc included withm any State
The constitution of Kansas does include them
I propose to run thc line iust north of those Indian rcscrvalion.s, and observe our treaty stipulation, and not break it because ure have the physical power to do it; but observe good faith with the Indian tribes
My friend, the Senator froin Vennont., [Mr
COLLA- MER,] at the last, session, on this point, answered me about this, that the territorial bill included it
and that that was as much a violation as this
But you will observe, by examining that territorial bill, while the nominal boundary runs around it, as drawn by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr
DOUG- LA s,] and as passed by Congress, it especially excepted all Indian reservations
The constitu- 1 ask tion of.Kansas docs not except anything
It was compet.ent for attention to this point
Congress, organizing the Territory, to except it
It was therefore legally excepted out of the nom- inal boundaries
It will be observed, however, in reading the House bill upon which we are now acting, that the House of Representatives undertook to cx- cept it just in the same lancyua(re that was em- ployed in the Kansas-Nebraska bill; but 1 ask the attention of Senators to this point: Kansas, in hcr sovereio•n capacity, if we admit her as a State, has made a constitution that excepts nothing; we say, " we let you in, if you except these Indian lands." Very well; does not that force us to re- commit the constitution to them
or else, in the I think the Nebraska river would be a better boundary Several SENATORS
You mean the Platte river
Mr
DOUGLAS
The Indian name of the Platte is the Nebraska river; from that I got the i name of the Territory
I think that rivet: would be a better boundary
It is a barrier to settle- ment rather than a connectine link between the It is very wide very shallow; settlements
its bottotn is filled with qnicksands; it is almost impossible to ford it; and it is extreinely diflicult It would bc a much I and cxl.)ensive to bridge
it
better boundary than ihc one fixed on the fortieth parallel, for which I admit that I am responsible in the formation of the Territory
I would like to give the natural boundary instead of that arti- fic,ial one; but I am only willing to Rive that by an amendment submitting the proposition to the people for ratification or rejection by itself, and I not to aflk2ct the question of ihe admission of Kan- sas under this constitution
But there is another objection of the Senator from Missouri
He prcsents what he thinks is an I insuperablc objection to our admitting this State Ele tells us that there are certain at this time
Indian treaties by wl-lich ccrtain lands now within the limits of the Territory and of the proposed State of Kansas, were stipulated never to be
in- corporated within or subject to the jurisdiction of and -I apprehend that if Kansas shall bé admitted under this constitution, and thequestion shall ever come before- any court, it will be at, once declared that the treaty is the paramount law; •ana that, consequently, there is nothing in the
cohstitutiöfi of Kansas to give to that State jurisdictiom Over any Indian reservation which -has been exceéted by treaty, and which it has been declared shall never be• included within •the limits or be subject to the jurisdiction of any State
It is very well for the House•of- Representa- tives to declare that these Indian reservations•hall be excepted ; which,in fact, amounts to declaring that we understand at the, time we pass the act that we are not subjecting them • to the jurisdic- tion of the State of Kansas
It was very well for me to insert in the Kansas-Nebraska bitl the same declaration
It is only giving notice that, at the' time the bill passes, it is so understood; but the legal effect would be, that the rights secured under the treaty would prevail, whether* there was any such declaration in the law of admission or;in the constitution of the State •or not; and therefore thesc reservations are not necessary; They are very well on thcir face, but they are ' not abso- lutely necessary
For this reason, I do not understand that the objection interposed by the Senator from Mis- souri is an insuperable objcction at all
Tho pro- posed amendment to the boundary does not change the legal effect of the bill as to the rights of the Indians, or the jurisdiction of the people of Kan- sas, in respect to the Indian country, at all
1 think it would have been very well if •the people of Kansas had drawn their boundaries in the way I think it would have been a little hc indicates
plainer, and certainly it would have been a little more acceptable to me; but the legal effect would not have been changed; and, as the objection, if it has force at all, consists only in its legal effect in violating the legal rights of the Indians, if that legal effect is not changed; the objection van- ishes
Hence, I have been unable to see anything in the objections which have been urged by the Sen- ator, either as to the southern bÖundary or the northern boundary, as furnishirw reasons why we should not vote for the admission of Kansas
I do think we ought to admit Kansas promp_tly, without further delay, or further obstacle
We have had controversies enough about Kansas
W c had a strugglc once whether she should be admitted with thése same boundaries, with these same objections existing, two or three years, with a constitution that I insisted was not madc by the people of Kansas
I do not intend now to reopen that controversy; but if the objection brought for- ward by the Senator from Missouri is insuperable now, it was just as insuperable to the Lecompton constitution
The fact of these Indian reserva- tions was just as well known to us then as it is now
The Objection was as binding on the con- sciences of men t.hen as now
Nobody on this side of the Chamber then thought the.objqption was insuperabre
I do not see what additional force it has now got.• I did not deem-it necessary in debate, when armuing against
the acceptance of the Lecompton constitution, to go any further than simply to make a vague allusion to the In- dian treaties
knew the sagacity of the Senator from Missouri; and if I did interpose that objec- tion, he would have retorted on me in a moment, it is a treaty stipulation; thc treaty is the para- mount law, and there is no valid force in your I thought so too
Hence I predicated objection.' any State or Territory
rlNhat is true
That objec- my opposition to the Lecompton constitution tion was made when the Kansas-Nebraska bill was pending, and to meet it, I inserted a clause upon a different ground; upon a gronnd that I providing that such Indian reservations as were thought could not be answered —upon the merits not by treaty to be included within the boundaries of tho question, and not upon a technical point as of any State or Territory should not be deemed to a treaty stipulation bemg violated, when the act had no legal effect to deprive anybody of any to be within the boundaries of Nebraska or Kan- sas; but should be excepted therefrom
I suppose right under a treaty
they would have been thus exceptcd if there had Under all these circumstances, i think the op- been no such declaration in the organic act; for ponents of the admission of Kansas now had the simple reason that the Constitution of the better regard the question on its merits, as we did United States has declared that the Constitution I when we opposed the admission under the Lc- language of the eloquent Senator from Illinois, we itself, and all laws and treaties made in pursuance compton constitution
If it bc true that this con- shall be choking a constitution down their throats I of it, Shail be the supreme law of the land, any- I stitution is the act and deed of the people, let-them thing in the constitution or laws of any State to I have it
Senators tell us that there

They have never 1 reckon there are aemån-y: peo- lat.ion enough

•we can only get rid of the dif- ficulty by changing the boundary, or if we except ing the paramount law, the supremo law, no act ple in Kansas now as there were when the Le- of the people of Kansas, by constitution or by compton constitution was made

 446 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 18, than double as many
The president of the Le- compton convention himself did not claim, when that constitution was made, that there were more than from twenty-five to thirty thousand
He furnished a writte'l statement to that effect
The census now shows, how many 
Mr
GRIMES and Mr
DOOLITTLE
One hundred and nine thousand
Mr
DOUGLAS
Three or four times as many as there were when the Lecompton constitution was made
It has as -large a population, appre- hend, asfthere is now in the State of Oregon.
I have not seen the census of that State; but from what i have understood, I should suppose so
This objection in regard to tho want of popu- lation was not deemed quite conclusive and insu- perable when we passed the bill for the admission of Oregon here-two vears acro
I know I had to fight u good muny o
my friends, if I may so call them, on the other side of the Chamber, on the admission of Oregon
My colleague thougl'it it was very wrong to admit Oregon with so small a population
My answer was, that while it was a good rule to require the ratio requisite for a member of Congress, yet we had never adhered 1 •uras willing to declare it a rule fin• to that rule
the future, and live up to it; butl was not willing to make a case, and apply it to onc State, where there were special political and personal reasons for making that objection, and except another State 
to which it ought to be applied with the same ricor and force- I helped to admit Florida into the Union when she had a population of forty-cight thousand, undcr a ratio of representation that required sev- errty-three thousand
I suppose two thirds of the new States of this Union have been adlllitted with less population than Kansas now has
I doubt whether more thun two or three ever had as Inuch
Ohio had nothing like it, probably not more than half; Indiana had about half; Illinois about half; Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Ala- bama, and Louisiana about half
There is DO constitutional limitation as to the munber of in- habitants
While I think it is not right to admit new States with too small a population—thirty or forty, or fifty thousand—yet it has even been done; and certåinly, if the objection was not well taken to a population of forty or fifty thousand, it is not an insuperable objection when there are one hundred and nine thousand
Under these circumstances, I think we had bet- tcr waive thesc small, technical objections, and treat this question on its merits
I think thc people of Kansas have been badly treated with I think reference to this question of admission
thc sooner we close up this controversy the better, if we intend to wipe out the excited and irritated feelings that have grown out of it
It will have a tendency to restore good feeling
It is an act of justice, and I had höped that the bill would pass now unanilnousty
If there is any,dcsirc to add to this the country on the north side of Kansas runnino• up the Nebraska river, I think that would impn•ove its boundaries; and I would bc- verv will- incr to give our assent to it, as we did to extend- ing thc- boundary of Missouri up to the Missouri river, and as we have given our to extend the boundaries of other States, in order to make i am willing to adjust the them natut•al ones
boundaries of a State when the people have made a mistake in its original limits at any time; but that can be done hereafter as well as by procras- tinnting the admission
I will not detain the Sen- ate; but I will do no act that will cripple or pro- crastinate the adrnission of Kansas into the Union
excepted in the constitution, it occurred to mc that the argument of the Senator from Illinois in answer to the objection was enti.rcly satisfactory; and if we had time to refer to the constitutions of several of the States, we should find that thero was the same improvident neglect, not guarded against
When I heard the objection morning that the constitution of Kansas does not save the rights of the Indians in Kansas, I sent for the constitut.ion of the State of New York, (which has been twice revised by conventions—one in 1822, and one in 1846,) 'vvhere there always have been reservations in the occupation of the Indians the reservations are there yet; and the constitu- tion, in either case, forgets to notice that there are either Indians or Indian reservations in the State
They have enjoyed all their rights and immuni- ties, and been protected by the Federal Govern- ment as weH as by the government of the State
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President, there is a vast difföFence between New York and Kansas
New York was one of the •original States which as- sisted to form the Government, and her bound- aries and jurisdiction were the same then that they are now
The Federal Govcrnmcnt had no agency in the formation of her boundary; and to undertake to liken that to one in which we must have an agency, is nota very fair arguinent
The Federal Government never had power to take that land from New York
The Federal Govern- ment never owned that land, and the Federal Gov- crnment never sold that lar)d to the Indians
It was New York land, and New York can do what she pleases with her own
But this land in Kan- Sas beionged to the Federal Government, and was sold to the Cherokees—they paying as a consideration—with the cxprcss stipulation that it never should be included in any State
Now, I wish to put this question: it is either excepted out of the constitution, or it is not; which do I shouRl like to have Senators you say it is
It is cither excepted out of the Con- answer me
stitution, or it is not—I mean the constitution as If it is not excepted out, framed at Wyandotte
arc doing wroncr, unless we put a proper qual- ification in the bill requiring the assent of thc peo- plc of Kansas to it
If it is excepted out, and we make a treaty with thc Cherokees and the Scne- cas, and by their title, where will the boundary If it is excepted out, it runs of Kansas be thcn
around on tho north side
Or do only except our jurisdiction, and leave the boundary included
You must come to these points of' consideration
They are either included in the State, although you may except the jurisdiction, or they are not mc.ludcd in the Slate
If they are included in the State, you violate the treaty
If they are not included in the State, if we Inake a treaty and purchase their lands, thcy• '.vould not be then included in thc State without a subsequent amend- ment to the constitutiorn
the Senator from Illinois savs it is A crain, sir: no more an insuperable objection now than it was I with the Lecompton constitution
That is true; and if my attention had been called to it, I should •I have pressed it then as much as I do now
But the practical effect of it is now being scen and understood
Inasmuch as the boundaries of Kan- sas as a Territory nominally included this land, the white people went out and rushed upon it; and there are from three to four thousand upon it nov.,r
The dragoons of thc United Statcs were scnt down to drive them off
'l'hey burnt some twenty houses; but it raised so much confu.aion and commotion, that the Secretary of the Interior That is the reason 1 propose the amendment
is of a practical character
If you admit the State vvrith the boundary in the bill, the whole of the Indian lands will be overrun; and then, to save the lives of the people, and to prevent i-var, shall be forccd to buy the lands from the Indians; and when bought from the Indians, they will take their preémptions
It will be that much positive injury to the United States; but yet we shall do it, and ought to do it, rather than see our fellow- citizens murdered and butchered
But we ought not to hold out inducements and false light.s to lead them upon these breakers
We ought to of the Six Nations
The Indians are there yet; legislate understandingly; and in no case should we violate a treaty stipulation
I venture to say, that when the Lecompton ponstitution was pend- ing, the subject was never pressed upon the atten- If it was, my attention was tion of the Senate
never called to it
Perhaps it will be said, I stultify I Was myself; it was my duty to look into it
not upon the Comrnittee on Indian Affairs
I had , not examined the Indian treaties
lought to have done it, perhaps; but a man has not time to do everything
Now, with regard to the northern boundary, as I said before—and the Senator from Iliinois agrees with me—it would make it a better bound- ary
If it would make it better, it simply afiirms the statement I made in my few remarks before, to wit: that but for the political considerations, I believe four fifths of this Senate would vote for it
Are we, then , to give wrong boundariés from polit- ical considerations
Ought we not rather to look to the permanent good of the State, and the per- manent peace of the country, in the division of the future States
But the Senator is mistaken when he says it had the same boundarics in the Lecompton con- slitution that it has now
Ile must have meant, I suppose-—for I do not want to do thc Senator injustice—north and south
'Mr
DOUGLAS
The same now in I did not include the western i versy, of course
boundary, about which there is ne controversy
Mr
GREEN
Exactly; but that takes off one third of what l,vas then the Territory, and creates the necessity for supplying that deficiency some- whcrc else
That is the purpose to which I re- ferred
The present boundaries, as propose are plain, sin3ple, and commodious
'I'hey insure a population which will be adequate to suspended the order, and they arc now living Mr
SEWARD
Mr
President, 1 do not in- tend to enter into an examination of the several objections which have been madc by the honor- able Senator from Missouri, further than to say, that last year I had an opportunity to visit Kan- sas, and I found the condition society there very far advanced in agriculture, manufactures, trade, and all social and civil organizations— everything complete, and all within a Territory which was compact and satisfactory to the people I found that in adopting the Wyan- themselves
dotte constitution, they had at last succeeded in acting upon a frame of civil government against which I heard not one word of objection in the whole Territory
So much as to the boundaries and thc constitution
In regard to the alleged danger to t]le reserva- tions for the Indians, which are not mentioned or upon it
One of then'l came to me who had trav- eled four hundred miles to see me
He lived upon the Indian lands, and expended in buildings—a mill, dwelling-house, and so on —not knowing he was upon the Indian lands
He knew he wus within what was nominally caned the boundary of Kansas; and when the dragoons were about to drive them off, he came to me to øet the order suspended, and to see if anything could be done their rclief
This is a practical consequence of the serious difficulties that occur out of this loose, and, to no y mind, very improper legislation
Let us mark the boundaries that wc have a right to mark; and when the people arc informed of where the limita- tions are, they wili never pass over the limits, and nonc of these unfortunate consequences will ensue
sustain a separate State government
As to the subject of what the population '.vas when the Topeka constitution was adopted, and when the Lecompton coristitution was adopted, that is an immaterial issue; and when the Sena- ator refers to Alabama, t6 Florida, and to Ohio, a.} admitted with from thirtv to forty and fifty thousand inhabitants, while Kansas is now rep- resented as having one hundred thousand, he overlooks the fact that the ratio of representation then was down nearly as low as the population
Only a few States came in with less than the ratio of representation
Ohio had the ratio of repre- sentation with her forty thousand
Kentucky had the ratio of representation; Alabama had the ratio of represcntation; Florida had not; so that the force of his argument is destroyed by refer- ring to •the other additional fact that the law of apportionment was different then from what it is now
However, I shall make no point about the pop- ulation; but I "'ill say that this eao•er• anxiety to admit the State in a wrone-» position with an im- proper boundary, at a time like this, is to rne very extraordinary
We have a long petition presented bv the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr
SUMNER,] praying us to relieve them from starvation
How can they support a govern- mont
We have been paying all their expenses
We are now paying their expenses—their Legis- lature, their judges, their Governor, and other offcers—and yet, with all this expenditure from our Treasury, they send up long petitions, and send out agents to beg throughout all the States for means to subsist upon
That is the popula- tion to be forced into the Uniön to bear the burden ofa State government, with improper boundaries, and which arc conceded to be improper
not see any necessity for this hot haste
I no political consideralion to urge it
The Oppo- sition, or rather the incoming Administration, will have
its majority anyhow, and before thc meeti1P of tho nexL Congress, Kansas can be in,  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
with proper boundaries
It will produce no ex- citement, no ill-töeling, no 'jarring or discordant feedings; and why might we not-do what our judg- ment dictates as riffht
Mr
DOUGLAS
One word in regard to the improper boundaries upon which the Senator piaces so much stress
I did not say those bound- aries were improper
So far as the people of Kan- sas themselves are concerned, there is no impro- priety in them, and no inconvenience to those people
There may be an inconvenience to the people of that portion of Nebraska Territory south of the Nebraska river, and the whole incon- venience of not including them in Kansas rests upon the people of Nebraska, and not upw the people of Kansas
Inasmuch as that question of Inconvenience affects that people Only, and not the people within the
limits of Kansas, I arn will- ing to leave that question to be decided by the people themselves
The inconvenience as to the boundary is one not felt at all by people livilp within the present limits of Kansas, but it is con- If those outside desire to fined to those outside
be admitted, I am willing to-relieve them from the If they do not desire it, then I inconvenience
shall take it for granted they are better judges of what is for their convcniencc than I am, and I shall leave them outside
Hence, I do not admit that the boundaries are improper at all In my opinion, it would be wise for the people of that portion of Nebraska to ask for admission into this State; and if they do, I shall be ready to grant it to them
Mr
COLLAMER
1 do not desire to enter into the issue between the gentlemen on that point; but when it is said they have not the amount of • population to entitle them to a Representative, I say, as I understand it, they have
What is tho amount of population required for a Representa- tive now
Ninety-three thousand and a fraction; and that is not only so for the present Congress, but it is so for the next Congress
They have, therefore, now the population- that is required for a Represontative to this Congress, and for the Congress two years to come
NV hether, when we come to choose a Congress next after that, they will come up to what may be required bv I think the apportionment, is another question
it highly probable they will; but at any rate, for to-day and for the-present time, and for the present Congress and the coming Congress, within these boundaries they have the proper population
This su biect of undertaking to make new bound- aribs is worthy of separate consideration
In the first place, the people of Kansas were told, when the Territory was formed, and they went there and settled, that at the proper timc they should bc adlnittcd as a State; I beiievc the exprcssion is, " with or without slavery, as their constitu- tion shall provide." Now, when the time cornes, as it has, and they havo the requisite population, and have
made their constitution, and It is pr0- sented here, they are told, no; you are not to be admitted now, though we told you you should be, unless you add a part of Nebraska." NC- braska was told the very sarnc thing in the very same way; and the proposition novvis to dismenn- ber that Territory without its consent, and even without the consent of the pcoplc that are pro- posed to be included
I do not think it is dealing fairly
It looks as if, come when she may, q.vhat- ever may be the condition of her circumstances, there is all,vays something to object to
It is said, " let them go on; and we will admit them at the and an argument is actually re- proper time;" sorted to by taking the advantage of the misfor- tunes of that people from the drought of this year
Mr
President, the territorial condition is not ,one which it is desirable to extend
It is an un- natural condition in our Govcrnment
That peo- ple have never vet had the advantage of choosing their own government, their own executive, or having their own judiciary
it may bc said, when you come to view it politically, thein- coming Administration may not differ with them I so nu.tc.h in relation to the political character of the and offcers that are set over thein, and they thereby may 110t be so objectionable, still, they ape perfectly willing to forego all that
'Ithey desire to be enabled sorne time or other, and they consider this the -proper time, having the pops ulation, to have the privilege of €roverning them- selves in this country, as other people do
regard these amendments, and the people there cannot but regard them, as really, in effect, mere continu- ations and delays
I have a further remark to make in relation to Nebraska
The honorable Senator from Illinois said he would be willincr to leave that question of annexation to the people south of the Platte river to say whether they would come in
This pres- ent amendment does not provide that at all
But it will be recollected that that question deeply in- terests the rest of the 'I'erritory of Nebraska, whether you may take a part of their people south of a certain river, and let them go where they have a mind , and thus overbalance that Territory itself, and delay, for a great and indefinite period of time, thc chance for their admission, which .has long since been promised
M r
GREEN
I have but one word to say in reply
It is true, under the Louisiana treaty, there was a stipulation that they should be ad- mitted as States—and I presscd this upon the at- tention of Congress two years acro—but the time 'I'he circumstances under was never named
which they were to be admitted depend upon the It is also true; that sound discretion of Congress
the Senator fron) Illinois takes an improper posi- tion, when he says the people of Kansas are sat- isfied with these boundaries, and that ho is willing to put in a portion of Nebraska, if the people of Nebraska are so
•WV hv, sir, when these Terri- tories were organized, there was a special provis- ion put into the territorial bilk, reserving the right to change the boundaries as we pleased; and this matter of shaping the boundaries of new States has always been exercised by Congress, accord- ing to its own volition
But hus Congress ever as- sentcd to the boundary marked out in the Kansas constitution
Not at all
She has shaped her boundary different from what we did the bound- ary of the Territory
Now, as she has made a change, it is perfectly competent for us to make a change; and the only question is, would it be a prudent and a proper disposition of the Terri- tory
I think it is a conceded fact
Do we al- ways go to consult the people of the Territory as to what boundary they shall have
We never do
We have never done so in single instance, whether a previous enabling act has been passed or not

We consider the question of boundary; and if the proposed boundary is such as to meet the disapprobation of Congress, it has been the uniform practice to change that boundary, and resubmit it to them for their approval
If they did not approve it, they did not come into the Union; if they did, they •vverc declared admitted
This would delay the admission of Kansas but a very short tixue
We can so shape this bill as to say, if the people in the Territory assent to it, it shall be the duty of tho Executive to declare that admission into the Union
Such a provis- ion was inserted when lvlissouri was admitted
It will be complete whenever they assent to the propositions that we make
We have taken the responsibility to change their ordinance and their Fl'he House bill does that; propositions for land 
but I do not make any exception to it, for that it was cornpetent to do
The ordinance is no part of the constitution
But when we change any part of the constitution, it must be resubmitted to them, or they do not assent to do as we do
Let us have agreement between the new State and the old thirteen and the existing twen- ty-ninc
Let us have perfect cQncord and har- mony, and not one branch of the Government, the Fedora) authority, insisting upon onc bound- ary and the State insisting upon the other bound* ary
Whose construction will prevail
Flow shall we avoid these Indian conflicts to which have called attention before

We proposed to divide it, that we might indorse Major Anderson, and vote against the residue; whiéh was refused
I revolved it, however, in my mind, giving it all the consider- ation that I could in the brief period allowed be- tween the introduction of the resolution and the time when we were called to vote upon it
I cc:m- cluded that while i could fully and freely indorse the action of Major Anderson, an act justified by th6 laws of self-defense, if not by the orders of the War Department—that which had passed, and which we fully and completely understood— I could not vote to indorse cvery act that the President in the future might regard as his con- stitutional duty, in carrying out the laws and pre- serving the Union, to do
I cannot in advance indorse his acts
'YVhile, sir, I am for the Union, and while in saying that i believe that repre- sent the scntimcnt of Kentucky, I looked npon the action of the southern States as of that mac- nitude that required us at least to pause and hes- itate for a molnent ere we N,vould peril the whole nation, and plunge it into a general conflagration and a general internecine war
I thought that we should hesitate before saying that we would indorse cvery act of the President of the United States for thc purpose of enforcing the laws and carrying out the principlcs of the Constitution
I am not one of t.hose, Mr
Speaker, who believe in the right of a State to secede from the Union
regard that as the greatest heresy that over received the countenance and indorsement of a political party
I approve of the resolution upon that subject, passed by the Legislature of Ken- tuck y in 1833, in which Legislature wore then the wisest of Kentucky 's statesmen, and which is as follows: 5
'I'lläit tbc people of the United States have a deep in- terest in the perpetuity and integrity of the LTni0i), and an iind tbc right of secession, lidoub(.ed right
to preserve it ; asserted hy the ordinance, is not only unauthorized by the Constitution, but is repurnant to its letter and spirit." do not believe, that any State has a constitu- tional riffht to secede; but all must recocynize the right of revolution—the right of submittin(F to the, arbi t t of the sword opp rossion upon onc side , and indcpchdence and freedom upon the other, whenever oppressi01'1 becomes intolerable not believe that {hc time has come in the history of this country when we should resort to means so dreadful, so full of disaster and catastrophe; butl I do believe that it is not right, at the present titne, to send reinforcements to the forts in South Car- olina or the other southern States, but that we should first endeavor, at least, to obtain by com- promiso what, in the end, some may think we will be under the necessity of taking by force
I should not, Mr
Speaker, havo conceived it to be In y duty to havc made this explanation had it 110t been that, from various parts of
my dis- trict., I havc rcccivcd letters from sotnc of the most t rpspectablc of my constituents, saying that in y VOtc aryainst the resolution of Mr

It rescinds a resolution entitled " A resolution relatinø to the claim of George Fisher, latc of Florida, deceased , passed at

The question being on ordering the resolution i to be engrossed and read a third time, Mr
EDWARDS
I ask the attention of the House to this subject
The resolution relates to a private claim; but, unlike our general legisla- tion, which is usually to allow private claims, of  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C
RIVES, WASHINGTON, C
THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, 2D SESSiON
whatever they may be, it is a resolu- tion introduced for the purpose of rescinding a resolution under wfich there has been an at.tempt to get a private claim allowed, which, in the judg- ment of the Committee on India)) Affairs, ought not to be allowed
Its object, therefore, is to save to the public Treasury something more than sixty thousand dollars
The facts aré, these: A resolution was introduced into the Senate at the last session, authorizing the Secretary of War to reexamine a decision w}iich hc had made two vears previously; and if, on that revision, he should think it proper ta increase t.he aHowance to the claimant, to do so
That resolution passed the Senate, and wras sent to this House, where it was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs
It was, in its terms, extraordinary; and, in my judgment, if it should be examined by any mem- ber of this House, in connection with the result, it would be seen that it wus drawn for the express purpose of securing allowances beyond the pre- vious awards and allowanccs, which have no iustification in the history of the case, or in the testimony by •which it was sought to be supnort- ed
Let me say, from information of the most reliable character, that that resolution was not framed in the Senate, but was framed and present- cd to the Senate from outside of Congress; and I presume that it passed tho Senate without any member of that body being aware of its real char- acter
When that resolution cainc to the Com- mittee on Indian Affairs of this House, thcy saw something of its covert character; but they did not suppose that any wrono• was intended, be- cause they had not a knowledge of the facts on which it purported to be based
They thought it proper, however, to report it back with an amend- ment consisting of an entire substitute, havinff nothing of the directory or mandatory character of the Senate resolution, but simply authorizing and requiring a reexamination and a consideration of all the testimony in the case, leaving the Sec- retary of War at liberty to abide by his award as before made, and to allow nothing in addition un- less the justice and equity of the case required i!
STRANGERS ON FLOOR
Mr
SCOTT
Will the gentleman from New Hampshire yield to me a moment
I rise to a pri vileged question
A few moments since there was a friend sitting on this side of the Hall—a Democrat
The doorkeeper—not the gentleman who was clcctcd, but his assistant—sent a page with a notification to him to leave, as he,was in the Hall contrary to the rules
Now, sir, on look- , incr at the other side, I see, in conversation with a rnember fronu New York, a person who is not entitled to the privileges of the floor
Through- out the whole session, Mr
Darling—the assistant doorkeeper, to whom I refer—has invariably al- lowed persons on the floor on the other side, while on this side he will not allow any person to enter
f therefore brand him as acting partially and un- :ustly, actuated by a low, disgusting partiality, unworthy of an omcer and a gentleman
continue this course of removing Democrats on this side and of admitting Republicans on the other side, I shall move his expulsion as doorkeepcr; for hc is not worthy to hold his office, or to come in daily contact with gentlemen
The SPEAKER
Chair is of opinion that the Doorkeeper should cnforce the rules without partiality; and the Chair, so far as it has anythin to do with it, will insist on that
CLAIM OF GEORGE FISHER—AGAIN
Mr
EDWARDS
Mr
Speaker, from California having terminated the interrup- tion he thought it necessary to make, I now te- sume mv remarks
This éubstitute, reported by the committee, was adopted, and was agreed to by the Senate; and under it the Secretary of War has proceeded to act, and has allowed to the claimant in this case, instead of !hc• additional amounts supposed to be claimed, the sum of $66,000 more than hc had allowed in his award made two years before, on precisely the same testimony, and no other, on 29 MONDAY, JANUARY 21, 1861
which he had made that award
This extraordi- nary allowance has not boon paid
The money still remains in the Treasury
When it became known, at the commencement of the present session, that the amount allowed was so much beyond any- thing that was contemplated when this legislation was adopted, it threw a suspicion over the whole transaction
Now, sir, let me say that, when this matter was bcfore the Senate during the last session, the de- bate which took place upon the subject, which is now on record in tbe Congressional Globe, shows that it was stated that nothing more was expected by the passage of the joint resolution than the correction of an error or two, amounting to not more than from two to four thousand dollars
With that statement before us, when at this ses- Sion the fact became known that an award of more thau sixty thousand dollars add.itional had been made at the War Department, it was sufficient to attract attention, and to give rise to the opinion that the award was extraordinary, if nat entirely u n warra n ted
Now, sir, I will, for momen\•, refér to the his- it ißa claim for torv and nature of this claim
I sustained in 1813—forty-s$ven vears ago —for damævycs sustained from depredations of the Indians, tl')en in astatc of hostility ,hnd by appro- priation for tbc use of the troops ofth& United States then encaged in suppressinffsuc.hhoQilities
And, I Mr
Speaker, this matter has been bchn•c Congress It lias been ! from 1813 up to the present time
I before successive
committees, some of which havc reported adversely and some favorably; but no legisla!ion was had upon it until 1848
fn 1848, by the action of both branches of Congrcss, it was referred to the Second Auditor of the 'i'reasury to "I'he Second Au- make an adjudication upon it
ditor, upon cxamination , fou lid that damages had been sustained from both the Indians and troops by this claimant to the amount of about seven- teen thousand dollars
But as by the Itiw under which he acted, he was directed to ascertain how much damage had been sus:ainod by the claimant from the Indians, and how much the troops of the United States, and not to allow anythil')g for the darnage done bv the Indians, but
only so much as had been do•ne by the United States troops, be found due the claimant a sum between eight and nine tllousand dollars, but awarded no interest on the clailn
Subsequently his atten- tion was called to that fact, aud he allowed $8,000 interest; making, in all, $17,000
His attention was again called to the Inat.ter•, and hc allowed #10,000 terest in addition,.making, in all, the sun') of 27 ,000
i state these sums in round n u m bers
-A nother application was made to Congress, and the matter acrain referred to a new Second Auditor, but who did not act
A {rain application was made to Congress, and the Illatter was referred to the Secretary of War for his adj ud ication , with power to investicrate the claim, as if dc noto, upon all the
testimony in the case, including certain deposi- tions, said to have
been rejected by the Auditor, if now authenticated
These depositions had been duly authenticated, and were before him, and the papers in the case show were considered by him with other evidence; and it is to be presumed he gave such effect to then') as he thought they deserved
On this examination, he doubled the allowance which had becn before madc by the Second Auditor
This was in 1858
And now at the last session of' Congress, the joint reso\a- tion, which was first before the Sey)ate, and the substitute for which it is now proposed to repeal, •was carried through the Senate upon the pre- • tense, first, that the amount claimed was small; and, in the second place, upon the ground that the depositions referred to had not been consid- i ered; and that if they were now duly authenti- cated, they should be cohsidered by the Secretary the claim; whereas the in his final adiustrncnt of I fact in the case is, that t tiese depositaon.s were duly authenticateu in 185{_), He-ere before i he Soc- retary in 1858, and were then made a part of the basis of his award
New I now come to the case as it was presented the last- session of Congress
• I have said that the amount was doubled by the Secretary in 1858; In was again referred to the Secretary Of War for his decision
Let it be remembered that the claim had been first.increused from $9,000 to $17,000; then to $27,000; then to $66,000; and now the Secretary of War, in this last award; has increased the aggregate amount to $133,000
Mr
Speaker, during the present session, the Committee on Indian Affairs have gone fully into an examination of the claim
The claimants were heard by them by able counsel at sessions on three several days; the whole merits of thc casc were fully gone into; ail the legislation which hars been had upon the subject from the outset
has been fully considered; and all the testimqny.in the case examined and considered; and the Com- mittee werc unanimous in reporting the resolu- tion which is before the House, for the purpose of rescinding the resolution giving the authority under which the Secretary of War has acted
Now, sir, the question has been raised as to whether this House has the power to rescind this resolution; and upon that point, I am not here to chargc fraud upon the Secretary of War as a cause of rescindment
I do not here undertake to charge fraud against anybody who has had con- nection with the case; but I do undertake to say that it is outside of this House and of Congress that this case has been managed; and I do tan- dertake to say that, if this resolution should be permitted to fail, and the award under the legis- lation of the last session permitted to be carried into effect, the Treasury of this Government will, in my judgment, be plundered of an amount Of morc than $60,000
And I say further, that if the Secretary of •war was honest in making the award which he has made; if everybody con- c.crned in procuring the award has been honest; they have been strangely misled, and have en- tirely misunderstood the purpose of the •resolu- tion and the facts of the case
They could not otherwise have sanctioned this claim to anything like the amount of the award
Now, sir, in relation to the exercise of the power of this House to rescind and nullify the action of the Secretary
It has been said that there is a vested right, that Congrcss cannot rescind this resolution under which thc Secretary has acted, so as to divest this claimant of his right to the payment of the amount of tho award from the Treasury
Well, sir, I do not propose to argue that question here; but I undertake to say, thatno casc can b$ fo•und in which a claim has been en- forced against the Treasury in -the face Of a_law of Congress prohibiting the payment
And- let Ine say further, that in the opinion of the commit- tee, as a suit cannot bc maintained aoainst the Government, and inasmuch as tbc claimant would have no remedy for the payment of this money, if he still insisted upon its paymenp against a posi- tive law of Congress, except by a mandamus from the court, and that, before that writ would be al•- lowed, the court would see to it that its effectwould be to protnotc justice and not injustice—the com- mittee thoughi this repealing act should be passed, and turn the claimant over to the chances of a legal enforcement, if he should persist
The only case that has becn referred to as presenting the action of the courts having any similarity to this, was the issuing of a writ to compel an offcer of the Govornment to discharge an offcial duty de- volving upon him under an existing law of Con- But that was not a case similar to this, I gress
E inasmuch as this would bc a case of commanding an offcer to do an act vrrhich was virtually against an express law of Congress
Now, sir, I knot,v that the House is always impatient under debate upon these matters of a private nature, and havc, therefore, endeavored I have not adverted to be as brief as possible
with any minuteness to the testimony ii the -case
have not adverted perhaps with suffcientaear- ness to aki the details of the historyof the case; but I have made statcmcnts whiéh I think, in connection with the fact
that this measurc receives;  450 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBØ
January 18, the unanimous support ofthc committee in whose behalf I have presented it, will bc suffcient to satisfy any candid man that it should receive the unanimous support of the House
It involves the dcfcatofac!aim for more than $60,000
It is true, this may not be regarded as a large amount in com- parison with many that pass under the consider- ation of this House, or with that of some other private chainis even' which have been allowed by Congress without any semblance of justice or right; but it is surely a large sum in the present state of the Treasury to put into the pocket of any claimaiit, against equity and against right, by any agency of this House
Beyond this, sir, this measure has another and a higher purpose than merely protecting the Treasury in this single case, important as this is
It is intended ns a discouragement to all that class of persons who are lying around this Capitol with specious, plausible, but substantially ground, less claims, waiting their opportunities to secure for them by schemes, inventions, manaffement, and appliances, the sanction of Congress
Sir, while I would have the Government dis- charge scrupulously and promptly all its just ob- ligations, I would have it meet with uniform and stern denial all fictitious and fabricated claims, and all exaggerations of just claims, by whom- soever they might bc preferred, or by whatsoever combination they might be attempted to be sus- tained
Mr

1 should like to hear the report
gannot uuderstand tills from thc reading of the resolution." Mr
EDWARDS
The the being the resolution substituted second extract, •tor thc Senate resolution, and being the resolu- tion now proposed to •be rescinded
The Clerk read, as follows: The joint resolution of 1860 provldcs that the Secre- !try of War is hereby authorized and required to revise his cxecution of the act of Congress, entitled 'An act sup- >lemental an act therein lltentioued,' approved Deceni- aer 22, 1854, required of him by a joint resolution of Con- grcss, approved June 3, 1858, and on said revision to consider and givc effect to all the testimony filed in said ease, including certain depositions formerly rejected by the Lion, but now duly authenticated, and to restate and settle the nccount heretofore stated and settled by him under said gentleman from New Hampshire withdraws his demand for the previous question, perhaps he can enlighten me on some points
Mr
EDWARDS
i am ready to answer any question the gentleman may propound to me
Mr
KUNKEL
1 understood the gentleman to admit that this claim has some fbundation, and that it was ascertained by the First or Second Auditor, after three or four specific examinations, that tlH2re was something due to this claimant
Mr
EDWARDS
That has all been paid
Sixty-six thousand dollars has already been paid on this claim, while the original claim, for all dam- ages, was only for $15,000
The demand for the previous qucstion was sec- onded, and the main question ordered; and under the operation thereof, the joint resolution was ordered to bc engrossed aid read a third time; and being engrossed, it was accordingly read the third time, and passed
Mr
EDWARDS moved to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was adopted; and also moved that the motiön to reconsider be laid upon the table
The latter motion was agreed to
LIVINGSTON, KINCAID & CO
State of South Carolina have seized the custom- house in the city of Charleston; they have Clösed that port, and prevented the United States from the exercise of its conceded exclusive power of collecting the revenue from imports
They have taken, by force, money from t.he Treasury of the United States, and applied to their own use.
They have seized the arms and munitions of war of the United States deposited in arsenals within the conceded exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and turned them against tho Arrny of the United States
They have seized the rev enue and the property of Lhe United States
'I'hcy have seized a loyal citizen of the United States engaged in the discharge of his duty, imprisoned him, and threatened his life, for the exercise of a plain constitutional duty, charging him with trea- son against the State of South Carolina
They have taken citizens of different Statcs, rightfully and peacefully attending to their business, insulted them, inflicted the most degrading indignities upon -them, and then forcibly expelled them
They have raised a military force of artillery, cav- alry, and infantry, Wilh the avowed purpose of cxpellirv, or, to use their own chosen word, co- ercing, tile United States from the forts, arsenals, Mr

AR.hfY APPROPRIATION BILL
Mr
SHERMAN
1 move that the rules be suspended, and the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
'I'he question was taken; and the motion was ao•rccd to
T hc I-louso accordingly resolved itself' into tho Committee of the Mllhole on the state of the Union, (Mr
SVA$IIBURNE, of Illinois, in thc chair.) CHAIRMAN stated that the
business forc the committee was the Army appropriation bill; and that on that business the gentleman from Ohio [Mr
PENDLETON] was entitled to the floor
Mr
PENDLETON addressed the committee for an hour
[His speech will be publ.shcd in the Appendix
I Mr
SHERMAN
Mr
Chairman, 1 have ened with respect and attention to all that has fallen from rny colleague, [Mr
PENDLETON.] Much that he has said I approve; but it seems to me that instead of appealing to this side of he House forconciliation, kindness, and forbear, ce, he should appeal to thÖse around him, who lone provoke the excitement now prevailing n this country, He says the Army should not be used o coerce n State
by this he Incans that the Army should not be used to conquer n State, to compel her to be represented, to maintain the courts or post ofiiccs within her limits, to burn her cities or dcs- I do not olate her fields, ho is entirely correct
l)elieve that any Administration will pursue such a policy
But, sir, we have a Government, a •-yreat Government, to maintain
It is supreme within the powers delegated to it; and it is pro- vided with ampleauthority to protoctitsclf against foreign or domestic enemies
It has the exclusive It is the ex- right-to collect duties on irnports
clusive owner of forts, arsenals, navy-yards, ves- It has a flag, tho gels, and munitions of war
symbol of its nationality, the emblem of its power and determination to protect all those who may of right gather under its folds
It is our duty, as the representatives of Ibis Government, to main- tain and defend it in the exercise of its just I powers
Has it trespassed upon the rights of a single individual
Does any citizen of South resolution, and to make sueh corrections in his said former Carol complain that this Government has done ntatement and settlenlent, and such further allowances, if 
i i him wrong
No man can say that
The Gov- beön allowed and paid, as, in his opinion, justice to the ernment for years has been in the hands of the Democratic party, controlled chiefly by southern claimant shall require." N'lr
KUNKEL
I think we had better have citizens, They have controlled its power and the whole report of the Committee
on Indian Af- patronage; and now, when the Republican party I fairs read to the House
Iam not familiar enough about to assume the reins, they seek to subvert it
They organize revolution under the name of with the merits of this case to vote on it at this time
I am not permitted to propound any question, the secession
previous question having been demanded
if the h What have they done
The people of the and other property still in the possession of the United States
When Major Anderson, for the safety of his small force, removed it from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, they seize4 Fort Moul- trie, Fort Pinckney, and other property
More recently they fired upon a vessel in the employ of the United States, conveying reinforce- in this act ments and provisions to our troops
of war, they used the cannon and munitions of war paid for out of our Treasury
Forts ceded by the State of South Carolina to the United States were used to expel a vessel of the United States in the pursuit of its lawful commerce
When the " star-spangled banner" was hoisted to her mast-head, as a sign of nationality, appealing to all the patriotic recollections which cluster around it—your flag, my flag, the flag of Virginia, of Ohio, of Kentucky, of Massachusetts, the flag of every State and of the whole Union, the rustle of whose folds has so often excited the pride patriotic ardor of Americans in every part of the habitable globc—that flag, invoked for the protec- lion of an unarmed vcssel, carrying provisions to our own troops, was fired upon and disl)onored
An act of war by citizens of the United States, and therefore an act of treason, was applauded by 0M- cers and citizens of that State, and perhaps by these of other States
It was not an act of war against you and me merely, but against every loyal and patriotic citizen of this great Republic
Up to that moment we had done nothing
This Government has been more quiet, more com- placent, under this series of' offenses, than any Government instituted since the foundation of governments
And now, Mr
Chairman, the same lawless vio- lcnce is breaking out in other parts of the coun- try
Forts, arsenals, navy-yards, and vessels of war, intrusted without defense to the patriotism of the people, have, upon one pretext or another, been seized, and are now held by lawless force
Upon the recommendation of members of Con- gress, Fort Pulaski was seized by troops, under an order from the Governor of Georgia
I sup- pose there is not a member upon the other side who will declare that it would be given up peace- fully to the troops of the IJnited Siates if it were demanded by our national authorities
More re- cently sli\l, the navy-yard at Pensacola was taken by an armed force, under the order of the Gov- crnor of Florida
I have here a telegraphic dis- patch sent to this Government: appointed by the January 12, 1861 ' vernor of Florida, with a regiment of anned men at the emanded the surrender of this navy-yard , having pre- vio taken possession of one of the magazines
ren ered the place and struck tny flag ai half past one o'elock, p
m
, this day." Here, then, is the Governor of one State, the weakest of all, with a regiment of armed men, who goes to a navy-yard of the United States, having first seized the magazine containing gunpowder and muniments of war—who goes with this armed force to a navy-yard in the charge ofa captain of the United States Navy, and demands possession
Then the flag of your country and of mine is lovvr- ered to lawless force
Mr
Chairman, suppose Great Britain, suppose France, suppose all the Powers of the world com-  1861, THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
451! bined, had thus outraged the flag of the United • States: would not every one of us have demanded menand money to wipe out the indignity, and to repel further like assaults, at whatever hazard
Yet, sir, the'Governor of Florida, before the State of Florida had seceded, goes with an armed force, seizes upon our property, and turns the guns of the people of the United States aoainst the Army I am also and the Navy of the United States
told—witli what truth I do not know—that can- non are planted upon the banks of the Mississippi river, at or near the city of Vicksburg, in the State of Mississippi, and that our steamboats are nowr coinpelled to land there and to give an account of themselves
We do not know at what moment they may be subject to tribute and seizure
To whom 
To the State of Mississippi
I agree with all my colleagues from the State of Ohio, from both sides of this House, that there is one thing immutable—a law that is a higher law
It is, that the Mississippi river, gathering all the rivulets of the Northwest into one current, must be permit- ted to float our commerce uninterrupted and un- trammeled to the sea, or thousands of men will float down upon its waters and make it free
Mr
BRANCH
The gentleman from Ohio will allow me to ask him whether the statement he has iust made is founded upon any good authority 
•can he inform this House authoritatively that cannon have been planted upon the banks of the to control the navigation of that Mississippi, Mr
SHERMAN
I can only respond, that what I have stated I saw in thc newspapers of the I have already declared that have no of'- •fic.ml information upon the •subject
I know from private information that citizens of Ohio, enoag •d m lawful commerce—men of political opini0!, like
those professed by you, (Mr
BRANCH] —have been detained in the State of Louisiana until y could send back to Ohio for proof that they had not voted for Mr
Lincoln
As this was an act of lawless violence, not sanctioned by a State, I arrai(yn no one foe it
Mr
BRANCH
The will allow me I,will tell tho gentleman from Ohio, still further
what we all know very well, that there are many things in the newspapers which afterwards turn ou t to be untrue
There is now no gentleman upon this floor from the State of Mississippi who can give accurate and reliable information as to the circumstances referred to by the gentleman from Ohio; and i wish simply to say to him that the gentlemen around me, those who are in the best position to know whether this fact is true or I'10t, ure of the opinion that it is without foundation, and entirely untrue
Mr
SHERMAN
I hope that it may not bc true
I trust to find that It is entirely without foundation
Air
CRAWFORD
Let me word to the gentleman from Ohio
I presume that the whole of this statelnent which has gone out into the press of the country about cannon having been planted upon the banks of the Mississippi river may have grown out of the futt that there s•vas some appre- hension on the part of the peoplc dwelling upon that river that General Scott was preparing to send down a large force for the purpose of com- mencing an invasion into the southern States from Ido not some point in the State of Mississippi
know that cannon have been planted; but if there has been, then it has been done for their protection I would do so were I in their place, and defense
apprehending such an invasion
Mr
SHERMAN
stated that 1 found the fact in the newspapers of the day; and upon the newspapers we have to rely until we are, fur- nished with offcial information
It is certain that our flag has been fired into; that the property of the United States has been seized; and that the guns of the United States have been turned against the people and the shipping of the United States
It is certain that acts of war have been committed by the State of South Carolina
No one doubts, suppose, that the forts at the mouth of' tho Mis- sissippi are in the possession, not of tho troops of the United States, but troops that will resist the troops of the United States
There is no doubt that Baton Rouge has been seized; no doubt, sir, that act after act of war hps been repeated
I ask you, as the Representatives of a brave people, what shall we do
The question is not, shall we coerce a State
but shall we not defend the prop- erty of the United States against all enemies, at home or abroad, here or wherever the flag of our country •floats 
Must this Government submit to insult and in- dignity
Must it surrender its property, its flag, its nationality
Do you, gentlemen from Vir- ffinia, whose great statesmen had so large a share in laying the foundations of our Government, de- sire to see it thus dishonored
Are you ready to join excited men, who will not listen to reason; who even spurn your patriotism as timidity; who reject your councils, and who would drag you as unwilling victims at the heel of their car of Jug- gernaut, crushing under its weight all hope of civil liberty for ages to come
Arc you aroused into madness by political defeat
Mr
HILL
Will the gentleman allow me a moment
Mr
SHERMAN
1 never decline to yield
Mr
HILL
I think I know the feelings of the honorable gentleman well enough to know that the question I am about to ask will not be decmed offensive
I desire to ask him whether hc thinks that it is wholly incompatible wiLh the dignity of our great country that conciliation should be had with these parties that have so grievously offended, according to his argument, by the cap, ture of these forts
Must these acts be expiated by blood, before any terms of accommodation can be had
Mr
SHERMAN
My friend fi•ofn Georgia, whose patriotic feelings I know ond appreciate, well knows that I do not bring this matter for- ward for the purpose of adding to the excitement, but for the purpose of showing that the argument was not stated correctly by my colleague, [Mr
He said that we threatened to PENDLETON.] coerce a State; that toe were about to inauo•urate civil war; that we were devising means to march down upon and conquer South Carolina
My argument is, that South Carolina is not coerced; but that she is coercing this great Government; that she is 'coercing all the border slave States; that she is leading them by wild fanaticism, and by the community of interests, to take a step which I do not bclieve Virginia, or North Caro- lina, or Maryland, or any of the border States, would take, in the light of and cool reason
I do not wish to be misapprehended
I do not wish to have it supposed that 1 would makc x.,var upon any people of common blood and conunon heritage afd common name; but I do say that it is your duty, gen tlemel') of the southern States, your duty, ni),' friend from Georgia, to see to it that if Lhis Government is to be dissolvcd,at least we should prcscrve the honor of our flag until hostile sections—not insignificant States—lead the van
Mr
CLEMENS
Will the gentleman allow me one word 
Mr
SHERMAN
Certainly
Mr
CLEMENS
want to say a few words only
Mr
SHERMAN
very well; go on
Mr
CLEMENS
The course of South car- olina toward Virginia has not only been marked as the gentleman from Ohio has characterized it, but her Governor declared in his message that Virginia must be dispensed with; that South Car- olina must act without her, because she holds the Union above the Constitution; and nox.vVirginia is called upon to intcrposc to save a State from the just indignation of the people of the United States, which, in the inauvuration of a revolution like this, could fix a stigrna such as that upon a sister State of the Confederacy ! Mr
LEAKE- Will the gentleman Ohio permit me for one mornent
Mr
SHERMAN
1 trust the gentleman will not consider me discourteous if I decline to do so at this point
Sir, it was but the other day that I was told by a distinguished citizen of an absolute monarchy— and the rernark made a deep impression upon Iny mind—that he deplored the events now transpir- around us; that he deplored what he consid- cred the inevitable fall of this Republic; but, said it wili stop for- he, one good will result from it: ever the struggle for free institutions in Europe it will estabiis"h upon a secure basis the existing Governments of the Oid World
i felt that
the remark was true
If this Government cannot sur- vive a constitutional election; if we cannot defend our property and protect our flag; if this Govern- ment crumbles before the first sign of disaffecLipn,
what hope is there for free, insut.ütiqns„ in e-oüiik
tries where kings and nobles 'and niårshals: and: hereditary institutions and laws of pirhogeniture have existed for ages
Sir, when in the love to liberty has inspiréd the massé$ people to demand the right o
they have been, pointed to the French ræ+dfü:tioii» of and to South America, where Changing Republics rise and disappear so rapidly' not ten men in this House can tell mé theiÉ names
They have been pointed also to Mexico
God forbid that the despots of the Old World shOUld ever adorn their infernal logic by pointilig_- to a disrupted Union here! It was said, withapoet.s license, that— Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell." Sir, freedom will die with the fall of this Re- public
Those who survive the first calamity will find springing into existence military despotisms North, Söuth, East, and West
Instead pf t.wo divisions, there will be many divisions
Thecon- dition of this country will be worse than that Of Mexico, because we are a braver, a strover, a more powerful people, and shall fight each other with greater tenacity
If this Government is die-
solved, thc man now lives who will be the Na- poleon of some section of this Republic
All his- tory teaches us that a free Government is never broken up and disrupted unless a military des- potism of force is substituted for the will of the people; and we have no right to suppose that our country will be an exception to the general rule
Mr
Chairman, I appeul in all candor to the Representatives of the border States to arrest the tidc that, but for you, will in few days place us in hostile array with each other
I know that the movements in the cotton States have gone so far that we cannot arrest thern
I appeal to the Representatives of the border States to arrest the progress of this storm for a little time, at least, Let us see whether there is any hope for peace and conciliation, If there is not, then, if we can- not agree, leg us fi"ht; but if we can aoree, let us do it like men, and not be hurried off by wild and insane feelings of rage and disappointment by the woakest State in this Confederacy
Sirs, if you do, peace will again smile upon our country
if you do not, I see nothing bat civil war before us
My colleague may paint in beautiful language-the blessings of peace; and cry " peace ! peacc ! when there is no peace;" but, Mr
Chairman, you arid I see already rising in the West, where military feeling is so rife, a spirit which will not brook much longer the insults already cast upon the flag our country
I do not threaten; for I dread— not for you and me, or the members of this House, for I suppose we have the ordinary courage of our race; we are but atoms in the storm—but thousands and millions of men, like us, will re- gret the day when this Government was hurried into revolution, without opportunity for parley or delay
If your people will not aid the Gov- ernment in maintaining the public property in the seceding States, then we must do it in spite of you, or perish in the attempt
We must -not allow the Government to crumbleat our feet
You can arrest this movement, and you alone can do I ask you, gentlemen from Virginia and the it
South, does not your blood boil with indignation when you read of the surrender of our forts and the dishonor of our flag
Are they not yours as well as mine
Has the feeling of sectionalism become stronger than the love of cdåntry 
I ask if
the same patriotism wl')ich brought your fathers and mine into common battle-fields, amid all the storms of the Revolution, does not now rebel when you are forced into a civil war by the mad- ness ofa few men in the southern States
Sir, I do not believe it
For the moment, under the smart of imaginary wrongs, under the disappoint- ment of political defeat, your people may be hur- ricd into acts of madness; but when returninø reason comes, woe be to thosc who have led them astray! Then a single wave of the star-spangled banner will silence the
miserable party cries with which you havc misled them
Let us not deceive ourselves with the idea that this Government can be broken upon Mason and Dixon 's line, or upon any other line, without in- volving us in all we dread
There is no man, with a head to reason and a heart to feel, who 'does not shudder at the idea of civil war
Do you suppose that this Government can be divided in two,  452 according to thc plan of the gentleman from Vir- ginia, [Mr
GARNETT,] with this Capitol, with the mouth of the Mississippi, with the Tcrritories, and the thousand things that divide us, without provoking civil war
Why, sir, we may do all we can to prevent it; we may throw ourselves into the breach; we may stand up and yield every- thing, or cringe down and yield everything; but I tell you that will not
stop the surging Waves
If this Government is divided, though we may agree to separate in peace—though every man here may sign the bond—we know that events hur- riedly running forward will bring these two sec- tions in hostile array against each other; and then, I know what a war is there, my countrymen 
that your southern people are bravo, spirited, ac- tive, quick; no man doubts that.; but
if' you have had any Inisapprehension about the northern peo- ple=if you suppose that, because they are cold, bccause they are not fired by your hot blood, they will not perform their duty everywhere, you are very much mistaken
We arc the equals of each other; we are of the same blood, the same parcnt- acre, the same character; your warun sun has quick- encd your blood, but our colder climate has steadied the intellects and braced the of our peo- I again repeat, Mr
Chairman, that we should not allow ourselves to be deceived by words
I T hc question is not whether the United States will coerce a State, but whether State shall co- erce the Government; whether this noble fabric, devised by our fathers, shall fall without a blow
I appeal to you again; I appeal to the Represent- a•tivcs of ali the States, whether we shall allow Fort Sumter, the only place where our flag floats in the harbor of Charleston, to be su rrondered at NEVER! NEVER! Even discretion
if to-tnorrow I should vote to o•ive South Caro- lina license to leave the Confideracy, if I had the power; yet, while that flag floats, it is the bounden and sacped (l itty of this Government to protect it against all ies, and nt all haza rds
1 had fondly hoped, while we disagreed, while I knew that our disa trcecrncr)t
was and decided, that you, crentlenu•n ot t would yourselves take the load in t.he defense )ropert.y and cur honor; of our had hoped that, while we '•,vere discuss- intr, you would insist
u l)on the protection of' the property of the Unitcd Slates, aud that, our flag should nol bc dishonored until we separa ted, ill peace or in war
I was much fit,ruc.k I)'V a rounu•k )nud'e the other day by the Senator from Mississippi, [Mr
Davrg,) t.l')at if we could acrree with each other, we ought to separate in peace—that we should take this old flag, and fold it owuy, and keep it as a much-loved mo- Blit, sir, we cn n do tl'lat mento for us all

I was surprised that my colleague [Mr
PEN- DLF,'I'ON] did not vote for the C) fl*ered by jor Anderson
I that the Ohio' delegation would unite in favor of resolution
I think my colleague were but two exceptions
t•rorn the I)ayton district [Mr
V ALLANI)IGIIAM] the negative; and n) y colleague who voted in made such an cloquent speech for peace to-day did not vote on the passage the resolution, but voted againstsuspendingthc rules
I was surprised that tiny onc from Ohio should vote against it
I '•,vas still more surprised, allow Ine to sav to the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 18, cheerfully vote for u part of that resolution, they could not sustain the last part of it, which they feared committed them to measures of coercion by the Federal Government arrainst sov.ercign States of this Confederacy
The Kentucky del- egation—at least a portion of them, including my- self—differ from the gentleman of Ohio as to the structure of this Government, and as to the foun- dation upon which it was erected; and hence we may well differ fundamentally as to what it may become the duty of t,he Government, under a given state of the case, to pursue towards seced- ing States; but, so far as Major Anderson is con- ccéncd, uninformed as he was of any am•eed status between South Carolina and the Federal Government, we not only approved of his course in removing to Sumter, but we honored and ud- mired in him even still more that calnl states- manship and patriotism which allowed him not to return the fire when South Carolina opened herbatteries upon the Star of the West
We honor that noblc forbearancc upon the part of the brave soldier, and consider ita sparkling crem in his bril- liant coronet of valor and fidelity
Mr
SHERMAN
1 am very indeed, Mr
Chairman, to hear the gentleman from Kentucky say even as mucl'l as he has done
But if hc main- tains the course of Major Anderson •in removingr to Fort Sumter, I ask him now what will he dB with Major Anclcrson there
Will he allow him to bc girdled around with forts and barricades tili he is slarved out like a rat
Mr
STEVENSON
No, sir
The State of South Carolina has, I rejoice to learn, opened her rnarkets, and given to Major Anderson his postal facilities
So far as courtesies go, they have been restored to N'laior Anderson
No reinforcements are necessary for his comfort or safety now
It was by the foresight, the pru(lcnce, tho states- mauship of Major Anderson , which kept him from firin'Y, in o rdeé to prevent civil war, that even the bare hope of preserving this Union under the Con- and with its o•ua rantees, is left us
st it u tion , BLit if the course intimated by thc gentleman from • Ohio had been pursued, and if' N'lüjor A riderson —as the centlernan s at•tnunont, would seern to imply he shoni(l have done—fired on Charles- this rnonu•nt civil ton, we should have had at war, without the least hope of preserving the Union, or even reconstructino• it under our blessed Constitution
Mr
SHERMAN
Mr
Chairman, not said, and the gentleman frmu Kentucky cannot Ene say, bhat Major Anderson should l)avc fired upon Charleston
'The gentleman ought not to have done nle that injustice, especially while ho was spoaking by my courtesy
I do not know what Major Anderson should have done
I will not give my opinion on il until I sce what t.l'le facts were
I Inay say that impulse would have l)eon to returl') the fire
of Fort Morris, or Fort Moultrie, or any other fort, or any other can- 11011 that fired upot') the flag of' the United States
_But I did give any opinion on this point; and certainly I would not have required [Viajor Ander- , in vindicating the honor ot• his flag, to have fired on the men , women, and children ofthc city of Charleston
The very resolution referred to by the gentleman from Kentucky, an extract from which I havc now before rno., expresses only those
plain axioms acrainst which i do not
see how any tnem- ber could have voted
My friend snys he would have voted for that part of [he resolution approv- ing the conduct of IVIaior Anderson, but that he Representatives of Keritucky, that, '.vhen their could not vote for other' portions of' it
What por Is it that point in which X,ve express our tions
own gallant son had but performed his bounden determination to maintain that fearless officer in duty they should have refused to vote to sustain and in all conslitutional his present position, hitn in his removal from Fort Moultrie to the rneasures t.o en force the laws and preserve the point in his Mr
STEVENS()N
Will the gentleman allow Union 
" Why could not thc gel')tlcman vote for me to say word 
Mr
STEVENSON
For the simple reason Mr
SHERMAN
Oh, yes
that I do not know what might be, in these stir- Mr
STEVENSON
Mr
Chairman, T do not ring and startling tin•ues, regarded by any Adrninis- suppose that the're is a man of any party, or from Again, sir, the gentleman has applauded Major Anderson
Major Anderson saw that flag so eloquently eulogized by the gentleman and so dear to us all struck down
He saw the Star of the West, with thatensig'n unfurled, fired upon
Why did he not return the fire
It was not that he loved the flag less, but his country more
His patriotic heart was big enough to brook the as- sumed indignity rather than Involve his country in civil war
By such a coursc he differed wholly with the gentleman from Ohio
I honor the gal- lant soldier for it
His native Common wealth honors him; and good and patriotic men must always honor him for a prudence excelled only by his valor, which saved his whole country from civi} war
No man will go further than It must be a Union will to preserve this Union
I will join hands with any man, of of equals
any party and from any section, in efforts to pre- serve such a U Ilion
And I believe Maior Ander- son would do his part in so how a work
He knows, as we all know, it can only be preserved by compromise and concession ; and this can only be reached by peace

There are no disunionists in Kentucky
Her gal- lantanddistinguished Senator tenders, in her name, the olive branch of peace in the propositious he has presented
Why will not4he gentleman and his friends accept them, and restore peace to a distracted country
Let them not be deceived ! Much as Kentucky is devoted to the Confederacy, great as are the sacrifices she is prepared to make and has rrrade for it, she will cling to no Union upheld by force; and in which she is not a recognized equal

in practice, southern men have had a great many more rights than northern men have had
I am glad to know that the gentleman from Kentucky does not disagree with me so much as to the views declared in the resolution , as hc does in regard to somc inferences which he feared somebody elsc might, in these constitutional times, draw from the resolution
The resolution simply expresses a desirc to enforce thc laws and to pre- serve the Union—no more
I am willing to stand on this platform
I can joil'l heartily with all those who made that pledge, whatever else they may think or believe about the questions that divide If we can stand by each other, if our people
our constituents will stand by us in that emphatic declaration, I do believe thc good sliip that has borne us thus far on a prosperous voyage will outlive the storm
But, sir, if we yield too far to the fury of tho if we now surrender with- out resistance the forts, arsenals, dock-yards, and other property of the Government, we ouly dem- onstu•atc that we arc not fit for the duties assigned us; and, if our names survive our times, they wili only be recorded as those of a degenerate ra9e, who had not the manhood to preserve what their fathers won

Mr
LEAK E
Will' the gentleman permit me to ask him a question 
Mr
SHERMAN
1 the gentleman will I have been already led from the not ask mc
course of my remarks through interruptions
I do not mean any discourtesy to the gentleman
Mr
LEAKE
Then the gentleman from Ohio denies me the courtesy which I ask, and denies such courtesy to nobody else
Mr
SHERMAN
repeat that I do not want to be discourteous to the gentleman, and I wili allow hir-n to proceed
Mr
LEAKE
The gentleman from Ohioquotes not the language exactly, but substantially the language of a man who lived in the county in which I was born, who died there, and is buried there—Thomas Jefferson
His language was, that it was the duty of all parties to the compact to obey the Constitution and the laws of the land
And now I demand to know of the gentleman from Ohio, whose high character and high intelligence will enable hirn to answer me, whether Ohio, his own State, is noL now in open rebellion agaunst the Constitution and laws of the United States 
demand to know whether she has not passed a law which violates thc Constitution aud laws of the United States in undertaking to violate the, fugitive slave law; and whether her Governor has not, on solemn requisition of the Governor of Virginia, refused to surrender a man, not be

Mr
SHERMAN

I am here to de- I say it is not so
On the fend my naiive State
contrary, Governor Dennison refused to respond to the requisition in the case alluded to simply because the papers showed on their face that the alleo•ed criminal never was in Virginia
'They were based upon a mere constructive presence, a doctrine under which a citizen of Ohio, in Ohio, may be dragged to Virginia for trial for au act lawfulinOhio
Governor Dennison gave the same decision that has been sanctioned by too courts of the southern States; and in strict acccordance with the common-law priilciple that an accused shali be tried where the offense is committed
Neither in the case alluded to of the difficulty between Ohio and Kentucky, has any right of' Kentucky been violated
Governor Dennison fol- lowed the
decision of the Governor of Kentucky, CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

Mr
Chairman, the Gov- ernor of Ohio has himself spoken in his recent message, and I can only refer to that message
He has fully maintained, justified, and defended his action in this matter
Now, I trust, as so much of my time has already been taken up by these interruptions, that I shall be permitted to go .on without giving way to any gentleman further

If the objection to exterd- ing time is withdrawn, I will repeat what I said, and my colleague can reply to it
I simply said I regretted that Ohio was not unanimous upon the subjectöf the resolution indorsing Major An- (lerson 's conduct; and that one of my colleagues, the gentleman from the Dayton dtstrict, [Mr
VALLANDIGHAM,] voted against it, and thatanothm• colleague was not
present to votc, Mr
VALLANDfGHAM

I *hould so vote again; but if the res- olution h.ad been divided, and if I had known what I eun now informed to true—that the Ex- ecutive of the Federal Government did not dis- close to Nfaior Anderson, as hc ought to have the acreetnent 01' understanding between him and the authorities of South Carolina, or with members of Congress from that State—I would have most cheerfully votcd to indorse the wise act of Major Anderson; w Ise and prudent, cer- tainly, judging of it from a military point of view, and acting as he did act, without, knowledge the atrreernent to which I have referred

Mr
SHERMAN
Now, 1 trust gentle- men will see that cannot extend to them furiher indulgence,- but that I shall be Permitted to go on and finish what I have to say
Under the grave responsibility upon which we I feel it to be my duty to you, to my are acting, fcllow-members, and to my countrymen, North and South, to say frankly, that in voting for this Aymy bill, I vote with the expectation that the Army will be used in protecting the acknowl- edged property of the United States, in recover- ing that which has been unlawfully taken, and in maintaining thc Union
it may be said that the gravity of the events that surround us demands a greater forcc than is provided by this bill
The regular Army is a mere, skeleton
The present force will scarcely defend our frontier from Indian incursions; but it forms a nucleus capable of any reinforcement demanded by the exigencies of the times
I do not contemplate, in any event, hostile invasions of the soil of any State, unless deman@d for the defense of the ackl')owledged property of the Uni- It is the duty of the Government to ted States

•we can no longer talk about the weakness of the old confederacy or anarchy of Mexico
Sir, we owe it as the most sacred of duties to put down this heresy
If it now fortifies itself by sectional animosities, if it rises from party rebellion to sectional and civil war, still it must and will be met with determined resistance
Upon this point, am glad to say, the people of Ohio are united, if the unanimous voice of the Legisla- ture of that State is a true indication
Again, I say, what is the uso of concession, conciliation, or compromise, when, if we yield everything you demand, you cannot say to us: " It will save us from disunion" or war
Are we not in danger of quarreling about terms of conciliation, when traitors are overthrowing the Government we wish to preserve
Are we not dividing ourselves for their benefit
What will satisfy South Carolina and Florida and Missis- sippi and Alabama
They want' disunion, and not compromise or conciliation
The Democratic party would not agred to their terms, and they seceded from the Charleston and Baltimore con- ventiöns
Is it lilcely that we will yield what our nörthern Democratic friends could not yield

Mr

1 say again to the gentle- man from Georgia, that I hold the floor by unan- imous consent, upon the terms that I should not yield
i say agam, Mr
Chairman, that [do not believe any terms which our people could yield and preserve their own self-respect would satisfy South Caro*ina, Florida, or some of the other soutlmern States, because they are bent upon dis- unron
We know that gentlemen who represented South Carolina on this floor, if the newspapers correctly report them', declared in the Charlestq„n convention, held recently, that they had brooded this matter for long years, and that they over only sought an opportunity, an occasion—or, if i mav use the word, a the secession drew Jackson and»John C
Calhoun
We know that, in 1832, the doctrines upon which this revo- lution is going forward were initiated, and from that time the young men of South Carolina have been educated in the school of disunion
They have cherished those doctrines in•their innermost hearts
All tho concessions we might make, all the compromises we could agree to, all the offer- ings of peace we could make for the salvation ot• this Union, would not be able to secure that de- sired end, if South Carolina could prevent it
Again: we mi2ht on this side properly say we have done nothing to impair any constitutional right
We propose to do nothing to infringe yours
We havo succeeded in a constitutional way in electing a President of the United States
All we ask is that he may be inaugurated in peace, and may develop his policy in the usual manner
We can add that this is thc demand of all our people, not only of those who voted for Mr
Lin- coln, but of every loyal citizen
You teli us your people are excited and alarmed, that they appre- hend that an overwhelmintr anti-siavct-v element is about to be inaugurated in power that will di- rectly or indirectly affect the constit•v.uonal rights of vour Stat.es
Perhaps you will confess, what you know to be true,' that for political purposes, in the strug- gle of partisans for asccndency, both parties in the South have united to fire the southern mind against the hated Black Republicans of the North 
Speeches have been distorted, single sentences havc been torn from their context and made to deceive and mislead
Garrison, Wendell Phil- lips, Seward, Lincoln, and latterly Douglas, have been mixed in a hatcd conglomerate, and used to excite your people
A philosophic opinion of Mr
Seward has bcen construed as the statement of a settled purpose to overthrow slavery in thc Statcs, although in the very paragraph itself all idea of interference by the people of thc frec States with slavcr.y in the slave States is expressly excluded
It is but a year since you inflamed your constitu- cnts bccause {$01nc of your fellow-members rec- on-nnendcd, without reading, a book written by one of your own citizens, containing obnoxious opinions slavery

You have all contributed, more or less, in perverting thc pub- lic mind as to our principles and purposes
And I tell you, gcnt.lcmcn, that when you call the Re- publican party an Abolition party in thc sense in which you use t.he word abolition; when you quote from Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and from like extreme •rnen, and circulate their opinions all over thc Sontl), tellil')g the people of your States that the people of the North have been educated in these son linnent.s, profess them, and are going to put down slavery in the States, you do a m•cat injusticc to tbc intelligence and the safety of your I have heard hcrc, over and over again, this coarse of agitation, pursued only the other day in the Senate of the United States
Mr
DOUGLAS— I beg pardon, the Senator from Illinois—quoted from onc of the speeches of Mr

Sir, in this time when the peoplc of the sout.hern States are in a stortY1 of excitcmentßhat speech of the Senator from Illinois is sent ovcr those States as tending to show that Mr

Mr

The gentleman from Ohio is mistaken when he says that the Senator from Illinois misquoted the speech of Mr
Lincoln
Mr

1 have not said that Mr

Lincoln the benefit of his disclaimer and explanation
Mr
McCLERNAND
Will the gentleman say that what Mr

Lincoln 
Mr

That is a matter for others to judge of
Mr
HILL
I hopc the gentleman from Ohio will yield to the gentleman from Illinois
Mr
SHERMAN
1 decline to yield any fur- I would yicld were it not that I have 'Tiven my word to go on without further interruption
Sir, the baptism of misrepresentation through which this Republican party has thus far ad- vanced, does not excuse us from doing all in our power to produce conciliation, hartaony, peace, quiet, a fair and honest adjustment of ali the dif- ficulties that surround us
Let us sce where we stand
Slavery is either the cause, or is made the pretext, for all our differ- enccs
Slavery of the African race is recognized in fifteen of the southern States
It is prohibited in eighteen northern States
Congress is the rep- resentative of the people of all these States
All parties affirm that Congress has no power to abolish slavcry in any of the fifteen StateS, nor to establish it in either of the eighteen States; and that it has no right to intcrfcrc with that subject directly or indirectly in cither of the States
So far we are agreed
At an early day of this ses- sion, I was surprised at the request of a fellow- member from a southern State, that we should as an amendment to the Constitution, that Cor)gress shall never intcrfcrc with slavery in the States
Why
Who claims such power 
Its denial is in the platform of every political party, and in nonc more clearly stated than in the Chi- cago platform
Every prominent politician stated it as an axiom of Amcrica:-l polities
I v,'as told there was such an apprehension in the southern mind, to remove which would tend ID reconciliation
In other words, a constitutional amendment is wanted to convince the South that what hos been so often stated to their people was not truly stated
Very well; let the Constitution be so amended
Declare in your own langutlge, in the clearest nnanncr, that each State shall Inakc, change, modify, its domestic institutions in its 0'..vn way
As a matter of convenienc.e, I prefer such an amendment, as it will save us forever, I trust, from answering the oft-repeated assertion that we intend to interfere with slavery in the States
In connection with this subject, I can cordially approve the fourth proposition stated by Mr
SEWARD
It is as follows: " hold Inyselr ready now, as always heretofore, to vote for any properly guarded laws which shall he deemed cessary to prevent nmtual invasions of States by citizens of other States, aud punish those who shall aid and abct them." Fortunately, in our history, we have had but two such invasions, both calamitous to those who set them on foot
The one was the armed inva- Sion of Kansas by citizens of Missouri; the other was the conspiracy and armed foray of John Brown on the soil of Virginia
These examples are not likely to encourage similar attempts; but when- ever they occur, they should be promptly and severely punished
Our people in the North have the right to ex- press their opinions about slavery; to write them, to speak them, to preach them
Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of opinion , are essential to the preservation of repub- lican institutions; and they never can be, and never will be surrendered
Theirconvictions that ßlavory- is a social, moral, and political evil, arc fixed and immutable
They are now shared by the
great body of the civilized world
They are not likelv to be weakened by time or reason, and surely tfiey will not be weakened by threats of disunion
They have a right to their opinions; you have a right to yours
You can write them,  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
print them, speak them, preach them
The prov- idence of God will, In due time and in His own way, determine this difference of opinion
Opin- ions may freely be left to test their strength be- fore the Great Arbitrator
We go a step further
W c invite you
into our midst
You can discuss your peculiar opinions and views in any town or it would bo far bet- city in
the northern States
ter for you to invite similar discussion of our opinions rather than confess your weakness by mob violence, and excite alarm among your cit- izens, and unfounded hopes among your slaves, by misrepresentations
Your right to recapture fugitive slaves, undcr IS not dis- the words persons held to service," • pf.lted by any considerable number of persons
By some it is held to be a right to be enforced wholly by State authority; but it is settled by a series of decisions, both in the Federal and State courts, that it may be enforced by congressional enactment
We insist that the present law upon that subject is unjust, harsh, and unconstitutional in somc of its provisions; that it may be used to kidnap free men as readily as recapture fugitives; and that its practical effect is to excite resistance
It ouäht to be and will be modified
The laws of the States to preventabuses under it will then fall, or be promptly repealed
The complaint is made by gentlemen that fugi- tivcs from justice have not been surrendered
1 have already refbrred to this matter in reply to the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr
STEVENSON.] 'l'his grows out of the construction given to the clause of the Constitution providing for such sur- render in these words: " treason, felony, or other crimes" include ail prohibited offenses by State iaw, or only crimes reco'ynized by common law
T hc Governors of Kentucky and Ohio havc lim- itcd thcsc words to crimes at common law; but no doubt they would follow a legislative construc- tion when given
Let us declare that the sur- render shall be made for all offenses committed in person, within a State, and guard against con- structive crimes or a constructive presence
citizen of Ohio enters within the jurisdiction of Kenluc.ky and violates her laws, 'he should not escape from punishment by flcein«-r to Ohio; nor should a citizen of Kentucky so esc.ape
Good neighborhood and comity demand rcspeét for even pol ice regulations
The only remaining question, then, is in regard to slavery in the Territories
As to Kansas, trust she may this day be admitted
I understand 'the bill is now under consideration in the Senate
How can gentlemen, without blushing för very shame, say to us anything about slavery in the Territories, when they seek to prcvcnt the admis- Sion of Kansas
They attempted to drag her unwillingly into the Union under the Lecompton constitution, and yet the Senate delay her admis- Sion when she has an ample population, and pre- sents a constitution anorovcd by the people
Why, then, not appeal to your political friends to do promptly an act of justice by clothing her with State sovereignty 
In regard to the balancc of thc territory north Of 360 307, I believe no sanc man thinks, after the experience we have had in Kansas, that slavery is goino• into any territory north of that line
Indeed, ib is yicldcd that slavery may bc prohibited in that I know territory by constitutional amendment
I care that slavery can never be planted there
not if Congress, I care not if the Supreme Court, should so decide, yet I know that slavcry cannot by any rule, by any law, or any decision, or by any act, be carried into the territory north of 360 .30'
The attempt to carry it has been properly met
The contest between freedor» and slavery was fought in Kansas
We won the victory; and vou ought to yield at once, and graccfuily
The victory was won two years aff0, and not at the last election
The political power of slavery was settled in If the the contest unhappily invoked by you
slave States will fairly read the logic of events, they would no longer seek to be the central sun around which all the other States must revolve
They will seek no longer the delusion of a united South, thus inviting a united North; but as sep- arate States and as separate communities of south- ern States, as cotton States, as border States, as western States, they will take their proper places w ho I land is in the minority
Who thinks of oppress- ing the Pacific Stat" because they arc In the minority
If the southern States will be but sat- isfied with equality, and not thrust their local institution upon us as a national institution, the contest about slavery will dio away
Then peace will be restored; harmony and quiet will come
We will love each other better for the strife that was between, us
The declaration of the Chicago platform, that freedom is the natural condition of the Territorics, will not then obstruct your growth, expansion, power, or prosperity
There is a Territory west of Arkansas covered by treaty stipulations with the Indians
By our treaties with the Indian tribes this Territory can- not be admitted as a State or included within the jurisdiction of a State; and therefore it is idle to talk about it
The only Territory, then, which remains is the Territory bounded on the south by Mexico, on the north by-Kansas and Utah, and on the west by California, containing about two hundred and sevcn thousand square n'iiles—a nar- row, thinly-populated country
When you an- alyze all this controversy, the whole results in a contestabouta territory, of but little value
Shull New Mexico be free or slave
This is the ques- tion upon which this Government is to be dis- rupted, our flag dishonored, and upon which State after State goes out of the Union
The question is, whether New Mexico, with its peons, with its wild lands, with its half-breeds and Mexicans, its mixed population, shall be free or slavehold- ing Territory
Mr
OTERO
Mr
Chairman, [laughter,] surely the gentleman wikl permit me to interrupt him
Mr
SHERMAN
1 cannot yield
1 shall soon be through; and tbc gentleman will have an opportunity to reply
Mr
OTERO
The gentleman should yield to a reply against so infamous and malicious a libel acrainst the character of the people I represent
A VOICE
He must yield
Mr
SHERMAN
says 1 must; I say won't; and this is the cnd of it
however, say I wish no disrespect to thc gentle- I desired to speak man froni New j'vlexico
frankly of character of that population; of its sparseness; of the aridness of its soil
There are three propositions made in reference to that Territory
The first is to leave it alone
By the act organizing New ltvfexico, the people of that Territory have a right to form themselves into a State; to frame their institutions, not incon- sistent with the Constitution of the United States, and to apply for admission into the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution may ap- prove
T hc same organic law provides that their T.raitorial Legrislaturc may pass laws not incon- sistent with the Constitution; but it provides also that these laws may'be sent here for our approval; and if we disapprove them, they shall not be laws
N'ly colleague [Mr
BINGHAM] last session intro- duced a bill to declare our disapproval of some provisions of those laws
rl'be Senate did not agree to the biil, and that Territory still stands, nominally, a slaveholding Territory
I am told that there is one negro slave man there and eleven negro slave women, and a large number of peons
Mr
OTERO
The peonsare the gentleman's peers
Mr
SHERMAN
The peons, too, are the gentleman's peers, for they elected him
They are made citizens of the United States, and are voters, and they have sent the gentleman here
The next proposition is, that we shall admit New Mexico as a State at once
She has one hundred and six thousand inhabitants
It is pro- posed to admit her as a State; and, of course, that would allow her to frame, regulate, change, and modify hcr own constitution
I must confess it struck me favorably, and I
gavé my assent to it
There are, objections to it—not in regard to slavery, but in regard to other ques- tions which I might mention
I doubt very much whether their people want a State government; indeed I think 7 may say that the people are not able to pay the expenses ofa State government
I believe I can say, from the best information, that they do not desire a State Government
They prefer to remain in a territorial condition
Then• population is sparse, and their settlements remote from each other
Under these circmnstances, the diflicul.ty in the admission of New Mexico does in this great oommunity of States
of oppressing New Engiand because, New Eng- not oat of -the slavery question, But out o'f other, questions, and especiall yout of their sygtem of peonage
Yet I am Willi stand by the dec- laration which made 'to: my constipuents; ahd I will vote for the introduction; of, New; Mexico as a State; alid- that is the uUin_u which I will go

We have another proposition, offered} by: the distinguished Senator TENDEN.] It has been,variously modified.{ I:éan- not vote for that proposition; and I- •rill •seate frankly the reason
In that proposition I find this clause: In all the territory south of sald lineof latitnde; slavery of the African' race is hereby recoghited as existing; and shall not be interfered with by Congress ; but shall be pro- tected as property by all the departments of the territorial government during its continuance." This provision , protecting slavery m New Mex- ico by constitutional enactment, is extended to all the territory hereafter to be acquired
Why, sir, on a recent occasion I
proposed 
to .amcnd thiß section by providing that in
future no erritory should be acquired except by, treaty-, requiring a concurrence of two thirds of the States; and that thc act of acquisition •should form it into a State
Gentlemen from .the South voted against it; and thcy frankly confess they do not look to the ex- tension of slavery in New Mexico, but look to future acquisition
I think wehave had experience enough in this matter, and I trust in God that, if this country hangs together, we will' acquire no more territory; and that we may live in peace and quiet
Not that I am opposed to the acquisition of territory, per se; but rather than have a family quarrel over the territory, rather •than have this quarrel between t.he North-and the South over again,- I would forego to the end of time the quisition of a single foot of territory
I cannot vote for the proposition of the Senat0T from Kentucky, simply because it protects the institution of slavery in the Territory of New Mexico; it takes away from Congress all power, over the subject; it takes away from the pcop10 of the Territory all power over the subject; it makcs this Government establish, protect, and I believe tbüt, uphold slavery in that Territory
slavery is a local institution, municipal in its character, protected by State laws, havir;m rights exclusively within thosc States, and having no rights beyond those States except the right to recapture fugitives who escape from service
Be- lieving, as I do, that that is the correct construc& tion of the Constitution, I never will, whatever may be the consequences, vote for a proposition to establish, protect, and uphold slavery any- where on God 's earth
And m doing this; I only usc the, language of the greatest statesman that Kontucky ever produced
And here:l mioht end what I have to say
The proposition of tie gen- tl&man from Tennessee [Mr
ETHERIDGEI modi- fies to some extent the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky; but even that does not meet the difficulty; it still leaves substantially the provis- ions of thc Crittenden amendment, although he has ingrafied upon it a provision against' the fu- ture acquisition of territory
I could not, thei•e- fore, vote for it; and I would not, the other day, vote to suspend the rules to admit it: for the reason that I will never
vote to suspend the rules to admit a resolution that I am not willing to vote for
Now, Mr
Chairman, I have gone over the whole field
I have given my views, speaking for no other man, frankly and fearlessly, as I will stand by them now and in the future
I have given you my opinion upon all these points
tell you that this whole controvcrsy was fought and won by us two years ago, and all you have to do now to admit Kansas
That is the only act of power now needéd
There let it stand
Let us live together like a band of brothers
cannot agree with you about slavery, why, you I know there has been a do not agree with us
great deal of intemperance of language on this subject; but I ask, If it has been used upon our side, has it not been used upon yours
If there have been harsh and violent words used, -I have not uttered them, that I know of
If I have,- beg every man's pardon; because I thihk -that violent language, calculated to stir up excitement and agitation, ought not to be used in a-delibérative I ask you if you have not sins to re- assembly
pent of, if we have
Let us be at-peacO
Let us go on with the administration of the Government kindly, harmdnioüsly, hopfuliy, •trugting in that  456 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

General debate is now closed upon this bill
Mr
CRAWFORD
By what authority has the' debate been closed 
The CHAIRMAN
By authority of the com- mittee
It was the general understanding of the committec
There was no objection to it
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 am not aware that the committee had any authority to fix the time at which tbe debate should' close; and, as we can probably make no great advance in the bill to- day, I would ask the indulgence of the committec for a few moments only, to reply to the speecl-n which has just been made by tho member from The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will to the gentleman from Georgia that he presumes the committee has really no authority to closc the debate; but that t.he committee can make an acyrec- ment which it will stand to
It was the under- stitnding of the cornmittee that the debate upon this bill should be closed last evening; but a fur- ther understanding was made, by unanimous con- sent, that it should close to-day, after the two gentlemen from Ohio should havc becn heard
Mr
SHERMAN
Georgia will fbrego his remarks until Monday or Tuesday, when he will no doubt have an 01-)por- tnnity of being heard, and that we may pass the Army bill to-night, or at least considor amendments that may bc offered to it
'That ',vas the understanding
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 will that this may be the last opportunity I rnay havc of replying to the gcntlmnan 's speech, and I beg leave to do so to-duy I have no disposition to say anytllin«r in tcmpcratc

No object ion was rnadc
Mr
CRAWFORD
Illingling in this discussion, or asrain ad- dressing the House u pon any whatever during the brief space of titne in which I should be onc of its members
, tbc very extraordi- nary speech which has just fallen thc honor- able member from Ohio demands a reply
That gentleman no doubt reflects the opinions and pur- poses ofa majority of the party which ho bc- , longs; and as 'his position here and in the country will secure for l)is remurks a general perusal, they must not cro unanswered
It is with of great distrust that I undertake the vindication of South Carolina and the other seceding States, from the chargc.s rnade by the gentleman from Ohio; but its very necessity leaves me no other alternative
His speech, without correction, will have the effect of producing upon the public tnind of the North, thc Impressidn that South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabmna, Mississippi, and Lou- isiana, have commenced an acycn•csslve war upon the Government of tbc United States
It is not just either to ourselves or to them, that they should believe, for one moment, that we had, or Hit-ended to conunence, an accn•essive war upon this Gov- ernnuent or the people of the North
All that they ever intended, was to protect and defend them- I selves ao•ainst encroachments upon their rights and liberties, come f'rorn what quarter they might
at such opposite eonclusions
South Carolina knew us well, Mr
Chai,rman, on the 6th day of November last that she intended to resume her sovereignty as she did on the 20th day of De- cember thereafter; and yet nothing was further from her purpose, than an act which might be construed by (his Government into an act of war, or a breach of their friendly relations with the remaining StateS
It was her especial wish and desire to preserve the fullest faith and confidence between herself and the Federal Government
And I stand here to-day to defend her, and to main tain , in her name, that she has not at any time violated her plighted faith, or committed any act inconsistent with her honor or her rights
Up to the very day of thc adoption of her ordi- nance, her cm.u•se towards this Government was as it ever had bcen; sae made no assaults upon the public property; she Inade no attack upon the forts within her harbor; she did nothing that could by possibility have been construed into a purpose of offensive war upon the United States
Upon the contrary, sir, she quietly selected the members of her convention, and discharged every duty which was required of her by your Consti- tution
Her meml)ers appeared upon this floor; they brought to you and to the executivc gov- crmnent every assurance of their friendly inten- tions, they pledged their State acrainst any act of hostility to youi• rights, upon condition that you were to observe and keep the same on your part This assurance wus Inade to your towards them
Executive; and he asked a •written memorandum of tho substance of' tbc assurance from the Rcp- resent&tives of South Carolina, which they gave him, and it is as follows: To I-1is ExceUcney Bueh.an.a•n, President of the United States : In ',viEh our statenlent to you yesterday, we now express to you our strotl(' eon victions that neither the constit.uted authorities, nor any body of the people of the State of South (_:a will either attack or rnolegt the I} nilPd States torts iu the harbor ('Atlat•leston, previously to t.l}Q aetion ot• the convention, and we hope and believe nntde throul-rl) a n aec red ited representati negot iate iin• au icable arrantretnent of c rs be L 'v ee.n F'oderal G overtunent, provided t nn rointbretnnents be sent into those , and their relative Iliälitary status shall rclllain as at JOHN McQUEEN, WM

WASHINGTON, Deccmber 9, 1860
Here we have a written statement as to the pur- poses and of South Carolina, which met tbc approval and of the Executive, and he ace." pt.ed I-hc ora nd um , and with it
o
neces- sit y, its For, to have received it '•,vuh no intent to act
upon it, would have been a piece of I t.reaerherv that no tnan of decent respectability for have countenanced
It is that objection was Inade to the word but that it was " because it looked as if the were bindin«y Linn, while n no authority to commit -the eon vent inn
A_nd, M r
this inter- view \vas by the President saying, in sub- ple of the North, simply declaring that her con- nection with these United States was dissolved
This being done, did she order the forts and de- fenSes to be taken
Did she order the arsenal to be seized
No, sir; upon the contrary, she ap- pointed three of her ablest statesmen a commis- Sion to your Government for the purpose of set- tling all questionsarising out of her new relations with you
They did not Come with banner, brand, and bow, As a leader seeks his mortal foe." They came as friends, to negotiate with you as peace commissioners
If war or aggression upon your rights were t.heir purpose, why thus come to your Government
War commence* in a different way from this, and aggression seeks no such means to encompass its ends
Now, mark you, Mr
Chairman, the course of action pursued by this Government
Scarcely had these commissioners passed beyond the limits of their State, on their way to the Federal capital, when hostilities were actually cominenced by this Gov- ernmcnt upon the people of South Carolina
Major Anderson, who had theretofore been sta- tioned at Fort Moultrie, evacuated it by night, and fortified himself and his command in Fort Sum- ter, a more impregnable fortress, and one which commanded not only the entrance into the harbor, but the city of Charleston itself, with a hostile intent upon his part
This •was an act of war
But to make it beyond question, and show that he considered it war, he did that which no sane man would do in peace, which was to destroy as far as possible Fort Moultrie, and render it unfit fbr use or service as a fortification; add to this the burning of the gun carriages and the spiking of the cannon, and then tell me, cither that your Government has kept its faith, or that South Carolina was guilty of the first act of hostility
Up to that moment, nothing had been done by South Carolina inconsistent with the good faith l)ledged for her by her Representatives; yet when they saw these things done, and were chafing under the mala 
fidcs of your Government, and losing all hope ot' any other result than war, they seized .such defenses as were within their reach, and have held them since for purposes of protec- tion and safety
Why these acts of war by the Government
Why this change of position by Major Anderson, but to command the harbor and reduce Charleston to submission or to ashes 
We have done nothing to warrant or justify his course; and when say I rnean those other States which, through we, •.vcal or woe, will stand by thc palmetto flag till the last man perish
I ask the honorable mcm- bcr from Ohio where, up to that hour, had any act of hostility been committed by any of tho se- ceding States; where had the flag becn struck and forts surrender.ed
He can name no place
And I assert upon southern honor, that no fort have been taken, no arsenals seized, and no hos- tilc attitudc assumed by a single State, had it not been for the action of Major Anderson at Charles- ton; and upon him rests whatsoever of IJlame may attach to the subsequent conduct of South Carolina, Georgia, and the other States
They stance, all, this isa matter of honor ,sunong all felt that their only security against perfidy I do not know that any paper writing n•ent ; we each other." And i IS necessi_lrv•, a (listinct slat.emcnt as to their " relative military status," n') e.anin•r o f the words used iu thc Inetnot•andurn, which -was, atnono• otbcr things, that Anderson should con- tin ue to occupy his then position at Fort Moul- a nd not to throw hiinself' into Fort Sumter
trie This tra.nspired oariy in December, and South (Carolina, true to ner word, permitted nothing by looking to a change of the military status bet,we.on her o•ovcrnrncnt and yours
There hour frotn the day of the interview was not an betwccn those gentlenu-:n •and your Executive, that the peoplc of the city of Charleston micrht not have taken possession of all the forts within her harbor; yet she forbore in consideration of her plighted faith; she restrained an impatient and a bra ve people, because it would have sacrificed her honor; and with then) that is a point which ad- mits of no debate
Nothing was done on the part was that it should not be in the power of the en- emy to turn our own guns upon us
South Caro- lina blad been lulled into a false security, and we could only profit by her misfortunes
Mr
BARR
Will the gentleman allow me to interrupt him 
1Mr
CRAWFORD
Excuse me
1 had rather Mr
BARR
There is a misunderstanding; and I want t.o set the
gentleman from Georgia right
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 ask the gentleman from New York whether I have said anything that bears on him or on his State 
Mr
IBARR
Yes, sir; because my State is a part of the United States
If there was any agree- mcnt between the Government and South Caro„ lina, it would put an entirely diffefent face upon the ,matteu•
If there was such a written avec- ment as the gentleman says, then the President was entit•ely to blame, and I would not stand here to uphold him in the course he has pursued
On of South but to go forward quietly and the contrary, I think he should be impeached and prepai•e for separation-from this Confederacy
condemned for it
But I do not so understand it

If the gentleman had  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
457 tened to my remarks, he would not have found it necessary to interrupt me
Mr
BARR
I understood the gentleman to say that there was a written agreement between the President and the members from South Car- olina
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 said no such thing
1 said there was a written communication from the South Carolina Representatives on this floor at that time to the President of the United States, making certain propositions, which communica- tion he accepted and kept as binding upon South Carolina
Mr
BARR
Did he agree to it
Mr
CRA W FORD
His very acceptance of it, and holding South Carolina bound, of neces- sity involved an agreement upon his part; and I again repeat, that if the gentleman from New York had paid attention [Mr
BARR
I did pay attention] his interruption would have been un- necessary
I stated the facts, drawing my own conclusions, and leaving the country to do the same
I may be in error; if am, the Repre- sentatives from South Carolina were in error, and, more than that, the head of your War De- partment was in error
Why, sir, if I am not mistaken, he puts his resignation of the high omce which he held upon the ground that, as the first omcer in the War Department, he had, according to his understanding with the Administration, pledged the people of Carolina that no reinforcc- ments should be sent to Charleston, and t.hat the status quo should be maintained; and when the President refused to order Major Anderson back, he retired from the Government, as he was in honor bound to have done
This is the cvidence of one of your own Government omcials, and one, too, who refused to continue in oflice at the sacri- fice of his personal honor
Mr
SICKLES
1 ask the gentleman from Georgia to allow rne a word
I beg the gen- Mr
CRAWFORD
rcannot
tleman to excuse me
I prefer to go through with- out exciting anv bad temper in any quarter; and as I have not alluded to him, he must excuse me
I say to the House that whatsoever I say will be in no spirit to provoke replies and stir up strife; for how willing soever I might bc to engacpe in a personal collision, or settle by wager of battle these difficulties, I•would not utter one word which would unnecessarily plunge our country into civil war
To return: every act committed by a seceding State inconsistent with its former relations to wards you, was the result of the acts of this Government at Charleston
We believe that the seizing of Fort Sumter was the first of a series of acts look- ing to our subjugation
This we did not, and do not, intend to allow, so long as you leave us one man to resist your oppression and nmke war upon your invaders
Georgia believed that her forts were to be garrisoned by your troops; that guns which had been placed at Pulaski were to be tui•ned a«ainst her own citizens; and thus her only means of protection to Savannah was to be in the hands of an enemy
Is there in this Republic one rnan who does not know that this fort was put there but for one purpose, and that to defend the city
Admit that It was ceded to the United States: for what purpose, let me ask
Certainly never, in any contingency, to be used by the trustee, the mere creature of our will, for the purposes of de- struction to o tu• people and oar property
It would be, on your part, a wicked and unjustifi- able abuse•of the trusts reposed in you, were you ever t.o attempt such a thing; and believing such to be your object, our Governor, knowing that it would be taken by the citizens, ordered it to be If, sir, the State of taken by the State troops
Georgia Shail retire from this Confederacy, we will hold it with our lives; if she does not, we will deli ver it up to the authorities of the United States
Mr
GROW
do not pisc to interrupt the gentleman from Georgia, but merely to remind him that the courtesy of the House was extended, him to speak fora few minutes, and a half hour has already elapsed
I say, I do not desire to interfere with his remarks, but if it is intended to finish this bill to-night I think we had better close this debate as soon as possible
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 will be very brief
Mr
GROW
If this bill is not to be finished to-night, I will make no objection to the gentle- man's proceeding as long as he pleases
Mr
CRAWFORD
things, believing that this creature of ours bad no right to use these fortifications erected for our defense, for our destruction, we seized them under the universally recognized principle of law that the rights of the agent are all,vays subordi- nate to the rights of the principal; and your rights within the limits of our State must be subordinate to ours whenever you violate the compact between us
That is the principle upon which we have acted, and , as I have said before, which we intend to maintain to the very utmost of our men and means
Now, then, as the gentleman from Pennsylva- nia desires that I should not extend my rernarks to any great length, desire to say, in conclusion, that I understand very fully the purpose of Mr
Lincoln and his party
The majority x of that party to-day, when they tik of enforcing the laws over seceding States, mean war; and we know it
There is no use in undertaking to dis- guise the fact, that when you say you will enforce the laws, that means war
We have no idea of violating a single right of the Government of the United States
We intend to declare our inde- pendence
We intend to resume the powers del- egated to the Federal Government; and we intend to maintain them to the best of our ability
We understand fully that to submit to the adminis- tration of the Government by your p..rty, would be to submit to the destruction of our rights
We know that such will be the effect, though you may deny such to be your purpose
A man can trust himself when others might not be willing to trust him
You have more confidence in the jus- tice and fairness with which you will administer the Government than you can mduce us to believe
I do not say this to wound your feelings
I only say it because justice and fall' dealing demand that I should speak plainly
I say that our people believe that this Government, ad ministered by the Republican party, cannot be otherwise than de- structive of their rights; and hence we intend to protect ourselves against that administration
We do not invite your hostility, but we say it is our duty to be prepared to meet war if it is forced upon us
We will not violate the rights of any citizen of the United States; but we will protect ourselves againstany violation of our own nghts— mark that
What is the collection of the revenue whin our limits but war
What is the enforce- ment of thc law against the citizens• of Georgia and South Carolina but war
The gentleman from Ohio who has just taken his seat [Mr
SHERMAN] said that, at the North, they intended to write and speak their opinions freely and fully upon all subjects; and of course they inun)d to clann thc ught to have what they write and speak sent to any portion of the coun- try
Now I desire to say, in referencc to that, that under t.his degree of freedom of speech, 'if we svere to remain in the Union, we might be com- peiled to have sent into every hamlet in the South Incendiary speeches and writings, calculated to do us infinite harm and bring good to none
Mr
HOARD
I desire to call the gentleman's attention to the Fact that it was the right of speech which the göntleman from Ohio claimed, and not the right to circulate what he pleased
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 understand the position to be, to speak what they please; and of course they will claim the right to print and circulate what they please
Mr
HOARD
I only state what I understood to be the declaration of the gentleman from Ohio
The gentleman from Georgia has put into the mouth of thc gentleman from Ohio what think he did not say
He only said that the Repub- lican party would hold to their right to write and utter and publish the sentiments which they pro- fessed
He did not claim the right to circulate them anywhere and everywhere
Mr
CRAYVFORD
He said that his party would ••,vrite what it pleased, and publish what it pleased, and that those rights they never would surrender
Of course, they would not desire to Mr
GROW
If we are to'closethis debates and pass this Army approrriation that the gentleman from Georgia, should
keep within the timew granted to him by the courtesy of the House, and not allow himself to be further interrupted
His few minutes have extended ing) half an hour
Mr
CRAWFORD
The gentleman must be mistaken.
Mr
GROW
Members speaking are not always aware of the time that they occupy
Mr
CURTIS
1 to say; and I would long ago have said it, if I had not been interrupted
The gentleman from Ohio stated that the people of the North would speak and write and print their sentiments on slavery, and all other questions; and that the people of the-South would -speak and write and print whatever..they saw proper
He claimed that those rights could not be Interfered with; but by that, as I under- stand him, he did not mean that he claiméd the right to carry any of the incendiary documents, spoken of by the gentleman, into the: South, or that he deniecfthe right of the South to prevent the circulation of incendiary documents within their limits
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 think thatl understand the position of the Republican party; and 1 would ask the gentleman from Iowa whether he would not feel that the Postmaster General would be bound to send into the southern States anything mailed in Boston or Buffalo, Chicago or Cincin- nati, whatever it might be 
Mr
CURTIS
we would have the right to have our mail matter carried in the United States mails; but that, sir, would not prevent a sover- eign State from interfering with It, so far as their police regulations made it necessary
The south- ern States would have a right to prevcnt the cir- culation of anything likely to produce insurrec- tion in their midst
Mr
CRAWFORD
When we did that,while Abraham Lincoln was President, and General Scott was his Lieutenant General and Secretary of War, you would say that your rights under the Constitution of the United States were denied to you; that the liberty of speech was suppressed; and that you would spili the last drop of blood in the Northeast and in -the Northwest to regain your ri hts
That is what you would say
Mr 8URTIS
Let me interrupt the gentleman for a moment
Mr
GROW
While 1 am willing to hear the gentleman from Georgia, still, sir, I am not will- mg to let this colloquy go on to an indefinite ex- I do not believe that the colloquy has any- thing to do with the remarks which the gentleman from Georgia was granted the courtesy of the House to submit
And again, I would call his attention to the time he has already consumed
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 will go on with my re- marks
I reiterate, Mr
Chairman, that if we did prevent the circulation of their documents in our midst•, they would then declare that we had violated the freedom of the press, and force us to permit their circulation, or submitto be overrun
They would insist that tbe Constitution of the United States secured the freedöm of' speech and of the press, and that it was denied to them in the South
Then they would declare that they would come upon us with their armies and their navies to enforce the laws
These are inevitable conclu- sions growing out of the positions and platforms of the Republican party, and,as I think, the argu- ment of the honorable member just submitted
A few more words, Mr
Chan•man, and I will yield the floor
Allow me to ask these northern men if we had eighteen slave States, and•popula- tion great enough to control all the Territories, a majority in every branch of the Government, and were to declare that freedom, as you use the term, was contrary to the laws of God and man, that it I was a crime, and, being the sum of all villainies, the Congress of the United States should declare the Territories to be slave Territories; that all the powers of the Federal Government must ye used to extend it, and establish it in your fifteen speak and publish without circulating
Mr
CURTIS
The gentleman from Ohio is States, and then elect a President with two mil- can state my recollec- lion rnen and a hundred million of Federal patron- not now in his place
tion of what he did say, and I will do so very I age to enforce slavery upon you, would you per- mit such a President, representing such aparty, Mr
CRAWFORD
It is with the gentleman to be inaugurated, and impose upon your necks such a yoke, without resistance
from Pennsylvania to say whether shall be in- Mr
LOVEJOY
We have done it for years terrupted any further
 458 [Laughter
I Pro-slavery Presidents and Con- gressés have always ruled us heretofore
Mr
CRAWFORD
Mr
Chairman, the an- nouncement made by the gentleman from Illinois is not true in one solitary particular
We havc never elected a President of the United States by the people of the slave States alone
Mr
LOVEJOY
No, sir; but have elected pro-slavery men
Mr
CRAWFORD: we have elected men according to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States; by the aid of a portion of the northern Democrac.y, from the commencement of the Government
until now
We have always go-tten some northern States to support our candi- date for the Presidenc.y, and very frcqucntly elected northern men Presidents of the United States
This being the case, the statement made by the gentleman from Illinois is untrue
We say that If W'e had eighteen States, with a controlling power in every branch of the Government, and had elected our candidate for President, and with a party of two million voters to carry out every thing I have said, then I appeal to men of the North to say whether they would submit for a solitary hour
I know that the New England States, I know that Ohio and Illinois and Indi- ana and Michigan, and even Minnesota—ay, not a single one of the northern States would submit a solitary hour to the administration of this Gov- ernment by a pro-slavery party, for the purpose of establishing slavery within its borders
Mr
GROW
I wish to say that next Monday we shall have general debate again upon this same subject,• arising upon the report of the select com- mittee of thirty-threc.• I hope thc gentleman will understand that am very anxious to have this bill passed to-night, or else I would not have in- terfered
Mr
HILL
T hc gentleman from Pennsylva- nia should understand that time is very precious to the Georgians
[Laughter.] Mr
CRAWFORD
Mr
Chairman, 1 desire to say that, believing as [ do, and believinf' as the people of the States whicli have seceded or are about to secede do, that their safety depends upon the withdrawal of the powers they form- erly gave to this Government, and resuming them for their protection, it is with that view alone they havc called their conventions
Believing that you intend to violate our rights, xve have taken this course for the purpose of givino se- curity and safety to the lives of our citizens and protection to our property; and while x,ve seek not to violate vouc rights, or the rights of the Government oÉ the United States, we ask you not, under tho flag of the Union, to come for the purpose of subjugming any portion of the people of the southern Statcs, and we ask you to allow them to retire in peace
That is all that we ask Of the North
We ask the fair of' the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 18, the powers of British rule are only changed to the I would rather see the eiøhteen northern States
broad lands from the Potomac to the Rio Grande one grand charnel-house, filled with the bones of brave and gallant men, than submit to such I ask the God of our degradation for one hour
fathers to avert this civil strife; butif it come, my life upon it, we will meet it as patriots ought to meet the oppressor's march, and drive him back, or give to the attempt the last blood that flows in southern breasts
The CHAIRMAN
The general debate upon this bill is closed, and the Clerk will read the first section of the bill
Mr
QUARLES
1 move that the committee do now rise
Mr
GROW
I hope not
Therc is not much courtesy in that arrangement
Mr
HILL
1 desire to ask the allow me to make a few remarks
The CHAIRMAN
The pending motion is that the committee rise
Mr
MAYNARD
1 hope my colleague will withdraw that motion
Mr
BURCH
1 wish to romind the gentleman from Georgia that an agreement was made in colli- mittee yesterday that ibis bill should be disposed of this evening; and I, fot one, upon this Sidc of the House, am willing to carry out that agree- ment in good faith
The gentleman from Georgia will have an opportunity on Monday, or on any day for a week thereafter, to make the remarks he wishes to present to the House
Mr
HILL
That may or may not be so: it 1 ask depends vcry much upon circumstances
only a few minutes
Mr
LONGNECKER

The chair will state to the Tentleman from Georgia that debate upon this bill IS closcd, and the gentleman from Pennsyl- vania upon the left of' the Chair objects to the gentleman trom Georgia proceeding

I trust the gentleman will with- draw his objection
Ivrr
BURNETT
1 desire to inquiry of the ChaiE•
When the first section of the bill is road, will it not be open to amendment and debate under the five-minutes rule
The CHAIRMAN
It will be
Mr
BURNETT
Then, as the from Georgia wants to speak but a few mil)fftes, I hope he will avail himself of that mode of do- in«r it
Mr
HILL
It will not be very agreeable to be so confincd
Mr
MORRILL
1 move that the gentleman from Georgia be allowed to procecd for ten min- utes
No objection boing made, the motion was agreed to
Mr
HILL
Mr
Chairman, 1 beg to assure the con•nnittee, since they have allowed me a few North, the just men of the North, to allow us to retire frorn this without doing in- moments, that it was not my purpose, since I have not sought the floor beförc, to say a word If they desire to war, we justice to them
say thcy ought
to make a declaration of war, and to-day
I have watchcd with interest the course ought not, under pretense, of enforcing the laws of this debate, and it is not my design, in the few remarks propose to submit, to anitnad vert upon of the United States over territory which has anything which has been said, or to eulogize that withdrawn itself from your jurisdiction ,nnd nu- thority, attcmpt to enslave us
We ask you not, undcr pretense that the flag has been struck in some of tho southern States and others raised, that you must call your men to come down upon us to protect the American flog from disgrace and dishonor, and thus delude the masses of your countrymen into the bcliefthat they arc battling to i sustain the stars and stripes, Under that banner we won our liberties; and it would bo an unholy usinff that it should lead armies to crush and destroy the rights and liberties achieved under its ample folds
which has been so wiscly and so prudently said by some who have participated in this debate; and I would particularize tbe eloquent gentleman from the city of Cincinnati, [Mr
PENDLETON.] I •wras desirous to have an opportunity to answer the inquiry put by the honorable gentleman from I wished to say to him, Ol)io, [Mr
SHERMAN.] when declarino• so emphatically that the South, in its enraged state, would hear no proposition of conciliation, that hc spoke, in my judgment, with- out authority
I feel assured that he did so, so once before, upon this continent, declared ticir ft\oatemtyruocwsno fSatrataes ltShCeoncCnet\Peeds'outnhern States independence amidst thc jeers and taunts of those arc concerned
who felt that it would be but a holiday pleasure Despite the attitude of South Carolina herself, I believe to-day she is approachable with reason to reduce then-I to subjection
History proves the folly of such an attempt
We number eight n)il- and words of kindness, arm that she witl listen to the voice of conciliation if it came in so «entlc lion; we shall declare our independence of this Government; and if you choose to put
us to the a form as it could be tendered by gentlemen upon the other side of this House
test of maintaining it by anus, then the battle- I beg, invoke it do it, as guardians of this great and povverful Gov- ernmcnt
South Carolina may be, and, in my judgment, she is, extreme in her precipitancy
I have recrett.ed it; I have remonst.rated against it, and I have implored the people of my own State, notwithstanding her example, to delay their ac- tion, and never to follow her-example, until as- sured that it would meet a hearty and undivided response from the people of Georgia
Will you, under these circumstances, urged and entreated as you are by men who are as much and as faith- fully attached to the Union of these States as you yourselves arc, refuse to make this last effort in behalf of conciliation between these distracted sec- tions of our common country
I hope not
I hope the door to conciliation is not yet closed
There are good men yet from the North in this House
There are good men yet in the other wing of the Capitol; and I mistake, if they do not yet send forth words of love and kindness to soothe an exasperated people, and thus give quiet to aa afflicted nation
i regret not to find a greater de- gree of it in my honorable friend from ()hio
Surely the time has not yet arrived to determine, as positively as he does, that if there can be no reconciliation, there must be a resort to the stern arbitrament of war
Surely he does not mean what he says: that there must be an accommoda- tion or a fight
Not yet—not yet, sir, 1 wrould hope
Let him, let every man who feels that there is an inevitable result, wait for the accumu- lated voice of American patriots to come up and determine this question
I abide that result with confidence and hope
I trust that the convention of my own State—which is sitting to-day, and in which is assembled a large amount of the best intelligence and the best patriotism of that State— will give time to the people of the United States to confess their conservatism, their attachment to the Union, and their devotion to the interests of I believe it will do it; and I the several States
trust, if my State shall resolve to secede in this the hour of her extremity, as she believes, that she will make hcp secession prospective, so as to afford ample time to intervene, and still save the great structure under which we live, and which has blessed us so long
Sir, I n)ake this appeal
I wish that I had had tune to prepare it in some shape that would be more Worthy thc great theme; but i can only speak the outgushmg of my heart when I ap- peal to every Inan in this Hall to throw nside the Iniserable shackles of party, to rise superior to the vindictive feelings that may control them, and to remember, whether they be unionists or disunionists, that they strike at a mighty people when they level this blow at the people of Geor- gia
Let them pausc before they do it
A great and dominant party should not allow itself to be influenced for a single moment by the wild and Crazy fanatics who form a part of its members, and who fancy, I believe, like the fly upon the •wheel, that they direct its motions
I know, sir, that this is *a mistake; and I believe the day is approaching when justice and prudence shall guide the American people, and when fanaticism and ultraism, wherever it may shox,v its head, will be crushed out bv the good sense and patriotism of the nation
God grant that day måy be near at hand! Can there be a nobler task for the pa- triot than to forget for the nonce that South Car- olina may have erred in seizing the Government forts and arsenal, and that the Governor of 111 y V.rn State may have erred—as I think he did—in seizing Fort Pulaski
I should have been better content for the great State of Georgia to have bided her t.ime, and not
for him who has assumed the peculiar guardianship of her defense to have gone, without authority of her Legislature, or of her convention, and while she was not even men- aced, and done this deed
Georgia, if I understand her people, has no fear of any other people, and no dread of any Gov- ernment upon earth
When the time shall come, if it ever does come, when she shall dernand the allegiance and fidelity of her sons, though I shall I regret in extreme sorrow the necessity, I say to every one who hears me here to-day, she shall not have a more faithful and devoted adherent to her shock hctween our contending forces will bo such for her, as my mother, who cherished me in the fortunes than Shail be, despite my pleadings to as the earth has never scen; the b(kFinning we early part of mv life, and upon whose bosom sleep n) y honoréd parents, arid where dwell to- can sec, the end no mortal man can toll;- but what- soever it I prefer it to the vassalage you are day in y near kindred; and 1 ask you to present mistake upon this head
I go further, and I say soon to inaugurate {Or us and our posterity
The to her, far gone as you may consider her, the olive here—and I wish it to bc borne in mind, if is Revolutiön, Indeed, was fought in vain for us, if branch

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
459 that class of men who desire to dismember this Confederacy f.Q* the purpose of reconstructing it and making it more Solid and enduring, and more valuable to all its constituent parts
I would as soon take a glass vessel and crush it to pieces in the vain and delusive hope of making it better than it ev.c•r had been, as to attempt to make a better Government than this, by first breaking it to atoms'
If my own State, acting through the deliberate judgment of her people, should vroceed to this extremity, I beg hcr, for her honor s sake; I beseech hei• children for their own sakes; I im- plore her Senators and Representatives, to have the manliness, after the act is done, to refuse to take part in any reconstruction of this Union, and to stand outan isolatcd nation in the world
There is dignity in that position, if there bc not safety

Mr
HILL
I thank the committee, and will only say few words in conclusion
I desire the gentleman from Ohio, who has been so courteous t0öday, to make sorne distinct effort at concilia- tion; to present some plan, such an one, for ex- ample, as t.hat offered by the venerable Senator from Kentucky, about which so much has been said
And let me say here, that there is a vast amount of abstraction about this whole affair; the North puts too much value on mcre abstrac- tioms; and do not hesitate to say that I think thc South has also attached too much importance to some things of no practical value
Mr
DAWES
Will the gentleman from gia agree to take the platform of the party with which ho acted during the late presidential can- vass—" The Union, the Constitution, and the enforcement of the laws ." I hap- Mr
HILL
I understaod it very well
pened to be onc of the committee that made that platferm; or rather, that refused to makc a plat- form
Mr
DAWES
• 1 propose that you shall hold yourself to it now
Mr
HILL
If thc gentleman has seen any disposition upon my part to be a violator, eithm• of the Constitution or of the laws, he may then, with great propriety, insist that I shall be held down to rigid observance of the platform of the Constitutional Union party
I abide by it; but It is not it will not do as a basis of settlement
definite enough
We want something that will meet all of tbc exWencies that are presented to the country, and that arc rcgarded as grievances by the southern people
• I will ask the gentleman from Massachusetts if ho himself advocated the platform which he wishes rne now to reindorse
Mr
DAWES
Yes, sir; every letter of the Constitution, every obligation of the Union, and every feature of the law
Mr
HILL
I am glad, Mr
Chairman, to hear the gentleman say so
I take it for granted that he will administer a severe rebuke to the newly elected Governor of Massachusetts for not con- currino• in those views
[Laugh ter.] Mr
DAWES
No State in this Union has a son more true to the Union, the Constitution, and the law, than that Governor
A MEMBER
This debate is all out of order
Mr
HI LN DMAN
I trust the gentleman from Massachusetts will be permitted to define his po- I want to hear him
sition
Mr
HILL
do not want to be drawn into a conflict of this kind with the gentleman from Massachusetts; but I join issue with him, and I insist that the retiring Governor of his State— Nathaniel P
Banks—stands before the American people as a better observer of the obligations of the Constitution of the United States—I will add, of the peace and happiness of the country—than does, in my humble judgment, his successor
ri'hat is, however, a Inatter of opinion
A MEMBER
Do you indorse Governor Banks
Mr
HILL
No, 1 do not; but think that Mr
Banks did himself great credit in his retiring spccch, and I am always willing to acknowledge merit
I will conclude these desultory remarks, Mr
Chairman, by inviting
prominent gentlemen on the other side of the Chambcr to consider gravely, as time flies, and as every moment is precious In the excited state of the country, whether they cannot, as a triumphant party, afford to be mag- nanimous; takc hold of this Government, and tender, almost at the same time, thc earnest ofa faithful observance of the Constitution by offer- ing to the southern people their indorsement of the propositions presented by the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr
CRITTENDEN.] If not, come as near those propositions as you can
Mr
HINDMAN
How near
Mr
HILL
We will see how near they Will como first
Make your apN•oaches
I state here that I listened with pleasure—southern gentlemen may be surprised, but nevertheless it is true—to some of the sentiments expressed the other day by the Senator from New York, [Mr
SEWARD,] because I knew that they were modifications of his former opinions; and to that extent they cer- tainly were agreeable to me
Lct other crentle- men here, of the samc school, go about moäifying their opinions
is the only proper way to approach a compromise
It may be, if you do, you will meet on this side of the House a corre-• sponding disposition
I-low else can you, as sen- Siblc men , accommodate this matter
You can do itin no other way
If you stand out pertinaciously on what yon call your national principles, or the principles of t!-le Republican party; and if the ultra and extreme men of South Carolina, and other southern States adhere to theirs, it is as manifest as that we are now enjoying daylight, [laughter, as the Hall was already lighted gas,] that we will come to no desirable end of these troublcs
I am Welt, say rather, gas light
[Laughter.] Clad to sce •tho House in such a good humor; but the question—w hethcr I can give it gravity or not— is, in my judgment, dcscrving of thc most serious I beg gentlemen to attention and consideration
regard it in all seriousness, because while we jest about it the great tabernacle ofour liberties, which we all afiöct to cherish so much, is actually being consumed
Let every man go to •work, and try to extinguish the flumes that threaten its destruc- tion
The CHAIRMAN
Debate is now closed, and the Clerk wili proceed to read the bill by clauses for amendment.
Mr
SHERMAN
Unless some gentlemen de- sire to offer amendments to the bill, I move that the corntllittee rise and report
it to the I-louse
I have Mr
QUARLES
object to that
amendments to offer
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
Then, 1 propose that the gen tlcman from ff'cnnessee offer his amend- mcnts at once
The CHAIRMAN
The Clerk will proceed to read thc bill
Mr
HARDEMAN
1 move to amend, by striking out the eightcenth and nineteen th lines, as follows: For payment to discharged soldiers for clothing not drawn, $50,000
I offer that amendment, Mr
Chairman, in order to reply to a question
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM
Is it the purpose of the chairman of the Committee of SY ays and Means t.o dispose of this bill to-night
Mr
SHERMAN
1 should like to do so
This is the last of the general appropriation bills, and to-morrow there is a special order
Mr
VALLANDIGI-IAM
If the bill is not to be got through to-night, I would move that the committee do now rise
Mr
SHERMAN
1 would state to my col- league that thero is nothing in this bill but the ordinary appropriations; and I hope it wili pass without objection 
Mr
HARDEMAN
In offering this amend- man, as a representative-on this floor of': theep•arty to which he alluded, that l, for Onex, qii'll'.täke thol platform,as a settlement or basis of e#erycxisting diffculty
[Cries of G' Agreed P' from -the', Repub- lican side of the House
That •platform recoø- nizes the Constitution, t ne Union, and the laws, Mr
GARTRELL
Do 1 understand flic gen tlcman from Massachusetts to agree to that
Mr
DAWES
To every particle of it
.'l want no other platfdrm
Mr
GROW
1 rise to point of order
we may as well begin the five minutes' discussion understandingly
The rule permits a gentleman who offers an amendment to have five minutes to explain, and allows any other gentleman five minutes to oppose it
Now, I make the point of order that gentlemen shall be confined to their amendments
Next week this whole debate will be up again, and gentlemen can discuss the matter as much as they choose
• The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from Penn- syl vania states the rule correctly
The gentleman from Georgia must confine himself to his amend- ment
Mr
HARDEMAN
1 will do so thus
in Georgia who are expecting to secede, will be considered as one of these discharged soldiers; but before we are discharged, we want to -state the grounds on which we think we are entitled to an honorablc discharge—[\aughter]—that is, be- cause our platform has not been recognized by the gentlemen of the opposite party
That plat* form recognizes the Supreme Court as the tribunal that interprets the laws of the land
That Su- preme Court has decided that the people of the South have a right to carry slaves into the Terri- tories of the United States
Therefore, as one of the discharged soldiers, I say that we are will- ing to take the Bell and Everett' platform as a basis of settlement for the existing diffculties
[Here the hammer fell.] The question beingon Mr
HARDEMAN'S amend- ment, Mr
HARDEMAN asked leave to withdraw it
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
lobject to its with- I want a vote on the amendment after drawal
tl'lat argument
[Laugh tcr.] T hc amendment was not agreed to
Mr
FLORENCE moved to amend line one hundred and sixteen, by adding, aftcr the words garnson purposes," as follows: 'l'o enable the Secretary of War—if he may consider it for the advantage, of the Government to do so, under tho supervision of or through the aid ot- the officers having in charge the quartermaster's, ordnance, or enalneer's depart- ment, or any other head of any or either of the Executive Departments of the Government—to test the practicability, utility, and econo:ny
of a eonibined wrought and cast-iron wheel, for use upon transportation wacrons and other sim- ilar vehicles, or upon gun carriages adapted for artillery use, or other purposes, as they in their discretion may de- termine, and to bc subject to their selection." Before the reading of tho amendment was com- pleted, Mr
SHERMAN said: There has been enough of that amendment read to show its character, and I submit that it is out of order
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order
Mr
FLORENCE
Let the amendment be read
It will show for itself that it is in order
The CHAIRMAN
The Chairis of the opin- ion that it changes the existing law
Mr
FLORENCE
It not change exist- ing law
It is for an economical purpose, to en- abje tho Secretary of War to make experiments which, in my opmion, will save the Government millions of dollars
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state that flie point of order is not debatable
Enough of the amendment .has been read to show that it chancycs existing law
Mr
FLORENCE
It does not change theiaw
The CHAIRMAN
If it does not, it is not ne- cessary
[Lauzh ter.] Mr
FLORENCE
very well, 1 the mcnt, I mcrcly desire to reply to a question asked i ruling of thc Chair; but I ask that the amendment by the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr
I may be inserted in the official report, and gentle- men will see, when they come to read it*to-mor- DAWES,] which was this The CHAIRMAN
The Chair would suggest row, that I have stated Its effect correctly: I to the from Georgia that he Mr
BOTELER

Mr
HARDEMAN
Yes, sir; 1 will speak to Thepara- I the amendment before f close—when I get to that I graph would then read: For -tho Inanui'acture of arms at the national armories, point
This is a wayward subject' we are on
svish to state distinctly to the honorable gentle- • $400,000
 460 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 18, Mr
Chairman, I shall not consume the time of the committee at this late hour, by making an ar- gument in favor of that amendment
The House may probably remember that, at the last session, made an earnest appeal to them to increase the appropriation to the same extent for that year
The argument for increasing the appropriation applies with greater force now than then
hope the committee will adopt the amendment I havc proposed, and give the two national arm- ories the amount they require, which ought not to be less than $200,000 for each of them
Mr
STANTON
1 hope the amendment will be adopted
Mr
QU ARLES
I rise to a question of order
I submit that, uniess the gentleman from Ohio speaks in opposition to the amcndment of the gentleman from Virginia, his remarks are not in The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the question of order
Mr
STANTON
very well; will move an I move to amendment to the amendment, then
strike out " $400,000," and to substitute therefor $450,000
Now, MI'
Chairman, this letter of the Secre- tary of War, and of the Ordnance bureau, says that the capacity of the armories at Harper's Ferry and at Springfield, for the manufacture of arms, is about four hundred thousand dollars in the ag- gregate, or $200,000 each, when they are worked to their full capacity
The appropriations for a year or two past have fallen short of that amount, and they have not been worked to their full ca- pacily
A larger number of men could have been employed
Now, Mr
Chairrnan, some how or other, for somc reason which I do not comprehend, one hundred and fifteen thousand stand of arms have bccn taken funn thosc armories and transfin•red to the southern frontier; and one half of them to- day are in the hands of thc enen)ies of the Re- public, ready to be turned ngaillst the Army of I ask for this increase of a the Republic
priation, therefore, for the purpose of enabling us to supply that deficiency
Mr
BOTELER
I offered my amendment in good faith, to enable the Governtnent
to Inann- facture the usual quantity of arms; but I anust say that if the increase of the appropriation is to be based upon the nr«nunent that arms taken south are in the hands of the enemies of the Repub- lic," I •vould rather sec the armory in my district sunk, t,hal the irnputation cast upon our sec- tion of the Union by the remark of the gentleman from Ohio should be justified by the conduct of its people
Mr
Chairman, I regret that we can 110t con.Nider any Inatter of ordinary legislation in this House witt)öut having these sectional difficulties thrust upon us
What necessity was there that the gen- t}crnan from Ohio should spring this issue upon us while considering this itmn df appropriation 
If I arn not mistaken, the in ('ormatlon u [)on this subicct in the ha nds of the Conunittec on Mili•ary A trail's is not full, the chairrnan of that conn- mittee promised rno that when hc brought the matter to the attention of the House, he would accompany it with all the facts connected with the transfer of arms to the difFercntsections of our country
A MnMBCR
How many have gone north 
Mr
BOTELER
1 do not know how many have gone north, and I do not care; for am willing to trust arms in the hands of our citizens north as well as south; and shall not stigmatize those who have them enemies of the Republic
" Mr
STANTON
1 said that a proportion of the anns on hand in those a•rJnories had gorie out of thc custody and control of the Government alt0'-rether
I suppose that it will not be denied
Mr
QU ARLES
I•understand that this debate is not in order
I object
Mr
BOTELER
[should like to ask the gen- tlcman from Ohio what that information has to do with the regt.llar manufacture of arms at the national armories
Mr
STANTON
1 withdraw my amend- ment
Mr
FLORENCE
may be to Inake a single remark in this connection
I desire to state an important matter of fact
The CHAIRMAN
No debate is in order
The debate has been exhausted upon the amend- ment pending
Mr
FLORENCE
1 will move, then, to in- crease the appropriation one dollar
Now, Mr
Chairman, I will state that, upon ap- plication to the Secretary of War for an additional number of arms for a volunteer force in Penn- sylvania, the Secretary of War granted quite a large number, if I mistake not, a thousand stand of arms—more than the quota supplied by the General Government under their regulations
Mr
HINDMAN
When was that
Mr
FLORENCE
Only a few months ago
There was a very huge volunteer force in the city of Philadelphia without arms
I represented that fact to the Secretary of War, and he provided them with the Minié arm
He did it without hesitation, and remarked that it would give him great pleasure if were permitted, under the law, to increase the number
Mr
DELANO
I shall oppose the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania; and shall ask some fifteen minutes upon it, Wilh the indul- gencc of the committee
If I had time to show,' the condition of these arrnorics, I could make it appear that there is a necessity, not merely for an appropriation of $200,000 in the item of manufac- tore, but for $200,000 in the item of repairs and apprehend that even the Mili- I improvcments tary Committee of this House cannot answer all the qnestions upon this subject which are most per- tinent to bc answered
I apprehend they are not able to tell you at this moment how many stand of arms there are in thc twenty-four depots estab- lished at different points—I mean arms of that character which any one of thesc gentlemen would intrust in the hands of infantry in the field
Now, sir, have made it a matter of investigation to some extent; and questionable as the propriety may be of statin(' it at this time, in the threaten- ino aspect of affairs, I have been led to believe— and I state it here upon my responsibility—that are not in the arsenals of the country, at this time, thirty thousand stand of arms which would pass thc Government standard
Yes, sir, not thirty thousand stand of aruns
'I'hcy have been disl)osed of everywhere
h ingand c very- thing has been done with th(nn except to retain them for the use of the General Governrnent
I do not say that now is the time tll(..• Gen- eral Government to consider Inore seriously than heretofore this question, which I now call to the I brought it up at the last attention of members
session of Congress; and it was my intention, at the adjournment of the last session, to urge it at this session
I press the matter now, not because of the threatening aspect of affairs, but be- cause I deem it to be a disgrace, to the country that a peol)le professing to be among the firstoow- ers of the world should be without a proper equip- t•npnt in a nuilitary point of view
We have now an impoverished equipment that is disgraceful to any nation pretending to any posilion
I can very readily detnonstrate, from the reports of the War Department, the position which I now assume
In 1855 the stnootll-boremuskets were superseded by the Minié rifle
Since then we have Illunufaclut•ed none of the old tnodel
W c have manufactured in all, seventy thousand of thc new rnodel; of that i number we have distributed over twenty-five thou- sand to the different States
What were left have been distributed to the twenty-four depots through- out the length and breadth of the land
I appeal to the House to say whether we have a proper equipment, or whether we are in a proper condition to meet any crisis or any exigency that may arise 
I do not refer to any crisis wlnch may impend I now; for, sir, God forbid that '.ve should ever see the time when any arm manufactured at thie na- tional armories should be imbrued with the blood of any of the citizens of this glorious Union of I repeat, that it is a disgrace for us, pre- States
tending to bc one of the first nations in the world, to be dismantled and disarmed, so far as respects the arm nour in question
I oppose the pending amendment, Mr
Chair- man, because I design at the proper time to move to increase the amount of this appropriation $200,000, and to add, fbr the repairs and improve- ments for thc manufacturc.of machinery at the armories, the further sum of Mr
FLORENCE, by unanimous consent, withdrew his ameudmcnt to the amendment of the gentleman from Virginia
Mr
SHERMAN
I am perfectly willing that these amendments iri reference to the national armories should come in, and that a vote should be taken upon them in the House
Mr
CURTIS
I move to increase the appro- priation to Mr
Chairman, while Iwould go as far as any man to settle this question, yet I think it would be extremely foolish if we did not look at things as they are
That there is great danger, every
One adrnits
That there isa probability the United States will need arms, is so obvious that it does not require controversy
I know that the United States IS very strong
All it wants is to exert its power whenever that is necessary
I hope that in time of necessity will never arrive
But, sir, I am anxious peace we should prepare for war
that the amount asked for by the gentleman from Massachusetts shall be put into this bill
Either in peace or war, we want more arms than we have
We want more arms of the new pat.tern
We have a great many of the old pattern, which I know will answer our purposes in casc of necessity
Certainly at this time, when our affairs are thrcat- enincy, we cannot expect our consti tucnts will look on and see us indifferent to the existing condition of the country without rebuking us, however is the duty of much we unay all desire peace
the men who still stand by the honor of their flag, to see that the Union has ample means of I trust, then, that my protecti01'i and defense
amendment for half a miliion will be agreed to
Mr
GARNETT
I do not rise to exftess any opinion as to the propriety of the amend- ment movcd by my colleague, or of the amend- ment proposed by the gentleman ft•cnn Iowa, but for the purpose of expressing my hope that the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means will inform the, House why the estimate of the Secretary of War was reduced to $50,000
I never knew before amendnwunt of this macrm- tude—it being proposed to increase the appropri- ation to a bilk reported from the Comrnittec of Ways and Means, to pass without solnc frot•n that
committee for its action
hope that the chairman of that committee will o•ive us the which influenced the Conl- In ittee of Ways and -Means to reconunend an ap- propriation of only #50,000
Mr
S'rAINTON
The of War says that he cannot work than n ycnr —that that is the capacity of the arrnories
'Ithc question was taken; and the amendment of Mr
CURTIS was disagreed to
The amendment of Mr
BOTELER was then adopted
Mr
DELANO
I now move to increase the appropriation to $500,001
Mr
QUARLES
Is that in order
The CHAIRMAN
It is not; the paragraph having been already acted on
Mr
DELANO
1 move, then, to add as fol- lows: For new workshops and Inachincry at the Springtield annory, for working that armory up to its full capacity, the further of $100,000; and on the
cotupletion and readiness for operation of such new workshops and ma- chinery within the year nmv provided for, thc further surn ot ror the Inanufacture of arms
Mr
QU ARLES
rise to a point of orderon that amcndment
The amendment provides for tbc manufacturc of arms, which question has already been settled in a preceding paragraph
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair does not ex- actly understand the point of order raised by the gentleman from Tennessee
Mr
QUARLES
we have already settled upon an appropriation for the manufacture of arn-ns, and the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts is not in order in proposing to add $100,000 for the same purpose
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair does not un- dcrstand thc arnendmcnt as thc gentleman from Tennessee
It is an amendment in relation to the Springfield armory, and not in relation to the manufacture of arms
Mr
DELANO
I desire to answer, under this amendment, the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
GARNETT,] who inquired of the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, what he had to say on this subject, to explain why this large do not know appropriation was now made
whether the gentleman from Obio [Mr
SHER- MAN] is aware of it or not; but the proposition of the gentleman from Iowa [Mr
CURTIS] did  1861
not cövcr the deficiencies in the appropriations which have been made, for this purpose, if we run rn 1855-56, through the last half dozen years
the Government having adopted a new model, In 1856—57, there there was no appropriation
wasasmallappropriation of$250,000
In 1857—58, when the model became established, there x,vas an appropriation of $400,000
At that time that was considered necessary in order to make up the de- ficiency in the appropriations white the new model was brought to perfection
From 1858 up to the present time, in conse- quence of the embarrassed condition of the Treas- ury, Congress hag cut down the Secretary's esti- mates from $400,000 to #250,000, so that, if Nuve are to make up this deficiency, wc should add the present year $300,000, which would increasc the
appropriation bcy(jnd the surn which the gentle- man from kowa [Mr
CU.RTISI named in his amend- men t
We have actually, for the last two years, been working upon an appropriation of $250,000, when, two years ago, the Secretary of War estimated tl-ne appropriation for this purpose at $400,000
If, then, there were nothing in the present state of the times to require an increase of appropriatiot, and if we were merely intent
upon making up the deficiency of the last few years, it would be due to the armories of the country that we should add $300,000 to make up the dimin- ished appropriations of the last two years
The chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means speaks of the Secretary of War
I confess that I do not know whom the chairman means by the Secretary of War
He says the Secretary of War says we can get along with this sum
If he refers to the estimates sent us by the late Secretary of War, I must confess that, to my mind, that is not a satisfactory statement of what should be estimated, when we see and know how that de- partment of the service has been managed within the last year
[Here the hmumer fell.] Mr
STANTON
rl'he way in which I under- stand the question is briefly this: the armories have a capacity to work hands which will exhaust the sum of $400,000 per annum
They have not the means and appliances work up and use, in It is no mat- the eurse ofa year, a larger sum
ter, therefore, what may have been the failure to make appropriations in the past year; and you cannot, by supplying the deficiency, add anything to the annual products of the armories in the coming year
At the instance of the gentleman from Massachusetts, u communication was sent to the War Department requesting* information as to the capacity of tl')e armories; and the answer conveyed to us the iriformation that the armo- ries could work up, with their present capacity, $400,000 per anuum, and no more
Then it mat- ters not what is the deficiency of appropriations in past years, or what the surplus
You cannot increase the amount of manufacture beyond the capacity of production of the armories
Hence, it IS of no use to appropriate more than It would answer no useful purpose, and hence I propose that the appropriation shall remain at As to repairs, I suppose they can be dispensed with in the present embarrassed condition of the Treasury
know that the Secretary of War says that the buildings at the Springfield armory ought to be replaced by larger and more commo- dious ones
But apprehend that the House will not} in the present condition of the country, au- thorize the tearing down and rebuilding of the Sprintrfield armory
Mr
DELANO
1 desire to know of the gen- tleman frot•n Ohio, whether he has any informa- tion froin the Department as to the capacity of the arm ones
Aiso, whether he does not know that they can manufacture forty thousand muskets per vcar, whereas they have, during the last few years, , manufacturincr only eighteen thousand
I do not know who communicated to him the in- formation of which he speaks; but I know this— and i can show it from the debates of last year— that
the Senator from Mississippi, who is as far.ni!iar with the necessities and wants of this ser- vice as any man, said that the present working capacity of the two armories is equal to the man- ufactu re of forty thousand stand of arms per year, whereas, at the present time, they manufacture only eig!lteen thousand
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
Mr
STANTON made a reply as to the source of his information, which was entirely inaudible to the reporters
Mr
HILL
I know enough of the nature of the amendments which will be offered to this bill to satisfy me that we should not dispose of it to- night; and, therefore, I move that the committee rise
Mr
SHERMAN
1 hope not
we are within a few sections of the end of the bill already
Mr
HILL
I withdraw my motion
Mr
BURNETT
I am ready to vote upon all amendments which may be offered to the bill, arid I am anxious to get through with it; but if this debate is to be continued, I say let us rise"
The amendment of Mr
DELANO was not agreed to
Mr
QUARLES
1 strike one hundred and eighty-four and one hundred and eighty-six inclusive, as follows: For continuinz the survey of the northern and north- western lakes, including Lake Superior, $75,000." I see that this work is estimated for by the Department; but the estimate was made in No- vember last, and I presume that w heri the esti- mate was made, the present contingency of the country was not upon us
The Treasury is now bankrupt, and we are borrowing money at twelve Der cent
interest
Now, this work is not actu- ally necessary for the purposes of the Army
It is a mere survey of a lake, which may be made at some other time as well as the present
We would all like *o have the information which this survey vvrill give us; but it is not actually necessary to the efficiency of the Army; and I propose to strike out the $75,000
I think wherever we can pos- si bly retrench our expenditures in the present financial condition of the country, we ought to do so; and this is one of the cases where we can It will not take away a single dol- safcly do it
lar from the actual troops; and it will not dimln- ish the efficiency of the corps at all
My amend- ment will only suspend this work for the time being, and until we are in better condition for prosecuting the work
Mr
HOWARD, of Michigan
Thegentleman seems to be under a total misapprehension of the character of the great work which is going on
The whole of the lakes are being surveyed, and the work has been prosecuted for several years
This work is under the direction of the War De- it have partment; and hence appropriations for always been made in the Army bill
The gentle- man, in opposing the appropriation, speaks of the financial embarrassments of the Government
'1' he gentleman ought to know that there is a large amount of material on hand for the prosecution of thk work, which it is good economy, to say the least, to keep ernployekl
Two steamers are employed all the while, and there are materials enough to carry on the work; and to suspend the work would be ••.vou•se than paying twenty-five per cent
for Inoney to carry it on
The necessity for its completion is the stune as that of the Coust Survey
The work has always been prosecuted with great economy, and at a much cheaper rate than all y other work of the kind
We cannot suspend it without tying up these steamers to rot; and it would cost more to resume the work than to go on with it now
The amendtnent of Mr
QUARLES was not agreed to
Mr
JENKINS
1 desire to offer the amendment, to come in at the end of the bill: Provided, That no part of any o
the foregoing appropria- tious shall be
expended directly or indirectly iOr the pur- pose of recapturi ng any {Orbs, arsenals, navy -yards, or other property of like description in possession ot• any States which have seceded, or may hereafter secede, from this Confederacy
By the unanimous consent of the committee, 1 will consent to have a vote taken u pon this amend- ment in the House, and will not discuss it here
Mr
SHERMAN
I ana perfectly willing
Mr
CURTIS
1 object
1 want it discussed
Mr
JENKINS
vel•y well
1 have a word or I desire to say that this two to sty about it
amendment is not offered as a pretext for sayin(T anything; but in goog faith, and with a desire to procure a practical amendment to the bill before I think it is nothing morc than the committee
Ways and Means, who reported be sidered as a eontext
And a context, I remember distinctly that 'he declared that this bill was for the ordinary purpoées bfthU Government, and for the recapture of the forts and arsenalS, and other property of that tion, within the limits of the seceding States
71f I do the gentleman injustice in my statement; 1 hope he will correct me
Mr
SHERMAN
For the defense ofthe prop
erty of the Unitcd States, and for the recovery of that which is unlawfully withheld
Mr
JENKINS
Then 1 understand the gen- tleman to mean to recover it by military force, as this is a military bill
That, sir, is -precisely the remark to which I alluded
Now, have to say that this bill, construed by the context of the gen- tleman's remark, is nothing more or less than a force bill; and its purpose nothing more or less than to put into practical execution the plan of asserting military supremacy Over thc States which have seceded from this Confederacy
This bill means war upon thoäe States; and It means nothing else; and I appeal to every member upon this floor from the slaveholding States, when this bill shall be reported to the House, and shall be voted upon, to know if any one of them will give his vote for a bill upon which the construction has been'" fixed which I have mentioned, by the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, who reported it
Now, sir, I have one other remark to make, and then I shall have done
When the gentleman who reported this bill was declaiming so elo- quent!y for peace—that is, peace from the South towards the North—he should have remembered that the very proposition which he interpolated into his remarks of using the funds appropriated by this bill for the purpose of recovermg, by mil- itary force, the occupancy of, the forts and arse- nals in the seceding Statcs, was of itself a- propo- sition which , ifmain tained by the dominantsectzon of the Confederacy: would dissolve the Union and dismember the Republic, if there was no other question of dispute between us
If we are to un- derstand that, at ariy time hereafter, under any circumstances, however pressing the emergency, or however gréat the necessity, no portion of the States of this Confederacy, however many they may be in nurhbcr, shall be allowed quietly to act upon the great principlc of self-government and confederate together, but that the strong arm of the Army and Navy will be used by the-old Gov- ernmentto bring them into subjection—I say even if the slavery question were dead to-day, the fact that the dominant section stand upon a proposi- tion of that sort, and are ready hereafter at any time to put it into execution, is enough to make any southern rnan desire to get out of the Con- federacy as soon as possible
Mr
CURTIS
I am hcrc a Representative of thie United States—that is, I am Representative of a certain district in the State of Iowa, im the United States—and while I am in the United States, I expect to stand up, by all honorable means, for the honor, the safety, and the tuity of the whole of the United States, North and South
When the forts of the Government are taken by lawless mobs, I deem it my duty to vote, for their recovery
I will do It if they bc by a large force, or by a State, or by a section of I would adopt every means of concilia- States
lion, exhaust all other means, before I would re- sort to force; but, as a Representative of the U yfited States, I could never consent to vote for a proposition like that ndw offered by the gentle- man from Virginia
Why, sir, we have pur- chased angles df this contment in view of their defensive positions
We have atternpted to round of-T this great continent, so to speak, not for the purpose of establishing nev•.7 States, but for the purpose of defending States which already formed a portion of this great Confederacy
One of these salient points is the Florida reef; it is like the It defends the whole of the bastion of a fortress
Gulf of Mexico
Florida '.vas purchased by the United States for defensive purposes, and we paid $5,000,000 for it
Does the gentleman from Vir- ginia, as a statesman, pretend to establish the idea here that Florida, as a State, can but of the Union, and we thereby lose our $5,000,000 and our defensive point also
Suppose sure purchase fair that, for the purpose of construing this bill, the remarks of the chairman of the Committee of il Cuba—a circumstance which may happen some  462 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 18, day, in all human probability—it would be a State
We may pay, as was proposed by the Demo- cratic Adrninistration, $200,000,000 for it, and we may do so wisely at some period of our his- • tory; can it be possible that the morient we have acquired Cuba for military purposes, she wili have a right to secede
What would be- come of our money
What would become of the niilitary power that we would gain by the pur- chase
W,hat becomes of the statesmanship of gentlemen who argue in support of such a doc- trine 
[Here the Hammer fell.) Mr
BURNETT

Mr
JOHN COCHRANE

JENKINS
1 rise to a question of order
The committee gave unanimous consent, at the suggestion of the chairman of thc Committee of Ways and Means, thala vote should be had upon this amendment in the House; and the objection comes too late

Mr
Chairman, in the brief time allotted to me under the, rules, I wish to call the attention ot• members upon both sides of the House to the fact that this is the • identical amcndment that was mude by the Senate last session to the appropria- tion bill for the Military Ac.ademy at 'West Point, and which was -defeated by the action of this I-louse
My colleague and myself' presented then to the attention of the House the facts which, in our judgnwnt„ entitled 'i'exas to favorable con- sideration in regard to the proposed expenditure of public money
I do not propose on this occa- to recapitulate what then said
But I assure crcntltnnen on both sides of the I louse, that c very word uttcrcd by us on that occasion was not only true then, but is equally true to-day
there is an increased necessity for it now in fact, on account of the increase of depredations on our northern frontier
The truth is, that thc cvil has gone on so and the people have endured so much, that they have almost ceased to look to this Government for any additional protection whatever
This day, and for the last twelve rnonths, companies of Texas citizens, at their own immediate of course, to their own Government for remuneration hereafter —have becn in the saddle, and have been defend- ing, as best they may, the frontier of that coun- try
I arn sure that gentlemen on this side of thc House will do as they did last year—vote gener- ally for this proposition ; and to gentlemen on the other side of the House I have this to say: I called the attention of the chairman of the Coln- mittee on Military Affairs this day to the act of Conqress of' 1858, which provided for calling out t
his regiment
By the terms of that act, the authority to call out the regiment is given to the Presidcrlt; and he rnay also, at any time, when in his judgment it is proper that its existence should cea.é disband it
I say, therefore, to gentlemen on the other side of the House, that it will be within the control of the President chosen by their Own party, and certainly they cannot object to depend upon' his judgment and integrity in the If he believes that the condition of the matter country requires this regiment to be called into service, he will order it to be called into service; otherwise he will not
Mr
SHERMAN
say to the gentleman from Texas that I have no objection to offer to his amendment, and hope it Will be sustained by this side of the House
The question was taken; and the amendment 'vas agreed to
Mr
BURNETT
ment as an additional section to the bill, in the shape of a proviso: Provided, 'I'hat no part of the appropriations made in this bill shall be used by the Federal Govcrntnent in mak- ing war, or in any attempt to subject any State which has or may hereafter secede from the United States
I do not desire to debate the amendment at all; but I ask the other side of the House to give us a vote upon il in the House
Mr
STANTON

The mere block- make war
ading of the port of Charleston is, in my judg- believe, whpther mn)tle- ment, an act of' war
men so regard it or not, that the President has no power to use the Army and Navy of this country, except as subservient to the civil author- ity
South Carolina, as has been before remarked on this floor, has no Federal officers
She has no Federal judiciary there
None of the powers in that State recoonizc thc authority of the Fed- eral Government, or can cnforcc obedience to any ot• the laws of Concress
And yet you propose to send an arny down there, under the naiY1e of enförcing laws, to make war upon South Caro- lina
It is nothing else; and there is not a sensi- ble man on that side of the Chamber who does not so understand it

Mr
BURNETT
May 1 ask the gentleman from Ohio one question 
Mr
STANTON
Yes, sir
Mr
BURNE'I"I'
If you do not intend to make ••,var, why do you object to my amendment
Mr
STANTON
Mr.' Chairman, 1 will tell the gentleman WII y
If, in the execution of those laws, the offeer of the law' is resisted by a IY1ili- tary power, by State authority; and if it become necessary for his protection, and for the discharge of his duties, that the United States shall defend itself, protect itself, protect its property, its ar- senals, its forts, its executive and ministerial officers; it becomes necessary to make defens- ive war, then I suppose the mt)ney appropriated by this act will be used in that war
That is what I- understand
Mr
JENKINS
1 ask the gentlcman this question: whether two Governments, oach claim- ing to be supreme, can carry on government within the sarne sphere
[Voices from the Re- publican side of the Hall, Not very well," and laughter.] Mr

well
That is an But there are some things idea that [ had *nysex

Mr
BURNETT
1 want to know precisely what is intended by gentlernen
Mr
STANTON
1 do not think 1 can have been misunderstood
Mr
BURNETT
well, come right to the point, would you gentlemen hold it to be the duty of the Federal Government to use the Army and Navy for the purpose of retaking Fort Sumter
Mr
STANTON
we are still, thank God, in possession of Fort Sumter, and I understand it to be the duty of the Government to use the Army and Navy, if necessary, to protect that fort
Mr
'I'he gentleman understands, of course, that it was a mere slip of the tongue
YV11at I want to ask is, whether you would use the Army and Navy for the purpose of retaking Fort Moultrie 
Mr
STANTON
When we come to that, 1 1 will discuss the question with the gentleman
was going on to say that the Executive of this Governmenthas ccrtain duties to perform
Amonæ these is the collection of the revenues
So long as cities in any of t.he States are continued ports of entry, it will be the duty of the Government of the United States to collect the revenues of such ships as may enter there, either at the custom- house or at such other point in the harbor as the Government may designate
And if a military force or any force is employed to prevent the col- lector from discharging his duties at the custom- house, or any other appropriate place at the option o€thc Government, it is the duty of the Govern- ment to use the Army and Navy, if necessary, to in.the discharge of his dnties

the collector Now, presume that no gentleman apprehends that military force is to be used for the purpose ! of protecting the custom-house in Charleston or New Orleans; but I apprehend that it is intended that some collector for those ports shall be pro- tected in the collection of the revenues; and if military force is used to prevent the collector from  1861

The Jouönal of yesterday ',vas read
Mr
TEN EYCK
I Wish to move to correct thc Journal
•I yesterday presentcd a petition from citizens of Rockaway, Morris county, New Jer- sey; and I also presen ted certain resolutions passed by a public meeting at Trenton
If I heard the Journal correctly, it states that the petition came from citizens of Tren ton , and the resolutions from public meeting at Rockaway
As the pe- tition and resolutions refer to separate and distinct matters, I make a motion that the Journal be cor- rected in that respect
The Secretary read the following portion of the Journal: Mr
'TEN EYCK presented a memorial of citizens of' New Jersey, praying that a nationai convention may be held at Independence Hall, Philadelphia, on 4th of March next, to promote the general welfare and restore peace and har- mony to the cotintry ; which was referred to the Connnit- tee on the Judiciary
Mr
TES EYCK presented resolutions adopted by a )neet- ing of citizens of Rockaway, New Jersey, in relation to the present disturbed condition of the country
Ordered, That they lie on the table." Mr
TEN EYCK
It should be Trenton in- stead of Rockawa The VICE PRBIDENT
The Journal will be so corrected
The Journal was then approved
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
Mr
THOMSON

I ask that these memorials be laid on the table
The memorials were ordered to lic on the table
Mr
THOMSON also presented a petition of soldiers of the of 1812, dated at Dreehold, New Jersey , praying that pensions may be gran ted to the surviving soldiers of that

I present the petition of M/
C
Jewett, of Pike's Peak, protesting against thc passage of a bili for u national railroad com- pan y, on the ground that the Union question is and setting forth the injustice of in- paramount; curring a debt of $100,000,000 in the midst of a revolution, because the road will be of no use if the Union be broken up
The petition was ordered to lie on the table

Mr
POLK
I requested by the president ofa meeting held in th€ city of St
Louis, on the 8th of January, 1861, to present the resolutions there adopted
If it be proper that such resolutions should bc presented to the Senate, on the request of tlie presiding ofhccr of the meeting, I submit them, and ask that they lie on the table
The VICE PRESIDENT
The resolutions are not in the form ofa memorial
'The question was raised the other day in the Senate as to the propriety of receiving resolutions of public meet- at that time it was decided adversely by the Senate
Mr
SEWARD
What arc resolutions
N'ir
POLK
They are resolutions of a meet- ing held on the state of the Union; and I will state that they express thcir willingness to adjust the difficulties on the basis of the Crittenden com- promise
That is the substance of them
I will state, before the Senator from New York PPO- ceeds, that I did not distinctly catch the prece- dent that was set by the Senate in a case similar to this the other day, on a presentation of similar resolutions by the junior Senator from the State of Kentucky
My impression was that thc res- olutions then presented yvere received and laid on the table
Mr
SEWARD
Mr
I 1850, and the question about receiving proc.oed- ings of public meetings was then discussed; and I I think it was settled in this way: that if the pro- ceedings of the meeting were in favor of the views of a majority of the Senate, they ought to be re- ceived; and If they were adverse, they ought not 1 think that has been the law of to be received
the Senate; but as it is not yet ascertained, tyre motion for reconsideration lying on the table, that thcsc views tvree vv•ith those of a majority of the Senate, I am inclined to think the best way is to continue the old practice, and receive the proceedings of all respectable publig assemblies, and lay them upon the table,' or give-them a ref- erence, as may be thought proper: 
I- hope-timt will be done now
It something for
men -to
petition, and very proper
that they should* be heard
Mr
POLK
I will state, in .refetehce toq one
k adjective the Senator used in regard to- this; meet- ing, that I am satisfied it Nas one of -the largest that hus ever been holden in the State of Mis- souri
It was held in the city of St
Louis, where I there is population of upwards of one hundred and sixty thousand, and held in -thé day time, when the men who attended had to make, some sacrifice order to do so
As to their respecta- bility, I can say, that the offcers of the meeting, who are personally known to me, are gentlemen of the highest respectability in the community, and as respectable as can be found anywhere
Mr
SEWARD
I hope they will be received, Mr
HALE
I do net liker to let this thing go in this way, because my recollection is entirely different from that of the Senator from New York, I was hére in 1850, and 1 have been here When such resolutions have been presented, and the ground hås been taken over and over again; that 
it was not proper for the Senate to lumber its files with the proceedings of meetings all over the coun- try, that were not addressed to the Senate, what- ever might be their character
I took exception the other day to those presented by the honora- ble Senator from Kentucky, and the Senate re- fused to receive them, not from any want of cour- tesy or respect to the meeting or the members of it, or the sentiments expressed; but because the files of the Senate are not the proper piace where the reports of meetings all over the country should be piled up
The VICE PRESIDENT
Shall the resolu- tions be received, and -lie on the table
The question was decided in the negative
WEST POINT ACADEMY
Mr
FOOT
I ask
leave to introduce a bill for the reorganization of the United States Military, Academy at West Point
I will state that this bill has been prepared by the West Point Com- mission instituted at the last session of Congress
I ask that it have its first and second reading, be printed, and go, upon the Calendar
After it shall have been printed, if any member of the Senate desires its reference to the Committee on Military Affairs, I shall interpose no objection
Leavc was granted; and the bill (S
No
540) for the reorganization of the United States Mili- täry Academy at West Point, was read twice by its title
Mr
MASON
1 take it for granted that bilk should go to a committee
It is one of great im- portance
Mr
FOOT
I stated that after it shall have been printed, I shall have no objection to that
The bill was ordered to be printed
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senator from Vermont moves that the bill be placed on the Calendar
Mr
FOOT
For the time being; but after •it shall have been printed, it can be referred, if that be desired
Mr
MASON
A bill on the Calendar is for consideration
I sec no reason why it should not go to the committee at once
have no doubt the Senator would be willing to do what he says; but if it be placed on the Calendar, the fact that it has not been referred may escape observation
It is very common to move to refer and print at the same time
Let it be printed and referred
Mr
FOOT
1 will not resist
Mr
MASON
I move its reference to the Com- mittec on Military Affairs and Militia, The motion was agreed to
GUN BOATS
Mr
GRIMES
I desire to offer a resolution, to which I presume there will be no objection; and I therefore ask for its immediate considera- Resotved, That the Secretary of the Navy be, and he is hereby, directed to furnish to the Senate a detailed estimate of the expense of building and equipping a steel or iron cascd gun-boat of the capacity and arnxament of the United States gun-boat Iroquois
There being no objection, the Senate proceedéd to consider the resolution
Mr
BIGLER
1 to the Senator from Iowa to put the resolution in the usual, form—to request," instead of direct
"  464 Mr
GRIMES
I understand it to be- in the usual form
There have been several debates on this question, since I have been a member of the body,- as -to what was the proper mode of address- I believe it has ing the executive department
been the uniform opinion that it should be " di- récted" when it relates to one of the Secretaries, and " requested" when it relates to the President
The resolution was adopted
PORT on CHARLESTON
Mr
SUMNER
1 ask the Senate to take up the resolution which I offered yesterday
The motion was agreed to; and the Setate pro• ceeded to consider the following resolution, and it-was agreed to: Resolved, That the President of the United States be re- quested, if not incompatible with the public interests, to furnish to the Senate a copy of recent correspondence between the Department of Statc and any 'ninisters of for- eign Powcrs at Washington, with retorcnce to foreign vessels in th•e port of Charleston
MESSAGE FROM TIIE HOUSE
A message from the House of Representatives, by Mr
HAYS, Chief Clerk, announced that the House had passed the following bills and joint resolution; in which the concurrence of the Sen- ate was requested: A bill (No
833) for the relief of Eben Adams; A bill (No
899) making appropriations for the support of the Army for the year ending the 30th of June, 1862; A bill (No

PUBLIC PRINTING
Mr
SLIDELL
I hold in my hand a resolu- tion which I intended to offer the other day, ex- pressing Lhc dissent of the Senate from the doc- trines enunciated by the President in his message, think of the 16th Instant, in response to accrtain msolution of inquiry presented by me
The Ines- save was sent to the Public Printer three days since, and I ask the attention of the chairman of the Committee on Public Printing to that fact
is a very short document; and yet the Pablic Printer has neglected to send it to the Senate
I think some inquiry ought to be made into the circumstances of the case, and the reason why his duty is not more promptly discharged
It is a sh&tt document; it was sent to the Public Printer three days acro, and lhave not been able to obtain u copy, so that I nlight
peruse the President's I do not message with the attention it deserves
• know what is the proper course to bc taken
Mr
FITCH
know of no reason why it should be delayed
Perhaps othcr public printing assure the Senator that may have delayed it
inquiry will be made to-day into the cause of the SUSPENSION OF LAWS IN SECEDING STATES
Mr
MASON
I ask leave to offer a resolution, and ask that it be printed and laid on the table, with the intention of calking it up hereafter
not mean to make a speech
It is a resolution that is intended to meet onc of the exi(rencies
that has arisen in the present condition of public af- fairs; and which, in my judginent, is thc best cal- culatcd to avert that civil war which seems to bc impending
I ask that it bc read and printed
The joint resolution (S
No
60) in relation to a suspension of certain laws in States separating froin the Union, was read the first time
Mr
MASON
I do not cntcrtaina doubt my- self of the perfect and unquestioned right of any State in this Union, in the exercise of its own discretion alone, upon its own responsibility, to separate itself from the United States
Mr
HALE
If the Senator will allow me, is this resolution underconsideration 
Mr
MASON
1 offer it
I do not mean to discuss it; but only to account for the
phraseol- Off y 
Mr
HALE
I want it to lie over
Mr
MASON
I do not ask its present consid- eration, but only to put myself richt in reference to the language used in it
Mr
HALE
No objection
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 19
Mr
MASON
- But really desiring, as far as I can, to be instrumental in averting what seems to be civil war from the use of force under the existing law—I have endeavored, in the language of the resolution , to avoid as many points of controversy as would be likely to arise by the expression of the sense of Congress upon the act of separation
I have therefore only recited it as a declaration on the part of South Carolina
I move that the resolution be printed The motion was agreed to
MITCHELL AND RAMMILSBURG AND OTHERS
Mr
PUGH
1 move to take up House bill No
428, directing the Secretary of the Interior to liquidate the accounts of Mitchell & Rammils- burg and Baker & Von Phul
The motion was agreed to; and the bill was considered as in Committee of the Whole
proposes to require the Secretary of the Interior to pay to Mitchell & Rammilsburg, their survivor or lawful assiffnee, for furnishing thc United States court-rooms in Cincinnati, Ohio, #552 17, in full of their claim against the Government; and to Baker & Von Phul, their survivor or assignee, $161 20, in full o' their account against the Gov- ernment for furniture for the same court-room, and all other claims
The bill was reported to the Senate without amendment, and ordered to a third reading
Mr
KING
I ask if there is a report in that case, that we may know what the bill is about
Mr
PUGH
There was probably a report in the House of Representatives, which the Secre- tary can read
Mr
TRUMBULL
That is a small account, amounting to about six hundred dollars in all, for furnisliing the court-rooms at Cincinnati, '.vhich was befox:c the Judiciary Committee; and I think it is substantially right
Mr
KING
I I'lave no objection to tho bill
I simply desired to kilow something about it, bc- cause iridefinite bills always have more in them than appears
I can explain
The accounts Mr

RAFT OF RED RIVER

JOHNSON, of Arkansas
mission of the Senate to take upa joint resolution relatinry to the Red river raft, in Arkansas, which has passed the House of Representatives, and put it on its passage
The joint .resolution (H
R
No
43) giving the assent•of Congress to certain acts passed, or to be passed, bv the Legislatures of Arkansas, Louis- lana, and "Texas, or any two of them, in relation to thc raft of Red rivqr, and for other purposes, was read by its title
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 trust that will not be taken up
It involves very important principles, and we l'Äavc a special order at
one, o'clock
I feel quite
sure thnt this joint resolution can hardly pass between now and one o'clock
It involves the question of the collection of tonnage duties on the western waters, and I hope we shall not go into the consideration of so important a suuject during the morning hour
I wish to say, Mr
JOHNSON , of Arkansas
as •the Senator opposes the taking up of this joint resolution, that I concur with him entirely in the idca that it cannot be passed by one o'clock
have no idea and no l')ope that the rosolution will I pass by ()Vie o'clock, if thc Senator seeks to make It an object of serious opposition; but I will state to the Senate that this resolution passed this body at a previous session of Congress—the Congress before this—and was sent to the House of Rep- resentatives, Mthere it failed to receive consider- ation, and of course fell by the expiration of the Congress
Now, however, it has passed -the House of Rcpresentatives and come to this body, and now it meets this opposition
I cannot but think that the Senator from Illinois is somewhat in error in regard to the principles upon which he relies, and which induce him to oppose it
There are none concerned in this matter other than those who live above, below, and around the raft of Red river
There are not less than fifty i thousand pcople above that raft who areconstant sufferers in consequence of this obstruction
They have been petitioning Congress for forty or fifty years for its removal, and Congress has appro- priated from time to time, thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars to remove the Red river raft
These people, however, have now given up all hope „that Congress ever will do anything ade- quate to relieve them in the preruises
In this condition, compelled to look to themselves alone for any hope whatever, they have proposed that the Legislatures of their own States may be au- thorized to provide companies, so that the citizens, with their own means, may proceed to remove the raft and relieve themselves from the worst incubus there is on any people in any State within the whole United States; and still the Senator from Illinois, for some slight cause, that cannot but believe is utterly unreasonable, and is entirely without any real foundation, pertinaciously op- poses this measure; and this is not the first time he has done it
Those who live above that raft cannot receive a barrel of flour without a tax of five dollars upon it
They cannot secure its transportation thirty or forty miles without a tax of five dollars a bar- rel for freight; and everything else is in propor- tion
I simply name that one article as being one in regard to which the unreasonable character of the charge will be easily understood by every mem ber here
The whole cost of thc barrel itself would only be about five dollars, ordinarily, and absolutely the cost of transporting it some t•wen- ty-five or thirty miles comes to some five dollars more
There
is no such thing as getting articles that are of any weight for less than double the real value of the articles themselves, on account of the increased price of transportation; still, the Senator from Illinois is averse to taking up this measure, wh ich simply authorizes the States them- selves to form companies, and allow the people out of their own pockets to pay for, govern, and direct the removal of that raft, and give them an opportunity to bring in and carry out produce such as their necessities require
I think that the
opposition to this measure is I of the most unreasonable character that I ever knew
I hope the Senate vv'ill take up the joint resolution, and dispose of it
I have With patience sat here and listened to others, and have allowed the time to be devoted to other matters, hoping and supposing that, the Senate would at some time give Ine an opportunity of taking up this joint I ask the per- resolution, and having it disposed of
I ask the I Senate to consider it and dispose of it; cither kill it at once, and tell these people that they shall continue to suffer, or give them relief, and let them out of their own pockets pay the expense of the improvement
Mr
DOUGLAS
I would ask the Senator from Arkansas whether, if we take up this joint reso- lution now, he will waive it in case it shall not be disposed of by the tillie the special order shall be called up
Mr
JOHNSON, of Arkansas
Exactly
Mr
DOUGLAS
Then 1 hope we may take it up not.v, and proceed with it until that time, at least
Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, 1 am not opposing this proposition, as the Senator from Arkansas would sccm to suppose, from any feel- ing I have in regard to the particular measure at all
But it involves, in my judgment, constitu- tional principles of some importance
I do not believe that we have authority to pass such a bill
I do not think we have authority to grant this power in advance
I will not go into a discussion of the provisions of this bill now; but I think it conflicts with the Constitution; it certainly in- volves very important constitutional questions
I have no objection to taking it up at any proper time
I am entirely willing, so far as I am con- cerned, that the Senator from Arkansas shall name some day to take it up, when we can have time to investigate it and discuss it; but to call upa bill of this importance in the morning hour, when we have but twelve minutes to act upon it, would manifestly Amount to nothing; and f
woul(l sug- gest, as the Senator from Arkansas seems to think that I have some design in keeping this bill back, that hc name his time—I do not care when it is— so that we may know that it is coming up, and there will be sufficient time to consider it
Then, if the Senate understands that it is to come up, I presume Senators will comc prepared to discuss It, if they think proper to do so, or to vote upon  CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C

it without discussion
The•only reason I had for objecting to its coming up now• was the one which I suggested, that there is very little time to con- sider it; and I am not prepared myself at this mo- ment to discuss it
I do not know that I shall do so at any length at any time; but I should desire to state briefly, at any rate, unless some other Senator does it, what regard to be fatal objec- tions to this bill
Mr
WILSON
I hope the Senator from Ark- ansas will consent to fix a day for the consider- ation of the bill
W c have not timc certainly now
I would suggest that it be put off until some day next week—say Thursday, at half past twelve o'clock
Mr
JOHNSON, of Arkansas
If the Senate will make it a special order for that time, I will assent to it
Mr
T,VILSON
1 am in favor of this biU
believe it to be a righteous measure, one that ought to pass Congress, and I am in favor of taking it up and considerin« it at thc earliest day; and I move that Thursday next, at half past twelve o'clock, be assigned for its consideration
Mr
JOHNSON, of Arkansas
1 should be glad to inquire whether a subsequent special order at one o'clock would cut it off
Would an order made after this for Thursday next, at one o 'clock, cut off the consideration of this bill when that hour arrived on that day 
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair would havp to call ug.) the special order for one o'clock, at that hour
Mr
DOUGLAS
I suggest, then, that the Sen- ator from Massachusetts fix it at one o'clock
I move that it Mr
JOHNSON, of Arkansas

Mr
POLK
I should like to ca'll up, for con- sideration by the Senate, a bill x.vhi.ch was passed by the House of Representatives at the last ses- sion, and has been reported by the Committeeon Military Aiyairs of the Senate, with amendments, at this session, for the saleot•the grounds on which the St

The question ison the motion of the Senator from Missouri to take up the bill (H

No
132) to remove the Uni- ted States arsenal from the city of St
Louis, and to provide for the sale of the lands on which the same is located
The motion was agrced to; and the bill was It considered as in Committee of the Whole
proposes to require the Secretary of War to pro- ceed at once to have the grounds now used for the purposes of an arsenal in the city of St
Louis laid off into blocks, according to the present plan of that portion of the city, and to have them sub- divided into lots of a convenient size for build- inm purposes, and subject them to sale to the high-- est bidder, at public vendue, on such terms as to I 30 MONDAY, JANUARY 21, 1861
him may sccm most advantageous, first giving sixty days' notice, by advertisement in at least ! three newspapers, published in St
Louis, of the time, place, and terms of sale, with a description of the property to be sold
It also proposes to authorize the Secretary of War to cause the busi- ness heretofore carried on at the St
Louis arse- nal, to be transferred to the military reservati•on known as Jefferson barracks, in the county of St
Louis, and also to cause all the tools, imple- ments, machinery, and materials now at the ar- senal to be removed to that reservation
The first amendment of thc Committee on Mil- itary Afihirs and Militia was, in section one, line nine, after the word subject, " to insert the words " the western unoccupied portion of;" so as to make it read: And subject the western unoccupied portion of the same to sale to the highest bidder, The amendment 'vas agreed to
The next amendment was to add, at the end of the first section, the following: The proceeds of such sale to bc applied to the erection at Jefferson Barracks, in the State of Missouri, of suitable buildings for containing ail the tools, implements, machine- ry, anns, and rnateriais now at said St
Louis arsenal
Mr
GRIMES
1 should like to be informed I by some member of the Military Committee, if they believe that the whole amount of the value of these lands will be necessqry to be expended in the construction of any such building
Mr
KING
I wi}l reply that, by the amend- ments, the Senator from Iowa will perceive that only a part of these lands arc to be sold
When the buildings are completed at Jefferson barracks, the residue is to be sold, and the balance to go into the Treasury
I ask that the amendment be read providing for that
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
FosTER in the chair.) The amendment will be read•again
The Secretary atrain read it
Mr
KING
Thcrc is another clause
1 think there is anothe! amendment which provides for the suggestions which madc to tl)C Senator from Iowa
Mr
GRIMES
That provides for the expend- iture of the whole of it
Mr
KING
ask that the whole bill be read, from which these facts will appear
The Secretary read the bill and amendments
Mr
KING
I do not see by the reading of the bill, so far as the Secretary read it, that the sale is first confined to a part
That, J know, was the conclusion at which the committee ar- rived—that a part should first be sold, and then the residue
As it has been read, it does not pre- sent my recollection of the bill
Mr
POLK
My recollection is—I cannot lay my fingers upon it now, but I read it when it was reported from the committee—that it provides for the sale at once on the western portion of the land
Mr
WILSON
The unoccupied portion
Mr
POLK
The unoccupied portion, should say, first; and then, wl'lcn that sale has been made and they have got the Jefferson bar- rack for the purpose of placing the Inachinery, the tools, and the munitions there that are on the eastern portion, they are to be removed there, and then the eastern portion is to be sold
Mr
KING

Mr
DOUGLAS
1 would ask that amendment comes from a committee, or is öfTered by an individual Senator
I doubt the propriety of amending the billon the motion of an individ- ual Senator in a matter so important as this
If any Senator will take the trouble to examine tho practice of thc two Houses of Concrrcss on the admission of ncxv States, he
will fina that if has been almost uniform, with one or two exceptions, perhaps, to admit the State unconditionally, and subsequently to prepa re the judicial acts nec.e•ary to its new condition
That has been the practice and it is founded upon tuxood reason
The reason is this: the act for the adlY1ission of a Territory as a State comes from the rrerritorial Committee; it is matured by the rl'erritorial Comnaittee•, it has erencc to its boundaries, and those matters that appropriately belong to that comrniltec; but tl)e lnatu ring of a judicial system, rendcrcd necessary by the admission of a State, is pu-rcly a judicial matter, and invariably con-2cs fronv the Judiciary Committee.' So the adniission of a State often carries with it other legislation in respect to lands, sometimes in regard to thc surveyor generå( office, and the surveys of lands
Those invaria- l)ly come from the Cornmilt.ee on Public Lands
'Ilhc Territorial Commit tee do not think it proper to interfere with what more appropriately belongs to thc Land Comyniltcc
IZIcnce the practice has been—and I think it a safe one—that the 'I'errito- rial Committec should confinc its bills to t be simple act of admission
Such was the case \.vhen Tennessee was admitt.ed, and when 1ü0St
of the other States were admilted
Sucl) was the caso in the admission of Oregon and California; and it has i.)ecn almost uniform
The Senator from Vermont [Mr
COLLAMER] says he has a list of Now, in regard to the judiciary clauses that are necessary in Kansas, I lake it f(-n• granted the Senator from Indiana has prepared tlrern with carc; but yet I would not bc willinot to vote for any one that had not been carefully considered bv the Committee on the Judiciary
•WV hen you bring a new State in, it occupies an ånOmaloåS condition with reference to its judiciary
The United States are divided into nine circuits,- The It becörnes new States are notwithin any circuit
necessary, therefore, to give powers tothe district court, corresponding not only to district court, but a circuit court also

January 19, mittee on the Judiciary- is the iaw organ of the I am unwilling, therefore, to encumber Senate
this bill with any provision upon that subject, but shall be willing to unite with the Senator frÖm Indiana in passing a proper judiciary bill, to fol- I low this one, and immediately after it, if it shall be necessary, when Kansas shall have been ad- mitted; but I do not wish to encumber this bill I do not think it is safe with these provisions
to do so, no matter how carefully they have been prepared, and no matter how competent the Sen- ator may be to prepare them, •without their un- dergoing the investigation of the Judiciary Corn„ mittee
Mr
FITCH
Mr
President, it is rule, an unwritten one of the Senate, which I give the Senator from Illinois the credit of having discov- ered, that an amendment to a bill, not involving an appropriation, must necessarily come from a committee, or that it is not worthy of considera- tion if it does not
That it may have becn the practice to pass supplementary bilk, creating ju- dieial districts in new States, at one period of our history as a Government, I admit; but the Sen- ator, think, has the further credit of having been among the first to sanction a departure from that practice
The Senator, as chairman of the Com- miltee on Territories, was the channel through which the bili for the admission of Minnesota camc to the Senate
This amendment was copied from that bill
Therefore, if the language of that bill is carefully guarded, this is equally so
I give him the credit that it is so, taking nonc to myself
He first depafrted from what he inform* us has been the practice; or at least the departure met with his approbation
1 have followed his ex- ampic
If he was right, then this amendment is I need not now, Mr
President, give reasons in favor of the amendment
Its language carries the reasons f(y• its necessity, should think, to the conviction of every Senator
The only real rca- son for opposition to •it must be political
No opposition can be based upon sound, lecyal, con- stitutional ground, or grounds of right
There may be political reasons för such opposition
Unless those reasons arc developed by the vote upon tho proposed amendment, or in the course of the debatc elsewhere, I shall not go into any discussion of them
If they are, I may do so
Mr
DOUGLAS
Mr
President, the Senator happens to be mistaken, I believe, in his suppo- sinon that I prepared a judiciary bill for Minne- sota, or that portion of t'hc bill for the admission of Minnesota relating to the judiciary
'Ilkat bill came from the House of Rebrescmtatives
I was informed that it had received the approbation and reporl of the Judiciary Comanittee there
When it came here, no objection being made, it havinrr come from the Judiciary Committee of the House,' it is very probable I did not move to strike it out; and if this provision had come with a carefully prepared bill from thc House of Representatives, and from thcir Judiciary Conunittcc, I do not th ink I should to strike it out
That is one of the exceptions to the general practice of the Govern- ment in regard to these bills
I see no necessity, therefore, adopting this provision as an amend- mcnt, although I do not, perhaps, deem it such a departure as would have rendered it necessary to strike it out if it had come from the House of Representatives in thc bill
It involves the ne- cessty of sending this bill back to the House of If the bill itself were defective, Rc ves
and required amendment, I should be willing to amend it, and send it back to the I-louse of Rep- rcscntativos; but as tl'ke bill itself is complete for the purposes for which it was introduced, with- out atnendment, and as the general practice has been that the judiciary bifl should come from the Judiciary Committee, and be passed in a separate form, choose to conform to that practice rather than put"this amendment on this bil\
The case that the Senator stat.es is not in point
Mr
PUGH
Will my friend from Illinois allow me to make a suggestion
Mr
DOUGLAS
Certainly
Mr
PUGH
The clause in the Minnesota bill amendment, as offered to this bill, is in the form It was of the Minnesota bill, as it was approved by the was added in the Senate on my motion
not in the bill first prepared for the adrmssion of Judiciary Committee, at that day, the only ob- Kansas under the Lecompton constitution; but jcction I now have to its being added to this bill af'ter conference with the members of the Com- is that it involves the necessity of sending this mittee on the Judiciary, it was rnoved bv me in bill back to the House of Represcntatives, for the Senate, and was then debated at somb leno•th separate bill can easily be passed in the usual and added to that
bill
Afterwards, at the request form to accomplish the object
of the Senators elect from Minnesota, I moved it, Mr
GREEN
I should like to ask the Sena- with a mere change of the name of the State, to tor a question
If a separate bill would pass, why the Minnesota bill, as an amendment to a House would not the Kansas admission bill pass with bill,' just precisely as the Senator from Indiana this tunendment
has done to-day
After my friend has finished Mr
DOUGLAS
take it for granted that a his argument, I shall show to him, 1 think, the separate bill •will pass
absolute necessity of its being put here now, to Mr
GREEN
Very well; why not this, then 
prevent a fairure of the administration of justice
Mr
DOUGLAS
There is no necessity for Mr
DOUGLAS
I understand , then, from the delaying this bill as it would be delayed by the Senator, that he was a member of the Judiciary adoption of the amendment
The Senator from Committee when he offered it; that he consulted Missouri well knows that this Kansas question and had the approval of the Judiciary Commit- has been here for years,.and no consideration on tee, •and announced that fact at the time to the carth could suffice to stop it in this body three Senate
years aco, when it came under the Lecompton • Mr
PUGH
I did not announce it; but I constitution
It was notstopped then to be amended showed the necessity of the amendment; and 1 for the want of judiciary or any other clauses; think shall show it now, after the Senator has but it was forced through
We are told, first, that finished
Kansas must be kept out because her northern Mr
DOUGLAS
There is a solitary excep- boundary is not right, when it is the same now tlon—perbaps there may be one more—in the as it was then; next, that shc must bc kept out whole history of the Government, to a general because the sou thern boundary is not righ t, though rule
Now, this amendment is to delay the bill
it is the same now it was then; again, she must What necessity is there for it
'We can pass this be kept out because o: the Indian treaties, though provision to-day, or next week, in a subsequent the same objection existed then as now; again, bill, according to tho usual practice, and send it she must be kept out because she has not popu- promptly to the House of Rcprcscntatives
have lati01) enough, though she has three times as many not made the objection the Senator from Indiana people as were there then; and, finally, this bill seems to suppose, that an amendment to a bill must bc dclayed now because it does not contain cannot properly come from an individual Senator; a judiciary clause
do not understand why these but I do say, that an amendment embracing the constant objections are being interposed to the whole subject of the judiciary of a State ought to admission of Kansas now, when none of them come from the Judiciary Committee, ought to be were presented in regard to the Lecompton con- matured by them, and ought to be offered with stitution, three years aff0, nor in regard to the their sanction
The Senator from Indiana thinks admission of Oregon, which has since taken place
there can be no opposition to this amendment It seems to me that the fate of Kansas is a hard except it is political
I believe i am the only man one; and it is necessary for these Senators to ex- yet who has evinced any disposition to oppose plain why they makc the distinction in their action It, and it is difiicult for me to understand how the between Kansas and Oregon, instead of In y ex- Senator thinks my objection can be political
I plaining why I do not make a distinction between do not understand what political motive I can them
have cither for opposin«r or supporting it
My Mr
PUGH
Mr
President, it seems to me i position forbids that I should have any political that my friend from Illinois is disposed -to sus- motive whatever in this matter; nor am I in the pcct something where nothing ought to be sus- habit of suspecting Senators of different motives

Mr
FIT&H
all the details of Representatives, and that, instead of adding it to that, a separate bill was brought in
I ac- of the legislation of period when Minnesota was knowledge that the early practice was to have two admitted, although at the time a member of this bills; not for Lhe reason given by the Senator body, I took it for granted that the bill for the ad- from Illinois, because there was no Committee on mission of that Territory as a State had passed Territories till a late period in the history of Con- through the ordeal of the committee over which the gress, and all questions as to the admission of Senator from Illinois then presided
It appears, new States were referred to the standing Com- however, that the amendment to that bill, from mittee on the Judiciary; but why they reported which I have copied this one, was introduced pre- two bills instead of one bill on the same subject, ciscly as this has been, by an individual Senator, is a matter Nhich we cannot now explain
•per- on his individual responsibility, and that it met-the haps it was because, in the early times, the powers sanction of the Senator f'z•onl Illinois, at that time
and jurisdiction of the district courts in the new That sanction he is disposed to withhold now
States varied somewhat; but at a verv early pe- i have no word of complain.t That is his right
riod, in regard to the district court of Kentucky, at this apparent change in his views
The Sen- the power and jurisdiction given under the gen- ator erred when l•rc supposed I was attributing to eral judiciary act of 1789 was assumed, and it has I supposed it would him any political object
beefi followed from State to State
Therefore, strike every gentleman who heard the remark, when the Senator from Indiana refer' us, as his that my supposition that the opposition to this amendment does, to the district court of Minne- amendinent out of political considerations sota, that refers to the district court of Iowa, and could not apply to this side of the Chamber
that act refers back to a fornier district court, and desire, however, not to cro into that discussion, at last you get back to the old district court for for really I 'flatter myself that the necessity of the tllC State of Kentucky; and hence there is no ne- I amendment is too apparent to require any such ccssity except to refer back, for the jurisdiction discussion, or to admit of any opposition, based of thc courts is settled
on any such consideration
Such necessity, how- Now suppose v„re do not put this amendment ever, I shall leavc to the Senator from Ohio to on this bill: what then
If it were early in the explain, he having already indicated his intention session, if it were the first session of the Con- to do so
oress, I should care little about it
We might Mr
DOUGLAS
1 have only a word to add prepare a separate bill, us we did in the case of to what I have already said
As the Senator did Oregon; and be certain of its passage in both not allude to me, when he rcferred to political Houses; but suppose there be no such proposition • motives for opposing the amendment, I can only what is the condition of affairs
Are not the say that since it has been disclosed that: this courts of the State of Kansas, when she is ad- mitted, incompetent to entertain any prosecutions for ofiönscs against the laws of the United States
Are not the citizens of every other State pre- verged from bringing their actions, as the Consti- tution of tho United States gives them a right to which I think there is no necessity, because a do, in thc Federal court
More than that, as the  1861
Supreme Court has decided that the mere admis- Sion of a Territory into tho United States as a State, without legislative provision, dismisses in fact every pending appeal and writ of error in the Supreme Courtof the United States, the question is one of great importance
The Supreme Court have so decided; and it was that verv thing which induced me, two years ago, to supp-ly that defect
I did it after consultation with the Senator from Louisiana [Mr
BENJAMIN] and the Senator from Delaware [Mr
BAYARD] and other members of the committee on the Judiciary
We thought it was a wise practice, to prevent parties coming hore to met soccial acts to restore their causes now pcndilw on appeal or writ of crror
Therefore, to admit the Statc of Kansas, or any other State, without this provision, is to pass an imperfect act
Ifthe session were yet long enough for us to feel certain that new bill could be matured here by our committee, called up in the Senate and passed, and go to thc I louse of Representatives, be ex- amined and passed there, and become a law, I should care very little about it; but what assur- ance have we of that
If we admit the State of Kansas, with no provision fa• the administration of justice, as I say, it is an imperfect act
Now, who is afraid that this bill will not become a law, merely because we put in it a proper and just amcndmcnt
The bill has passed the House of Representatives heretofore, and passed by a large majority
Our amendinenl does not require that it shall go to any commiltce of the House for ex- amination; it does not require that it shall go to a Committee of the Whole House
It is simply to prevent a failure in the admihistration of justice; and therefore, as I said, it having been put upon it having been made as a the Lecompton bill, Senate amendment to a House bill in the casc of Minnesota, "it seems to me that the suggestion of the Senator from Illinois is suspecting evil where certainly no evil is ilitended
I shall, therefore, vote for the a\ncndment
The PRESIDING OFFICER
If no proposi- tion be made to fill the blat')ks in the proposed amendment, the question will be taken on the amendment without filling them
Mr TRUMBULL
think the Senator from Ohio is entirely mistaken as to the effect which he apprehends will be produced upon suits
1 am not aware of any such decision as that of which he speaks
Mr
PUGH
I tell the Senator there are three or four such decisions
Mr
TRUMBULL
If there be such a decis- ion, it would be in the teeth of the statute, which, I apprehend, would be overruled in this case, at any rate
Thc schedule of this constitution pro- vides, in order that no inconveniences may arise: That all suits, rights, actions, prosecutions, zanccs, contracts, judgrnents, and claints, both as respects individual* and bodies corporate, shall continue as if no change had taken place." Mr
PUGH
Is the Senator reading the con- stitution of the State
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 am reading from the schedule of the constitution of the
State
Mr
PUGH
What has that to do with the Supremo Court of the United Statos in regard to a writ of error pending there
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 suppose the Supreme Court of the.United States is as much bound by the action of Congress in admitting this State with this clause in its constitution, as if it were in a separate statute, Congress ratifies this con- stitution by admitting the State with it; and I am not aware of any such decisions as those of which tho gentleman speaks; but a general law would reach them, if there w'ere such decisions
It seems to me the only effect of thisamendmcnt is to delay the bill by sending it back to the House of Repre- scntativeé
As niy colleague welt remarked, we have had this Kansas question before us long enough
Now let us admit Kansas as a State; und if there is any trouble, it will be very easy to correct it by subsequent legislation, without en- cumbering the admission of the State with these I detaifs
Mr
GREEN
1 think this amendment emi- nently proper
There will be no Federal judge CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
467 ity so far as the Constitution gives us the riffht•, and when the Senator from Illmois says we can, by a supplemental bill, pass it, I ask, '•.vhy not put it on here
It is just, it is right, it is proper; and he says it will pass in another bill
It can get through on this bill better than on any other bill; and why
All who are in favor of the proposi- tion will go for it; and the friends of Kansas will go for it, because it will not hurt Kansas in any manner, shape, or form, unless it be simply this one point: that they desire to delay the oroaniza- tion of a judicial district, and the appointment of a judge, until the next President comes in
Let us call things by their right names
if that be the object, speak it out in meeting; let us understand it
Are we to have a judicial district there or not
If not, why
If so, let us go to work; make it— for it can be done in five minutes—and the House of Representatives will agree to the amendment thus proposed rnorc readily than they would agree to a sc 
aratc bill
Mr
BOUGLAS
I now find out what the im- portance of this question is
It seems it is a ques- tion whether the present or the next Executivc shall appoint the ludge
Mr
FITCH
-1 trust the Senator from Illinois will not do me tho injustice to suppose that that is the sole reason which g6verned me
Mr
DOUGLAS
No, certainly not; because you have not avowed it
Mr
GREEN, 1 avowed the motive of the opposition, not of the movement
Mr
FITCH
There is another reason, inti- mately connected with politics, of much more importance
Mr
DOUGLAS
All I have to say to that is, bring up your bill to-morrow, next day, any day, to creatc a judicial district, allowing the President of the Un'ited States to make the appointment under the Constitution, and I shall vote' for it under this Administration, under the next Ad- ministration, under any Administration
I will neither postpone the bill for the benefit of the next Administration, nor will I amend it here for fcap of the next Administration
I will perform my duties as the occasion arises, and let each Admin- istration take the patronage as it may fall to it; but I do think we ought to pass a bill during this Administration, before the 41h of March, in thc usual form., for Kansas; und unquestionably I should resist any attempt to postpone merely for thc purpose of giving a Republican President the opportunity of making the appointment
Mr
TRÜMBULL
so would 1
Mr
FITCH
That is all very good declama- tion
The Senator from Illii10is rnay introduce his judicial bill to-morrow; but he has yet to learn that it will not pass this Congress until about the time of the inaurruration of another President
If he does not know it now, time will show that my prediction that such will be the fact is correct
But I said there was another reason, intimately connected with politics, aside from thi appoint- mont
That reason I shall now proceed to state; and I will leave it for the Senator from Illinois to say whether it operates at all upon him, or not
It •is an 4dmitted fact, as the Senator from Ohi has said, that unless there is a judicial dis ct created, all cases pending upon writ of err , or appeal to the Supreme Court of the United tates, fall
There is an important case supposed to be in that condition now in the Territory of Kansas, involving the question for which the Senator from Illinois has contended—the right of a Territorial Legislature to abolish slavery
It is there
The decision in the territorial court has been adverse to that right; and if this amendment be not adopted, that case upon appeal falls, and there will be no decision on it by the Supreme Court
I trust we arc all anxious for a decision; at least, we all should be
Let this specific case go to the court, and a specific decision on that precise point bo had; and that I apprehend cannot be done, unless there is a judicial district created simultaneously 'INhc pendency of with the passagc of the bill
this casc was doubtless known whekMhis bill was I will not say that a knowledge of introducdd
this fact led to the 0Q'1ission to insert a provision there, and no Federal marshal, and no means of in the bill for the creation of a judicial district
If there were any political considerations con- enforcing Federal authority
I am not willing to trust Kansas by herself", ui)dcr Kansas laws, and nectcd with thc neglect to rnake that insertion at Kansas rulers, and Kansas judges, and Kansas that time, those considerations were probably connected with a desire to obtain the political executive omcers, without some Federal author
power which a new State would givc the Opposi- tion, and the political representation here; "_-b.ui I trust that no such consideration operated.
That the other consideration to which Ihavc alluded, connected with this amendment; did 'I have good reason to believe; not, h'0'Wever, from anything said by members of this -I trust it will not be found operative here
Mr
DOUGLAS
I wa-s not a-ware, sir, that there was any such case as the one tö which •the Senator
has referred
If I had ever heard of it, I had forgotten it, and was not aware that any- thing of the kind was pending
Mr
FITCH
An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court
Mr
DOUGLAS
As 1 said, 1 not aware such a case was pending
If it had been decided, therefore, I was not aware that any such decision was made
If it were so, I take it for granted the right of appeal to the Supreme Court is not taken away
If there is any doubt on that point, I will ac»ree to insert a clause in the judicial bill that it hall not be taken away, and that will put an end to all apprehension in that respect
Thc rightcan be reserved in the judicial bill, and therc Will then be no difference about it
No man is more anxious than I am to have the question to which the Senator refers decided in the Supreme desire to have it decided Qt the earliest Court
period at which it can be brought regularly before the court; and I will go for inserting in thc judi- ciary bill all the provisions necessary to secure not only that, but every other case that can arise
That will certainly obviate all the diffculty, and disposes of all the objections except the one about the patronage•involved in the appointment of the judge of thc court; and in regard to that, it may
be possible—I should not be at all surprised, from my knowledge of the other side of the House, if it were so—that they would like to reserve the appointment of the judge for the next Adminis- If they do, they will have power to do tration 
it
Before this bill bec.omes a law there will be absentees enough on this side of the Senate to give them a majority; and if they are going to be governed by political considerations in the ap- pointment of a judge, they will refuse to confirm your appointee and suspend the appointment, as the Senate has often suspended the appointment of judges of the Supreme Court* just as an Ad- ministration was going out, in order to postpone it until the next one came in
If that side of the Chamber are ff0ino• to bc governed by political considerations, they will have the power on the question of confirmation just as well now as here- after
But I take it for granted they desire the bill passed; and therefore I take it for granted there will be no diffculty in passing a judiciary I take it fot granted they do noi wish the bill
citizens of Kansas to be put to the incon venience of having no Federal court; but if they want to get the patron 6, they have the power to obtain It in the ner I have indicated just as well as l" Question ! " " Ques- by this bill

January 19, •vs
John Batty and others, the case of the State cofitingency
They are all made that way
They I p/ovide for it; and so it will be .here
Whenever of Wisconsin : A writ of error to the suprerne court of the Territory of Wisconsin was pending in this court when the State of I VVi$consin was admitted into the Union, and no provision I was made by any act of Congress for the execution of the mandate of this court, in such a case, by any inferior court ; 'Phat as tbc territorial court bad ceased to exist, aud no court had been empowered to execute the mandate of this courl, the writ must
be dismissed; •2
That as the subject of the suit was a matter not within the judicial power Of the United States within a State, Congress eould mnpower any court therein to execute the mandate of this court after the admission of Wisconsin into the Union." T.here are several others, but I happened to lay my hand upon that first
This amendment was drawn two years ago, as 1- said, upon a careful examination of this decision, and to meet that very difficulty
Mr
COLLAMER
Mr
President, in relation to that, it is not entirely true that the mandate of the Supreme Court must be authorized by law to go to some other tribunal if the one from which the judgment came has ceased to exist
That I have requires legislation, and it has received it
here a list of the acts for the admission of a large i number of Slates for the last thirty years, and not one of them, with the exception of the single in- stance of Minnesota, had in the act which admit- I can tcd the State any such provision as this
go as far back as Indiana, Arkansas, and Illinois
They were always, cxcept in that single insbance of Minnesota, and for the very purpose which the gentleman mentions, fully provided for in this judicial arrangement after the State was admitted in every case, and even since the Minnesota case, in the casc of Oregon
For myself, Mr
President, I never entertainod an idea that the question about this amendment had any political character attached to it in the I should be as free to vote to-morrow for this arrar)sremc nt for the judicial necessi tics arising out ofthc admission ofa new State, in relation to the Slate Of Kansas as any other State be willing to do it at any time, to-morrow', or whenever it is a proper subject for consideration
There is no necessity to vote iton
this bill
With a single exception, the whole experiencc of the is the other way
Ail the casi's• have been the other i-vay for a great many years; and how it makes sort of difference with the de- cision quoted, am sure I cannot conceive
That decisiou has been already made;- and therefore anything that coukd be done here about making judv•os and corn•ts for the Statcg of Kansas never by any possibility, have any upon that judgment In any way
The citing of that as a case, '.vhich calis for this being done in this I bill, hits'no force whatever
Ido not wish to take up tune about it
this State is admitted, and an act is brought for- ward for the purpose•of covering these cases, that will be just, the way l)ere
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator vote for it
Mr
COLLAMER
Certainly 1 will; to-mor- row or any day
GREEN
Why not do it to-day as well as to-morrow

COLLAMER
Thereasonissimply this— and that has been answered two or three times— it•will embarrass the admission of the State, and send the bill back to the House of Representa- tivcs, and we shall have another quarrel aboüt it
That is the reason
Mr
GREEN
There will be no diffculty about the bill
Mr
COLLAMER
There will be no trouble if the bill be passed, and the State admitted
Mr
GREEN
The only mattér that can corne before the House of Representatives will be the amendment put on the bill; and if they will pass the amendment in a separate bill, they can pass it attached to this one, so that the whole objection falls
'l'hct•e is some other purpose which I can- notdevise except as I have explained
The House of Representatives cannot consider a bill after they have passed it
The rules do not allow it
They cannot amend or alter onc single word in the bill as they passed it; and when the bill goes back to them, the only question is: will you agree to the Senate's amendment or not
It' they would agree to this amendment in a separate bill, will they not agree to it added to this bill, when a majority of thc House are so warruly attached to Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, the casc referred to by the Senator from Ohio by no means establishes the principle w bich has been contended for
That, decision goes this length; that no mat- tcr what acts of Congress may be passed—that is the poii'lt of thc decision, although t.hey place it upon two is not competent for Con- crress to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction ofa case when the court to which their rnandate would be directed is gone, and the subject-matter of the suit is not one of which the court would have jurisdiction as in a State
Now, take the case suggested by the Senator from Indiana, and the very case, which has necessitated the occasion for offering this amendment
That is a case of which the Supreme Court of the United States would not have jurisdiction if it came from a State
It is not one of that class of cases of which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction, except in the Territories
Nov,' , what does this court decide 
Mr
GR.FJEN

Oh, yes; it terminates the intended to cover it— jurisdiction of the territorial court

GREEN
And although an appeal is taken provisions ot• the Florida act of the 22d of February, 1847 in that court, alid noticc of the appeal given, how applied to tbc case, the jurisdiction could bc upheld

Mr
PUGH
well, Mr, President, there are more than forty law vers in the Senate; herc is the book, and they may- all read it, but this attempt to make back-water around the case will not oyer- throw it
The jurisdiction of the Court of the United St.ates in ali writs of error and in all appeals taken from the supreme court of Kan- sas will determine, Congress passes some act of legislation
Now, whether the Florida act in that case was sufficient or not, I do not know; but I know that this provision is; because, since it was put into the Minnesota act, cases continued in the Supreme Court under it have been decided and reported
Cases pending in the Supreme Coutt of the United States on an appeal arid writ of error, from the suprcmc court of the Territory of Min- nesota, have been ponding in that court under that provision, and decided; so that, if that statute is not suffcicnt, we know this is, because it has I do not carc to pro- passed under adjudication

As I say, any lawyer in the Senate may read the case
Mr
FI'I'CH
Mr
President, 1 desire to attention for a moment to the circumstances under which this bi\l is about 10 be forced to a passage, as compared with the circumstances attendant upon the passage of thc Minnesota bill
The bill for the admission of the latter State passed in 1858
Then the present Executive
havin some two years to serve, It was not thought possible upon the part of his opponents to defer the admission of the new State long enough to prevent his having the appointment of the Federal offces within its limits, oven if sucl•x postponement had been de- sirable•, and I do not know that it was deemed so by any Senator on the side
But here c.(.nnes another bill for the admission of another State upon the eve of an out.'F0ing Administration, and when one is abou•t to be inauo•uratcd into power with
their political prociivit.ies
There was no objection on their part, in 1858, to the adoption of the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH,] to the bill for the' ad- mission of Minnesota in the precise language of the amendment I have offered to this Kansas bill
Thcn every Senator on that side of the Chamber, without an exception, voted for it
Here are the yeas and nays in the Journal hold in my hand
But now, suddenly, thcrc isa conscientious desi re on their part to have the bill for the admission of aStute not hampered with any extraneous matter
Their now professions are the reverse of their then acts
They pledge themselves that they will vote im- incdiately for: a judicial bill
Why did they not make the same objection t.o the attachment of the same feature to the Minnesota bill
I know, vou know, sir, the anxiety they felt—an anxiety par- taken in comrnon, I believe, on the part
of all the North, and indeed many of •the Senators of the South—for the early admission of State
thought it but an act of justice; but we thought it equally just to attach a provision similar to this to the bill
No voice among them was raised against the proposition then
Upon a call of the yeas and nays, their names—including that of the Senator from Illinois who sits behind me, [Mr
DOUGLAS I—are all recorded in the aflinna- tive
But now, uudei' a new phase of political that cot.trt
to the Supreme Cour-t
The moment still he inconu)lete and ineffectual, inas•unueh as that court you abolish the court, can you send a writ of possessed no power to carry the :uaudatc into execution, parties, and in vie'•v of the fact that thcrc is a cer- the case not being one of Federal jutis•.diction, the resnit r I'here is nobody to serve a writ on, error there I would be the *tune as that at
which we have arrived

Mr
President, in every the case, x,ve arc satisfied thittour jurisdiction over it ecased onc of the cases i have mentioned—the list of -.—the territoriat courts always endcd w a icl} I have w I-wun the State was admitted; and in that oase of , which came before the Supreme Court, they decided that inasmuch as the case came fron-} the territorial court, they could not send a mandate to any State court to execute thc judg- of thp Supreme Court
They said it rc- qun•ett an act of Congress to invest them with the to do that
Now, ull these judicial acts have in t.he:n this very to mcet that with the torn)ination ofthe territorial gnvcnunentand laws; and that it has not been revived or if, indeed, it could have been, by any aci or authority or on the subject; and uat the writ
of error must be abated 2' In a previous part of the opinion Ille court say: 'I'he section was dravv'l}, under the supposi- if t.ho suit was pendin•r here at the time of the lion that, adn;ission of a rrerrjtory int.o the Union as a State, on '1 peal or writ of error, no legislation Was necessary to pre- serve or 2ivc effect to the jurisdiction of the court over it as we have seen, founded in error." an oninif)ll (and that is ! the point of that case is, tain question connected with the great sectional a«yitation which is at this moment almost
uproot- ing the Govern nunnt of the country from its found- ations—and which question they are apprehensive may, through this amendment, be decided adverse to their political tenets—they desire to prevent the attachrnent of the amendment to the bill Instead of frankly order to prevent the decision
acknowledöing that these considerations influ- ence their views—and I cannot believe that the views of all on that side arc thus influenccd—tbev basc their opposition to this proposition upon a desire to admit the State without clogging the bill for that purpose with any mutter which can be  1861
.THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
469 omitted
No such desire was expressed under other circumstances in relation to another bill for the admission of another State in the same sec- tion
Mr
CLARK
I want to call the attention of the Senator from Indiana to one or two consider- ations in anéwer to what he has just said
They are these: At the last session OF Congress, this bill was reported to the Senate
The Senators on this side have been continually anxious to pass If it had not been for the opposition on thc it
other side, it might have passed months ago; and the gentlemen on the other side might have had their judiciary bill, and their appointments also
Wo have
not delayed it
You, on that side, have delayed it; and because now we want to pass it at the close of the session, you arc trying to de- feat it, on the pica that q.vc want to get the appoint- ment
You nught have had it six or eight months a«ro, if you had chosen to pass the bill; and it is not fair to makc such an irnputation upon this side of the Chamber
You can have it now by passing the bill
Mr
FITCH
That is very true
think there was opposition on this side of the Chamber
confess I opposed it, as I Shail do again, unless this arncndment is adopted
T her), as now, there was no disposition manifestcd upon that side of the Chamber to agree to this amendment
Mr
CLARK
Did the Senator offer it then
It was pending then; but there Mr
Fl'rC1-1
wore other amendments which had precedence; and this is the first opportunity, although it was printed at the last session, that I havc had to call Mr
COLLAMER
Did the Senator endeavor to get it acted on at that time
Mr
FITCH
1 tried to got it before the Senate at that time, as tho Senator must recollect and the amendment wiil show; for f offered it, it was printed, and notice given by me that whenever the bill should come up it would bc offered
An- however, having been intro- other amendment, duced prior to it, precluded the possibility of ray taking it up then
I never met with any oncour- acycment on the opposite side of the Charnber rel- I was not disposed to prc- ative to its adoption
vent the admission of Kansas upon political grounds, and do not believe now, so far as myself and those associated with me politically are con- cerned, that wo have anythin«-r to expect, politi- icaily, from the adoption of this amendment; for, judging from the recently-manifested proclivities of the Exequtive, he is quite likely to appoint to the offices creatcd by the amendment applicants recommended by those of the opposite side of thc Chamber,
especially if those recommended can claim to be front Pennsylvania
Mr
WILSON Mr
President, this question of the admission of Kansas has been pnndil'lg• be- forc us for a long We
arc anxious to carry the bill through; and I take it that is the only motive that governs us in opposing the amend- mcnt of the Senator from Indiana
- It is in the power of that Senator, and of his friends, to intro- I duce a bill, after wc pass this act for flie admis- Sion of Kansas, to securc the judge in the new I know of no Senator on State, if they desire it
this side of the Chamber who will oppose any bill of that kind
Now, sir, if this provision had been in the originåi bill as it came from the Hot-Ise of Represel)tuti ves, do not believe there is a Sen- ator in this body who would vote to strike itout; but thc bill comes to us from the House of Rep- resentatives in its present form ; we want to admit Kansas; we want to close that case; and we say to the Senator from Indiana and his friends: brino• in your bill, and pass it promptly, if you desire aud if you want the appointment of a co do so; jud2•e in the 'Territory, take it
We want to close this question to-day, and admit Kansas into the Union as a sovereign State
1M r
GREEN
This question cannot be closed to-day
know that this amendment is just and proper in itself, and it is conceded to be so on all sides
Not a single Senator says it is wrong; but they say: " 'This is the wrong place; it embar- I happen to rasses the admission of Kansas
' know the contrary' It insures the passage of this amendment
in the House of Representatives, in consequence Clingman, Crittenden, Fitch, Green, ter, Iverson, Johnson of Arkansas, It is •necessary
You say a of this amendment
Lane, Mason, Nicholson, Polk, Powell, Pugh, Rice; Satilsé supplemen tal bill catl be passed
Well, if a sup- bury Sebastian, Thonrson, a'nd plemental bill will pass so quickly and so easily, why not let it pass with this bill, and go to the House of Representatives
Can any one assign a reason for it
I believe I have heard no reason
I shall urge no reason for its necessity, for that strikes every Senator who listens to the reading of the amendment; but there is a reason for put- ting it -in t}iis bill, and that is, to insure its pas- sage
In a separate bill it will not pass, in my opinion
If put on this bill, I know the bill and amendment will pass, and that is the reason I want it put on the bill
Mr
FITCH
Mr
President, accept the pledge of the Senator from Massachu- setts, (and certainly, so far as he is concerned, I would accept it cheerfully,) hc cannot pledge him- self for his political friends at the other end of the Capitol; and if any Democrat—I beg pardon for al lud ing to political parties by name herc ; the names by which they are designated should bc excluded altogether from this Chamber—but if any gen- tleman professing tbc politics entertained by a majority of those on this side of thc Chamber is sufficiently vcrdant to act on that pledge, he will find himself most woefully disappointed ; not from any indisposition on the part of the honorable Senator who makes the pledge to carry it out, but on account of his utter inability to control the ac- tion of otl'ieps of his party
is it fair for them to u roe an objection to an amendment to this partic- ukar bill, when the same provision—this being a copy—has received t.heir assent in another bill under very sirnilar circumstances, except those connected with the incominr» and outfF0ing of Administrations
The Senator himself I see is recorded in favor of the passage of the Minnesota bill
So are both the Senators from Vermont, and indeed all, without exception, upon that side of the Chamber, who then held seats here
This regard for thc prompt admission ofa State, with- out clogging that admission with what they now call extraneous questions, t11C\'1 was not breathed
Minnesota, according to their present logic, was a State of minor consideration compared with that which they are dis Dosed to Oive to Kansas
look upon them bot alike
I voted for the admis- Sion of Minnesota with that provision
I shall sustain the provision in the present bill, and shall most assuredly not vote for the bill unless the provision is inserted
PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the amendment offered by the Senator from Iildiana
Mr
FITCH
There two blanksin the amendment, which I apprehend it would be proper tn first
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair suggested that fact to thc Senate on several occa- sions
No motion has yet been made to fill the blanks

FITCH
The blanks were left with the intention, on my part, to have the amour)ts with which they should be filled—I believe they relatc only to the compensation of offccrs—stated by some Senator who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, who are better judges than myself of the value of the services to rendered
Mr

The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair is informcd, on an examanation of the amendment by the Secretary, that the blanks only relate to the time of holding the, courts, not to the salaries of officers
Mr

I will suggest to the Senator from Indiana to fill the blanks with April"' arid so that the courts will be held on the ' 'October," first Mondays of April and October in each year
Do understand that to be acceptable
Mr

So many Senators are passing upon the floor, and there is so much con- fusion, that it is impossible for the business of the Senate to proceed understandingly
The.que..tion is upon the adoption of the amendment to the preamble, which has just been read
Mr
GREEN
There are two amendments
I will explain the first one, and let the vote be I shall then explain the second taken upon that
one, and let the vote be taken upon that
Neither will giye rise to much debate
The first one is to insert, in the fifth line of the preamble, between the words, s' by the words which" and was,' order of the convention, x,vas submitted to the vote of the people for their approval or disap- proval, and by them." The object of this amend- ment I will state to the Senate
The preamble, as it now stands, reads thus: Whereas the people of the 'l'erritory of Kansas, by their representatives in convention assembled at I.Vyaudutte, in said Territory, on the 29th day of July, 1859, did lön-n for thmnseives a constitution and State gover•nnent, rep»b- lican in torm, which was ratified and accepted by the peo- ple at the election held {br that purpose, &c
I do not wish Congress to sanction tbc idea that it is necessary that it should be ratified and adopted by the people, unless the convention of the people directs that course; that is all
not wish to be committed
I hold that it is com- petent for the convention either to submit it to a vote of' the people or not, unless the vote of '-the people, when they make the convention, decide it is merely an exclusioii of author- otherwise
icy
I think it had better be done, bccauee, so  470 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 19, far as I am concerned, I think ali action of Con- gress amounts to precedent, to some extent, and we sec Senators every day referring to what -y,tas done at the last session, and at other sessions, and thc votes that were "iven
Let us, therefore, be correct
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the scnat% ready for the question on the first amendment to the preamble, which has just been read 
Thc amendment was rejected
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question recurs upon the second amendment to the pream- ble; to strike out, in the sixth line of the preamble, so that it will read: the words G' by the people;" A constitution and State government, republican in form, which was ratified and adopted at an election, &c
The amendment was rejected
Mr
GREEN
Now, Mr
an arncndmcnt to offer, of a substantial character
The other two were not
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will state that thcre is a third amendment pendino to the preamble
Mr
GREEN
I have not moved that
I took it back yesterday, in order to correct it
But 1 move this one, to come in after" the word " schools," in the fourteenth line of the third section
As soon as it is rcad I will explain it
The Secretary read the amendment; to insert, after the word " schools," in the fourteenth linc of the third section, the following: Provided, 'I'hat in all cases where lands which were rc- scrvcd the use of schools in the 'l'erritory Kansas by the thirt.y- iöurth section of t.he act providing fbr the organi- zation of said 'I'crritory, have

Mr
GREEN
I will explain the amendment
T hc section to which it is offered is the onc mak- ing a grant of two sections of land in each town- It
says that the ship, for the support of schools
sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections shall be granted It reads thus: to the State
Seetions numberéd sixteen arid thirty-six in every town- ship of public lands in said State ; arid where either ot• said sections, or any part thereof, been sold or otherwise been disposed or, ()ther laud* equivalent thereto and as con- tiguous as luay be, *hall be grantcd to said State, It)r the uSC (it' schools
Now, that provision is right; but I nulst give n littlc history
In the orcranic act of Kansas thorp a sirnilat• provision, sections sixteen and thirty-six shou}d be reserved for schools, to be dispcns•cd of by thc 'Iterritory 01' future St.atc
Under that grant, the Terri t,ory went to work and t.his bill passcs did dispose of them
Now, it• without my qualification, they will get four sec- tions out of every thirty-six, which no State in the Union ever did receive
All the old new States (which looks l.ikc solecism)—thc first admitted now but onc section in thirty-six
To the latter we have given two sections in thirty- six
I do not object to that; but, under the pe- it being culiau• phraseology of the Kansas bill, rcservcd for the use of thc rl'errilory, the 'Perri- tory went to work und sold the land ; and it is now occupied, and tho people have paid for it, and the money isin the territorial treasury, and the schools enjoy thc benefit it this day and this hour
wish, therefore, this amendment simply to quit- claim, so far as tho Government of the United States is concerned, to that extent, and as far as they have sold, to reserve it from the sections we hereby grant
Otherwise you will grant four scc- tioos out of thirty-six, and ruin a policy which the Go vernmen t ofthc United States has uniformly pursued
I submit to the Senate whether that is not right
I shall not
raise the legal question as to the right of the Territory to sell thc land under the tcFri- torial bill; but it has been given as a legal opin- ion, by the highest legal authority in the United It was reserved for the States, that it was leeral
use of the Territory or future State
" territorial bills whicli I have drawn and reported I convey
I will not argue the legal question here, to the Senate since my attention was called to that for I can get a bigzer fee for doing it somewhere point, I have specially stricken out " the Terri- else
In the territorial bill, this land was reserved tory" in that clause
I do not allow the Territory i to sell and dispose of the land ; but in Kansas they I they exercised the power, and had the power; have sold the lands
Now, having sold them, and the Territory having the benefit of the sale, I am not willing that the State should have an additional benefit equivalent to it; because the State, as the administrator or heir, will take all that the Territory had; and to let them have the two sections which the Territory has already sold, and then two more sections under this bill, would be very unjust
i am willing to confirm the sales that wcrc made that were legal
Wherever they were legal, I say confirm them
They have given the benefit of the money, the interest of which is applied now to the public schools of the Territory ; but except that out from the amount to be granted on the face of the bill as it now stands
I submit wrhcther that is not right
Mr
DOUGLAS
will ask the Senator whether there has been any land sold except onc section ofa township in the county •of Atchison 
Havc not the sales been confined to that one town- I am told that two Mr
GREEN
all
thirds of the school sections in the Territory-have been sold
That is my information
Mr
DOUGLAS
My information is, that these sales have been confined to that one township; and also, I am very clear (but on that point want to turn to the language of the law) that the Ter- ritorial had no power to sell the land at all
There was a reservation to the United States of the lands, for tbc purposc of being up- plied to schools
There was no grant of land to the (Frant to the State
They were reserved in order to bc granted; but it required I think the I future legisla$on for the purpose
langattge in this bill rnust be considcrcd to mean sakes by the United States, because a rc*ervation was made to the United States; and unless soill by the United Statcs, it strikes me that no land could be selected in lieu of that which the territo- rial (roverurnent itself has sold

them, so that the Territory nevm• could have power to sell the lands at all

they became a State; but I was willing to con- sider that question when we came to make the grant
When we collie to admit States, we then usually insert the grant; but the grant is only made when they become a State
This wasa res- 
crvation, the title being in the United States, so that they should not touch it at all
Mr
GREEN
When the original grants were first madc to the first new States, the question was raised whether they were not compelled to lease the lands and hold the title in perpetuity; and the question that the Senator from Htinois now raises was then discussed in ail the courts, It was de- from the United States: for whose use
Not thc future State alone
Now, the language of the bill is for the
Territory and the future State
If his construction be true, how can the Territory have the benefit of it for schools if they have not the power of sale
The use, according to the con- struction and decision of the courts, carries with it thc power to convey
The Territory of Kansas has exercised this power; and there is high judi- shall neither decide one Cial authority for it
way or tho other, for I do not care about it; bat if it should be finally dccidcd that the title thus conveyed is valid, I want to except out of this grant an equivalent
Whatever they have sold and conveyed, which may be determined by legal authority to be valid, I propose to except out of the grant hereby made; Ido not propose to affirm the sale to be just or unjust; I do not propose to say that the sale was right or wrong; but I do propose to confirm thc title of these men who, in good fhith, have paid their money, and the Ter- ritory has loaned it but, and has had the iutcrcst to support the schools to educato the children
This proposition of mine is a bill of the House of Representatives for that very purpose, with a little amendment I put on to this effect: that what- over passes under It shall be excepted out of the grant made to the State
This amendment is a separate bill which passed the House, and move it herc as an amendment to this biil
The House, therefore, have already said they will confirm it
If the House confirm it, •and the Senatc agree to, the bill, arc you going to mtant the State two more additional sections
Yet the language here em- ployed would carry two more additional sections
It says: A r,'l where either of said sections, or any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise dis- poscd of, other lands equivalent thereto shall be If the Territory has sold them and dis- rnven
posed of them, or the United States gave thenl to the Territory and they have sold and disposed of them, we have got to (rive them two more sections in lieu thereof
They are disposed of by the United States, if they are given to the Territory, and the ' rerritory sells them
So I say nothing but an exception or a proviso can save this from having that double operation
There is nobody who desires that
All that anybody desires would be that two sections in each township should be given to public schools; and if the rrerritory has sold them, and has the money in the county treas- ury, bearing interest, supporting schools, ed ucat- ing children, that ought to meet that branch of the case as far as it goes
Mr
PUGH
1 ask Senator from Missouri whether there are any sales or grants madc of either of these sections, sixteen or thirty-six, beyond those embraced in this joint resolution, approved March 3, 1857: A resolution relative to sections sixteen and thirty-six in the Territories of Minnesota, Kansas, and Nebraska

The dif- ficuity which my friend from Missouri suggests, therefore, cannot exist
Mr
GREEN
The Senator from Ohio is cn- tirely mistaken
It does not reach the case at all
i recollect that act
Mr
PUGH
I will ask the Senator, does he know of any sale e*cept of that character
Mr
COLLAMER
The case of Atchison
Mr
PUGH
The case of Atchison was the case of a town site covering a section before the survey
Mr
GREEN
i answer thus: I do not know
Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other men ; in mind* attentive to tileir own." Mr
PUGH
I do not understand the remark
Mr
GREEN
Well, 1 no actual knowl- edge, but have information
Mr
PUGH
That is satisfactory
I did not understand the other remark
GREEN
But here is the pointl make: the Territory has sold two thirds of all the school lands
Whether that title will be sustained or not, I am not going to argue; but when they have received the money—and it is now in their treas- ury, or loaned out und bearing interest, or applied to the support of schools—I a no not going to give additional {ands
The language of this bill will give then") additional lands in all such cases
Mr
COLLAMER
Allow mo to the tleman whether the provision to which he alludes in relation to these lands would give them any lands except those disposed of by this Goverl')- ment
Mr
GREEN
Yes, sir; 1 will answer: any land disposed of legally is disposed of by this Government; because this Govcrnment made thc grant to the Territory: the Territory sold it; and the lord paramount is responsible for the title; so that that does not meet the case at all
NV e must not give this Stat.e anv mope than we gavo Min- nesota
We gave hei• a superabundance
What harm can it be to put in a qualification that when any portion has been disposed of legally, it shall be excepted out of the grant hereby made
Can there be any harm in that; or do you want to give them more
It is true they are a very poor, starv- ing people, sending around .and begging alms all over the United States; but land will not support It is the production of land life without labor
that supports iife; and it is not tho land itself
Hence I am not
disposed to give them any more I will give them just than I give Olher people
the same measure, pressed down, shaken together, and, if you please, runniDff over
No other Ter- ritory ever sold the land
If they have done so, and thc sale is good for nothing, then the quali- fication will do no harm; but good lccral opinion has been given that sale by the Territory is bind- iuo• and valid; and why
They paid their money; they have occupied the land; they have put im- rovements upon it; and the Senator from New Krork [Mr
SEWARDI said he was astonished to f If not confirmed, those lands still belong to the Territory
It shows that they think so, other- wise they would not be asking an act of confirm- It is very clear to my mind that the title ation 
to these school lands is yet in the United States
They were not granted in the territorial bill
They wcrc reserved
To whom 
To the United States, to be applied according to the-langaage of the law
They we;e reserved for that purpose
The judicial decision which the Senator from Missouri cites in regard to the sales of the lands in the States does not apply here, for in that case the lands had not only been reserved in the ter- ritorial bill, but when the States were admitted into the Union the lands were then granted to the States; and the question before thc courts in, his State and mine was whether, in a case where we had granted tho lands to the State, after having reserved them in the Territory, the grant conveyed the power to sell 01' simply the power to lease
Our courts decided that a grant, being an uncon- stitutional grant by the State, conferred the power to sell.
Gut the court very clearly would not have decided that a reservation by the United States for the purpose of being subsequently ap- plied was a grant that authorized the sale
The effect of the Senator's proposition would seem tb be to confirm what thc Tcrritorial Legislature has doné, and allow the confirmation of those titles
I If the State of Kansas, do not choose to do ib
after it is admit.t.ed, sees proper to pass an act of confirmatinn ofthose previous sales, she may do it
I am more unwilling to confirm this now, even by inference, for the reason that it will seem to be a license to other 'L"crritories to go on and sell I do not think the territoriål government theirs
should be permitt.ed to sell; and I think we ought to It in the first instance that comes before us
Thcrcfore, for one, I am for making the •rant in conformity with the territorial acts to the State, and leave the persons who have pur- chased under tho State law to apply to the sense of justice of the State to confirm thc act of the If it be true that there territorial government
are valuable improvements on any section, as supposed by the Senator from Missouri, it will be a good claim upon the justice of the State for confirmation
But i am unwilling to sanction this principle that territorial governments can go on and sell lands that have been reserved, the title of which is in the United States, and which thoy cauld not dispose of until they procured a subsequent grant from the United States Govern- ment
I think it is unnecessary and improper to give any such sanction to that territorial sale; but if the House of Representatives choose, they can make such an amendment to the bill the Sen- ato has passed as will reach the point, if they desire to reach it
Mr
COLLAMER
1 do not know but that, from nny want of acquaintance with the particular details of the public lands and matters connected with them, I may bc somewhat mistaken on this subject; but it seems to me, on the reading of the bill, to be a very clear affair
There is reserved in the case of Kansas, as in yall the other Terri- II torics, certain lands för school purposes; and find fine buildings and expensive farms and cutti- Now,- it -seems to me, -that
is>the Clearest If the Territory of KansaS has case imaginable
used any of the lands granted for schools; and disposed of them, they are to' be-I expressly de- ducted from the grant made in this bill
That seems to me to be all there isof it
I have more to say
Mr
GREEN
That- is just exactly want
I want it confirmed; and that ends the question
That is precisely what I desire
wäs aware of that provision; but I want it confirmed;- and end the question, so that they shall not take double sections in any cases but just take exactly what is granted, and end the question forever
Mr
COLLAMER

DOUGLAS
The Senate has already a to do it
The Senator says some counsel have bill, as I understand, confirming these lands that advised them that they had the right
I do not In the first place, do not have been sold by the territorial government, and know who they arc
know the fact; and in the second place, I do not that bill is unacted upon in the House of Repre sentatives
TheSenatehasexpressed its judgment believe anything about the power
But if the that an act of confirmation was necessary to make Territory had the power to dispose ofthose lands— It appears by the action of if that was the legal effect of it—I refer the gen- t_hose sales valid

But this thing of putting the tract in and in the same words, in which it has been done viéion, seems to mc hardly the form of legislation which a grave body like
this ought to adopt
It is put within the geographical limits of the State and it is excluded from its jurisdiction within the samc words
But we shall assuredly have a con- trovcrsy with the State of Kansas about that tract; and, as I said, our fQrmer experiencc ad- monishes us what the result will be
The squat- ters will get, the land; they will drive the Indians off, and we shall have to pay for it That is what I expect
Now, I think that ought to be left out
Wo ought to make.our treaty faith whole
As to the upper boundary, I was in favor; two years acro, at the time of the Lecompton contro- versy, and urged it upon Senators constantly, of carrying the northern boundary of Kansas to the Platte river
"I'hat is the naturai boundary
It is the ptoper boundary
It will be the source of con- troversy hereafter when we cOme to State I understand that, at the time north of Kansas
the bill authorizing this convention to assemble at Wyandotte was passed by the Legislature, there was some provision made whereby ihc:people of that part of Nebraska, if they
cliose, might elect  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 19, delegates to attend the convention, and thus unite themselves to the proposed State
I understand that they did elect delegates; and' I -understand, furthermore, that they were not admitted in the convention for fear they wouldchange its political character
Still, as there has been so much bad conduct of all parties in Kansas, I suppose that might be put in the general account
I do not wish to delay the admission of Kan- sas
I shall vote for the bill without amendment, though J would prefer it with amendments
I think we ought to strike off that neutral tract— that we can do without any trouble—and makea provision, not in the language of the Senator from Missouri, but to authorize thel.,egislature of Kan- sag, at its first session, to speak fbr the people of Kansas, if lhey choose, and add this part of Ne- braska to them, provided the people of that por- tion of Nebraska, cither upon a forrncr vote, or upon a vote hereafter to be taken, desire it
The Constitution of the United States authorizes Con- gress to consent' to the a.crreement of two States to change their boundaries
Here we have one State and a Territory
It will delay the bill; and I hope it will be acceptable to the people of Kansas
It will prevent difficulty hereafter
1 •had such an amendtnent
at the last session; but it has gone out of my possession, I '(now not whither
In moving to reconsider this vote, it is not for the purpose of voting for the proposition of the Senator from Missouri in its whole length and breadth; but it is in the hope that we may be able to arrive at that result: strike off the neutral tract from the southern portion of Karlsas and make some provision whereby this part may be added on the north, with the consent of' tho Lc- gislature of Kansas and of the people of that por- lion of Nebraska, without delaying• t.he nd ission of the State beyond the present session
Of course, if the Senate will make no amend rnent in these particulars, 01' in any other, it would bc idle for n')C, or any one else, to attempt to draw it

Mr

My friend will allow me to rnake a suggestion )lcre
I unclerstand that the Gov- crtrment itself, or its ofiiccrs, backed by the terri- torial authority , at least the Governor, have driven the, settlers oft once; but we shall have no Gov- ernor therc, and tfoops, if they get to be a State, and the influence of' the Stutc government will bc a«rainst us; whcrcas thc influence of the territorial government now is with us in preserv- in2' that tract
Mr
DOUGLAS
All 1 have to say on that poil'lt is this; if a treaty, which is the paramount its military power to protect them in the enjoy- ment of their rights under the treaty, what other guarantees can you give them
Excepting that out, therefore, by further legislation, will do no good; because the State has no right to interfere now any more than if it was not within her limits
She is prohibited now by the paramount law, by the supreme law of the land; and if she will not be bound by that, we cannot expect her to obey anything of less validity
All the United States have got to do, is to enforce the paramount law, and execute its treaty stipulations with the In- dians
do not think there is any necessity for this
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It is moved and scconded that the Senate reconsider its vote passed yesterday, rejecting an amendment pro- posed to this bill, which amendment has been designated by the Senator from Ohio
Is the I Senate ready for the question on the motion to reconsider 
Mr.- GREEN
I ask for the yeas and nays
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
GREEN
1 will read the treaty itself
It must be remembered that this is not land reserved
It is land belongincr to the Cherokees, who moved there from Tennessee, North Alabama, and Geor- gia
They paid $500,000 for it, and they have not merely an Indian claim, such as is ordinarily un- derstood of Indian tribes; but they have a fee-sim- ple title resulting from the actual purchase, with this stipulation: The United States hereby covenaht and agree that the lands ceded to the Cherokee nation in the foregoingarticle shall, in no future time, without their consent, be included within the tcrritorial litnits or jurisdiction of any State or 'I'erritory
But they shall secure to the Cherokee nation the right by their national councils to make and carry into enuct all such laws as they may deenn necessary for the government and protection of the persons and property within their own country, belonging to their people, or such persons as have connected tbctuselves Witb thetn : Provided al.tvays, 'l'hat they shall not
be inconsistent Witb the Con- stitution of the United States and such acts of Congress as have been, or Inay be, passed regulating trade and inter- course with the Indians; and also, that they shall not be considered as extending to such citizens and anny of the United States as inay travel or reside in the Indian coun- try by permission, according to the laws and regulations established by the Gove* nruent of thc same." Now, it will be observed that this is a treaty stipulation
The faith of the nation is pledryed to it
This bill admits Kansas with her present constitution, but excepts this country out; and Senators seem to overlook the fact that we can not change u State constitution
We can propose a change in conformity with treaty stipulations, but the people of Kansas must ratify that change
I say we cannot except it out, and make that ex- ccption valid and binding on the people of Kan- sus
We could except it out of the territorial bill, becausc that all depended upon our individ- ual action; but when it depends upon the State action of Kansas, we cannot except it out
It is either included ill the State, or it is not
The Senator from Illinois says a treaty stipulation is the supreme law of the land; and the inclusion of this land within the State of Kansas wi\l be simply null and void
How would he like to crive the bounds of Kansas including the island of Cuba
Would that be sensible legislation 
Would hc say, " well, it is simply null and void, because Cuba does not belong to the United States
Is that the way to legislate
Suppose we proposed to admit the State with certain bounds, Including Great Britain, France, and freland: would he vote for it
It is an insult; and it is an i insult to the Chcrokce nation; and as I stated yesterday, I repeat to-day, the cvil of it are very many
Our people suppose the bound ary to bc where the outside line runs, and they will go in and occupy the Jands in spite of every I thing you can bring to bear
T herc are three thousand people now on these lands, and they went in because of the loose phraseology of the Kansas-Nebraska bill on that
subject; including the lands and then excepting thern out
With over a State constitution, will not protect the i most of the Indian lands, where there is nothing Indians, I do not sce how an inferior law is going 'I'hoy are protected now bv a treaty of to do it
the United States which is declared io be the sun prcn-te law of thc land, arxything in the constitu- lions or the laws of the States to the contrary notwithstanding; and if that pararnount law will not protect tbeun, I do not, see how any inferior one, that unust yield to the other law, is going to protect thcm„ the United States will not use but a mere Indian claim, a usufruct; it does not makc any diftöt•ence; but where there is a fee-sim- ple and a treaty stipulation that they shall not be included, it does make a difference, Take the Cotnanches, the Navajoes, the Arrapahoes, the Sioux, or the Yanctons; it makes no difference at all in organizing your Territories, for thcy have nothing but a usufruct to the land, But take the Cherokee nation in these Dry Woods and in these neutral lands, where they paid $500,000, with a special stipulation that no- body should ever put Ins foot there without their consent: to undertake to include them within a State makes a different question entirely
You have no right to do it; and, if you do it, you com- mit a wrong against the Cherokee nation, and violate a treaty stipulation
The constitution of Kansas does include it, and it makes no excep- tion
It does not put in this qualifying clause: " provided, however, no jurisdiction shall be ex- ercised over the Indian lands until the title has been extinguished by treaty." It includes the whole of it
You propose to admit; but you say Kansas shall not exercise any jurisdiction over them, and it shall not include the Indian lands
Do you change the boundary
You either do, or you do not
If you do not, it is nonsense to put It in, and it ought to be stricken out; and if you do, it ought to be resubmitted to the people of Kan- sas, or else you are choking down their throats, a constitution to which that people never con- sented
Which horn of' the dilemma will you take
I leave Senators to answer
Here is a constitution without any qualification; here is the bill saying, " come in; we take you with yourconstitution, but your constitution shall not be so and so." Missouri adopted her consti- tution, and there was a free negro clause, and Congress were so particular that they said the State should not come in until she declared, by a solemn public act, that that should not be con- 
strued to include free negroes; and they said she must go back and wait on account.of free nem•oes•, but when I propose to protect the rights of the Cherokee nation, now being civilized and christ- ianized and educated, under treaty stipulation, being property that they have paid then• money for, we are to disregard all that, and let Kansas in without sending back the constitution
Is that dealing with them as you dealt with Missouri
And here let me throw in, by way of episode, that although Coneress was so tenacious on that point with reference to Missouri, Iliinois has laws to this day to exclude free negroes; but Missouri could not get in, and had to be sent back and pass a solemn public act that she did not mean to ex- clude free necrroes
Here, where there is a serious matter, where there is one affecting the plighted faith of this nation, where there
is one that looks to the honor of the people who represent this na- tion, we say we will lot you in, but at thesame time your constitution is in conflict with the treaty." I know it may be said that you did the same thing years ago in your propositions and in your votes
Thank God there is a locus pæni- tentiæ—there is a time and place for repentance; but besides that, no man's attention was called to the subject, else the samc objection would have bccn made by me, for everybody can see that I would have done it
It had to go back and be re- submitted anyhow, and why not resubmit it with that as with anything else; and if our attention had been called to it, it would have been done
Now, Mr
President, I hope this reconsidera- tion will take place
I want this bill put in such a shape that we shall not be ashamed of our- selves, and blush when the chiefs of the Cherokee nation come up and demand of us to know why we violated a treaty and included within a State their lands, which it was specially stipulated should be excluded from every State
This attempted explanation, that the territorial bill did the same, an entire misapprehension
The t.erritorial bill nominally ran the boundary around it, but ex- cepted it out
We had the right to make that exception
Do you say we have the same right now
I answer, yes, we have; but Kansas in her constitution has not excepted it out; and if we except it out and she does not, ought it not to go back to Kansas for ratification, or will you not be forcing upon tlrem that to which they have neverassented, and choking it down their throats
If not, will there not be a conflict of jurisdiction, a collision, as the Senator from Ohio has well re- marked, between the Federal and State authori- ties

to pass the bill at any moment you •choose
however, tnust discharge' my duty in pressing these prominent, palpable objections, which must strike every man the moment he turns his atten- tion to them; and which, in my opinion, but for political considerations, would secure the unani- mous consent of the Senate
But for these con- siderations, I do not believe there would be one dissenting voice to my amendments
And is it possible, in these trying times; in these times when so much oucht to be done for conciliation; in these times, the hearts of: patriots are beginning to fail them, lest catastrophes may overtake the country and plunge us in ruin, that the Senatc will rush with such hot haste, and almost förbid t,he freedom of debate, for the pur- pose of voting down proper amendments, pro- posed on a measure where a little delay
cannot possibly injure anything, but whei•e hot haste and inconsiderate action may plunge us into diff- calties with the Indian tribes, and occasion other diffculties
'I'here is something in honor; there is something in plighted faith; there is something in a solemn pledge given to a weak people, a people whom we should foster and protect and cherish, for they are advancing with rapid strides towards greatness as an infant appendage to the I trust, sir, that we shall pause United States

GREEN
1 now call up the amendment that lies on the Secretary's desk, which was printed
The Secretary read the amendment; which was, to add at the end of the bill the following: and be it further enacted, That before this act shall take effect, the people of Kansas shall, by vote at such times and places as the Legislature by law shali order, assent to the provisions of this act, or until a convention of delegates shall thus assent, which delegates may be elected by the qualified electors as the Territorial Legislature directs, in- eluding, however, the whole of the territory embräeed in the limits herein prescribed as the boundaries of the State of Kansas
Mr
GREEN
A very words of explana- tion; I do not intend to repeat what I have said
This is to carry out in an effective form the views I have previously advanced, that this bill does make a change; that the people of Kansas ought to assent to it in some legal form; and if they do not, it will not be binding upon them; and I do not care whether it is a direct vote of the people orof •delegates sclected by them for that purpose
They may choose their own manner; they may select their own mode, and I shall be content; but put- ting in here a qualification to which they have never assented, I think makes it imperative on us to resubmit the question to them, out of abundant caution, to prevent any collision b&ween the I ask for the yeas Fcdcral and State authorities

Mr
DOUGLAS
I rise simply to say that I am ready to give a territorial government to the inhabitants of Pike's Peak whenever that propo- sition shall come up on its own merits
r thmk they are entitled to it
They have people enough to constitute a government; a much larger num- ber than most of the Territories häd when they were first organized; but I cannot vote to put it on this bill; and I think the Senator from Mis- souri is endangering the interests of the people of Pike 's Peak by trying to force it on a bill where he compels those who are most anxious to do jus- tice to those people to vote against it
He cer- tainly must rely on the friends of Kansas to pass a bill for Pike's Peak when it is to be passed
When he brings it up in its order, as a territorial measure, I have no doubt he can have it passed
Certainly I shall take great pleasure in giving it all the support I can; but I will not now encum- ber this bill with it
Mr
POWELL
1 move that the Senate ad- journ, and ask for the yeas and nays on the mo- tion
Mr
CAMERON
1 hope the Senator from Kentucky will withdraw his motion for a minute
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
CAMERON
1 to say— The PRESIDING OFFICER
The motion to adjourn is not debatable
Mr
CAMERON
1 hope the Senator will withdraw it for a moment
Mr
POWELL
1 withdraw it
Mr
CAMERON
I desire to make a sugges- tion, only because -I think we had bctter adjourn
'l'o continue here to-day will only irritate each other; and I satisfied that if we adjourn now, and meet ön Monday, this bill will go through the Senate then without any trouble
I am assured of that from gentlemen on both sides
Mr
BIGLER
It can go through in the morn- ing hour on Monday
Mr
GREEN
I give assurance if it be made the special order for half past twelve o'clock, not one word shall be said,' and not an amendment bc proposed by me
Mr
CAMERON
1 felt sure of that; and 1 was in hopes this bill would be got out of thc I think it troubles of the country at this time
would do a great deal of good to remove it out of tho way
I want it removed out
of the way; but in order to have it removed peacefully and cour- teously and properly, let us adjourn now; and we have assurance that it will be got through on Monday
Mr
POWELL
1 renew the motion to ad- journ
Mr
GRIMES
Mr
President— The PRESIDING OFFICER
motion to adjourn withdrawn 
Mr
POWELL
If the Senator from Iowa wishes to make a remark, very x,vell
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The is that the Senate adjourn
Mr
GRIMES
On that the yeas and nays have been called, I understand
if not, I ask for them
The ycas and nays were ordered
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 want to make a sug- gestion, by permission
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the motion to adjourn withdrawn
Mr
POWELL
1 withdraw Mr
TRUMBULL
The suggestion 1 to make is in reply to what was said by the Senator He ao•rees not to movc any from Missouri
amendments on Monday; but he cannot agree for others, and will not unaertakc to do so
Others rnay renew this scenc
Now, if there were an understanding in the Senate that this bill shall pass to-day to its third reading, so as to take the vote on Monday simply on the final passage of the bill, without amendment, at a particular hour, I, for one, ',vould be willing to agree to it; but we cannot make that agreement, as i understand
if we can; if gentlemen will sufför this bill to be ii reported out of the Committee of the Whole to- day, take its third reading, and stand for thc vote on its passaoe simply, so that there can be no amendment offered, and an understanding that there will be no shall be wiliing •to' assent to it
Mr
GREEN
Such ah understandihg be had
Mr
WADE, and others
Well' then:ø EÖ;on
Mr
GREEN
I desire to state expréås-ljänd• explicitly, that I do noi intend' to offei• måth-él$ amendment to this bill—except one„if.omvélled to remain •to-night, -If you postpone it on ment, shall not move a single one, noi will I: open my mouth except to vote; but to påss• iuo its third reading is equivalent to its - passage
There is one amendment that:wili be proposed when the bill comes out of the Committeel of-the Whole into the Senate, and that is by the Senator from Indiana, [Mr
FITCH,] and that is the only one
No Senator shall be deceived by anything 1 say
If we are going Oh now, and not going to a4journ, I have a four hours' speech' to make, all prepared
Several SENATORS on the Republican' Eide
GO ahead
wc shall be happy to hear 'it.' Mr
CLINGMAN
May 1 take of making a suggestion to Senators on both 
There IS but a single amendment to be votcd upon on Monday; and then, without discussion, we may @alq the final vote
Let that be understood, and it may relieve us from some inconvenience
I shall myself offer no amendment, and I propose to make no speech; but if there could be that understanding, perhaps it might serve our per- sonal convemence somewhat
Mr
FITCH
The amendment which 1 have offered, the Senator from Missouri has stated, will be renewed in the Senate
Such is the case, but there is no disposition on my part to debate it
If the Senate will adjourn until Monday morning, shall simply content myself with offering the amendment without two minutes' remark On the subject; and 1 am willing that the vote shad then be taken on that and on the bill
Mr
POWELL
I noiv renew my motion to adjourn
Mr
GRIMES called for the yeas and nays; and •they were ordered
Mr
MASON
I have paired off with the Sen- atorfrom Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN) on every vote that is to bé given on tliis bill
The question being taken by yeas and mys, resulted—yeas 18, nays 30; as follows: YEAS—Messrs
Bayard, Benjamin, Bigler, Bragg, Bright, Clingman, Fitch, Ilemphill, II unter, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Nichelson, *Polk, Powell, Saulsbury, Sebastian, 'I'hmnson, and Wigihll—18
NAYS—Messrs

So the motion to adjourn was not agreed to
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the amendment of the Senator from Mis- sourl
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President, it is proper that I should explain the åmendment a: little; and' I will do so as briefly as thécircumstances will well admit
T.he residue of my remarks will- be of a morc general character, and how far they may extend I cannot at present foresee
Every Sen- ator who looks at the constitution of Kansas will see that it cuts off one third of the territory lying beyond the twenty-fifth meridian from Washing- ton, and leavcs it without a government
pose in this amendment to organize that territory; and while it is true that I include a portion of other territory— Mr
CAMERON
Will the Senator from Mis- souri listen to me for a moment
I am one of those people who think we had better look at everything practically
I want to come to results; speeches will do no good; and I have made up rny mind that the Senator from Missouri is going Let us hear to make a very long speech
him." ] No, I do not want to hear him
He is a very eloquent gentleman, and sometimes I should be very proud and, of course, very much edified to hear him; but when he makes up his mind make a speech only to consume time, and thereby prevents me from going home not only to-attend to dinner, but to othei• duties, I do not Wtint to listen; and then the probability is that my friend, the Senator from Maryland over there; [Mr
KENNEDY,] will make a spcech, and my friend from Kentucky, [Mr
POWELL,] find the silent member from •Texas [Mr.
WIGFALL] may also  476 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 19, make a
speech
[Laughter.] I do not want to listen to all of them; and I think we had better take the word of these gentlemen that they wilk let us pass this bill on Monday without any debate and without offering amendments
Mr
BIGLER
We can take it up on Monday at half past twelve o'clock
Mr
CA*MERON
They only propose, then, to oflör a single amendment, and to have no de- bate
I think it is wiser we should go away to- day
I was very much instructed yesterday by what I learned in the
Senate, and to-day I want to digest what I heard yesterday about the Ad- ministration; and if we are kept here I am afraid I shall lose the thread of the story
I believe it is a great deal better for us and for the country that we should adjourn now, and let this matter be dcéided on Monday
I therefore move again that we adiourn
The PRESfDING OFFICER
The Senator from Missouri is entitled to the floor
Mr
CAMERON
He given way
Mr
GREEN
I did not give way, except to heår what the Senator had to say
The PRESIDING OFFICER
'The Senator from Missouri is entitled to the floor, if it is not talccn from him by his permission fora motion to adjourn
Mr
HALE
I ask the permission of the Sen- ator from Missouri, and i should like unanimous consent, to offer a resolution of inquiry, directed to the Secretary of the Navy, relative to a matter that is now before Congress
PRESIDING OFFICER
It requires unanimous consent
Mr
DOUGLAS, Mr
GREEN, and others, objected
PRESIDING OFFICER
The resolution cannot be received
Mr
GREEN
No motion to adjourn has yet merely wish been macle in order
make one explanation; and then, if the Senate consents to adjourn, I shall agree that
none of my amendments shall be renewed in the Senate, cither by myself or anybody else
The Senator from Indiana has stated that his proposition will be offered, and we shall come to a direct vote; but I do not waht to vote to-night, because you see the condition in which the Senate is placed
Fair- I ness cannot be done by voting now, and the vote cannot be taken until I have mti(lc my long speech
Would it not be better for us, therefore, at once to come to a common understanding
If we can- not, let us proceed
As I remarked before, this bill cuts off portion of the Territory west, and leaves it
wit.l')out government; and the necessity for this amendment exists, to all intents and pur- poses Mr
CAMERON
my friend from Mis- souri allow rne to interru pt him again 
IMI'
GREEN
I will hear what the Senator has to say
Mr
CAMERON
1 dcsirc to vote on this I am very well satisfied that if wc do not the Senator ('ron') Missouri will talk— Inalx-e a speech—and eloquent and able it will be; bul he may die under the excitementofit
[Laugh: ter.] I want to preserve his services to the coun- try; aud for his sake I hope we shall now adjourn, With the understanding that ncither he nor any of his friends will make any speeches in the Sen- ato on Monday
Mr
GREEN
Agreed
The PRESIDING OFFICER
A motion to adjourn cannot be mado without the consent of the' Senator from Missouri, unless he gives way for that motion
GREEN
1 will give way if the Senator will make the motion to adjourn, with the posi- five understanding of what I have said
Mr
BRAGG and others
That is enough
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- stands the Senat.or from Pennsylvania to move that the Senate adjourn
Mr

So the Senate refused to adjourn
Mr
GREEN
1 will proceed to explain the amendment which was read at the Clerk's desk
As I before remarked, a portion of the territory west of the proposed boundary of the State of Kansas was included in the Territory of Kansas
Being now cut off, it leaves it without any law, and without any organization
There is, there- fore, a manifest necessity for putting on this amendment, oro•anizing that Territory, and giv- ing them law and order
Gold has been discov- erod there; population has been rushing in; im- provements are being made; and I am informed, on reliable authority, that more than sixty thou- sand people are now livinrr in that region
1 wish to give them government; and the friends of Kan- sas may know this: it docs not delay the admis- In that proposition, I Sion of the State at all
I have no anti-slavery clause have no " or pro-slavcry clause
I have drawn it with scru- puious care, for the purpose of avoiding all con- trovers on a subject like that
Mr
%IGLER
Will the Senator from Mi'- souri allow me a moment
If I understand the
Senator rightlv, he commences his speech now under a threai that he will not stop for four hours
Mr
GREEN
No, sir
Mr
CAMERON
How long are you going to speak 
Mr
GREEN
When 1 make pledges, 1 al- I said had a four hours' ways fulfill them
speech within mc; but how much shall deliver depends on circumsgtar)ces
Mr
CLARK
1 hope the Senator from Mis- souri wili allow me to n'lake a remark to the gen- tlcrncn around him; and that is, that I hope no- body will interrupt him
I had good time
two or three ycars ago in .n)akinga speech all night, and I was illterrupted by others several tikilcs, i hope they will and it annoyed Ine deal
allow him to go on without interruption
I think he will get on much better in that way
Mr

No- body interrupted him on the occasion to which lie refers

[Laughtcr.] Mr

I was interrupted some way; I do not know how

Mr
CLARK
Perhaps you will want it more than (lid
[Laughter.] Mr
BAKER made a remark in an undertone
Mr
GREEN
I arn not so hungry as to desire or need the aid of a baker
[Laughter.] Mr
President, I was talking in good faith, not for delay; for while I have offered a number of amendments hero, I have offered overv single one of them because I believed it was rightl, and I have not opened mouth to constune titne
not occupied the floor for the purpose of delay; and the only single delay which I caused by dc- sign was when [ called for the reading of the last amendment which I proposed, and I did t.hat in order to crivc time friends to come in and have a fhir vote
To press a vote to-night, in the ab- sence of so nrany Senators, is not fäir
It
is true, you may say they had an opportunity to be here; but 1 told you ycktet•day they would not be here
I it; and hoped, therefore, you would let the subject go over to Monday, and we could have a vote then without any cavil, excuse, or delay
It is pressed on us to-night
Every effort to pass necessary amendment.s proves abortive
Every effort to get time fhr Senators to come in, in order to vote, täils
Underthese circumstances, I must speak to this amendment
Mr
PUGH
Will the Senator give way to me
I have never known any good from a night session in the Senate
Although I am in favor of the passage of this bill, and desire it should be passed before the adjournment, I see that nothing YEAS—Mcssrs

I move, therefore, that the Sen- ate adjohrn

STATE OF UNION
Mr
HARRIS, of Maryland, by unanimous consent, presented memorials, numerously signed by citizens of Baltimore, in favor of the adopti01') of what is known as the border State resolutions; which were laid on the table
Mr
LEACH, of North Carolina, asked and obtained unanimous consent to present t.o tbc E.louse the proceedings and action of a very large irrespective of party, held in the tow n of Lexington, North Carolina, upon the present alarmino crisis
The series of resolutions pusse:d at that Ineeting, with the and hope of' lead- incr to a settlement of our national trou!ples, were based upon the Crittenden propositions of adjust- ment, with some slight modifications, and h;
be- lieved they reflected the sentiments of nine tenths of the people of North Carolina, who patri- otic, Union-loving men, but who desired a fil')al settlement of the issues now agitatino• He invoked members to read, and give a mind 
respectful consideration to said resolutions, with the hope that the voice of North Carolina rnight be, in smne degree, instrumental in efli•cting an adjustment of our diffcalties
he resolutions were referred to the select com- mittec of five
Mr
FLORENCE
1 have in my hand memorials rnunerously signed by citizens of Phil- adelphia, asking Con:rress to pass the Crittenden I am daily in the receipt of rnen10„ propositions
rials signed by thousands ot• the citizens of Phil- adclphia arid the people of my State; and desire this fact to go out to tl'1C country to shot,v that the people of Philadelphia arc in favor of settling this difficulty 1.1 pon a proper basis
I desire to say further, that I intend on Monday to offer a proposition in the nature of an amend- ment to the propositions coming frorn the com- mittee of thirty-three
And inasmuch as all the propositions corning from that committee have been printed, with the conserlt of tl'le House will present my propositi01'l now and have it printed
I also take occasion to say, tl'lat on last Monday I submitted a motion to suspend the rules for the I purpose of giving the House an opportunity of considering the Crittenden propositions, which I suppose, cmne up on Monday motion will, next

BARRET
1 have been furnished with the procecdings of a meeting held in the city of St  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
Louis, on the 12th instant, and I beg leave.to pre- sent them to the House
The meeting was called, irrespective of party, to take into consideration the unförtunate condition of the country
It was comppsed of the very best men of the city, and the series of resolutions passed are able, eminently conservative, and in every way worthy of such a people
They heartily approve of the princi- ples of adjustment proposed by Mr
CRITTENDEN
That the other positions taken by this meetinff mav•be better understood, I will read the follow- ing extracts from the resolutions: That the possession ofslave property is a constitutional right, and, as such, ought to be ever recognized by the Fed- era! Government
That, if thc Federal Government shall fail and refuse to secure this right, the southern States should be fOund united in its defense—in which ovcnt Mis- souri wili share the connnon dudes and connnon danger of the Sonth
'Phat t.i1C discord prevailing for forty years between the people of thé northern and southern States, touching the ;-clitlion of the Federal Government to slavcry, affords suf- fieient reason for all sections ot•tbc Union to require a clear and final settlement of ali matters in dispute, by amend- rncnts to the ConstitUtion, so that the Slavery question may never a•yain disturb the public peace or itnpair the national harmony
'I'hat, holding these views, we are not prepared to aban- don the Union, with ali its blessings, while any hope ofad- justment remains
Until then, we will maintain our place in the Union, and contend iör.and demand our equal and constitutional rights, and wilt not be content with less
'l'hat, in the opinion of' this mccting, the employnent of tho Inilitary forces thc Government to cnförce sub- from-the citizens of the seceding States, will in- evitably plungc the country in civil war, and will innni- neatly endanger, if it do not entirely extinguish, all hopes of a settiunent of tl;e fearful issues now pending beföre the country
wc thereföre earnestly entreat: as well the Fed- cral Governinent as the seceding States, to withhold und stay the ann of military pourer, and on no pretext what- ever to bring m; the nation the horrors 0k' civil war, until the pcopke themselves gan take such action as our troubles dennand." The proceedings were laid on the table
Mr

NATHANIEL SMITII
Mr
HAMILTON
1 ask leave of the House to take from the Private Calendar bill NO
275, for the relief of the children of Lieutenant Na- thaniel Smith, deceased
I will state to the House that the report of the committee upon tbatclaim was unanimous
Lieu- tenant Smith was an old soldier of the war of 1812—14
He was in the battle of the Horse Shoe; *and was borne from the field by General Hous- ton, of Texas
He received a pension from the Government, which ran for several years
He subsequently removed to Texas, and his pension •vvas discontinued
The proof is abundant that he died in Texas of his wounds
His children now claim the amount of his pension from the amount; and I hope there will be no objection to taking up and passing t I-re bil\, ' l'he Clerk read th6 bill in ecten,so
It directs the Secretary of the Interior to place the name of lieutenant in the battle of the Horse Sh,oe, upon the pension roll, at the rate of $12 75 per month, to commence on the 4th of lvlarch, 1822, and to terminate on the 14th of July, 1834, the•amount to be paid to the surviving* children of said Lieu- tenant Nathaniel Smith
The bill was ordered to be enm•ossed, and repd a third time; and being engrossed, it was accord- in«yly read the third time, and passed
fivlr
HAMILTON moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed; and also moved that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table
The latter motion was agreed to

INDIAN HOSTILITIES
Mr

I rnovc that the rules be sus- pended, and the House resolve itself into the Committee of thc Whole on the state of the Union on the special order
The motion was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
MILI.soN in the chair.) The CHAIRMAN
The question before the committee is I-louse bill No
299, for payment of expenses incurred in the suppression of indian hostilities by the State of California
I ask tl'lat the original bill be I'v•lr
BURCH
read which I introduced; also, that the Clerk read the substitute reported frorn the Committee on Military Affairs, and the report which accompa- nies it
The Clerk read the original bill, the substitute, and the rcpot•t of the Committee on Military fairs in extenso
Mr
BURCH
Mr
Chairman, there is a dis- crepancy between the substitute and the original bill, as introduced by rnyseif
My bill appropri- ated for the payment of expenses in- currcd by the State of Caiifbrnia in the suppres- Sion of Indian hostilities
My State paid out of her treasury thirt.y to fifty dollars a month for the men she engaged In her service it') the suppression of those hostilities
The Committee on Mili- tary Affairs reduced that arnount of $500,000 to $400,000
Instead of allowing the amount paid by thc State of California to the soldiers in her service, they only allowed the amount paid by the Goverrnnelll to United States soldiers engaged ut the same time in similar services
The com- mittee camc to the conclusion that would cover all of these expenses
Believing that it is the best I can get for my State in payment of the expenses she incurred in the suppression of these Indian hostilities, am willing to accept the sub- stitute of the Committee on Military Affairs
Of course I would the adoption of my own bill

STANTON
This of consider- able importance, so far as the amount involved is coBcerned; and coming as it does from the Com- mittee on Mili.tary Affairs, perhaps I
ought to say a word in relation to it
It is a claim re- imbursement to tlie State of California, foo ex- penses incurred in the suppression Of
Indianl)os- tililies at sundry times during the years '1854, 1855, and 1856; it is a claim founded upon aprin- ciple so often recognized and settled, -that- the committee did not feel at.liberty to rejcciiL,hOw- ever much the amount might be
Similar claims for suppressing Indian hostilities have- been paid to Iowa, Missouri, and other States
This claim has this guarantee of its integrity and -honesty which good many other similar claims have not
The State of California, sir, has paid•out of its State treasury more than the amount that is pro- posed to be appropriated in the substituun may be assumed that the State of California would not take upon lierselfthe payment of unnecessary expenses, or expenses that were unnecessarily incurred
But, sir, the Committee on Military 'Affairs have not rested on the idea that the expenses incurred by California are to fix the amount for which this Government is responsible
That committee two years ago investigated the claim of Washington and Oregon for payment of ex- penses incurred in suppressing Indian depreda- 
tions, and on that occasion they settled upon some general principles, which they have-
adhered to from that time to this
These principles are mainly these: that this Government Shall pay no more upon claims for expenses incurred in the suppression of Indian hostilities than it paid for the regular service of the Army of the United States—that is, that volunteers shan receive no hiaber pay—that transportation and supplies should be paid for at no higher prices, than are paid to the regular Army of the United States, in service at the same time, in the same locå}ity
The Third Auditor of the Trcasury, a gentleman whose integrity and industry have become known to the House for his services in auditing claims of this description, is authorized by this bill to overhaul these claims of the State of Califoh)ia, to investigate the evidence of service and of trans- portation and supplies furnished, to:
satisfy himsclfi before any payment is -made* thut they arc reasonable in amount, and that the servicesand supplics have been fairly and honestly rendéred
The committee have provided in this bill what has not been provided In any other, •and that is, that the Third Auditor shall not bc required to audit and pay any claim for the suppression of Indian hostilities, which, in the opinion of the Secretary of War, was not necessarily and prop- erly incurved
The committee have acted upon the idea Ihat the executive department is the only proper department of the Government to determ- rnc when the necessity arrives for hostilities to suppress Indian depredations, and that Congress is incompetent, from its very constitution, to in- quire into the facts connected with the necessity It is properly an execu- for any such hostilities
tive duty devolving upon the Department havino• in charge the Army of the United States
There- fore the committee have provided that if, in the opinion of the Secretary of War, any of these expeditions were unnecessary, that there was-no exigency requiringhe service of any volunteers for the protection of the settlers, then the , Third Auditor shall reject the •claim for ekpenses curred in such expeditions..
see no-reason why this bill reported from the Committee on Mill- tary Affairs, as it is foundcd upon well recog- nized principles, should not be passed
The Scn- Lieutenant Nathaniel Smith, late of r Ilenncssoe, II to the substitute
 478 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 19, ate bill appropriates for these claims in the aggregate
The Committee on Military Af- fairs believed that the expenses could properly be reduced $100,000 by the investigation of the Third Auditor, and they tl'kerefore have provided only for the appropriation of $400,000
Mr
BURCH
Does the gentleman understand that this bill has assed the
Senate 
Mr
STANTOk I understand that it did pass the Senate
Mr
BURCH
It has not passed the Senate
The bill was introduced by me, and to the Committee on Military Affairs
Mr
STANTON
The gentleman is right, and for his bill the Committee on Military Affairs have reported this substitute
MAYNARD
Mr
Chairman, 1 rea- son to believe that in our intercourse with the In- dians we have Indian wars which arc gotten' up unnecessarily—or worse, from motives of spec- ulation, in order that largo claims may bc made I believe that the In- a(rainst thc Governmen t
dians are often causelessly aggravated into con- I would inquire of the chairman of thc Committee on Military Affairs whcnher, in the investigations of these claims, anything of that kind has appeared to have been the case in Cal- ifornia 
Mr
STANTON
The Committee on Militai.y Affairs did not make any inquiry into the cause If you make that a of these Indian hostilities
question in every bill which comes before the House for reimbursement, I think it is likely one half of the claims would be rejected; for, sir, I believe that in all our Indian wars, from thc or- ganj_zation of the Government, Indian hostilities have quite as frequently resulted from depreda- tions of reckless white men as from any other cause
However, Congress has never regarded that as sufficient reason for refusino• reimburse- ments for expenses incurred by State or Terri- tory for military expeditions, rendered necessary for the protection of frontier settlements and the safety ofthc lives of women and children , al though the alleged cause of tho war may have been the acts of reckless white men, with a view possibly to speculation
r l"he committee huvc done the only thing which they think is practicable in this or in any other State
'1' hdy have required the Secretary of War —the proper Executive Department—to institute that
inqun•y in every case; and if, in his judg- ment, these expeditions were unnecessary and unauthorized, then the committee have directed that no payment shall bc made for such disburse- ments
'Chat is all the committee thought they could do
Mr
CURTIS
It secrns to me that the impu- tation which has been cast upon the frontier men by my friend frorn Cl'ennossce, (Mr
MAYNARD,] ought to be responded to
I have before heard the sarne imputa.tion cast upon tlmem
The charge is, that the people of t'hc frontier are in the habit of getting up Indian wars merely för purposes of speculation
'l'hat has been charged to bc the cage in regard to t hc Oregon and Washington war, for which claims are beforc Congress
And it seems to be conccdcd, by common con- sent, that such a thing is possible
Reflect onc moment upon the circumstances on which such a belief is founded
The frontiers are very exposed; settlements and homes are isolated, and always liable to incursions from the Indians
VVhat pos- Sible pecuniary motive could induce the isolated settlers to try to draw upon themselves the cruel- ties of a savage warfare
The thing is so absurd in theory that I should think rational men and statesmen would at once see its improbability
I have lived in the West most of my life, and havc bccn in almost every frontier State of Union, and in tho Indian territories west of every State of the Union
I have been on the plains, in the huts of the settlers, and partook of their hospitalit.ies, their firesides, and united in their protection and defense
I know their anxiety and their fearful apprehension in regard to the Indian wa rfa re
From rny own experience and obser- vation, I co.n attest, and I h(fe protest, that none of Ille settlers, und none of the traders arnong the Indians, desire war
the contrary, it is their desire their in terest ways to cultivate peace
Truc, there are those on the frontiers—lawless and wicked men—who do sometimes encroach upon the rights of the Indians; stir up difiiculties bc- tween themselves and thc savages with whom tory of the Indians in Kansas were legal, because I they associate; and then the Indians, incensed think they were ilicoal; but they were undu misapprchension; and the difficulty of the Fed- at individual acts of wickedness, retaliate with depredations upon the whites
Such wras the case in Nebtaska, n year ago last summer, when I happened accidentally to bc in that Territory; and I Sound twenty or thirty miles of settlement had been laid waste bv the Indians, and the whole country in a panic of fear and trepidation
The settlements of the frontiers are scattered; the settlers are not surrounded by their friends; and when their homes are desolated, they have no relief, and can receive no assistance from their friends
Of all thc people on the earth, the fron- tier people are the last to seek and desire difficul- ties with the Indians
When their homes are destroyed, there is no neighbor's door open to receive and shelter them; for their neighbors may be very remote, and they are not prepared to Indian wars ought not to shelter the destitute
be charged to States or to communities
They grow out of those accidents which will occur amon& savaoes, and which you cannot avoid
'I'here are men everywhere, reckless of consc- quences, who have no interest at stake, and who would not hesitate to create troubles wiKh the In- dians
They engage
in any strife; and where it occurs with Indians, they, of course, retaliate by war upon the whites
These men prowl al)out the frontiers and settlements, as they also livc among us
Such men stir up diffculties every- where; but I beg Congrcss to cease to charge these things upon communities and states, as if speculation and profit would be the result of a bloody war with the Indians, which would inure so much to their pecuniary profit that they would involve themselves in the sanguinary hazard
Mr
MAYNARD
would like to ask the gcntlcn•ian a ql.tcstion
Tho gentleman from Iowa has had much better opportunity to become acquainted with thcsc Inattcrs than I have, and I ask him whether hc does not know that, within therc have been incursions and en- the last year, croachm(fl'lts madc by the settlers in Kansas upon the lands belonging to the various Indian tribes, and, arnong others, those bclonginT to the Chero- kee I ndians; whether thcy were not notified that they would have to be removed, by the Commis- sioner of I ndian Affairs; and whether they did not remain there, in defiance of the notice from the Government, until the Government Ivas obliged, by force, to remove thcm; and whether that re- moval has not been made the pretext for the raids, incursions, and depredations of Montgomery and his gang of lawlcss men
I ask whether these facts are not so
It is so reported to us, and so believed
We havc this very rnorning furnished the gentleman from 'I'cxas, in the Army bill, with a regiment of troops to rcprcss Indian hostilities upon the pnrt of the Governmcnt
The settlers were not
doing it; mod I thought the appropria- tion right, and voted for it
Mr
CURTIS
Mr
Speaker, 1 will answer the I do know that gentleman with great pleasure
avarice and cupidity have induced incursions into Indian territory, as it sometimes does in ncigh- I know this disposition of fillibustcr- horhoods
ino• i* one of the most fruitful causes of contro- vcrsies in regard to the rights of whites and' In- I know that the Cherokee Indians have dians
boon often obliged to expel those who have pn- cronc,hed upon thcir peaceful and wcll-defined tcr- I have been arcsidel)tupon thcir frontier; and I know they are a very peaceable, worthy, and quiet people
Of course, there will be intru- sions in all countries
They exist between in- dians and whites,as well as between whites them- selves
But that is not a qucstion of speculation, but a question of right between the whites and Indians
Thc right of dominion is a very diffcr- ent qu—tion, and often leads to difficulties be- tween whit.es, as well as whites and Ind;ans
In reference to the Montgomery raid, I do not understand that •it has any reference to encroach- ments made upon the Cherokee Indians
That is a race of civilized Indians, settled and estab- lishQ,d under their own laws and institutions; and they exhibit a degree of forbearance and civiliza- tion which many of us might very well profit by
Mr
CLARK, of Missouri
1 desire to answer the question propounded by the gentleman from rronncssee in refirenc.p.• to the settlements upon the indian territory of Kansas
I will not say that the settlements or the whites upon the terri- Cial Government with the citizens•of Kansas who settled upon that territory grew out of that mis- apprehension
i hope this bill for the payment to California of what has been paid by that State to repress Indian hostilities will not be prejudiced by any collateral matter drawn in in this way
Thig is an honestdebt, which we owc to a sister State; and it was incurred by that State in suppressing Indian hostilities when they came down upon the frontier settlers, and •cevould have destroyed them but for the efforts of the State
I feel an in- terest in this matter, because I have experience, I appreciate the to some extent, in pioneer life
diffculties in settling 
Indian hostilities, having had some such in my owi State
As was well said by the gentleman from Iowa, [Mr
CURTIS, I I know it is believed, by men who håve had no experience of practical life upon the frontiers, that the white citizens encroach upon the righls of the Indians, and comrnU depredations upon them
'There is a belief of that sort; but the pio necr settlers in all countries with which I have any acquaintance arc the most honest, the bravest, the most hospitable, the most generous, the most peaceable, and the most law-abiding people it has ever been my lot to be acquainted with
California is filled vit'h many of my own ac- quaintances from the State of Missouri; and I ask upon this occasion to vindicate their bravery, in- tegrity, and honesty; and I say this claim should be allowed
without hcsitation
Mr
BURCH
I desire to make one rcmark in rcfercnce to the objection of the gentleman from Tennessee, and I must say I am surprised that such an objection should cmnc from him
Mr
MAYNARD: 1 desire to disabuse the gentleman from California
I did not interpose any objection; only made an inquiry
Mr
•BURCH
HIS inquiry was, whether these wars were not got up for the purposes of specu- In this particular instance I know that lation
was not the case
Thcse wars were instituted by the Governor of our State, after repeated applica- tions to the officers of the General Government, to suppress these depredations
Our State author- ities have had no disposition to entail unnecessary expenses on our General Government; but have in- variably acted on the defensive, and only to afford necessary protection to our citizens
We are the rnost remote of all our States save one
We are constantly subjected to harasses and disturbances, to which you oftho older States are total strangers
I hope, for your own sakes, you may ever remain so
But, sincc I havea personal acquaintance with these hardships, and know the propriety of this appropriation, I hope I shall be pardoned for this trespass on your time, in urging the passage of the bill
I was present when rnany of these ap- plications wcrc made, and was instrumental, as a member of the Senate of our State, in the passage of an appropriation bill, paying a portion of this war debt out of our own treasury, and issuing bonds for the rest of' it
was more surprised that.this objection should havc come from the gentleman fi•orn
Tennessee than I should have been had it come from any other member of the House; because I believe that tl'lis policy of paying far tho suppression of Indian hostilities by the States originated with a Senator from his own State—General Jackson; it was in- augurated in 1828, and has been continued down to the present time
At the last session of Con- gress we appropriated to the Stato of Iowa for Inoncys expended by her in similar ex- peditions
We have this morninæ voted over a million dollars to Texas, another frontier State
-Why has the gentleman permitted all these mat- ters to pass by without objection
I presume hd must have some special information of tl)e fact that these wars have been got up by the people of California for the purpose of speculation
As was said by the gentleman from Iowa, I do not think x,ve should have discharged our duty, if we had remained quiet, and permitted these insinua- tions to pass unnoticed
One of tbese wars oc- curred in my own senatorial district; and I svell acquainted with the character of the Indians in that country
We have two rnountain ran«res of eight hundred miles in extent, which wore filled with hostile Indians
I believe that we have now  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
suffciently subdued the host.ile Indians in the State, and I doubt very much if there will ever a•ain bc any application from oura State for the payment of exnen*s of suppressing Indian wars
1 believe the Indians have been tho-roughly sub- dued> so far as we are concerned
I do not know how it may be in the neighboring Territories and State, because last winter there was an Indian war going on in Washoe; but i believe that, so far as our State is concerned, we are entirely rid of the hostile Indians who have been the country
I hope there will be no further objection urged to this bill
The subatitute has been reported unanimously, I believe, from the Committee on Military Affairs
I have a letter from the Third Auditor of the Treasury, written this winter, rec- ommending the principle of settlement which has been adopted by the committee
The Treasury is thoroughly guarded by the substitute; and it is impossible for us to get adollarunless we have expended it, or incurred it necessarily, in the opinion of the Secretary of War
I hope there will bc no further objection to the bill
Mr
STOUT
Mr
Chairman, 1 do not desire to detain the committee more than a moment in relation to this matter; and I would not say a word but for the fact that I know something in relation to this claim from my own observation
In 1856 a portion •of this debt was incurred
At that time I was a citizen of the State of California; and as a member of the Legislature of that State, 1 voted for and assisted in the passage of an appropria- tion of the sum of $15,000 towards carryin• on this war of which it is now proposed to pay the expenses
That $15,000 was put under the con- trol of the officers prosecut.ing the •war, and only some six or seven thousand dollars of it was ex- pended
I allude to that fact to show that thcre was no unnecessary extravagafice the carryincx on of the war, and only what •„vas necessary was used at the time
I know, also, that during that time the Gov- ernor of the State of California applied to the commander of the military division upon that coast for assistance, and his answer was, that he could not furnish troops for the suppression of these hostilities
Hence it was absolutely ne- cessary that a volunteer force should be called into the field; and I trust that, in justice to those people, the debt will bc paid
will not attempt to reply to the suggestions made by the gentleman from Tennessee in rela- tion to these Ifid ian I,vars being got up for purposes of speculation, and that such things are often done by the frontier people
That has been properly •responded to by the gentleman from Iowa
MAYNARD
1 would ask the from California if it is intended to pay interest on these disbursements 
the bill will not even Mr
BURCH
No, sir; reimburse the State the amount she has abso- lutely expended 01' incurred
Mr
MAYNARD
The bill is as to in- tercst
Mr
BURCH
I will statc to the gentleman that thc amount paid under this bill will not come within $100,000 of the amount which tho State has absolutely paid out or incurred; but I was willing to accept it as tlle best that we could ob- tain from the Committee on Military Affairs
We paid our common soldiers from thirty to fifty dollars a month, our captains $100 a month, and our other offcers from $100 a month down to fifty doliars
But,this bill reduces the pay of our officers and soldiers to what is paid by the General Gov- ernment to thc regular Army California; so that we lose, in that one thing, about one hundred thousand dollars
Mr
MAYNARD
been paid the money they have expended in the prose- cution of Indian wars, in which they have been engaged, the policy of the Government has been not to allow interest excepting where it has been shown affirmatively that the State had iLself paid interest 01' used un intcrcst-bearing fund
I was about to offer a proviso to brin«y this case within that rule; but, as the gentleman from California assures me that the payment of interest is not contemplated, I will not offer the amendrnent
Mr

Mr
WASHBURNE,0f Illinois
1 hope there will be some explanation of this matter, because it opens a very widö door
Mr
POTTLE
The facts are all stated in the report; but I can explain thc matter in a few words
The rcvcnue cu tter Harriet Lane A MEMBER
Let the report be read
It appears therefrom that The report was read 
when the late expedition to Paraguay was set on foot, t.lle Secretary of the Navy, not having a sufficient m.unber of vessels at his disposal, called upon the Secretary of the 'I'reasury för the tem- porary use of a revenue cutter; and accordingly the Harriet Lane and her officers were transfL•rred to the Navy Dcparttnent•, and were for nearly twelve months under the control of the flag-officer of that expedition
Captain Faunee asks for him- self and his assistant oflieers the sarne pay, while thus engaged, as was received by the offcers of the
Navy who were assimilated in grade
The Committee on Naval Affairs deemed the request to be reasonable; and, finding that it is not with- out preceden t, they recommend the passage of the joint resolution
I think that Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
that joint resolution ought to bc referred to a Com- mittee of tbc Whole House

, with all the costs which may have been incurred in any proceedings which may have been instituted in the matter
Mr
MAYNARD
Without some explanation of that bill, shall object
Mr JOHN COCHRANE
1 intended to give the House an explanation which will unquestion- ably .be satisfactory to every gentleman
On the 7th of October, 1859, these parties entered into bonds to transport twenty quarter casks of brandy I to New Orleans
A warehousing entry was made, and the transportation bonds given to deliver the casks to the collector at New Orleans
Instead of being delivered to him, however, they were de- livered to the consignee, which was a breach of the law, and the bonds were therefore forfeited; but the act having been committed out of the ig- norance of the parties, and the Government losing nothing by the operation, the parties paying the duties on the goods, with six per cent
interest, it is evident and clear that the bonds should be can- celed
The recon-nnendation of thc Secretary of the Treasury is that this relief shall be given by Congress, because he is assured and believes that the transaction was one in good faith, although it was a violation of-the law
Mr
McCLERNAND
wish to inquire of the gentleman from New York whether the proof is clear that these parties have discharged their obiizations by the payment of the duties on the goods

Thc ball partially fractured the i)one and lodged in his leg, r lthe veins of his but was afterwards extracted

After the wound he remained in the Army, though un- able to perform field duty
He was cmptoyed mostly in the recruitinm service, and was honor- ably discharged
He failed to receive the sur- geon 's certificate for a pension, w ben hc left the Army, from the, Surgeon 's neglect of duty, or other cause unknown

TUESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1861
of Lucas county, Ohio, on the pension rolls of the United States, at the ratc of ei&ht dollars per month, from January 1, 1861, to continue during his natural life
The report states that the petitioner is a grand- of Robert De Navarre, intendant and sub- d Slimué of Detroit, in the present State of Michi- gan,during thereign of Louis X V
The petitioner volunteered to serve under General Hull, on the northwestern frontier, in the capacity ofa scout
At the time of Hull's surrender, at Detroit, he was among the prisoners, and was sel'lt
home on parole
Afterwards he broke his parole and ten- dered his services to General Winchester; served him at Riyer Raisin ; gave him early information of the approach of the British army; and took part in both actions of Colonel Lewis on the 18th I January, 1812, and the engagement of the next day, which resulted in the deföat of the Ameri- cans
At the time of the surrender of Major Mad- ison, finding himself in a position where his life was forfeited by a violation of his parole, he escaped from the British and Indians, incurring great hardship for many days in mid-wintcr, in traveling through the wilderness returning to his home
When General Harrison came into thc Northwest with his army, he sent for the peti- tioner, and encraoed with him to serve as a scout, for the sum of onc dollar per day, until the close of the war
The petitioner was frequently sent by General Harrison, while in this service, with messages from onc point to another; on one oc- casion goil'10 on foot to Urbana, in southern Ohio, through the urilderness, with a message to Gov- ernor Meies; and again, on the day preceding the battle of Lake Erie, carrying a message from General Harrison, at Fort Seneca, to Commodore Perry, at Put-in bay; he was present and aided in tbc defensc of Fort Stephenson, under Colonel Croghan, and accompanied the army on its marc.l'i in pursuit of Proctor, and took part in the battle of the 'I'lltuncs
He is now poor and old, (being in his severity-scvcnth year,) and, in consequence of disabilities occasionöd by long exposure while in tile, arduous and exposed service, is and has been for a nurnbcr of years unable to procure a livelihood for himself und family

While there his wife died, leaving four childfcn ; and some friends were induced to enter bail for him in the sum of $15,000 for his appearance at court to take his trial, which recognizance was fulfilled without delay or for- feiture.- His means appeared to have been ex- hausted, and to prepare the necessary means-of defense, as well as to provide support for his fam- ily, he gave judgments to several other creditors, amounting, altogether, to $7,165, which were entered, in like manner as Shroder's judgment, at the respective dates mentioned in the prolhon- Otary 's certificate

724, for the relief of Sampson Stanfill, and that it be now put on its passæPe
There was no objection, and it was ordered accordingly
The bill, which was read in extenso, providcs that Sampson Stanfill shall be released and dis- charged from all claim and demand of the United States to the balance of money now remaining due upon a certain judgrnent recovered against him in favor of th&United States before the circuit court of the United States of Tenncssec, holden at Knox- Ville, which was recovered on a rccomoizance en- tered into by him as surety for Lewis G
Stanfill
It appears, from the report, that Lex.vis J
Stan- fill, at the term of the United Stmes circuit court holden at Knoxville, Tennessee, in November, 1858, was charged with having passed counterfeit coin, purporting to be a Mexican silver dollar, and upon this charge an indictment was found against him
Stanfiil and his father, Sampson Stanfill, entered into a recognizance in the penal sum of $2,000, conditioned for the appearance of Lewis J
Stanfill, to appear before the court to Mr
LOVEJOY , from the Committee on Public Lands, reported a bill for the relief of Sallie C
Northup; which was read a first and second time by its title

She carne into the possession ot• them by the death of her brother, who was formerly' a citizen of Mobile, Alabama
I It is a case like that passed at the last session in favor of Robert Johnson, of Philadelphia
answer the complaint, and not to depart the court without leave
Stanfill did appear to answer the indictment, and the same was called for trial
The court', upon examination of the law, decided that the offense was not within it* jurisdiction, but no formal judgment of discharge was ren- dared
'l'he respondent left the court, and subse- quently a default was obtained upon the recog- nizance, and a judgment subsequently rendered in favor of the United States against Sampson Stanfill, the father of the original respondent, for the sum of $2,000 and costs
Upon this judgment, Samp- son Stanfill has paid to the United States $1,000 and costs, leaving the balance of the judgment unpaid
The bill was ordered to be cnm•ossed, and read third tune; and being engrossed, it was accord- ingly read the third time, and passed

STEPIIEN DUNNELL
Mr
COLFAX.- I ask the unanimous consent of the House 10 discharge the Committee of the Whole Housc on the Private Calendar from the further consideration of House bill No
390, for the relief of Stephen Bunnekl, and to put it on its passage
The bill only failed last session for want of time
The bill, which was read, provides that the name of Stephen Bunncll, of Indiana, a sergeant of the war of 1812, be placed upon the list of pensioners of the United States, for and during his natural life, at the rate of fifteen dollars per month, com- mencing from 18th January, 1858
appears from the report that Mr
Bunnell, who served as quartermaster's serceant in the artillery corps of the United States Army for five years, from March, 1812, to March, 1817, testifies, under oath, that he entered the Armv in robust health; that his physical powers were broken down by arduous service and exposure in his specially hazardous line of duty; and that now, in his old age, with his constitution broken down, being unable, from his failure to claim a discharge, when sick, and, from the death of his captain avid comrades since, to furnish the evidence required at the Pension 13ureau, he applies to Congress for its recognition
He was the first who landed at the taking of Fort George, shared in the capture of Queenstown Heights, participated in the bat- tle of Stony Creek, lying on the wet ground at nights with the rest of the army, on their march thither, which caused him such sickness as to confine him for many months in the hospital at Yourpstown
Althoumh this sickness has im- i paired his system ever since, he recovered suffi- ciently to again join the Army, and to man the gun under his charge at the battle of Chippewa
At Lundy's Lane, his captain being slain and his lieutenant wounded, he took command, under direction of General Scott, of the last gun left to his company, and kept it in operation till he had but one man left; and his ammunition was ex- hausted, when he succeeded in getting the gun from tho field of bat.lle
At Fort Erie, hc was honored with a command above his rank, namely, of a battery in a specially exposed condition, in front of the gate of the fort ; and by its discharges, after the fort had been taken by the enemy, blew it up, discomfiting the whole British detachrnent
He x.vas wounded in the wrist at Chippewa, and at Fort Shelby was badly injured in the sltou)der by a fall occasioned by rotten timber in a bridge; but had ncvcr claimed a pension on account of those injuries, not deeming at the time that, would ever need it
The bill was ordered to bc engrossed, and read  1861

Itis the balance of an amount due him, and in reference to which, I understand, there is no dispute at all
