 to their wishes reconsider his
 resolution Mr DAVIS Mr President
 in the very words which
 i addressed to the Senate
 yesterday I in It was
 tcndcd to express simply my
 conviction not a matter of
 personal feeling with me know
 myself no public duty cvm
 is My opin ion was
 that thc State of Mississippi
 having takerx the subject illto
 her own hands could not
 expect to work advantageously on
 the committee Ncither could I
 under the circumstances enter upon
 the labor as willingly as
 trust I have usu all
 public service But if in
 the ally done in opu
 ion of others it be
 l ossible for me to
 do any thincr for the
 public good the last morncnt
 v h i le I
 stand hcrc is at the
 command of the Senate If
 I could see any n
 eans by which I could
 a vort the catastrophe of
 a struggle bet ween the
 sections of In y past
 life I hope gives evidence
 of the effort the readiness
 witli which I would Inalce
 If there be any sacrifice
 which I could on thc
 altar of my country to
 heal or prospective no Inan
 has the right to doubt
 nw r svhen Senators en
 readiness to do it tertaining
 the saine opinions with myself
 camc to me and expressed
 regret that I had refused
 to serve I could but
 tell that 1 had only
 obeyed what I believed to
 be propriety in the case
 not desiring to shrink from
 the of duty still i
 therefore less to indulgc in
 personal feeling answer thc request
 of the Senator from Florida
 knowing also that it is
 made after consultation with others
 that if the Senate choose
 that I should and continue
 to bc placed upon the
 conmnittee shall offer no further
 opposition serve there The PRESIDING
 OF ICER lthc motion to

 this morning directing the Vico
 President to fill t be

 I to have the opinion

 Mr FITZPATRCK Iknow there has
 been soine diversity of ov
 inion as to the effect
 of the two rales which
 have been read but I
 fhink the Fencn al practice
 has been that the unfil

 takes pr over ar y
 special order and i therefore
 in no y opini01 the
 Chair was riEht in ruling
 in stating that it his

 of th various chairmen who
 have presided tempo rarily in

 in soille v ay M
 LL i thin k a
 as to rulil g of
 the Senate on this point
 ily recollection is different that
 of the Chair s Ve
 have dis cussed this matter
 once or twic e and
 y ro c l lcction
 is that a special order
 for a particular hour comes
 up notwithstanding the Senate inay
 have Vlous The PRESIDING OFFICER
 With the the House She
 is a very old woman
 and whether mission of the
 Senator from Illinois the Chair
 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 185
 finished business to day the
 bill to which the I
 Senator from Vermont alludes would
 be the busi ness first
 in order and the fact
 that the unfin isht d
 business was not madc special
 order pre viou s to
 its being taken 11 p
 by the Senate makes no
 difference If a bill is
 taken up and is undis
 posed of by the Senate
 and the body adjourns upon
 it then uuder the determinatior
 always put upon these rules
 it becomes unfinished business and
 entiticd to precedence on the
 succeeding day I know it
 is repeatedly the case that
 Senators charge of particular business
 who are i anxious that
 _it shall not bc overridden
 call up just before the
 Senate adjourns so that they
 may have ic in order
 the next day as the
 first business at one o
 clock After the unfinished business
 shall have been disposed of
 either by being fin ished
 or by being postponed or
 by being laid aside in
 any other way then the
 special order of which the
 Senator from Vermont speaks becomes
 the first business in order
 and so on Since I
 have been connected with the
 chair I think it has
 been held that all unfinished
 business upon which the Senate
 adjourned takes precedence over It
 has certainly been my con
 all special orders struction Mr
 COLLAMER It is true that
 there was a period when
 perhaps the practice was exactly
 as stated by the honorable
 Senator frorn Alabama but the
 31st rule was madc to
 obviate and seLlle this very
 difficulty That is a new
 rule inserted i on a
 revision ot our rules within
 the last two or three
 years The effect of the
 principle which I Mr MASON
 If the Senator will allow
 me Republican party are our
 mortal enemies and the suggestion
 was made by the Senator
 from Missouri and I think
 acquiesced in by the Sen
 ate that he would not
 insist on the question of
 order provided the Senator from
 Tennessee was allowed to have
 the floor on this bill
 The Sen ator from Vermont
 I presume did not so
 under stand it Mr COLLAMER
 1 did not so understand
 it Mr MASON If that
 be the fact I must
 insist on the question of
 order and the vote of
 the Sen ate Mr COLLAMER
 I do not know that
 it will make any difference
 Were I to take the
 floor on the Kansas bill
 atld urge its passage the
 gentle rnan from Tennessee might
 take the floor imme diately
 following me and make his
 remarks It probably amounts to
 the same thing On that
 suggestion I will not insist
 on the floor now if
 the gentlen an wishes to
 take it on the bill
 but will permit him to
 do so Mr NICHOLSON Mr
 President 1 took the floor
 the other day with no
 expectation that tl le bill
 for the admission of Kansas
 would be the question for
 consideration by the Senate Ari
 other question however somewhat germane
 to it in the views
 which I shall present was
 expected r I he remarks
 which I to be before
 the Senate shall make though
 tl iey will not be
 directed par ticnlarly to the
 propriety or impropriety of the
 admission of Ka nsas will
 have a bearing upon onc
 of the consequences of that
 increase in the number of
 free States I shall there
 the gentleman states that the
 unfinished business fore proceed to
 pursue the line of argument
 in would take precedence of
 all special orders would reference
 to the present crisis in
 our couritry be to deprive
 this body of the power
 of making m y special
 order which would be at
 all effective if there were
 any business which remained under
 In that condition discussion for
 a long period of things
 the Senate could take up
 nothing they made a bill
 a speciat order ever so
 many times so long as
 any unfinished business contin I
 ued on tho table though
 it was itself never a
 spe it would overrule them
 all and Cial order at
 all supersede ail power in
 the Senate to make any
 special orders that would have
 any effcct and as there
 is no mode of putting
 an end to debate by
 oar rules everything might be
 superseded and unfinished business The
 I t hat forever by
 the 31st rale was made
 for the very purr ose
 of givino a different direction
 to business and securing pre
 cedencc to the special orders
 over everything else in the
 order in which they are
 so made when the time
 comes for which they were
 assigned When that time arrives
 it is made the duty
 of the Chair I to
 call them up that they
 may have precedence I am
 not now unless the Senate
 order otherwise which I had
 designed pursuing before this change
 in the order of business
 In the course of the
 speech delivered by the Senator
 from Ohio Mr WADE the
 other day hc made the
 fallow incr remurks I have
 listened to the complaints on
 the other side patiently and
 with an ardent desire to
 ascertain what was thc particular
 dtflicu t y under which
 they were laboring Many of
 those who have supposed themselves
 aerurieved but I confess that
 I am now t0Lally unable
 have spoken to uDdcrstand precisely
 what it is of which
 they com And further on
 the same Senator said But
 what has caused this great
 excitement Sir I I do
 not and I say it
 will tell you what I
 suppose it is frankly so
 much blaine the people of
 the South because they believe
 and they arc led to
 believe by all the intönn
 ation that cver cmnes before
 then that we the don
 inant party to day who
 have just seized upon the
 reins of this Governtnent are
 their Inortal entnnies and stand
 ready t o They have
 been told trarnple their institutions
 under root l_ heir misfOrtnnc
 or their so by our
 encnlies at the North fault
 is that they have lent
 a too easy car to
 the insinua wouid not bear
 us in the same speech
 the Senator And again talking
 about a contest hetween two
 special orders said but the
 subject of this unfinished business
 was Now what do you
 complain of You are going
 to break never madc a
 special order at all This
 bill has up this Govertnuent
 you are to involve us
 in war been made so
 and suppose some others in
 due and blood fro n
 a n nere suspiciou that
 we shall justity that tiune
 will corne up in tbc
 same way Now I say
 that the 31st rule was
 made for the very purpose
 of enabling the Senate to
 make special orders that would
 come up at the hour
 fixed notwithstand Mr GREEN 1
 think the Senator from ver
 mont is clearly right if
 these resolutions were never made
 the special order but to
 obviate all take up the
 Kansas question and let the
 Senator frorn Tennessee proceed on
 that just as well as
 on the other The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The bill which the
 Chair announced at one o
 clock wliich is the bill
 for the admission of Kansas
 into the Union is now
 before the Senate and in
 the opinion of the Chair
 it will require a vote
 of the Senate to displace
 that and bring forward anything
 else That is the question
 now before the Senate the
 bili H R No 23
 for the ad Eilission of
 Kansas into lhe Union subject
 of course to the control
 of the Senate in relation
 to givincr any other ques
 Mr NICHOLSON What the bill
 before the Senate viiicil we
 staud everywhere pie dced not
 to do Would you be
 justified in the eyes of
 the Civilized world in taking
 and predicating it on a
 bare so Ilionst rous a
 position arouudless suspicion seems then
 Mr President that this gloom
 which hangs over the cotantry
 and which is secn and
 fell by us all aud
 freely admitted by the Sen
 Ior has no better foundation
 in his esti Ination than
 the groundless suspicion that the
 party soon to take possession
 of the Goverrnnetlt Is it
 possible intends to do something
 wronff that this feeling which
 pervades the whole coun try
 which manifests itself in all
 oar intercourse which is seen
 in the countenances of all
 men and which indicates the
 fearful looking for of some
 sad calarnity that is about
 to befall the country is
 only the result of an
 idle delusion Is it possible
 that this wide spread disastrous
 pecuniary and com mercial revulsion
 that has taken place this
 de struction of private and
 public credit which within the
 last sixty days has diminished
 the actual value of the
 estates of men in this
 country from twenty is it
 possible I say that five
 to fifty per cent all
 these consequences these apprehensions thesc
 dangers are the fruits of
 an idle baseless ground The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The bill for
 less susplcion on the partofsouthern
 men Ifit believing that s
 he does not think we
 are so much to blame
 but in th next breath
 he says be lieve this
 upon unfounded we listen to
 none but the mortal enemies
 Of t hk publican party
 at the North a ndüthab
 we wil lt i iot
 hear that party itself I
 suppose the Sénaeor alludes to
 those in the North as
 mortäl who stand opposed to
 the Republican party As a
 matter of course he embraces
 within this desig nation the
 Democraticparty of the Noreh While
 I freely concede that he
 is right in sayingthat of
 the South believe his party
 our mortal enemies I deny
 that that conviction n madeon
 our minds from Information either
 true or false derived ex
 ciusively or mainly even from
 our friends of the North
 W c have for them
 the highest appreciation In regard
 to them it is my
 pleasure to say that in
 the South we have for
 years confided in them as
 faithful friends and true pa
 triots We have re garded
 them as standing as a
 barrier between our I rights
 and interests and the aggressions
 of ogr enemies and but
 for their faithful and efficient
 exertions and devotion to the
 const itutional rights of all
 sections this crisis which is
 nöw upon us would have
 come years vo It would
 åt leagt havc come in
 1856 My only regret is
 that they have not been
 able still to stem the
 Current of sed tionalism and
 fanaticism that has overwhelmed thein
 and brought full to our
 view the terrors of a
 dissolving Union Whatever may come
 in the future though this
 Union may be dissolved though
 we may separate into two
 confederacies there is one thing
 that will always be remembered
 by southcrn men and that
 is the fidelity and bravery
 and disinterestedneés with which north
 ern men bavc stood by
 and sustained and defend cd
 our rights until the power
 of sectionalism has at last
 crushed them down But Mr
 President it is true as
 assumed by the Senator from
 Ohio that there does exist
 in the South a deep
 and wide spread convict ionu
 at the Republican party mortal
 enemy of the institutions and
 rights of the South That
 con viction as I havo
 said does not arise from
 the misrepresentations as some have
 Said of north ern national
 men of whatever party but
 it has been produced by
 stubborn facts and by inform
 ation derived from the most
 authentic and relia It comes
 from the leading men of
 ble sources the Republican party
 from their speeches made here
 and elsewhere from the acts
 of their Legisla tures from
 all the sources authentic and
 reliable from which the truth
 as to public sentiment is
 to be ascertained Among those
 from whom afd by whom
 this conviction has been produced
 on the southern mind there
 are few If any who
 have contributed more than the
 Senator from Ohio himself I
 lis own speeches here and
 elsewhere have made the impression
 at the South that so
 i far as his opinions
 are concerned and we regard
 him as a representative man
 that portion Of the northern
 people represented in sentiment by
 him are our rnortal encrnies
 The peopleof th c South
 know the characters of the
 leading men of the North
 of all parties tell the
 distinguished Sen i ator from
 Ohio that in the South
 we regard him not only
 as a representative man as
 a strong minded man but
 a bold blunt brave man
 man of candor and when
 he speaks when he tells
 the country that there is
 now realty no union that
 there is a between the
 North and the South bitter
 rancor offeeling existing between the
 two sections that does not
 characterize the feeling ex isting
 between any other two foreign
 Govern ments when he says
 that the only salvation of
 this Union is to be
 found in divesting it entirely
 frorn all taint of slavery
 what are we to infer
 but that he and those
 whose opinions he represents are
 the mortal enemies of interests
 and rights with which our
 lives and our happiness and
 our all are identified have
 alluded Mr President to evidence
 ofa hostile feeling in the
 North against the South furnished
 by the Senator frorn Ohio
 because he has assumed that
 the only evidence on which
 the southern mind relies for
 its convictions on this i
 I be so then it
 becomes us ail with promptness
 and fairness and candor at
 once to relieve the country
 subject is derived from the
 enemies of Republi the admission
 of Kansas Mr COLLAMER Who
 has the floor on that
 I could pile up the
 proof canism in the North
 from so strange and so
 ruinous a delusion in refutat
 ion of his remark by
 referring to the But whiic
 the Senator can find no
 belter Tround The PRESIDING OFFICER
 No one at declarations of
 other representative and leading for
 this wide spread feeling of
 alarm and danger Mr COLLAMER
 I take it I wish
 to speak he concedes that
 southern men are not so
 much men of the Republican
 party in this body and
 in to blame He concedes
 that we believe that the
 II the other House and
 out of theni by referring

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 24
 What we now complain of
 is that in the year
 the facilities well known to
 be constantly fur nished to
 the free States for the
 escape of fugitive I i
 1856 these questions known to
 be questions of slavcs by
 referring to the diffculty and
 danger antagonism morally and socially
 if not politi of executing
 tho fugitive slave law by
 referring caliy incapable of reconciliation
 between the to the statutes
 passed by many of the
 frec State North and South
 were seized upon by political
 Legislatures for the acknowledged purpose
 of leaders at the North
 and incorporated as the basis
 obstructing t he successful execution
 of a plain as the
 central idea of a political
 association obligation Imposed by the
 Constitution by refer which rising
 upon the strength of this
 prevail irv sentiment at the
 North has finally taken pos
 ring to the well known
 fact that anti slavery so
 session of the Government of
 the country Mr cieties are
 tolerated in the free States
 when the avowed purposes of
 their association are to scatter
 I President the first fatal
 stab to this Union was
 incendiary publications through the South
 tend made at the Philadelphia
 convention in 1856 when these
 propositions were incorporated as a
 ing directly to the production
 of discontent re belkion and
 insurrection among the slaves but
 part of the Republican platform
 There was the it is
 only necessary to allude to
 the birth of Republicanism and
 there was the birth forbear
 facts to repel the allegation
 of the Senator from of
 organized sectionalism its legitimate fruits
 are Ohio that our convictions
 as to the hostility of
 agitation dissension alienation and finally
 dis his party are unfounded
 and based only cn the
 union in some form or
 other In my honest con
 information derived from theenemies of
 his party I viction there
 is to be found the
 true origin of disunionism and
 there the real responsibility for
 in the North But Mr
 President without goino outside of
 that catastrophe thc most authcntic
 sources of information rely Mr
 President desire now to turn
 tho atten tion of the
 Senate to the Republican platform
 for ing upon no facts
 stated by thc friends of
 the South but upon the
 acknowledged ovi E the purpose
 of showing that the surprise
 which is at the North
 dences furnished by the Republican
 party itself I expressed here
 at thc prevalence of the
 feeling of resistance in the
 South to have no exist
 shall proceed to state as
 briefly as possible what cncc
 The resolution in that platiörm
 to which I understand to
 be the complaints of the
 South Mr President in regard
 to thc sentiments ofa 1
 particularly reför is this majority
 of the northern people upon
 the subject Resoleed I hat
 with our republican fathers we
 hold it to be a
 seltievidcut truth that alt mcn
 are cndowcd with of slavery
 as an abstract proposition either
 mor the inalienable rights to
 life liberty and thc pursuitof
 hap ally oe politically I
 prcsume there can be no
 di piness and that the
 primary object and ulterior designs
 of vcrsity of opinion Looking
 to all the sources Of
 our Federal Government were to
 secure these rights to all
 information that are reliable I
 understand these persons within its
 exclusive jurisdlction that as OUY
 rc propositions to present fairly
 the sentiment of tlle publican
 fathers when they had abolished
 slavery in all our I
 national territory ordained that no
 person should bc de northern
 mind I mean the prevqiling
 se itimeut prived ot life
 liberty or property without duc
 process of in reference to
 the subject of slavery law
 it becomes our duty to
 maintain this provision of the
 l That slavery as it
 exists in the southern Constitution
 against all at tmnpts to
 vio at e it the
 pur pose of cstablishing slavery
 ill any Territory of the
 United StalQ s is a
 moral as well as social
 and political States by positivc
 legislation prohibiting its c xistcnce
 or i hat we deny
 t11C authority of Con extension
 therein 2 rl hat the
 owners and their slaves are
 created gress of a Territorial
 any individual or as that
 hcy are endowed alike with
 the sociation of individuals to
 ivc legal existcncc to slavery
 any _rerritory of the United
 States while the alienable rights
 of iife liberty und the
 pursuit of in Constitution shall
 bc maintainc l There Mr
 President is the truth spoken
 in plain unmistakable words What
 is the com plaint It
 is that the majority of
 thc people of one section
 ofthe Union having the numerical
 power to obtain possession of
 the Government form them selves
 into a political organization upon
 principles thatexclüde the minoritysectlon from
 coöperation for the purpose of
 governing that minority section That
 is a species of dominion
 in this case connect cd
 with the aggravating circumstances attending
 sectionalism combined with fanaticism that
 no brave and high minded
 people would long endure Hence
 Mr Ffllmore said truly when
 this party was organized and
 organized upon this purcly sectional
 principle that the necessary result
 of its triumph would be
 a dissolution of the Union
 His words would have been
 verified in 1856 but for
 the brave and the successful
 exertions of those very northern
 men whom the Senator from
 Ohio regards as his mortal
 enemies It was the men
 of Pennsylvania and of New
 Jersey and of In diana
 and of Illinois who then
 averted the catas trophe which
 hung over the country NIr
 Fill more s sentiment was
 responded to throughout the whole
 South and received as a
 declaratton of patriotism that placcd
 him high in the estimation
 of southern men It was
 responded to everywhere as a
 se ntiment worthy of a
 patriot Why That hc was
 a dissolutionist a disunionist No
 but that he saw that
 it was an act of
 despotism on the part of
 the majority to adopt a
 principlc or prin ciples which
 nocessarily made their orca nization
 sectional necessarily excluded the minority
 from any actual participation in
 the Government and held them
 therefore as rnere subjects in
 the event I of the
 permanent triumph of that oreanization
 xvVhy can gentlemen express surprise
 at the state of things
 now existing when we all
 know that precisely the same
 state of things would have
 I occurrcd the Republican party
 had been suc cessful in
 1856 l hc same ground
 which existed then exists now
 In a morc tvy rravatcd
 form for in addition to
 the saine platforrn substantially the
 candidate placed upon it in
 rny estimation makes the triumph
 even more offensive than it
 would have been in 1856
 Now Mr Pt esident let
 1s sec what it is
 in this platform that is
 so offensivc to the South
 for happiness and that to
 securc these rights equally to
 both govern Inents are instituted
 deriving their just power from
 the consent of tho governed
 3 l hal as the
 ownoet s and their slaves
 are c reated equai the
 former cannot rightfully acquire or
 hoid dominion over or property
 in the latter without his
 consent Now MI President t
 hese I understand to bc
 the prevalent sentiments of the
 northern mind ill refi renee

 either socially morally or politically
 IN hesc senti rncnts havc
 prevailed from the beginning of

 of thosc opinions Under the

 the freedom of conscience they

 opinions It is no cause
 of quarrel between and hern

 Ehere was precisely the sanne

 and there that exists to

 South on these questions yet
 iL was no cause of
 disruption it was no c
 a usc of quarrel it
 was no insuperable obstacle to
 the forin ation of this
 Government N len who believed
 as does the Senator from
 Ohio that slavery a moral
 social and political cvil in
 that conven tion sanctioned the
 Constitution and labored for its
 adoption and ratification yet in
 that Consti tution we all
 know the lcgatity and the
 rightful ness of property ill
 slaves are conceded in more
 than one clause that it
 even coes the longth of
 conceding the right to increase
 the 11 unaber of slaves
 by now importations for twenty
 years How can it be
 that svho stand now in
 the same position cannot setlie
 these coy flic tino io

 principle that they did That
 principle was to leave every

 and to require cvcrv rnan
 to ao ree that the

 law of the land and
 in the discharge of his

 I allude to Mr Fillmore
 Iri his criticisms upon this
 party and its oræan ization
 he stated in plain simple
 and few words the and
 the end of this sec
 truth the w holo truth
 tional organization Listen to him
 But sve nowt see a
 party ornanizcd ill the North
 for the E first tune
 selectin v candidates iör President
 and Vice Prcs ident exclusively
 the northern States wi th
 the avowed intention of electing
 them to govern the South
 as well as the North
 And again I he North
 is beyond all question the
 most populous the Inost vv
 calthy and has the rnost
 voters and thereföre has the
 pmver to inflict this injustice
 upon the South But we
 can best judge of its
 consequences by reversing the ease
 II Suppose the South was
 the populous the most wealthy
 and possessed thc greatest ntnnber
 of c eetorak votes and
 that it should Icclare hat
 tar solne or real in
 II justice done at the
 North it would elect none
 bilt a Pres i i
 ident and a Vice President
 of slavehol lers t he
 South to rule ovt r
 the North here Gentlcmen of
 the North seem not to
 com prehcnd this They even
 take up the idea that
 it IS a merc suspicion
 that sounc wrong may be
 done some t hat it
 is merely because we were
 defeated in the election because
 we have lost our candi
 dates because we have failed
 in holding tho Gov ernmcnt
 which we have held so
 long that we manifest such
 deep concern I tell them
 in all candor that they
 are mistaken in this Lincoln
 had entertained opinions and stood
 upon a platform that did
 not in our estimation involve
 our final destruction I moan
 the destruction of our southern
 interests and institutions we should
 have acquiesced in his election
 as cheerfully as in that
 of ax y other rnan
 What then is it this
 platform to which wo take
 exception I he first thing
 is that it recognizes the
 genera that ALL men arc
 created equal and in rccotyniz
 ing this asserts as a
 fa t that Governments are
 made for the purpose of
 securing alike thc rizhts of
 life and liberty and the
 pursuit of happiness to the
 slave and to his owner
 r ilhat general prin ciple
 if applied in the States
 would liberate four million slaves
 This is a necessary deduction
 from the assertion of the
 principle of tbc equality of
 the two races But tbc
 Ilcpublican Y arty i Illust
 do them the justice to
 say do not in their
 platform make the application of
 this general prin ciple to
 the States They confine it
 to those places within which
 Congress has according to the
 platform of 1856 exclusive jurisdicti01
 l IXhen the position is
 this you concede that in
 the St ates we have
 a right to this prop
 erty and you profess to
 be wikling that this con
 stitutionat guarantee shall be n
 aiynained yet rn so doing
 you avow a principle to
 be a do you think
 feliov citizens stibrrxit to this
 iniustic e would but one

 can suppose your southern bi

 and which if you had

 undertaking to say that this

 to other consequences than i
 the loss of pröperty yet
 to a southern mind these
 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 187
 other consequences are so frightful
 that when a pnrty phants
 itself on a principle so
 alarming and so destructive if
 carried out int o all
 its legitimate results wc can
 but eel that our security
 is small svhen all we
 have to repose upon is
 the profes sions of that
 party that it will regard
 our rights within the States
 when the same party tells
 us that rights which we
 regard the same outside of
 the States it intends to
 disregard This party promtses us
 as the inducement to our
 repose that our rights of
 property in slaves Shail not
 be inter fered With in
 the States because the Constitution
 recocrnizes thosc rights But they
 refuse to ex tend that
 prornisc to our rights of
 property in slaves outside of
 the States although upon the
 authority of the high judicial
 tribunal of the coun try
 for deciding constitutional questions we
 have exactly the samc rights
 outside of the States within
 the jurisdiction of the Federal
 Government as the owners of
 any other species of property
 have They concede our rights
 in the one case because
 they are expressly reco nized
 by the Constitution they deny
 them in the other and
 in so doing repudiate thc
 authoritative adjudica tion of the
 Supreme Court But suppose this
 general principle bc carried out
 within those places wherc Congress
 has ju risdiction then it
 will be carried out in
 this Dis trict for here
 Congress has jurisdiction it will
 be carried out in the
 forts and arsenals for Con
 ffrcss there has jurisdiction it
 will be carried out in
 the Territories for Congress there
 has juris diction Suppose a
 State makes application for admission
 into the Union with the
 recognition of slavery in its
 constitution is not that another
 case within your jurisdiction And
 do you not stand at
 least by implication from the
 principle you assort pledged to
 reject the admission of such
 a State These are vital
 points with southern men Sup
 pose your party gets possession
 of both branches of Congress
 then under this piatform and
 under opinions Hc hates slavery
 as much as an Abo
 litionist hates it he savs
 so in so many words
 He believes that the slavc
 has the same right to
 be protected in his life
 LIBERTY and pursuit of happiness
 as his owner He believes
 that man cannot have property
 in man without his consent
 that is Mr L incoln
 s central idca his sheet
 anchor of Republicanism He believes
 that sia very is a
 social moral and political evil
 He looks to the desires
 its ultimate extinction Republican party
 to adopt and carry out
 such a policy not inconsistent
 with the Constitution as he
 construes it as will induce
 the public mind to repose
 on thc conviction that slavery
 wiil be finally cxtinguisheg He
 believes Ihal such a pol

 entertains these views in strict

 principles and ceeded in electing

 southern men manifest so much
 uneasiness and not a word
 to say Ile may be
 all that his friends so
 much concern and meet us
 With no disposition represent him
 and I shall not controvert
 it but I to aid
 in promoting a_ny measure for
 averting the the point is
 is he a fair representative
 in his an calamities that
 threaten our country are asked
 to repose quietly becauspsthU tocedents
 of these principles and these
 measures which we look upon
 as threatenino our institu President
 elect is said to be
 a conservative man tions When
 I turn to his record
 find a most I I
 do not believe he intcnds
 to violate the Cöristi remarkable
 coincidence ina i respects beLwcen
 his tution as he construes
 it but where is the
 neceSp position as deliberately and
 frequently repeatcd sity of his
 violating it The measures that
 he by him and the
 principle to which have referred
 proposes tocarry out and that
 party stand pledged as constituting
 the central idea of the
 platform to carry out require
 no violation of Ibe Constitu
 of the Republican party Upon
 a careful exam tion as
 they construe that instrument for
 their ination of Mr Lincoln
 s sentiments as declared ultimate
 success It is only a
 matter of time again and
 again in his celebrated controversy
 in The end may be
 hastened under the administra 1858
 with Judge DOUGLAS and other
 speeches of I tion of
 a fanatical President and a
 fanatical Con his published and
 relied upon by his friends
 in the gress or it
 may be delayed with a
 more conserv late contest in
 the volume which is before
 me I ative Prcsidcnt and
 Congress but tlie result is
 come to the conclusion that
 he entertains these il fixed
 it is inevitable Mr Lincoln
 desires to place this Government
 in a condition in which
 the public mind will repose
 upon the conviction that the
 institution of slavery is finally
 to be extin guished What
 sort of appeal is that
 to southern men whose interests
 and happiness are identified with
 this institution What sort of
 appeal is it to those
 men in the cxlreme South
 where not only all they
 have is identified with this
 institu lion and is involved
 in it but where the
 lives of themselvcs and their
 families are constantly liable to
 be destroyed and sacrificed by
 some misguided fanatic 01 unonomaniac
 who feeling restive and I
 unwilling to await the slow
 process of the Repub lican
 mode libcrating the slaves chooses
 to resort to the torch
 and to insurrection Is it
 not a most astonishing appeal
 to make to them to
 say to them We expect
 you to repose quietly your
 pledge to carry out this
 general principle of sen timents
 which characterize his party In
 all seriousness and carncstness I
 ask gentlemen on yours what
 guarantee have ve what hope
 have the other side if
 it is surprising that the
 southern we that this District
 will not at once be
 visited mind is moved is
 disturbed is alarmed at the
 tri with your power And
 so of tbc forts and
 arscnals within hc slave States
 W c know that in
 the umph ofa party entertaining
 these opinions and at tho
 elccliou of a candidate avowing
 these senti Territories you would
 at once erect an impassable
 barrier belicvc that you would
 exclude upon the conviction that
 in five years ten years
 twenty years or thirty years
 all that you have is
 to be swept away Repose
 is the great object desired
 by thc South It is
 essential to the peace happ_inesS
 and pros perity of her
 people To O ern the
 constant agi tation of the
 slavery question is full of
 danger was to secure repose
 that the South sought for
 years and with earnestness to
 secnrc the recoo nition of
 concrrcssional non intervention as I
 he estabiishcd policy of thc
 country Although this principle has
 bcen declared by the Suprelne
 Court to be the true
 intent and meaning of the
 Consti tution we have failed
 to secure repose because the
 Republican party repudiated that solemn
 ad every other slave State
 fFom the Union Willi The
 whole import and purport therefore
 of any fair minded marl
 deny that these rneasures yout
 triumph is plainly this that
 you have fort ed judication
 and resolved to continue the

 any candid man deny that

 is for that reason that

 strange to you that southern

 next four years ask with
 all those facts that the

 that the question of secession
 is the great of the

 I admit that the condition

 I am not willing yet
 to believe and the amendments

 adopted by them has been
 resorted to from a feeling
 of disunion per se but
 I regard them as viewing
 separate secession as the best
 means of awaking the sentiment
 of the whole North and
 of the whole country to
 the real dan ger and
 the importancc of a satisfactory
 adjust ment While I differ
 with them in that policy
 I nm not prepared to
 pronounce judgment of cen sure
 and condemnation upon then They
 are It is their right
 to sovorf ign independent States

 their judgments dictate But having
 taken their course thc duty
 devolves upon us who live
 in the middle and border
 States to take our course
 Our people are not prepared
 at least I can spe

 until every reasonable effort is
 cxhausted to resort to the

 we do In my judgment
 the middle and border States
 have a plain duty out
 I think it is their
 dk lty to meet together
 in consulta tion in the
 most sorcm n manner that
 such consulta tions can be
 gotten up and to present
 to the North their demand

 is hope I think that

 occupy officjal places but i
 prefZ r at least before
 I give up all I
 the Union now subsisting between
 South Caro lina and the
 other States of America is
 thereby diséolved This is thé
 act of one of the
 sover eign States of the
 Confederacy of one of the
 originat members of that Confederacy
 It is an act consummatcd
 in the most solernn and
 impos ing form in which
 the voice and will of
 a sovcr eign people can
 be pronounced occasion calls for
 no discussion as to the
 character of the right which
 the people of South Carolina
 have exercised in thus deliberately
 re th ose attributes of
 their sovereicrntv which in 1788
 they in the same solemn
 and de liberate form delegated
 to the Federal Government I
 allude to shall enter into
 no such discussion it only
 as a great accomplished fact
 which must soon present practical
 questions of the most mo
 Ghall content myself now mentous
 character with briefly statinø without
 argument the course which in
 In y judgment ought to
 be taken on that phase
 of these questions which may
 look to a resort to
 force This question must arise
 either in a proposition to
 resort to force for the
 purpose of executing the laws
 of t le United States
 within the territorial limits of
 South Carolina or for the
 subduing the people of that
 State and coercing them back
 to their allegiance to the
 United States W batever tech
 nical distinction there n lay
 be in the two prop
 asit ions I ree ard
 them practically as amountin r
 to the same thing a
 resort to force for either
 pur pose amounts in my
 estimation to war upon the
 State of South Carolina I
 discard any distinction on this
 subject be causc t he
 cilec t of the ordinance
 adopted their convention is to
 constitute for the people of
 Soath Carolina a separatc and
 independent crovermncnt not in my
 estimation a separate and indcpc
 1Jd cnt de jure but
 de facto This gov ernment
 has absolved its people as
 far as it can be
 dono from all allegiance to
 the Government of t ll
 i United States aud has
 thereby interposefl between eac l
 one of its citizens and
 the Govern ment of the
 United States on any tuc
 stion of giance that nuty
 hoteaftcr arise jetwcon hen As
 the Constitution of the United
 States recoa nizes thc existence
 of the States as States
 in all the departments of
 The Govern illent legislativc judicial
 and executive as the Constitution
 was ratified by the States
 as States and as tbc
 State of Carolina meaning thereby
 the people of South Carolina
 in their sovereiffn capacitv has
 of every citizen thereof an
 undivided allegiance when the Federal
 Government resorts to force against
 one of those citizens who
 resists on the xround that
 he i s obeying the
 comtnand of South Carolina the
 Federal Government cannot decline to
 treat the resistance as the
 act of South Caro lina

 becomes war Hence practically regard
 the resort to either fbr
 the purpose of exec lüing
 the laws in South Caro
 lina or fi l the
 purpose of red acing he

 then arises whether in the

 Carolina now stands war and
 promptness to the people of

 though I joked for has
 produced a profound sen southern
 States with the vicw of
 urging uÉon hope to see
 whether or not an appeal

 a popular soverei YYlty of

 full appreciation of the iinportance
 of execu Linty the lax

 I con patriotislü enough t
 herc a to this con
 cession as our fathers did
 and to close up and
 strained to the conclusion that
 e vcn if the povv

 of agitation between to resort
 to force were subject to

 am thoroughly satisfipd that have
 deep sense of their correctness
 as well as an ardent

 good reasons to believe that

 sruattudeps in the e anization
 about to take tho reins
 of the Federal vvay of
 atnendlnents to the Constitution we
 arc Governmen t with every
 prospect of holding these reins
 perpetually be rtunoas to her
 interests and destructive ot the
 bbjécts for which the Gove
 1860 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 189 ernrnent
 was formed and who for
 reasons like these claim the
 right to resume her delegated
 sovereignty or to seek for
 redress or self preser vation
 in revolution I cannot consent
 to make war unless the
 subjection of such State is
 imper alive y demanded for
 the general welfare and safety
 of the other members of
 the Federal Gov In every
 such case the interests of
 the ernment States remaining in
 the Union as well as
 those of the State proposing
 to withdraw must be invol
 ved Both parties to the
 case have rights to look
 to and obligations to discharge
 all the surrounding cir cumstances
 must bc examined with an
 eye to all the consequences
 It would require a stroncr
 case to inducc me to
 incur all the horrors of
 a civil war either to
 execute the law S amrrinst
 the people ofa sovereign State
 or to conquer such people
 to their former allegiance I
 cannot forget that the Union
 was not formed by force
 and i know it can
 never bc maintained and perpetuated
 by force Resting on fraternal
 feelings among its members it
 was created If it is
 to be preserved it must
 be done by the persuasive
 but efficient instrumentalities of kindness
 forbearance patience and fraternity If
 South Carolina stood alone in
 this crisis I would see
 no blood spilled to coerce
 her but knowino as we
 all do that in the
 grievances on which she is
 taking so responsible a step
 four teen of the other
 members of the Confederacy are
 strongly sympathizing with her and
 are earnestly considering what measures
 for redress and safety they
 wilk adopt it cannot be
 doubted fora moment that war
 upon South Carolina would invoive
 the entire Confederacy in the
 conflict and destroy forever all
 hope of either prescrvinz or
 recon structing thc Federal Union
 In this connection I do
 not pause to contemplate the
 horrors of the civil war
 that would follow an attempt
 to cocrcc South Carolina If
 nothing else can be saved
 if if the members of
 the the Union must perish
 Confederacy must be severed Ict
 us at least save the
 blood of our countrymen Instead
 of considering the question of
 war upon one of sister
 States it rather becomes us
 the representatives of the other
 sisters of the Con federacy
 to elevate our thoughts our
 feelings our hearts into the
 atmosphere of a pure and
 unadulterated patriotism and from that
 elevation look down with calmness
 with kindness with unprejudiced minds
 upon the causes which have
 impelled Sou th Carolina to
 this fearful experi a nd
 wh ich are impellino fourteen
 other sov ment ercign States
 to seek for remedies for
 great evils willi which they
 feel they are threatened and
 upon this view to sec
 whether it is not possible
 for us to find a
 peaceful and effectual solution of
 the frightful ctgastrophe of civil
 x var and destruc tion
 of our Government which is
 impending over It surely cannot
 bc that t he people
 of fifteen us States arc
 so deeply moved and so
 painfully in tent upon having
 additional securities for their rights
 in the Union without some
 just and sub stantial cause
 for their crievance s and
 their de each other in
 the act of separation that
 we are determined so to
 live as neighbors that the
 hope of a future reconstruction
 of our Confederacy and of
 the resurrection at no distant
 day of our Federal Union
 to an immortality of grandeur
 and prosperity may not bc
 fbrevet destroyed Mr DOOLITTLE Mr
 1 do not desire if
 We can arrive at a
 vote upon this ques tion
 to occupy the time of
 the Senate I intend at
 some time to make some
 observations upon the resolutions pending
 before the Senate One word
 however in relation to Kansas
 I believe sir that the
 admission of Kansas is the
 immediate duty of Congress and
 is Inore likely to give
 peace and quiet to the
 slavery agitation than any other
 measure We had pcacc before
 the rcpcal of the Missouri
 compromises by which repeal the
 Ter ritory of Kansas was
 opened to a fearful struggle
 a struggle for years Happily
 it is now ended so
 far as Kansas is concerned
 When admitted into the Union
 we shall have peace Non
 inter ference by the Federal
 Government or by ftce State
 men affainst slavery in the
 States and non interference by
 the Federal Government or by
 slaveholders against freedom in the
 Territories It was the Opening
 of Kansas to sla rs
 peace very which brought strife
 its admission asa frec State
 will end the struggle and
 restore peace Mr COLLAMER Mr
 President 1 propose to confine
 my rcrnarks entirely to the
 question on the bill before
 us for the admission of
 Kansas nor do I propose
 to take a very long
 time in open ing the
 subject rhis bill was passed
 by the House of Repre
 sentatives by a very large
 majority at t le last
 ses sion It carne to
 the Senate and was referred
 to the Committee on Ellerritories
 The Committee on Territories differing
 in opinion on the subject
 came to no conclusion and
 of course no majority or
 minority report was made in
 relation to it The bill
 was merely reported back to
 the Senate It therefore is
 now a question on the
 passage of I the bill
 Some debate vvas had on
 this subject at the last
 session and it was finally
 deferred by the Senate preferring
 to take up and dispose
 of other been presented and
 different measures taken vill not
 go into them There was
 an act passed called the
 English bilb by which they
 were admitted as aState _on
 con ditions Certain subjects were
 returned to them with their
 constitution which was called the
 Lee compton constitution and if
 they agreed to th em
 by a vote of the
 people they were to be
 admitted as a State They
 were submitted to them and
 they did not agree to
 them Now under that bill
 there was a pro vision
 thåt unless they agreed to
 tbem and took measures to
 ratify the constitution they should
 not be admitted until they
 had a number of people
 such as would entitle them
 to a Repre sentativc in
 Congress That is the substance
 of it I believe The
 Wyandotte constitutioå which wc have
 now before us was made
 by people as I have
 said by a convention and
 as I insist they have
 that population The first material
 element to be considered in
 the formation of a Territory
 into a State is that
 they have the proper amount
 of population Mr President the
 Senatc and the House of
 Repre sentatives threc years ago
 agreed thät Kansas had population
 enough to bc adrnitted under
 the Lecompton constitution They would
 not make a point but
 what they bad enough then
 The question is have they
 enough nöw I do not
 consider that Conm ess has
 any power practically as they
 attemptefi to do in that
 English bill to prevent another
 Congress from exercising their discretion
 in the admission of that
 Territory l hcy could not
 put limitations on the power
 of Congress in the exercise
 of their discretion of ad
 mitting that as a State
 as well us uny other
 But no matter Mr President
 I insist that in fact
 this Territory has come up
 in point of population to
 that requirement The census has
 been taken and I have
 a certificate from the Census
 bureau in relation to it
 I will here observe that
 the west ern boundary of
 thc proposed State of Kansas
 lies a little west by
 a certain line of longitude
 of what is called the
 sixth meridian l hat is
 a meri dian fixed for
 tbe purposes of the surveys
 of the public lands and
 the line of the State
 is a little west of
 that meridian Here is the
 certificate from subjects which suppose
 they looked on as more
 thc Census bureau in relation
 to the population of important
 Then having no report in
 relation to it per Kansas
 haps I shall be not
 only justified but called upon

 that the popu lation th

 of the other States can
 see subject Their deliberations resulted
 in forming bers That does
 not include quitc all Thereis

 Congress antees then it will
 bccome us to look the

 that they havc a population
 whiclk Now Mr President in
 the exercise ofthc power quencc
 fuli ill the face that
 consequence is that of admitting
 Territories as States which is
 a dis would entitle this
 district of country now if
 with there is ars antagonism
 of interest or of senti

 been a very i I

 the next Congress great degree
 of liberality on the part
 of Coneress and the peoplc
 of tbc South which is
 Wholly and is to be

 It has generally been considered
 that a termtorial entirely irrecor

 that we have in our

 Ehis is the condition of

 in the most liberal form
 of territorial these people are
 entitled to appeal at the

 one which it is of
 Congress that they shah now
 be admitted utes of ibrbcarance
 and conciliation as will allow
 government an appeal to the
 people of the North before
 we desirable to continue longer
 than is absolutely The next
 element is theextcnt of territory
 The extent of territory in
 Kansas wit hin the present
 In almost all cases where
 the Terri superadd to them
 the horrors of a civil
 war necessary we rnast see
 the Union perish let us
 at least re tories have
 heretofore applied to Congress for
 ad boundaries as now proposed
 in this constitution mission I
 say Congress has generally admitted
 is a little over eighty
 thousand square miles I solve
 that we M ill burv
 it in peace arid witl
 k blood believe about eighty
 onc thousand square miles If
 we cannot agree to live
 together i them with great
 liberality until you come to
 this less hands Here there
 has been difficulty at It
 makes the State larger than
 Illinois larger than in I
 larmony us brothers of one
 Confederacy let one of Kansas
 us separate in peace showing
 by our justice to various
 stages of it Different constitutions
 have Missouri larger than Virginia
 It is true that the
 190 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Decernber
 24 boundary of the Stato
 does not exactly conform to
 the boundaries of the Teh
 itory and for this reason
 it has becn ascertained since
 that Terri tory was forrned
 that there is a large
 region of almost or quite
 uninhabitable country lying be twecll
 Kansas on the Missouri and
 Kansas by Pike s Peak
 away next to the Rocky
 Mountains where there is inhabitable
 count ry I here is
 a large region of country
 separating these two some two
 or tlit ec hundred miles
 which will never be settled
 to any very considerableextent The
 bound ary now runs across
 that region of country as
 fixed by this constitution including
 eighty thou It is not
 of very much im sand
 square miles portance where that
 western line runs but it
 goes across that region leaving
 a part of it to
 be in cluded in any
 rl erritory that shall bc
 formed west of this State
 These Mr President are the
 materials or the elements which
 constitute the claim for admission
 on the part of Kansas
 its population its terri tory
 the formation of its constitution
 it being ratified bv the
 people and having the proper
 nunT and t know 1
 0t exactly what objections will
 really be made I must
 wait to hear them It
 seems to me sir that
 not only for the sake
 of the pcople thcrc but
 for the peacc of tbc
 country at huge it is
 about time we should put
 end to this Kan that
 the Feople noay be empowered
 to sas matter n oeeed
 in their right of popular

 people of the United States
 and that there should not
 be any feeling of resent

 UNION Mr JOHN COCHRANE asked
 the consent of the House
 to introduce the following preamble
 and resolution Whereas it is
 not to he disguised that
 the dangers which invest the
 Union of the States and
 threaten its dissolution complish that
 åeplorable result and whereas to
 disregard those dangers were madness
 and while admitting their ex
 istence 10 refuse to apply
 ali honorable efiört3 to arrest
 and remove them were utter
 perdition and whereas the pres
 ent fearful crisis in our
 national existence is the effect
 of a collision betwcen the
 antagonist theories upon African servitudc
 entertained and propagated at the
 North and at the South
 and whereas those theories being
 irreconcilable the integrity of the
 Union can nolonuer be maintained
 save by recourse to a
 settlement which while suspending the
 conflict of opposing principles will
 ultimately remove it from the
 field of national politics Pherefore
 Resolved l hat it is
 the Opinion of the House
 of Repre sentatives of the
 Thirty Sixth Congress of the
 United States that in ail
 territory of tuc United States
 lying north of 360 30
 north latitude and not included
 within the limits of any
 of the existing States slavery
 and involuntary ser vitude except

 the said territory or any
 portion of the sarue when
 adn itted as a State
 should be received into the
 Union with or wiLhout slavery
 as its constitution may prescribe
 at Ibe time of its
 admission and that in all
 territorv of the United States
 lying south of 360 30
 north latitude not included within
 the limits of any existing
 State neither Congress nor arv
 territorial government should pass any
 law prohibiting or unpait ing
 the establish ment of slavery
 Pro vided always tl hat
 the said l erritory or
 any pqrt of the same
 when ad nitted as a
 State should be received into
 the Union with or without
 slavery as its constitution may
 prescribe at the tirnc of
 adtnission 13 FRIDAY DECEMBER 28

 to offer resolution as a
 substitute for the one proposed
 by my col league The
 SPEAKER The resolution is not

 is made Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 move to suspend the rules
 Mr HASKIN I send up
 my resolution which I will
 offer as a substitute The
 SPEAKER When the are sus
 pended the resolutions will be
 in order but not before
 Mr HASKIN Let my resolution
 be read for in formation
 The resolution vas reacl as
 follows Resolved That the Committee
 on thc Judiciary be di
 rected to inquire into thc
 relations now existing between tbc
 Federal Government and the State
 of South Carolina the dutv
 of the executive department in
 view of the at tempted
 withdrawal ot a State from
 the United States and t
 he threat oned seizure of
 the Federat property within the
 lünits of that State and
 also what action Congress should
 take in the present emergency
 to execute the Constitution entörcc
 the law und protect said
 property in South Caro lina
 from seizure and that said
 conunittee have leave to report
 at any time Mr STANTON
 If the gentleman from New
 York thc mover of the
 original resolution will consent to
 have his resolution referred to
 the committee of thirty three
 I shall have no objec
 tion to it Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE My design is to
 secure a vote of the
 House upon it now Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland 1 would
 like to suggest to my
 friend from New York that
 as this resolution involves the
 greatest question which can be
 presented to the consideration of
 this House he withhold it
 until the committee of thirty
 three has had an opportunity
 to report It is generally
 understood that that committee will
 take vote at its rneeting
 on Thursday next upon the
 propositions before it and it
 seems to me that it
 v zould bc wise upon
 the part of my friend
 and wise upon the part
 of the House to allow
 that committee to reach a
 result if they can reach
 a result or let the
 House be informed of its
 inability to do so before
 we bring this ques tion
 before the House I hope
 my friend will allow his
 resolution to go over until
 next Mon day instead of
 pressing it to a vote
 to day Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 not my wish to anticipate
 the repott of the committee
 of thirty It might be
 injudicious to have any pre
 three mature vote but thcrc
 are other considerations which have
 impelled me to present this
 question in this shape at
 this time I have no
 confidence at all in the
 power I might very well
 doubt the disposition of gentlemen
 members of Congress to settle
 this great question Mr GROW
 rise to a order that
 pending the motion to suspend
 the rules de bate IS
 not in order If debate
 were in order we might
 discuss this natter the whole
 day The SPEAKER The from
 sylvania is correct Mr MCCLERNAND
 1 move that do now
 adjourn Mr SHERMAN dispose of
 this matter now it will
 come up uext Monday as
 unfinished business Mr HOUSTON Let
 me suggest that if it
 is the policy of the
 House to postpone a vote

 No debate will be in
 order except upon the consular
 bill I suggested to the
 Mr MORRIS of Illinois gentleman
 from Ohio when he first
 made his res olution that
 an hour should be allowed
 for gen I am very
 frank to state to the
 eral discussion House that I
 was desirous to obtain the
 floor to speak upon the
 questions of public interest now
 acritatiny the couhtry I stand
 with a very small band
 of popular sovereignty Democrats and
 be tween the fire of
 both sides and think we
 ought to have the opportunity
 of beinrr heard occasion Objection
 vas made that debate was
 out of Mr CRAWFORD 1
 wish to say to the
 gen tleman from Ohio Mr
 SHERMAN that the House is
 evidently disinc incd to go
 to work upon this consular
 appropriation bill There is no
 urgent necessity as the gentleman
 knows for passiiP that bill
 to day The House is
 very thin and see no
 reason why we should not
 adjourn I will therefore move
 with the consent of the
 gentle man thnt the House
 do now adjourn Mr SEIERMAN
 1 have no doubt we
 can pass the consular bill
 in little while I want
 to get these formal appropriation
 bills out of the way
 of the pressing business When
 the bill is disposed of
 I shall be perfectly willing
 to ad journ Mr CRAV
 JFORD very well withdraw my
 motion to adjourn MESSAGE FROM
 TIIE SENATE A messarre was
 received from the Senate by
 Mr 1 1 cKEY its
 Chief Clerk informing the House
 that the Senate had passed
 an act to amend an
 act entitled An act to
 authorize the extension construction and
 use of a latcral branch
 of the Baltimore and Ohio
 railroad into and within the
 in which he was directed
 District Columbia to ask the
 concurrence of the House also
 return in in compliancc with
 a resolution of the House
 the deficiency appropriation bill CONSULAR
 AND DIPLOMATIC BILL The question
 was then taken on the
 motion to go into the
 Committee of the Whole on
 the state of the Union
 and it was agreed to
 T hc House accordingly resolved
 itself into the Cornmittec of
 the Whole ou the state
 of thc Union Mr J011N
 COCHRANE in the chair and
 pro cecded to the consideration
 of the special order being
 a bill H R No
 864 making appropria tions for
 the consular and hplcnnntic expenses
 of the Government for the
 year ending 30th June By
 unanimous consent the first reading
 of the bill vas dispensed
 with and the Clerk proceeded
 to read it by clauses
 for amendment Mr QU ARLES
 I desire to ask the
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means whether this
 appropriation for pay of consuls
 is in excess of the
 estimates or whether it is
 in conformity with them Mr
 SHERMAN It is in conformity
 x vith the e stirnates
 and in conformity with the
 law These are all salaried
 offices Mr STANTON I notice
 here appropriations tar missions to
 Rome and Sardinia I had
 sup posed that those Governments
 had been super gcded and
 the Italian Government substituted in
 If that is the case
 there is perhaps their place
 no occasion for these appropriations
 I suppose the gentleman who
 has charge of the bill
 or the c narr nan
 of the Committee on Foreign
 Affairs ndcrstands the matter and
 can explain it to thic
 House Mr St IERMAN I
 can state to rny colleague
 that the lecyal name of
 mission to Sardinia svas fixed
 by law last session and
 the amount of our minister
 s salary there was also
 fixed The do minions of
 Sardinia have been extended over
 other countries but the name
 of the mission IS unchanged
 We struck out the mission
 to Na ples that is
 the only change we made
 Rome is still a principality
 or temporal Power and ve
 If the House have a
 char é there ora minister
 chooses to dispense with that
 office they ought to change
 the law Mr STANTON Asa
 matter of course when ever
 there are such changes in
 foreign Govern ments as to
 supersede the necessity of the
 ap pointment of ministers there
 take it for granted the
 Executive would desire the appropriations
 for ministers to such places
 to be omitted from the
 I do not understand annual
 appropriation bill though 1 may
 be mistaken about it that
 there is any temporal Government
 at Rome left with which
 we can hold diplomatic intercourse
 I sup pose also that
 Naples and Sardinia are now
 uni ted under one Government
 with a new name and
 that both the missions ought
 not to bc retained but
 I am not informed on
 the subject Mr CORWIN I
 am unable to give the
 gen tleman or the House
 any information on the par
 I only know ticuiar point
 to which he refers history
 of the times that the
 from the general temporal power
 of the Pope has not
 been taken away from him
 by any act of the
 sovereigns of I take it
 for Europe or by the
 accidents of war granted therefore
 un til such an arrangement
 shall take place in European
 affairs that that mission whatever
 it is remains still to
 be provided for I do
 not know if what remains
 of the Government of the
 United States will have any
 particular interest in Papal affairs
 but it has he rctofore
 considered it its duty to
 send some one in a
 diplomatic capa city to Rome
 I would suggest to the
 gentleman however that the money
 will not be taken from
 the rrreasury unless there should
 be scope rc maining for
 that mission amid the convulsions
 of Europe and therefore no
 hartn can result frorn retaining
 thc appropriation in the bill
 Mr CRAYVFORD 1 find upon
 page 5 of the bill
 a provision ill these words
 For salaries of the mar
 lnqls t or the consular
 courts in Japan China Simn
 and l urkey 7 000
 It seems to me that
 that item might be reduced
 Mr SHERMAN law of last
 of June 22 thc compensation
 of these marshals and 7
 000 is the amount prescribed
 by law I do not
 see how the gentleman can
 reduce the amount Mr CRAWFORD
 1 ask the gentle man
 whether that law was a
 mere appropriation naming this amount
 or whether it was a
 law fix inff the salaries
 ivlr SHERMAN 1 have looked
 at the law but I
 sec by the estimates that
 the law of June 22
 1860 is to I remember
 the law very well It
 was drawn up at the
 office of the Secretary of
 State I do not know
 whether the salary was fixed
 Mr CRAWFORD My impression is
 that the amount of salary
 was not specified in the
 law and I think is
 too much Mr SHERMAN 1
 am informed by tleman who
 reported the bill that the
 salaries are fixed by law
 although he has not the
 law before Mr CRAWFORD Fixed
 would ask the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania Mr MORRIs who reported
 the bill if the law
 of 1860 defines the exact
 amount that each of these
 mar shals for consular courts
 shall receive Mr MORRIS of
 Pennsylvania My impres Sion is
 that it does Mr CRAWFORD
 That bill was amended the
 gentleman will remember in some
 particulars Mr MORRIS of Pennsylvania
 No sir that bill was
 not amended in any particular
 Mr CRAWFORD 1 will state
 to the chair man of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means that i will make
 no motion in committee in
 reference to this matter if
 he will agree to an
 understand ing that in case
 f on reference to the
 law of 1860 it shall
 appear that the amount of
 salary was not fixed we
 shall have a vote in
 the House on re ducing
 the item Mr SHERMAIN have
 no objection to that I
 now move that the committee
 use and report the biii
 to the House The motion
 was agreed to So the
 committee rose and the Speaker
 havin resumed the chair Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE reported that the
 Committee of the Whole on
 the state of the Union
 had according to order had
 under consideration the consular and
 diplomatic appro priation bilk and
 had directed him to report
 the same to the House
 without amendment and with a
 recommendation that it do pass
 Mr CRAWFORD 1 find law
 1860 authorizes the appointment of
 seven marshals for consular courts
 so that the salary of
 each is only My impression
 was that the law authoF
 Ized the appointment of only
 four Mr SHERMAN moved the
 previous ques tion I he
 previous question was seconded and
 the main question ordered The
 bill was then ordered to
 be engrossed and read a
 third time and being engrossed
 it was ac cording y
 read the third time und
 passed Mr SHERMAN moved to
 reconsider the vote by which
 the bill was passed and
 also moved to lay the
 motion to reconsider upon tbe
 table The latter motion was
 agreed to MILITARY ACADEMY BILL

 the House then proceeded to
 consider the bill of the

 for the support of the

 The following bills from the
 House of Repre sentatives were
 severally read twice by their
 titles and referred as indicated
 below A bill No 864
 making appropriations for the ment
 for the year ending the
 30th of June 1862 I
 wish to deprive the Territory
 of the power to to
 the Committce on Finance and
 I sell tbc sixteenth and
 thirty sixth sections the A
 bill No 909 for the
 relief of Thomas Chit school
 lands but to leave them
 in reservc for the Coast
 Survey during the fiscal year
 ending June a population to
 make a very fine State
 The country is mostly mineral
 but there arc some por
 tions of it well adapted
 to agricultural and grazincr purposes
 Without however enlarging on this
 i propose a little amendment
 to the fourteenth I section
 I wish to get at
 the formal parts before the
 general debate arises In the
 seventh line of the fourteenth
 section I move to strike
 out the words in said
 Territory and and then in
 the eighth line to strike
 out the words and Terri
 tories This section of the
 bill sets apart the sixteenth
 and thirty sixth sections in
 each town ship of the
 public lands for school purposes
 and it says that they
 shall be applied to schools
 in said Territory and in
 the States and Territories I
 wish hereafter to be erected
 out of the same to
 confine it exclusively to the
 States and I will explain
 to the Senate why I
 propose the change The Territories
 frequently hy virtue of this
 clam the right to dispose
 of the lands when the
 popu latiou is very small
 and the value of the
 lands very little and the
 consequence is that the bene
 fits intended to be conferred
 on the future popu lation
 are all lost and the
 lands are put away It
 is better to reserve them
 during the territorial existence and
 let the States dispose of
 them They will sell to
 better advan age and the
 whole people uvill enjoy the
 benefit rather than a few
 speculators who go out to
 induce Territorial consular and diplomatic
 expenses Of the Govern Legislature
 to sell in order that
 they may buy tenden to

 the amendment offered by the
 Senator from Illinois Mr TRUMBULL
 We have lived together under
 the Constitution of the United
 States in slaveholding and non
 skavebQldingStates for more than seventy
 years and have lived to
 gether in peace That peace
 however has rested upon two
 fundamental ideas first that the
 Fed eral Government and the
 citizens of the free States
 shall make no aggression upon
 slavery in the States and
 the other equally fundamental that
 neither the Federal Government nor
 the slave holders of the
 slave States shall make any
 aggres sions upon or undertake
 to overturn freedom in the
 Territories Upon these grounds we
 have lived together for these
 eighty years and we may
 livc for generations to come
 but if the citizens of
 the free States or the
 Federal Government shall undertake directly
 or indirectly to overturn slavery
 in the States where it
 exists or if the citizens
 of the slave States or
 the Federal Gov ernment shall
 undertake to overt urn freedom
 in the Territories we cannot
 have peace The amendment of
 the Senator from Missis sippi
 Mr BRowN is an attempt
 by a law of Congress
 to repeal the law of
 Mexico slavery ind to legalize
 it while the amendment of
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 TRUMBULL af firms that the
 law of freedom existing in
 the ere ritory at the
 time of its acquisition shall
 remain unchanged during its territorial
 condition Sir the Constitution of
 the United States is the
 supret1Re law of the land
 and of every State and
 speaks the same language and
 has the same force everywhere
 in Virginia Wisconsin and in
 South Carolina That Constitution was
 made for States and not
 for Territories at all It
 does not men tion them
 except to givc Congress the
 power to govern them but
 when extended over them by
 act of Congress it must
 be construed there and every
 where and always to mean
 the same no more no
 less If it contains any
 language which abolishes sla be
 in proportion to the value
 of the property taxed very
 in a Territory it would
 abolish it in a State
 iiciencies in the appropriations for
 the service of I If
 it contains any language which
 wouldrcstablish i The amendment was
 agreed to the fiscal year
 endmg June 30 1861 he
 was di Mr GREEN I
 have a third amendment to
 it in a Territory it
 would establish it in every
 rected to return it to
 the Senate 196 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE Decernber 27 State within
 its jurisdiction for it tenders
 the same oath and speaks
 in the sarne voice every
 Where in every Legislature and
 in every court The wise
 men who framed it knew
 that the laws of some
 States would maintain and the
 laws of other States woulr
 l deny the right of
 property in man They foresaw
 that the people of free
 States and slave States might
 disagreee fundamentally on this questiöri
 and therefore in a Consti
 tutioh which was to be
 adopted by all and to
 become the supreme law of
 all they neither afiirmed the
 right of property in slaves
 which would have established and
 made perpetual sla very in
 all the States nor did
 they expressly deny the fight
 of property in slaves which
 denial would have abolished slavery
 in every State instantly upon
 ius adoption They framed all
 its provisions in wisdom and
 none more wisely than those
 which undoubtedly refer to African
 slaves They would not have
 in a Constitution for States
 the word dave which had
 just come out of a
 seven years war for freedom
 and the rights of man
 It refers to them always
 as persons as persons held
 to ser vice not by
 the Constitution 0k laws of
 the United States but by
 the laws of the States
 where held State laws may
 hold them to service and
 make properly of the masters
 right to their service but
 the Constitution of the United
 States does not do it
 It allows the States if
 they will to do it
 within their jurisdictions By the
 laws of the free States
 minors and apprentices may be
 held to service till ri
 hcy might change their twenty
 one years old laws and
 hold them until twenty five
 years old In the slave
 States white persons minors and
 apprentices arc also hcld till
 twenty one years old Their
 laws might be changed so
 as to dis charge them
 at eigh teen or hold
 thorn until twenty five So
 colorcd persons of African descent
 may be held to service
 till twenty one or thirty
 or fifty years of age
 or for life The Constitution
 rccorynizes the fact that per
 sons may be held to
 service under the laws of
 the several States and provides
 that if they escape to
 another State they shall not
 be discharged from such service
 but shall bc delivered up
 on claim of the party
 to whom such service or
 labor nmy But I desire
 now to confine myself to
 be due I Inay recur
 to this sub the territorial
 question ject of the rendition
 of fugitives hereafter Mr President
 so much has bccn said
 about the famous Dred Scott
 case that it rnay appear
 rather late at this day
 to speak of the principles
 agreed indeed upon by the
 majority of the anything except
 that they were acrreed upon
 Dred Scott was not a
 citizen and therefore could I
 will stato onc thin y
 not sue in n Federal
 court however which was not
 decided I believe that no
 gentleman who has carefully considered
 their opinions will take issue
 with mc when say that
 nothing contained in that decision
 or in the opin ju
 lgcs can warrant any ions
 of a majority of the
 Inan in maintaining that the
 Constitution of the United States
 of its own fhrcc cn
 ters Territory where slavcrv has
 already beeri abolished by law
 ot the sovereign power of
 v hom we acquired it
 and establishes or o uaran
 ties the right to take
 and hold slaves in any
 such r in violation of
 that law I will admit
 the t a rnajority of
 the judges expressed the opinion
 that the act of Con
 gress abolishing slavery in a
 portion of Louisiana Territory was
 void but they put their
 opinion upon the ground that
 the Constitution gives to Congress
 no power of legislation upon
 sub ject Justices Taney Campbell
 Grier Wayne and Daniel all
 concur in that But with
 the ex ception of one
 or two sentences in the
 opinion of Justice Taney looking
 in that direction there is
 contained in the opinions of
 those judges whicll any one
 in inferring the right to
 take and hold slaves in
 all the Territories incl uding
 those acquired from Mexico wherein
 slavery was abolished not by
 a law of Congress but
 by a law of Mexico
 before their acquisition admit that
 one of the questions upon
 which a majority gave their
 opinion was the power of
 Congress to abolish slavery in
 r I erritory aud in
 a Territory in which slavery
 existed at the time of
 its acquisition by the law
 of France Justice Catron denied
 the 130 wer the ground
 that 1820 was unconstitutional and
 void but he did not
 I give the reason for
 that opinion Justice Nelson I
 condurred in the judgment of
 the court upon the ground
 that the question had been
 disposed of by the law
 of Missouri that whatever might
 have been the effect of
 the law of Congress on
 the terri tory north of
 360 3 Y upon Dred
 Scott on his re turn
 to Missouri by the law
 of that State and the
 decisions of its courts he
 returned to the condi tion
 of a slave He concurred
 in the judgment of the
 court but not in the
 opinion of the Chief Jus
 tice Justice McLean und Justice
 Curtis dissented from the opinion
 altogether and it is a
 remark able fact but onc
 judge Justice Wayne con curred
 in the opinion of Judge
 Taney without any qualification of
 its reasonin5 or its conclu
 sions Now sir the point
 which I make and to
 which I desire to call
 the attention of gentlemen on
 the other side of the
 Chamber is this that there
 is nothing in this Dred
 Scott decision or in the
 opin ions expressed by a
 majority of the judges mak
 ing that decision upon which
 gentlemen can base any right
 to take and hold slaves
 in the territories acquired from
 Mexico with the exception of
 one or two sentences contained
 in the opmion of the
 chief justice which may be
 tortured into that there is
 nothing absolutely nothing in the
 Dred Scott case to justify
 them m saying that the
 Con stitution of the United
 States enters the territo ries
 we have acquired from Mexico
 repeals the Mexican law against
 slavery and establiÅhes a law
 or guaranties the right to
 take and hold slaves in
 those Territories in violation of
 the Mexican law All the
 world knows that by the
 laws of nations and by
 the decisions of all court
 s in civ ilized countries
 the municipal laws of ceded
 territory remain in full force
 until changed by the sovereign
 power to whom the cession
 is made The law of
 Louisiana territory as ceded by
 France was the law ofslavery
 until the passage of the
 Missouri act abolishing it north
 of 360 and west of
 Missou The law of New
 Mexico and Arizona is the
 law of freedom until changed
 by Congress or by some
 other body or tribunal under
 its authority Suppose we were
 to acquire Can ada where
 by the law of that
 country or by the force
 of law the institution of
 slavery is not allowed to
 exist do gentlcmen on the
 other side of the Chaml
 cr contend that the moment
 we should acquire that territory
 the Constitution enters it repeals
 the law a ainst slavery
 and establishes a law in
 favor 01 guar anties a
 right by which slaves may
 be taken and hold therc
 in violation of its existing
 lam v Where urc the
 words in tbc Constitution which
 If there are any which
 ive any sucb power would
 give it such power there
 they do it in Wisconsil
 i and in every other
 State in the Uni ted
 States for the Constitution is
 declared to be the supreme
 law of every State anything
 in their laws constitut ions
 to thc contrary not withstanding
 I his amendment therefore pro
 posed by rny honorable friend
 from Illinois Mr PRU MB
 ULL that the law of
 Mexico existin r in this
 r rerritory acyainst slavery at
 tho time of its acqui
 sition should renntin unchanged until
 it is admit ted into
 the Union as a sovereign
 State n eets the case
 exactly and does not conflict
 even with the opinion of
 the Chie f Justice much
 less of a majority of
 the judges in the l
 rcd Scott case For onc
 I can never assent to
 the principle that Congress has
 no power to legislate for
 the I erritorios upon this
 subject but I ha e
 discussed that another occasion and
 will n repeat my I
 turn now to thc onsideration
 aroun7ent now of other subjects
 The other day the Senator
 from Tennessee Mr NICHOLSON vhom
 I do not now see
 in his seat stated that
 at the present time there
 was a verv wide spread
 alarm existincr in the southern
 States i n relation to
 the principles and ulterior designs
 of the Republican party He
 said that it was not
 so much the violation of
 the fugitive slave law nor
 the denial of the right
 to enter the Tcrritory with
 slaves which occasioned that alarm
 but from the growing numbers
 and power of tho free
 States he apprehended that the
 I time would come when
 they would have power to
 amend the Constitution itself and
 give to the the exercise
 of it was in violation
 of the treaty I Federal
 Government the power to abolish
 slavery if it be true
 that such wide spread with
 France Justice Grier concurred in
 the in the States opinion
 of the court that the
 act of Congress of II
 alarm exists among his people
 and 1 do not doubt
 it I desire to ask
 that honorable Senator why he
 did not while speaking upon
 that sub ject embrace in
 his speech which is to
 circulate among his constituents the
 expressive anguacre adopted by the
 Republican party as one of
 its fundamental principles at Chicago
 I will read it That
 the maintenance inviolate of the
 rights of the States and
 especially toe right of each
 State to order an i
 judgment exclusively is essential to
 that balance of power on
 which the perfection aid endurancc
 ofour political fabric depends and
 we denounce the lawless invasion
 by arnied force of any
 State or I erritory no
 matter under what pre text
 as among the greatest of
 crimes If that honorable Senator
 desires that the peo ple
 of his State should know
 what are the views of
 the Republican party and especially
 of that man who is
 about to take possession of
 one de partment of the
 Government why 1 ask in
 all candor should he not
 in his speech which is
 to circulate among his people
 incorporate these au thorized declarations
 of the Republican party Mr
 Lincoln has been elected as
 President of tl c Uni
 ted States and certainly if
 that Senator desires instead of
 increasing to quiet the alarm
 of his citizens why does
 ho not quote in his
 speech so that it can
 reach theih for ours do
 not what Mr Lincoln declared
 over and over acrain in
 the State of Illinois in
 the presence ofhis own people
 Why not Ict your people
 understand precisely the grounds upon
 which Mr Lincoln and the
 Repub lican party do stand
 Quoti11g into his speech the
 other day that one declaration
 which was made the subject
 matter of so much discussion
 between Mr Lihcoln and the
 honorable Senator from Illi in
 the canvass of 1858 I
 nois Mr DOUGLAS insist that
 it would have been but
 just and fair to his
 own constituents as well as
 to the President ekect and
 to the Republican party that
 he should have quoted also
 Into his speech what I
 lr Lin coli has said
 again and again in reference
 to this same declaration Upon
 one occasion in re ply
 to the charge of Mr
 DOUGLAS that he was in
 favor of making war by
 the North upon the South
 for the extermination of slavery
 Mr Lincoln do not believe
 the language en ployed will
 bear any know that I
 never nnennt any such such
 construction that no fair mind
 can inlier any such thing
 and believe have ever said
 thin froni anyL11intr if indeed
 your people rest under such
 appre hensions why not proclaim
 in every speech that can
 reach the people of the
 slaveho ldinø States that the
 incoming President declares have no
 purpose directly or indirectly to
 interfere with the institution of
 slavery in thc States vvhere
 it exists believe I have
 no lawful right to do
 so and I have no
 in W ben it clination
 to do so said that
 1 arn in favor of
 interfering with slavery where it
 exists 1 kno v it
 is unwarranted by anything I
 have ever have ever said
 intended and as i believe
 by hotd myself under constitutional
 obligations to allow the people
 in all the States without
 in terférence direct or indirect
 to do exactly as they
 please and I deny that
 I have any inclination to
 interi re with th ln
 even if there were no
 such constitutional obliga Lion I
 t there is one thing
 for which he is known
 and distinguished it is for
 his inflexible integrity of purpose
 unquestioned even by his bitterest
 ICal enemies When hc declares
 that he has no purpose
 inclination and believes that has
 no constitutional power either directly
 or indi rectly to interftn
 e with slavery iFI the
 States that he could not
 if he would and would
 not if he could I
 ask the Senator fronl rrennessec
 why not in I leaven
 s narnc quote these declarations
 into the speeches which hc
 is sending home to his
 con stituents if in truth
 he desires to quiet that
 alarm which he savs exists
 among them Mr NICHOLSON Mr
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr in
 the chair Does the Senator
 from yield to the Senator
 from Tennessee Mr DOOLI rTLE
 Yes sir Mr NICHOLSON must
 say to the Senator I
 from Wisconsin that in the
 remarks which I rpade in
 commenting on the Republican platform
 I stated in explicit language
 as plain as I could
 utter it that in that
 platform they professed t_heir determination
 to regard the righ ts
 which southern men claimed in
 their slaves in the States
 and that Mr Lincoln fully
 and explicitly a_ccords with the
 sentiment and declarations of Iiis
 platform I did not quote
 the language of the platform
 in that stated though what
 was my view of respect
 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLdiE that
 platform and that it did
 profess explicitly to allow to
 the people of the southern
 States the enjoyment of their
 rights within the States but
 laid down a principle outside
 of the States which if
 carried out to its u
 timate consequences would destroy their
 rights within the States I
 do not know what more
 I could have done without
 quot ing the whole platform
 and Mr Lincoln s discus
 sions with Mr DOUGLAS which
 would have oe cupied more
 timo than I desired to
 consume Mr DOOLITTLE 1 understood
 the Senator from Tennessee to
 say that their great apprehen
 Sion was that the purpose
 of the Republican party in
 getting possession of the Government
 was so to increase the
 number and power of the
 free States that they would
 obtain at last the power
 of amendment over the Constitution
 and when they obtained that
 it was their purpose to
 ex erclse it and cmancipate
 the slaves within the States
 I understand him to say
 that in substance now Mr
 NICHOLSON 1 took the position
 that the policy principles and
 measures of the Re publican
 party as avowed by them
 if carried to their consequences
 in the course of time
 x vould extinguish slavery in
 the States I expressed the
 apprehension that when they had
 the power by the increase
 of free States if they
 intended to carry out their
 purpose of ultimate extinction of
 slavery they would resort to
 that power and thereby bring
 about the result svhich their
 candi date rvn Lincoln expressly
 said ho desired Should come
 abou t thc final extinction
 of slavery That was my
 position Mt DOOLITTLE Mr President
 the Repub lice n party
 as I understand it maintain
 the re served rights of
 the States that all powers
 not expressly delegatbd or necessary
 to carry into effect the
 powers which are delegated by
 the Con stitution of the
 United States are expressly re
 scrvcd to the States and
 that it is fundamental to
 maintain the independence and sovereignty
 of the several States in
 raspect to all matters which
 are not conferred upon the
 general Government by the Constitution
 and that among the powers
 not conferred but reserved to
 the States is an abso
 lute independent sovereign control over
 all their domestic institutions and
 I undertake to say to
 that honorable Senator that there
 aro no Repub licans to
 be found within my knowledge
 within any of the States
 who have ever exprcssed the
 purpose or the desire that
 the general Govern ment should
 have the power to in
 terfere with slavery in the
 States Not one sir I
 know that some years ago
 a book published by Mr
 Lysander Spooner took the ground
 that the Constitution of the
 United States of itself abolished
 slavery but sir it finds
 very few sup It is
 just as unfounded as that
 other porters Idea which finds
 I regret to say so
 many sup porters now in
 the South but which found
 very féw even there until
 1848 that the Constitution of
 the United States is a
 slavery extending Con stitution and
 by its own force establishes
 sla very or what is
 the same thing guaranties the
 right to take and hold
 slaves in the Territories Mr
 CLINGMAN myself of this casion
 to ask the Senator a
 question as hc speaks I
 have no knowledge knowingly on
 this subject of the fact
 but it svas published in
 a newspaper and therefore 1
 call his attention to it
 He says that respectable authority
 or man of standing adopts
 this view of Spooner T
 herc was a pub iication
 last winter in some of
 the newspapers I fliink stating
 that the honorable Senator from
 New York Mr SEWARD had
 commended the work in very
 high terms There was a
 note pub fished purporting to
 have come from him Now
 I should like to know
 of thc honorable Senator whether
 he means to say that
 that was a forgery or
 does he mean to say
 that the honorable Sen ator
 from New York is not
 such authority as should be
 considered of weight in the
 country on these questions Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 remember too that
 the honorable Senator from Mississippi
 Mr BROWN also commended the
 book as one of great
 ability here on the floor
 of the Senate He thought
 Mr Spooner was a man
 of great ability and ingenuity
 But repeat this idea that
 the Constitution of the United
 States abolishes slavery by force
 of its own terms in
 any State or Territory or
 that it estab lishcs slavery
 in any State or Territory
 has not in my opinion
 the shadow ofa foundation The
 truth is that upon either
 ground the Constitution never could
 have been forméd atall It
 was framed by men who
 knew thé words which they
 em ployed and the meaning
 of those words They recognized
 it is true the rights
 of the StatAs to have
 persons held to Service undcr
 their own State laws not
 under the Constitution nor under
 the laws ofthé United States
 butunder their own laws They
 acknowledged the right änd made
 it the duty that persons
 so held to service when
 es capino into other States
 or those States where such
 Paws did not exist should
 be delivered up on claim
 of he person to whom
 the servicc was due But
 they have not declared anywhere
 in the Constitution of the
 United States that prop erty
 in man exists by virtue
 of its provisions They neither
 afhrm nor deny that it
 can exist by State authority
 under State law They leave
 just as they intended to
 leave each State perfect ly
 sovereign and independent over its
 own laws on the subject
 of slavery There was a
 provision it is true that
 until 1808 Congress should not
 have power to prevent States
 from importing or im migrating
 such persons as they should
 desire to have come into
 their jurisdictions but the Con
 stitution of the Uniteil States
 does not refer to them
 as property nor as merchandise
 but refers to them as
 persons held to service The
 law of the slave States
 makes them property the law
 of the free States does
 not mako them property The
 Constitution does not make them
 either That is the truth
 about it Neither Mr Spooner
 with his idca that the
 Constitution abolishes slavery nor this
 fanatical idea that has grown
 up within the last ten
 or twelve years at the
 South that the Constitution establishes
 slavery has any foundation what
 I say to these gentlemen
 that upon that ever idea
 that the Constitution establishes slavery
 you cannot have peace on
 the slavery question and you
 may just as well know
 it first as last The
 people of t hc United
 States do not believe that
 the Constitution is and will
 never consent that it shall
 be altered so that it
 will bccomc a slavcry extend
 ing Constitution by force of
 its own terms We do
 not ask either that you
 put upon it that con
 struction which shall abolish slavery
 in any State orin any
 Territory We say let the
 Constitution be as our fathers
 madc it let it be
 neutral neither affrming nor denying
 and then you can have
 peace Mr President one word
 further as to the pur
 pose or designs of the
 President elect of the United
 States He says Let me
 say I have no prejudice
 against the southern ithey arc
 just what we would be
 in their situa If slavery
 did not exist ilEnong thetn
 they would not tion If
 it did now exist arnong
 us we should 1 0t
 introduce it L his I
 believc of the masses North
 instantly give it up and
 South Doubtless there are individuals
 on bot h sides who
 would not hold slaves under
 any circumstances and others who
 would gladly introduce slavery anew
 if it were now out
 of existence We know that
 some southern Inen do free
 their slaves go north and
 becune tip top Aboli tioniste
 while some northern ones go
 southl and become most cruel
 slave Inaslers When southern people
 tell us they are no
 morc re sponsibie fin origin
 of slavery tha i we
 are acknowl edge the fact
 it said that the institution
 exists and that it is
 very difficult to get rid
 of it in any satisfactory
 way i can understand and
 apprcciate the sayiug I surely
 wilk not blame them iOr
 not doing what bould not
 know how to do myself
 if all earthly power were
 given me I should not
 know what to do as
 to thc existing institution My
 first injpulse would be to
 free all the slaves and
 scnd thorn to Liberia to
 their own native land Buta
 1110tnent s reflection would convince
 nie that whatever of high
 hope as I think there
 is there may be in
 this in the long run
 its sudden execution is ilnpossib
 e gt they were all
 landed there in a day
 they would perish in the
 next ten days ard there
 are not surplus shipping and
 surplus money enough in the
 world to carry there in
 many tunes ten days What
 then Free them all and
 keep thorn atnong us as
 underlings Is it quite certain
 tlfat this betters their con
 dition I tl ink I
 would not hold one in
 slavery at any ratc yet
 the point is not clear
 enough to denounce people upon
 What next Free them all
 i make them politically and
 socially our equals My own
 féelings will not admit of
 this and if mine would
 we well know that those
 of the great mass of
 white people will not WV
 hether this freliug accords with
 justice and sound judgment is
 not the sole question if
 indeed it is any part
 of it A universal feel
 in whether well or ill
 founded cannot be safely disre
 It does garded We cannot
 then make then equals seem
 to me that systems of
 gradual emancipation Inight be adopted
 but for that tardiness in
 this respect I will not
 undertake to judge our bret
 hren of the South When
 they remind us of their
 constitutional rights acknowledge them not
 grudgingly but fully and i
 airty and I wrould givc

 auguäC 21 1858 Now I
 ask gentlemen upöli the Chamber
 those of you Who do
 upon this agitation for the
 dfriiäkiBetlté agitation greater those of
 you lici d ÖQh b
 t to aggravate this excitement
 and of you who peace
 aid the the Union why
 in the speeches tha you
 culate among your people do
 you not itieIg4 these declarations
 of Mr Lincoln made ahü
 ii dred times over in
 his own State and published
 throughout the whole of the
 free States with the full
 knowledge of which he has
 been eleetéd by such majorities
 to be the President of
 the United States If you
 want peace among your peoplé
 why is it not just
 and fair and why dre
 you 00t called upon if
 you desire to quiet the
 alarm which you say existing
 among put these declarations into
 your speeches and circu late
 them among your people And
 now Mr President I desiré
 to speak Of what are
 now alleged to be the
 CäüSes of irritation existing at
 the present moment between the
 citi zeris of the slaveholding
 and non lmiehölding States One
 which was introduced bythe hon
 orable Senator from Kentucky Mr
 POWELL ille other day I
 regretted exe edingly to see
 iptfö ducod at this time
 The subject matter of it
 h is existed from the
 very foundation of the Govei
 h mcnt but believe it
 is but very recently that
 we havc heard of it
 in connection with this contro
 versy The complaint is this
 that some of the non
 slaveholding States refuse to surrender
 crim inals who are fugitives
 from justice I know that
 upon this subject of demanding
 fugitives from justice the States
 have generally adopted this as
 the rule of their action
 if the etimc with wliich
 the individual stood charged was
 a crime within the laws
 ef the State to which
 he flees he Sholtld be
 surrendered and notothcvivisc Such liæ
 ß been the practice of
 thc oldest StatcS beginning Wich
 Virginia at a very early
 day When certain dividuals were
 demanded by the State of
 Pennsyl vania to be delivered
 up as fugitives from justice
 charged with kidnappinæ free negroes
 from that State the Governor
 of Virginia refused to deliver
 them up and put his
 ref isal upon thåt gfound
 So too in relation to
 obtaining money under pretenses Mr
 BENJAMIN the Senator be good
 enough to give us his
 authority for that last as
 I should like to examme
 that sertion Mr DOOLITTLE You
 will find it referred to
 in onc of the dissenting
 opinions of the Frigg case
 Mr BENJAMIN In the Prigg
 Mr DOOLITTLE Yes sir so
 too in re lation to
 the obtaining of property by
 false pré tenses We all
 know that obtaining property by
 false tokens or false pretenses
 was not a crime at
 the common law it wasa
 simple misdemeanor a cheat but
 by the laws of the
 State of New York it
 is made felony and since
 _ they have made this
 a felonious crime they have
 sometimes demanded fugitives from thc
 State of New York to
 be delivered up by several
 States by Ohio and other
 States and they have been
 refused in those States where
 the crime is not made
 felonious by their own laws
 but remains as a simple
 misde meanor Mr FESSENDEN Maine
 refused Massa chusetts on the
 same ground Mr DOOLITTLE I
 understand my friend here to
 say that Maine has refused
 to deliver up to Massachusetts
 on precisely the same ground
 It was because the States
 were unwilling that the State
 of New York in which
 the great commercial transactions take
 place should have the power
 to make every cheat every
 fraud a felony underthe lav
 r of New York and
 make those laws a kind
 of criminal creditor s bill
 by which they could send
 out the process of the
 State of New York and
 demand his surrender from other
 States to bring him within
 the jurisdiction of that State
 and enforce the payment of
 a debt So too between
 the States bordering upon the
 Ohio A man a member
 of the Legislatuie l believe
 it was of the Statc
 of Kentucky several years ago
 was indicted in the State
 of Indiana for the offense
 of free negroes from the
 State of Indiana and taking
 them into the 198 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBFL December 27 State
 of Kentucky The Governor of
 Indiana made a requisition upon
 the Governor of Ken tucky
 and the Governor of Kentucky
 refused to i deliver him
 up and upon the same
 principle So too it is
 true as the Senator from
 Kentucky has stated the Governor
 of Kentucky has demanded of
 the Governor of Ohio to
 surrender up one in dicted
 for stealing slaves from the
 State of Ken tucky which
 was refused and put upon
 precisely the same ground that
 the test of criminality should
 be the law of the
 Stale Lo which they flee
 and not the State from
 which they escapc Mr President
 lay asidc all this excitement
 that exists in this body
 and thrOughout the country on
 this negro question and I
 undertake to say that there
 are not ten men to
 bc found on this floor
 who would advocate the doctrine
 thata State bv its own
 laws can make whatsoever it
 pleases a crime and that
 its indictment shall be conclusive
 evidencc of the guilt as
 well as of the escape
 of thc per son chargcd
 and that he shall bc
 absolutely sur rendered the Governor
 of the Stato where he
 may be found The honorable
 Senator from Ken tucky may
 complain that it is annoying
 so 1 It is exceedingly
 annoying t hat tbc grant
 it is free negroes of
 Ohio and of Indiana can
 be kid napped and carried
 into slavery in Kentucky 01
 elsewhere So it is annoying
 for the slavehold ers on
 the contrary that their slaves
 may bc en ticed to
 run away from them I
 know all that but sir
 there is a higher principle
 involved I will read my
 authority for the stat ement
 which I made in relation
 to the action of the
 Governor of Kentucky a statement
 vvhich I find in tho
 Louis ville Journal Governor Magoffin
 knows very well that onc
 of his predecessors a Governor
 of this State a good
 Inany years ago refused upon
 a requisition l rcnn the
 Govcrnor of Iu diana to
 surrender a fugitive charged with
 kidnapping a negro frrnn that
 State the ground assu ned
 being that it was no
 crime by Kentucky law I
 he offender in t lxat
 case was svc understand a
 Ine nber of tho Kentuckv
 and he was dernanded as
 a fugitive frorn justice by
 ttnc Governor of Indiana fbr
 having gone over to that
 St ate and itn cibly
 seized aud brought a negro
 to Kentucky leaal process and
 Governor of Kent ueky sustn
 Ened by the Kentucky Legislature
 leclined as Ve have said
 to surrender the ancged fugitive
 on the ground that he
 had lonc nothing vhie h
 the laws of Kentucky recognized
 as a crime I do
 110t care to go into
 a discussion of whether the
 right 01 wrong principle has
 been adopted by the Govcrnors
 of these several States in
 insistil ff that the c
 rn ne for which they
 are to be delivered up
 should be a crime within
 their own limits or not
 but whichever is right or
 whichever is wrong it is
 a principle which has prevailed
 in this coun try almost
 from thc beginning of the
 Government and ought not to
 brought forward to day for
 the purpose of acrgravntino the
 excitement now exist ino in
 the slave States to prove
 that the people of thc
 free States are unwilling fait
 hfully to all in tents
 and purposes to abide by
 the and by all its
 compromises another cause of is
 M r President X on
 rend ition of fugitives fro
 rn allecred to be the
 I the validit y of
 thc clause in the service
 Constitution which denies to any
 State the power to discharge
 a fa ritive frorn service
 fron the obli adtnit that
 it is gution hc owes
 to his rnaster the ConRfituGon
 which I one of the
 clauses of have sworn to
 support and I feel bound
 in con science to ndmit
 the validity of this clause
 as well as of every
 other clause in the Constitution
 While do this I tnust
 say in au kness and
 sincerity that questions have arisen
 on the construction of this
 clat_l so of thc Constitution
 tbe action of the Govcrnment
 under it Congress I about
 five hund ed thousand in
 the State of Vir does
 possess power tö legislate for
 the renditioh of fugitive slavég
 The Supreme Court of the
 United States on repeated occasions
 and the su preme courtS
 of Massachusetts Ohio and New
 York composed too of Republican
 judges have held that it
 belongs to Congress and not
 to thc States to legislate
 on this point I understand
 too that by the clear
 declaration of the President elect
 Mr Lincoln he is one
 among the number vv ho
 admit that Congress possesses the
 power to legis latc on
 this subject Hc said in
 his speech at Alton on
 the 16th of October 18
 58 suppose most of us
 I know it of myself
 believe that the people of
 t l e southern States
 are entitled to a congres
 sional fugitive slave law As
 the right is constitutional I
 aarcc that the legislation shall
 be grantcd to it and
 that not that we like
 the institution of slavery We
 profess to have no taste
 for running and catching negroes
 at least I profess no
 taste for that job at
 all Why then do I
 yield support to a fugitive
 slave law Because do not
 understand that the Constitution which
 guaranties that right can be
 sup ported without it Now
 although as I have stated
 frankly in my own opinion
 it belongs to the States
 and not to Congress to
 legislate on this subject still
 I am bound to declarc
 with equal frankness that the
 President elect of the Umted
 has declared again and again
 that it belongs to Congress
 and that Congress is bound
 to give an efficient fugitive
 slave law In his own
 language I would give them
 any legislation for the reclaiming
 of their fugitives which should
 not in its stringency be
 Illore likely to carry a
 freeman into slavery than our
 ordinary criminal laws arc to
 hana an innocent one While
 in my iudxmcnt reasoning as
 I do in favor ofa
 strictconstruction of the Constitution I
 believe that it belongs to
 tbc States and not to
 Congress to legislate still I
 am compelled to admit that
 outsidc of my own Statc
 the judicial authority inia At
 800 apiece they would amount
 to 400 000 000 Now
 I ask what is the
 annnal loss of the State
 of V irginia upon 400
 000 000 in the es
 cape of fugitive slaves l
 he Senator says 100 000
 One hundred thousand dollars upon
 400 000 000 is but
 one fortieth Of one per
 cent it is but one
 fourth of n mill on
 a dollar crowincr out of
 the peculiar risk which men
 who invest their prop erty
 in slaves run in the
 State of Virginia and that
 is one of the border
 States of this Conft der
 acy Concede that this estimate
 of the Senator from Virginia
 is right that the State
 of Virginia loses 100 000
 every year it is a
 loss I repeat of but
 one fourth of a mill
 on a dollar and one
 for ticth of one per
 cent Every species of property
 has its own peculiar risks
 If vou invest in land
 in grain in merchandise in
 stocks invest your property in
 what you will it has
 peculiar risks of its own
 and the loss on this
 property which is subjected to
 a peculiar risk growing out
 of thc fact that the
 person that is made the
 subject of prop erty has
 a will and a disposition
 to run away IS but
 one fourth of a mill
 on a dollar less than
 the peculiar risk which is
 incurred on any other spe
 cics of property in the
 United States Why IV Ir
 President suppose the slavehold ers
 of Virgi nia were to
 form themselves into a mutual
 insurance cornpany by which to
 insuro themselves acainst loss from
 the escape of their slaves
 how slight indeed would be
 the amount paid upon that
 insurance One fourth of a
 mill on a dollar ofthc
 slave property of Virginia would
 sccure that property against all
 loss by runaway slaves I
 llis peculiar spcc ic s
 of property whic h is
 subjccted to so slighta risk
 has peculiar advan tages too
 under the Constitution of the
 United States It is entitled
 to representation That cannot be
 has been almost unanimous the
 other way and said of
 any other property Four hundred
 mil such is thc opinion
 entertained by the Presidcnt lion
 of the property of Virginia
 is represented elect I must
 say however that in my
 hun hle in the other
 branch of this Congress and
 for the opinion reason is
 upon onc side and the
 weight benefit of this representation
 is it anything strancrc that
 those who own that in
 Virginia of precedent ar d
 authority is upon the other
 But Mr Prcsidcnt what have
 been tbc facts ill relation
 to the execution of the
 fugitive slavc law MT here
 has any slave t hat
 has f ver been taken
 into custody and been brought
 before a commissioner under the
 fugitive slave law where has
 any such slave with the
 exception of two or threc
 instances ever been rescued or
 ever escaped In own Statc
 a slave was arrcstcd under
 circumstances calculated to produce an
 immense degree of ex citen
 cnt in thc inimediatc locality
 He was res cued and
 this fugitive slave law was
 put into execution against an
 individual who was charged Wilh
 beino instrumental in his rescue
 I refer to I should
 bc subiacted to some peculiar
 additional the one fourth risk
 TV hen that risk is
 so slityht they have right
 on of n mill on
 the dollal that ground to
 undertake to break up this
 Union to destroy all its
 ad vantages and plange the
 coun try into civil war
 I ask what wilt vou
 gain by brea king the
 bond of the Union I
 under this bond which now
 cornpels us to surrender your
 fug itives you incur the
 risk of but one fourth
 of a rhill on a
 dollar in the border States
 how much risk will vou
 incur if you break the
 bond and arc no longer
 held to surrender your fugitives
 Bring down the linc of
 the editor ofa newspaper in
 the city Of Milwau Canada
 to Virginia and then how
 much risk would He was
 brought bcforc the district court
 Of tbc slave property of
 Virginia have to pay to
 secure the United States and
 convicted and sentenced themselves against
 loss by escape Would one
 and he is in prison
 That is the only case
 i pcr cent five per
 cent ay sir would ten
 per that cvcr occurred in
 Wisconsin How has the cent
 secure you against the loss
 from the escape in Illinois
 in Ohio in Indiana and
 fact been an y where
 in the Unit rd States
 in reference to any person
 who has actually escaloc d
 as a fugi tive and
 been claimed under this law
 Bnt rontlernen say that fugitive
 sometimes cscapc without ever beinc
 arrested That is very true
 indeed so they do but
 that is not the fault
 of the law That grows
 out of the fact that
 you own a species of
 property which has a will
 and legs of its own
 and which desires so nelimcs
 to escapc to That is
 your misfortune It you invest
 your nioney in a species
 not ours of properly which
 hus a will and power
 of its own to escape
 wc are not reponsible for
 that W c For 111
 yseif believino as I do
 that the Constitu tion of
 the United States should bc
 strictly con strucd if it
 were left for I should
 decide that it did not
 belon Y to Congress to
 legislate at all on this
 subject that it beloneed to
 tho States and only to
 the States and that it
 wouid bp the duty of
 the States if it were
 left to them and to
 then to nake provision by
 law faithfully to carry alone
 ir to this clause of
 the Constitution same opinion was
 expressed by Mr Webster and
 by Mr Rhptt of South
 Carolina when inembcrs are not
 made insurers of your slave
 property anainst its runnino away
 We are only required to
 surrender persons held in your
 service when you claim them
 But Mr President I desire
 to look at this in
 another point of view The
 Senator from Vir crinia Mr
 MASON the other day told
 us t hat it was
 estimated in 1850 that at
 least 100 000 every year
 of property in nea ro
 slaves was lost from the
 Slate of Virginia atld he
 believes that the of your
 slaves Mr President let the
 bond of this Union be
 broken and the nol l
 slaveholdin States no longer compelled
 by the Constitution to surrender
 these fu itives and slave
 property would of necessity reiire
 ft on the border I
 assure crentlemen on the other
 side of the Chamber that
 those men who are regarded
 as the Abolitionists in this
 country those men who have
 denounced the Constitution as being
 a covenant with hell be
 cause we were bound to
 return these fugitives to slavery
 stand looking on to day
 witli an anxiety and intensity
 of interest which you cannot
 con ceive Their prayers YO
 up day and night that
 this Union luay be broken
 that the free States of
 thc North Inay no longer
 be compelled by the l
 ond of Union to surrender
 your fugitive slaves They know
 what tbc effect would be
 and they desire the dissolution
 of the Union to produce
 just that effect in all
 the border States Now by
 the statement of the gentleman
 from Virginia the loss whicll
 is subn itted to by
 that State and it is
 a border State is but
 onc fourth of a mill
 on a dollar Break the
 bond of the Union and
 no ten of this IJ
 dv the same opillion was
 expressed by same is true
 now that the annual loss
 of Virginia a majority of
 the judges of the supretne
 court of by tlle escapo
 of slaves is 100 000
 Concede it Wisconsin At F
 he same time I admit
 with equal for tho sake
 of n y arc rumen
 t W h is the
 value of tho proportv in
 slaves iti Virginia or concenhnent
 whatever frank nosg what was
 it before this recent panic
 On an on tlBig question
 that the majority of the
 peo all sections and of
 all average thev were worth

 he United Stag s i
 per cent upon the fall
 value of the slave property
 of Virginia wm tld secure
 thorn aoainst loss tne cscape
 of fugitive s nves So
 too Mr resident these very
 Abolitionists whose declarations have so
 often benn under identified I
 taken by our political enemies
 to be partics to day
 outside of the State where
 I reside f one thousand
 dollars apiece as I am
 told by with the doctrine
 and purposes of the Republican
 admit that by this clause
 of the Constitution and gentlemen
 perhaps half that now There
 are party stand in anxious
 suspense hoping and 1860 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL praying that the bond
 of this Union may be
 broken and for another reason
 they know that the time
 will come in the progress
 of pop ulation and the
 time is cornmg with as
 much vertainty us the revolutions
 of the earth that the
 slave population in some of
 these States shall become so
 preponderating in numbers and phys
 ical power that it can
 no longer be held in
 sub jection to their masters
 that by the bond of
 the Union under which we
 live the arm of the
 Fed eral Government may be
 called in to put down
 insurrection and it IS because
 they believe that if this
 bond were broken the strong
 arm of the Federal Government
 could no longer be brought
 in to hold the peace
 and security of those States
 that they desire that it
 should be broken They desire
 it upon two grounds first
 to com pél the slaves
 to be withdrawn from the
 border States by easy and
 constant escapes and by re
 moval into the southern slave
 States and vhcn the whole
 mass of negro slaves shall
 be collect ed together in
 great numbers in those States
 and when the bond of
 Union shall be broken and
 the Federal Governme nt can
 no longer be brought in
 to put down insurrection they
 then hope to see immediate
 emancipation in the stave States
 with all the consequences wiiich
 would fol low They are
 as anxious for the dissolution
 of the Union as many
 of the extremists upon the
 Gulf of Mexico And Mr
 President while I can not
 believe that those residing in
 the Gulf States desire to
 accomplish any such purpose I
 cannot for my life sce
 and I do not know
 what course they could pursue
 which would be any more
 likely to bring about that
 result than to break up
 this Union of States and
 to overturn this Constitu placed
 by a conflict between these
 two Govern ments in a
 position where he must of
 necéssity be guilty of treason
 ü the one or the
 other and therefore be bound
 to be hung any way
 Mr DOOLITTLE No sir he
 for if the State declares
 that to be treason which
 by thc Constitution of the
 United States is void as
 I being in conflict with
 it it is no treason
 for the Constitution of the
 United States is the funda
 mental law of your State
 and any act or declara
 tion making it treason to
 do an act which is
 in conflict with the Constitution
 of the United States cannot
 be made treason by the
 State althmph they may declare
 it so Mr BENJAMIN If
 they declare it so and
 hang the citizen because theydeolareitso
 I should I like to
 know what advantage it would
 bc to him that in
 theory the decision was wroncy
 Mr DOOLITTLE The citizen must
 judge at his peril If
 a law is enacted by
 Congress which IS within the
 Constitution of the United States
 the citizen will judge at
 his peril and if he
 undertakes to break up the
 Government of the United States
 and to be guilty of
 treason against the Government of
 the United States any act
 which the State may declare
 in conflict with it is
 simply unconstitutional null and void
 Mr BENJAMIN The proposition 1
 put to the Senator is
 this as a practical proposition
 if the citizen of a
 State is by the action
 of his State which he
 cannot control commanded to do
 u cer tain thing under
 the penalty of being hange
 d un der the law
 of the State and if
 that thing is treason under
 the Constitution and laws of
 the United States is it
 possible under the law of
 nations and under the common
 sentiments of humanity that govern
 mankind for the Federal Government
 lion to undertake to act
 upon the individual who is
 Sir it was in view
 of this that our present
 min istcr to France in
 speaking of the institution of
 placed under duress to commit
 treason instead of slavery in
 the Legislature of Virginia declared
 that it had a magnitude
 of desolating power cnmpared with
 which if the Federal Union
 should be broken the pestilence
 that walketh in dark ness
 and the destruction that wasteth
 at noonday This declaration was
 madc Would be a blessing
 si ortly after the Southampton
 insurrection by which all Virginia
 was startled in her Legislature
 not long after that insurrection
 occurred Then it was that
 he said that if the
 bond of the Federal Union
 should be broken the institution
 of slavery would have such
 a magnitude of desolating power
 tell you Mr President that
 these Abolitionists the Garrison school
 of the North arö to
 day as anxious to break
 up the Union as the
 men in the extreme cotton
 States or in South Carolina
 Mr President there is one
 other subject rnat tcr upon
 which I desire to detain
 the Senate a short time
 and I shall have done
 The Consti tution of the
 United States adopted by the
 original t hirteen States and
 which has become the Consti
 tution of other States as
 admitted into thc Union is
 so far as it speaks
 in delegating power to this
 overnment the supreme law of
 the land any ing in
 anv State law or constitution
 to the con In all
 other matters per ary notwithstanding
 fect independence and sovereignty are
 reserved to the several States
 Every citizen of the United
 States therefore owes a double
 allegiance one to this Federal
 Government and another to the
 State in which he lives
 He may be guilty of
 first relieving him from tbat
 duress by making war upon
 the State Mr DOOLITTLE If
 one of the citizens of
 Wisconsin and sir I am
 sorry to be compcllcd to
 state that such things have
 occurred in son e of
 the southern States is talon
 by a mob and hangcd
 what remedy has he Mr
 BENJAMIN I am not speakingof
 mobs I am speaking of
 constituted governments If the government
 of a State undertakes to
 hang a citizen for refusing
 to obey certain orders and
 if the Government of the
 United States acting as it
 says upon the individual and
 not upon the State hangs
 him if he does obey
 it I ask if that
 is a position to which
 the gentleman supposes the fathers
 consented that a citizen should
 bc placed in when the
 Constitution was framed Mr DOOLITTLE
 If the man is to
 be hung if he does
 the act and to be
 hung if hc does not
 undoubtedly BO far as he
 is concerned it will laughter
 but as n make no
 Treat diffcrcnce question of law
 if he does an act
 which is treason against the
 United States and is compelled
 to do thal act by
 a law of the State
 thc State law is void
 because it is in conflict
 with the Constitu tion of
 the United States Mr BENJAMIN
 Then would the hanging be
 void Laughter Mr DOOLITTLE The
 would be a certainty laughter
 it would not be void
 for un certainty I say
 Mr President that where the
 treason against either he may
 be guilty of treason Constitution
 of the United States speaks
 in lan guage clear enough
 to delccrate power to this
 GOV but within their spheres
 each gov against both ernment
 it is not in tbc
 power of one ten one
 If Congros s ernment is
 sovereign and supreme steps beyond
 the powers delegated by the
 Con II hundred or all
 the citizens of a State
 any more stitution to enact
 any law it is absolutely
 void than it is in
 the power of a mob
 led on by Judge If
 the State should step beyond
 the Constitution I Lynch to
 annui that act of Congress
 because the of the United
 States which limits the power
 of Constitution and the acts
 in pursuance of it are
 the States to enact a
 law in conflict with it
 it is II the supreme
 law of that State and
 binding on every citizen and
 upon all the citizens in
 that simply unconstitutional null and
 void Mr BENJAMIN i should
 like just at this I
 State and every citizen must
 of course act at his
 point to ask a question
 of the Senator from Wis
 peril Mr BENJAMIN not the
 Sen consin if I do
 not disturb the course of
 his arcru I ator further
 in the course of his
 argument but I If he
 prefers going on I will
 not ask it ment will
 take occasion to answer him
 I get the i Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 have no objection
 Mr BENJAMIN I understand the
 Senator floor in In y
 turn to say that every
 citizen of the United States
 owes Mr DOOLITTLE If this
 doctrine is true that a
 State by its own mere
 motion without the a double
 allegiance one to the Federal
 Govern ment the other to
 his State and that he
 may be consent of the
 other States can assemble in
 con guilty of treason to
 either or to both Am
 I vention by mass meetings
 of its citizens or other
 wise and i y resolution
 dissolve its conncction corroct in
 that with the Federal Government
 absolve its citi follow If
 one State can I suppose
 the Senatoy deny that all
 the Yestun éeeede fkorn of
 necessity that gives to thio
 power to expel a State
 Iri ht Involves the right
 of expulsidli further BENJAMIN answer
 Mr DOOLITTLE may course of
 m arcument Mr BENYJAüIN I
 thought you were dit in
 for an answer DOOLITTLE No
 sir my notes Mr President
 how would th i doctrine
 ipéi a te in tim
 of war In thc war
 of 1812 with Gi eat
 Britain some of the New
 England States it is Said
 were rather disaffected toward the
 Gdvé n ment Of the
 United some of their Citi
 zens met in convention at
 At Such moment when actually
 at warwi_th Gieat if the
 doctrine ot the gentleman iS
 correct that secession is a
 constitutional i iÉli ts that
 thé Citi zcns 0f aState
 can resolve themselves in or
 out at their the people
 of MaSsachuseits could have resolved
 themselves out of the Union
 and gone over to the
 enemy without treason Our fortresses
 in Boston harbcn built with
 our money manned with our
 soldiers and mounted with our
 guns might by a resolution
 passed by a Massachusetts convention
 have been withdrawn from our
 jurisdiction and surrendered to the
 enemy ay our own guns
 turned upon us Thüt would
 indeed be constitutional secession with
 a vengeance Again the doctrine
 that each State may con
 stitutionally secede and become to
 all the rest foreign Power
 would open the Unitéd SiateS
 to become the theater of
 all tho intriguoa of foreigh
 Powers like the petty principalities
 upon th e ropean continent
 No State can enter into
 any treaty alliance or confederation
 nor i n to any
 agreemen t com pact with
 an other State or with
 a iör eign Power is
 the express language of the
 Constitution mid any such alliance
 or com pact on the
 part of the State would
 be null and void and
 on the part of any
 foreign Power an act of
 war But again sir take
 it in time of peace
 apply your doctrine to Pennsylvania
 and New Jersey that they
 by a simple resolution of
 their people can withdraw from
 the United States of America
 Why sir they would cut
 off all your great mail
 routes North and you could
 notgo by land from Virginia
 to New York without going
 through a foreign country So
 too with Illinois If this
 doctrinc is correct a mere
 resolution of the citi zens
 of Illinois can make that
 a foreign Ståte and cut
 off entirely the Northwest from
 communica tion with the East
 by land and we must
 ask leave of Illinois to
 go to New York or
 to New England to Ohio
 or to Indiana unless we
 go down around through the
 States of Missouri and KenL
 tucky and you propose to
 make that foreign jurisdietiön also
 Where does this Absurd doctrine
 end But go a little
 further Tale the Ståtc of
 Flor ida a tittle State
 down on the Gulf with
 about fifty thousand white inhabitants
 almost as many as there
 arc in some counties in
 the State in which i
 live Look at Florida We
 purchased this peninsula and gave
 5 000 000 for it
 W hut for To get
 rid ofa foreign jurisdiction over
 it to get rid of
 Spain to get also possession
 of the keys and to
 protect an entrance for our
 commerce into to take away
 the Seminoles Now these fifty
 thousand people whom the good
 citizens of these United States
 under their laws have permitted
 to settle there and with
 hardly half population enough for
 a Representative to be admitted
 as one of the States
 of this Union in fuli
 fellowship Florida for whom we
 have expended so much blood
 and treasure the most favored
 petted _ weakest littlc sister
 puts on great airs now
 and assumes that by a
 mere resolution of her people
 gathering together in convention she
 can resolve herself out of
 the jurisdiction of the United
 States take all our fortresses
 upon Which as pgu t
 of our great national defenses
 we have spent hun Yes
 Mr BENJAMIN Then wish to
 ask the zens from their
 allegiance and put end to
 dt edsof thousands seize our
 own guns and turn the
 supremacy of the Constitution and
 laws of them against as
 to cniörce her doctrine of
 consti under that form of
 government a citizon can be
 the United States Several other
 conscquenecs will tutional peaceable secession
 200 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 27 How is it with
 Louisiana the State which the
 Texas this Government under free
 soil rule during the days
 of Mr Filhnore disputed the
 honorable Senator himself represents The
 Gov ernmentofthe United States upon
 wise principles I title which
 they had three times asserted
 and main of great national
 policy purchased of the First
 Consul of France the rrerritory
 of Louisiana at an expense
 of And for what To
 obtain exclusive possession of the
 great valley of the Mississippi
 and above all things to
 take the mouth of that
 river through which its commerce
 discharges itself upon the high
 seas away from the control
 of a foreign Power Does
 that Sen attor contend here
 that the people of his
 State to whom the Federal
 Government has granted its lands
 and has permitted to bc
 organized and ad mitted as
 onc of the great family
 of States in a moment
 of disaffection or excitement by
 a mere resolution ofa convention
 of her citizens can re
 solve themselves outside of this
 Union absolve themselves from their
 allegiance and bccon c to
 us a foreign Power and
 take with ber tho con
 1 tell trol of the
 mouth of the Mississippi you
 sir and I tell the
 Senator from Louisiana that if
 any such doctrinc had been
 understood when Louisiana was admitted
 into thc Union shc I
 tcll you sir would never
 have bccn admitted that with
 any such doctrinc as this
 her people would not have
 been permitted to take possession
 and to cultivate the swunps
 of Louisiana Louis iana would
 have been held as a
 r I crritory now T
 hc people of this country
 will not consent that she
 shall becomc a foreign Power
 and hold tbc mouth of
 that river which floats their
 commerce to the Gulf They
 will consent that the a
 foreityn mouth of that river
 shall pass under jurisdiction come
 what may How has it
 been Wilh the State of
 Texas The Federal Government admitted
 Texas as one t the
 States into this Union at
 tiyne when she had lilany
 debts outstanding a sparse population
 with broken credit and an
 pty treasu ry Her independcncc
 had bccn ae knowlcdgcd it
 by Enffland France and Belffium
 but she was still in
 a feeble condition We took
 hcr as onc of I
 ler annexation was the States
 into this Union followed by
 thc Mexican war by which
 Mexico undertook to subj e

 cost us forty thousand lives
 to her against Mexico it
 cost us near ahundred million
 dollars and now when we
 have nonde her a great
 State built her fortifications paid
 oil her debts when wc
 have raised her up by
 a friendly hand o the
 position shc now holds which
 will rnake her in the
 end greater than any southern
 than Georgia herself thus far
 regarded as thc empire State
 of the South is it
 possible that now in a
 moment of passion when madness
 rules the hoar the people
 of rrexns can resolve them
 selves out of the Union
 and become to us a
 forei rn Power Mr WIGFALL
 1 ask the Senator to
 make un explanation The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FOSTER in the
 Does the Senator from Wisconsin
 yield to tho Senator frotil
 r rexas Mr DOOLITTLE 1
 shall through in a very
 few moments then the Senator
 can rnake his remarks Mr
 WIGFALL rather they would go
 in your speech so that
 the public would sec them
 both together Mr DOOLITTLE 1
 do not know that 1
 shall pul lish my speech
 Mr WIGFALL The Senator is
 mistaken in supposing that Ibis
 Governmcnt paid tho debts of
 Texas He is utterly mistaken
 in supposing that they have
 ever confin red any benefit
 upon the people of that
 State by annexation By the
 terms of annexation they wore
 to defend that border and
 that people have been left
 to lcfihld them selves fron
 l the Lillie Lhat tlney
 came into this Union up
 to the present litne Ill
 tere has been u consti
 l t war with American
 Indians They have built no
 forts that they agreed to
 do T herc is a
 fort that is in the
 process of construction at Galveston
 Fl hc Secretary of War
 ordered some guns to be
 sent there the other day
 and a free soil abolition
 mob tained for which they
 went to war and swindled
 us out of thirty thousand
 square miles which now compose
 a part o Kansas and
 Nebraska This is the faith
 that this Government has kept
 with Texas and as I
 said the other day if
 we have been bought and
 paid for I trust that
 Senator will come down under
 the fugitive slave clause to
 get his pro Qrty We
 are going out Mr BOOLITTLE
 1 have to the Senator
 going out All we claim
 is that the State shall
 remain Mr WIGFALL The State
 will go out Mr DOOLITTLE
 1 shall not now go
 into a detailed statement of
 the tunount of Federal ex
 penditures paid on account of
 I exas over and abovc
 tbc war cxpcnses Ten million
 was given for her surrender
 of what she claimed in
 New Mexico But that is
 not essential to my argu
 ment As to the matter
 of publishing my speech I
 do not expect to publish
 it in pamphlet form If
 the Senator on the othc
 r side desires to publish
 his i would be very
 much obliged to him if
 he will publish mine too
 and let it go along
 with his to his constituents
 1 should Mr WIGFALL Thank
 you sir suppose that the
 facts were material to your
 arcru merit Mr DOOLITTLE A
 word Mr President in relation
 to this doctrine as applicablc
 to Cali fovnia I believe
 the bonds are still out
 which ve crave to Mexico
 upon the purchase of Califor
 Ilia by the treaty of
 peace Do you upposc that
 w I len tbc fortresses
 at San Francisco and other
 defenses of the State are
 all completed and X ve
 get ou r railroad built
 across to California that may
 cost us a hundred million
 more California by a sirnp
 e resolution of hcr inhabitants
 can with draw from tho
 U Ilion without our consent
 a take harbors and our
 fortresses and our great national
 railway into a forei rn
 jurisdiction Illow was it in
 relation to the Island of
 Cuba Two years agb all
 the Senators on the other
 side of the Chamber were
 pressing upon the Govern ment
 of the United States the
 purchase of that island for
 which they wore willing to
 pay the surn Suppose we
 had paid the rnoney taken
 possession of the islarl l
 and entered the lorig coveted
 Moro Castle mounted upon it
 our best guns and completed
 all its harbor defenses impregnable
 as Gibraltar could Ibe people
 of that island then resolve
 themselves out of the Union
 take possession of our forts
 and destroy our commerce by
 the very means we have
 bou o ht or built
 to protectand defend it Upon
 what ground did they press
 upon us the purchase of
 Cuba To conirnand tho outlet
 of the Mississippi valley and
 to control the commerce of
 tbc Gulf Such orcat national
 considerations as those were ur
 ed by gentlemen upon that
 side of the Chamber But
 what wroul l it all
 be what is our whole
 Government worth what is Alnerican
 cili zenship what is American
 greatness what is American nationality
 what does it all mean
 Is it all a farce
 and a delusion and has
 it been from the heginning
 Mr President gentlemen sometimes complain
 that the Republican party in
 its policy is disposed to
 do injustice to the citizens
 of the South and especially
 to what they call their
 social institution of slavery What
 has been the history of
 this Government Since the adoption
 of the present Constitution we
 have acquired Florida Louis iana
 Texas and the Territories froin
 Mexico We surrendered a part
 of Maine We have riven
 up our claim to a
 large portion of Oregon The
 E same party and canvass
 which brought Texas i gave
 up 5110 40 and came
 down 10 490 giving up
 on the north Vancouver island
 and ilånost six as the
 kingdom of France MT e
 havo surrendered to your social
 institution in Texas alone more
 than your fuli share of
 all the territories acquired from
 Mexico when you compare the
 number of those persons who
 are employed under your sys
 tem of labor x vith
 the free white laboring popula
 tion of all the United
 States When you speak of
 injustice it is imaginary not
 real You have had your
 full share and more than
 your share of all the
 Territories that we have acquired
 from the beginning to this
 hour since the adoption of
 the present Constitution Most of
 you say that New Mexico
 is entirely unfitted for slave
 labor Why then make this
 struggle The repeal of the
 Missouri compro nusc and thc
 struggle t o wrest that
 Territory from free labor and
 to force slavery upon it
 to which it is not
 adapted has brought upon us
 all this agitation and trouble
 Why attempt to do the
 samc in New Mexico Mr
 President I am tired of
 hearing gentlemen complain of the
 injustice done to this institution
 by our territorial There is
 no founda tion for it
 in our history none whatever
 it seems to me In
 proportion to the number of
 persons held in your system
 of labor you have had
 alto in comparison gether Inore
 than your full share with
 the free white laborincy population
 of the United States and
 you now claim further not
 only rnorc than your share
 upon a fair division bat
 you claim what the Constitution
 of the United Statcs does
 not give at all the
 rigl lt to go into
 these territories acquired from Mexico
 and to cu rry your
 slaves there in violation ofthe
 Mexican It has been my
 purpose to lav acrainst it
 that the Constitution of the
 United States even under thc
 Dred Scott decision does no
 such thing that there is
 nothing in that decision to
 show that the lavv of
 Mexico existing when we acquired
 the territory is not still
 tho law of that terrif
 m y that there is
 nothing in that decision which
 afiirxns that the Constitution of
 the United States repeals or
 abrogates it and when the
 slaveholder claims the right to
 take his slaves therc under
 the Con stitution hc claims
 aright which the Constitu lion
 does not give There is
 therefore no founda tion for
 this char re which we
 so often hear that we
 t leny the equality of
 the States or the equality
 of their citizens in those
 Territories What do deny to
 you that we do not
 _lonv ourselves inele right in
 New IN lexico have vv
 e that you have not
 got there also You say
 that this doctriné excludes your
 social institution it excludes our
 banking institutions it excludes our
 manufacturincr corporations Your socitll plantation
 system is but a kind
 of close corpora lion existing
 under the laws of your
 Slates per milted or established
 hy the local law We
 deny you no right which
 we do not den v
 ourselves We give you every
 right and every privileo e
 which we ivo ourselves Mr
 GREEN Will the Senator to
 rive a little illustration Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 say to the
 Senatoi from Missouri that I
 am very nearly through al
 will hear the the remarks
 I intended to make Senator
 after I have done Mr
 President the Senator from Oregon
 Mr LANE seemed to complain
 on this subjcct with great
 ft eling that the Republican
 party were de n Ying
 the equality of the States
 in the Territories of the
 Union purchased with common blood
 and common treasure Now sir
 I stand hore to say
 that if the Constitution of
 the United States gives to
 the slaveholder the right to
 carry slaves as property into
 the Territory it follows of
 neces sity that he has
 a right to have his
 property pro I wili not
 admit a right and at
 the E tected there sanoe
 time deny the rezuedy will
 not admit that he has
 a constitutional to take and
 hold his slaves there and
 at the san ie tirne
 say that degrees of latitude
 W c purchased the Louisiana
 t tbcy may be law
 full v taken from him
 That Territory and nearly two
 thirds of all the good
 a thing may be lawfuily
 driven from a place when
 lands in that I erritory
 have been riven n p
 to the it has a
 lawful rio ht to stay
 I could never recon cilc
 in logic or in morals
 But I deny tho right
 I social institution of the
 South l hc annexation altoeether
 in the Mexican territories undcr
 the of Texas the war
 with Mexico and the acqui
 in Pittsburg interposed and committed
 an act of sition of
 those territories from Mexico including

 the Dred Scott case I
 hcre is no such right
 established bv it treason by
 levyincr war against the Unh

 regarded as but one transaction
 or they all followed close
 upon each other Now I
 He complained of what I
 had announced in nothing is
 said about Ihat They have
 letter to Milwaukee tl at
 the free territories ac in
 all fairness and candor p
 ud the debts of Texas
 but after having by i
 I ask you gentlemen to
 say of all those Territories
 that we acquired quired or
 to be acquired from B
 exico or Great treat v
 stipulation by the action of
 the legislative of this Government
 by the ucti01 1 of

 by surrenderino up the I
 l ritain should remain free
 Well sir I main whole
 of Texas to your social
 institut ion we tain that
 such is the law of
 the acquisition of ter the
 executive departmcnt of this Government
 recoo nized the Rio G
 rande as the boundary of
 have not surrendered up to
 you an empirc as big
 ritory undcr the Constitution and
 that is but just 1860
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE When we
 acquire free territory it is
 asking too much of us
 to convert it into slave
 territory It is impossible I
 say that we can have
 peace on the slavery question
 on any such constitutional doctrine
 as that You must consent
 to allow free Territories to
 remain free We stand pledged
 not to interrere directly or
 indirectly with your insti tutions
 in the States where they
 exist Upon these grounds we
 can have peace permanent perpetual
 peace Sir that is peace
 and I repeat what I
 declared the other day that
 non interfer ence by the
 General Government or by free
 State men acainst slavery in
 the States and non inter
 ference by the Generul Government
 or by slave holders against
 freedom in the Territories is
 pcacc Mr BENJAMIN Ido not
 desire to address the Senate
 now on this question because
 I under stand that we
 shall havc it soon before
 us requir ing practical decision
 W c shall have the
 direct and positive issue placed
 before us in the course
 ofa day or two it
 is known to the Senate
 and to the country at
 large that onc of the
 States of this Union has
 withdrawn from the Union and
 declared her independence and although
 that fact has not yet
 been ofhcially communicated to us
 it is also known to
 the public that the State
 of South Carolina as an
 independent nation has sent Government
 and known by it only
 when it wants tribute Whenever
 you choose to tax you
 tax our southern labor sometimes
 we think more exccssively than
 we tax your own but
 certainly you claim _to be
 taxed equally You tax our
 prop erty Bearing all the
 burdens of the GoVét nment
 we feel your power but
 when the obligation be comes
 reciprocal and we demand protection
 then you say no you
 own a kind of property
 which we outla v which
 this Federal Government this central
 Government the agent of all
 the States will never reco
 ynize Such sir was the
 temper of the speech which
 we heard this morning I
 have no hope mo expectation
 of changing the judgment of
 Senators on the other side
 and very little hope of
 ever reaching their constituents but
 there are some stubborn facts
 in histOry which it were
 well enough their constituents should
 come to learn After a
 seven years war which resulted
 in the recognition of our
 independence by the mother country
 a treaty was entered into
 The seventh section of that
 tycaty l mean the treaty
 of independence isin the following
 words I will ask my
 friend to read it for
 me as I cannot see
 very well in this light
 Mr GREEN fead as follows
 All prisoners on both ART
 7 sides shall be set
 at liberty and his Britannic
 Majesty diplomatic messengers to us
 for the purpose Of I
 shall with all convenient speed
 and without causing any destruction
 or carrying away any negroes
 or other prop treating with
 this Govefnmcnt and as that
 ques tion must necessarily be
 presented before us on Monday
 when we meet again and
 as the issue will be
 plainly and distinctly brought before
 us whether we will recognize
 that independence or intend to
 war against the State I
 desire to speak to that
 direct issue when it comes
 up on Monday Mr FESSENDEN
 Move an adjournment Mr BENJAMIN
 I will inove an adjourn
 ment Mr GREEN Not yet
 let us pass this bill
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Is the
 motion to adjourn withdrawn Mr
 BENJAMIN 1 merely desired to
 take the floor for Monday
 Mr BROWN I have no
 disposition to inter fere vich
 the Senator in his speech
 he PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator
 fr m Mississippi is entitled
 to the floor if he
 aims it now Mr BROWN
 Mr President it seems to
 me that northern Senators most
 pertinaciously over look the main
 point at issue betwpeen thc
 two sec tions of our
 Confederacy We claim that there
 is property in slaves and
 they deny it Until we
 shall settle upon some basis
 that point of con troversy
 it is idle to talk
 of going any further The
 southern people have locked up
 in this kind of property
 I do not mean to
 say that their slaves are
 worth so much l ut
 their real property their stock
 their household goods and all
 that belongs to them are
 dependeni upon the security of
 that kind of property During
 the first forty years of
 our national ex istence I
 undertake to affrm that no
 man North pretended to deny
 the great fact that or
 South there was such a
 thing as property in slaves
 About 1818 1819 1820 this
 doctrine of refusing to recognize
 the right of property in
 slaves sprai lg up It
 has continued to intensify from
 that day to this until
 we find ourselves in our
 present con dition Now I
 ask Senators on the other
 side if looking at this
 thing calmly tbcy can for
 an instant suppose that under
 any possible con ceivable state
 of the case we can
 voluntarily con sent to live
 under a Government passing into
 the hands of a power
 on the 4th of March
 which openly and undisguisedly tells
 us that all this vast
 interest is to be outlawed
 under the common Gov crnment
 that the 4 000 000
 000 invested in this propertv
 the accumulation of centuries of
 hard labor muscular and physical
 labor is oincr to be
 volan tarily abandoned a bandoned
 mean so far as the
 action of this Federal Government
 is concerned and that we
 the inhabitants of fifteen States
 of this Union will consent
 to live under a Governinent
 outlawed by its authority That
 is the stern proposition which
 you submit to us l
 hat is the proposition which
 xvc as sternly re ject
 Can we eve n consent
 to remain in a Gov
 ernmcut and know on v
 through its taxino pourer Do
 rational rnen of the North
 suppose that nine million southern
 people can ever con sent
 to live in a Government
 outlawed by the erty of
 the American all his artnies
 garrisons and fleets frorn the
 said United States and froin
 every port place and harbor
 within the same Done at

 OSWALD L s JOHN ADAMS
 B FRANKLIN JOHN JAY HENRY
 LAURENS L Mr BROWN 1
 desire to call the attention
 not of northern Senators because
 they are fa miliar with
 it but of the northern
 people to the fact that
 the very treaty which made
 us an inde pendentpeople Signed
 by John Adams Benjamin Franklin
 and John Jay spoke of
 negroes and other property thus
 in the very beginning of
 our existence as a nation
 recognizing the factfor which we
 contend to day that there
 was such a If gentlemen
 are thing as property in
 negroes ready to go back
 and live by the treaty
 which made us onc people
 which made us an independ
 ent people we shall again
 have laid the founda If
 John Adams tion for a
 permanent peace Benjamin Franklin and
 John Jay could recognize property
 in slaves why cannot the
 Senators on the other side
 do the same thing now
 Ithis was not an acknowledgment
 extorted from Great Britain but
 a voluntary admission on It
 was not even a demand
 upon the her part part
 of the American commissioners who
 signed thc treaty of independence
 but it was a univer
 sally recoonized fact at that
 day under which the Government
 lived for forty years never
 dis putcd up to 1820
 then first denied and to
 day more pertinaciously denied than
 at any former period of
 our history in the procress
 of events we had well
 sir I will ask my
 another war with Great Britain
 friend to read the first
 article of Ibis treaty I
 mean the treaty of Ghent
 Mr GREEN read as follows
 Shall be restored with ART

 to call attention Ato three

 that volume In 1698 Massachusetts
 passed A law forbidding to
 trade or truck with any
 Indian molato or negro servantor

 lute lewd and disorderly person
 of whom there _is just
 cauSe of suspicion and such
 persons to be punished by
 whipping for so _trading I
 will now read from a
 note on page 264 Between
 the years 1767 and 1773
 several unsuccessful attempts were made
 to procure legislative acts againkbtbe
 slave trade an Which is
 given by Dia Belknap in
 his letter to Jude Tucker

 Hazard 1 6 Among the
 articles of aareement the cighth
 is as follows Without reading
 it all I W ill
 read the extraet to which
 I wish to call attention
 This recal lect sir Mr
 FOSTER in the chair is
 a confed eracy in your
 own country It is also
 agreed that if any servant
 run away his master into
 any of these confederate jurisdictions
 that in such casc upon
 certificate of one rnagistratc in
 the juris diction out of
 which the said servant fled
 or upon other due proof
 the said servant shall be
 delivered either to his master
 or any other that pursues
 and brings such certificate or
 proof I could go on
 from this volume and multiply
 I read these extracts Mr
 Presl other proofs dent and
 I have marked a great
 number in this volume to
 show that Massachusetts and all
 New England recognized the right
 of property in man that
 you confederated for the purpose
 of having them rendered up
 when they escaped and that
 too upon the certificate of
 a single magistrate Are you
 wiser and better and purer
 than your an ccstors These
 were the descendants of tho
 Pil grim Fathers Thcy seemed
 to recognize the law of
 meunu and tuu m They
 seemed to recognize the great
 füct that property stolen should
 be given back and that
 there being property in slaves
 if it escaped it should
 be returned All we ask
 of you is to live
 up to the faith of
 the Pilgrim Fathers to do
 what your ancestors did to
 do what tbc sia ners
 of the treaty of independencc
 did to do what the
 elder Adams John Jay and
 others did when they signed
 thc first treaty of inde
 pendcnce to do what John
 Quincy Adams and Henry Clay
 did when they signed the
 second tteaty of Indepel dcnce
 to admit in other words
 that all the wisdom of
 the world is not conccn
 tratcd in New England now
 as you seem to imagine
 but that the men who
 went beföre us knew something
 Do that and you will
 lay the foundation of a
 permanent and lastincy settle ment
 If you stand by the
 doctrine that to be outlawed
 in Our own country that
 over foue I billion of
 property is not to be
 recognized as prop that this
 Govörnmcnt is to bc kpown
 erty at all to us
 only through the taxing power
 and hat we are never
 to it by its protective
 then sir there is but
 one of two alterna power

 separate iu peace or who
 had the control of the
 Government at home I separate

 that this Federal Government should

 Can you ex represcnting a

 no Governmcnt You say you
 do not rccognize the right

 cvcn here in this legiskativc

 You coolly tell us that
 slavery is not property and
 tl lat there is no
 law to protect it that
 the Federal Government does Plot
 recosnize it pro at ail

 any power on earth can

 kind of legislation it is
 tainly I will not weary
 the Senate with hav ing

 it to the reporter s
 desk and have it copied
 in the Congressional Globe Several
 SENATORS No objection to that
 Mr BROVVN It is pagc
 64 chapter twenty I SIX
 Mr CLARK Read it Mr
 BROWN I mean of course
 that the whole statute of
 New Mexico on the subject
 of slavery is to be
 copied into the official report
 so that the country may
 understand precisely what it is
 and what sort of laws
 I am proposing to ex
 tend over the Territory of
 Arizuma It is under stood
 I think that the whole
 statute need not be read
 but may bc copied in
 the report Mr COLLAMER Let
 us hear it if it
 is not long Mr SEWARD
 Let us hear it and
 see what it is Mr
 BROWN Then the Secretary can
 read the first chapter I
 suppose that will be suflicient

 slave whether such interest be
 loual or equitable present or
 future joint or several vested
 or con tinrrent Mr BROWN
 Senators do not desire to
 I accomplish all the purpose
 I that law read have
 in view as I said
 before in having it printed
 You hear thc Character of
 it I am perfectly will
 ing however to have it
 all read if Senators wish
 it The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 further reading will be dispensed
 with unless sorne Sen ator
 asks that it be read
 Mr BINGHAM Let it be
 printed Mr CLARK I desire
 to have it read unless
 it goes into the report
 so that we can see
 it Mr GREEN will Mr
 CLARK Let it go into
 the report so that we
 can see it and then
 the reading n ay be
 dis pensed with Mr GREEN
 Mr President 1 up this
 bill it was for the
 purpose of having it I
 It was not with a
 view of exciting any I
 passed discussion whatever or of
 introducing any of I these
 excitino topics that divide one
 section from I really think
 that thc people of Ari
 the other zuma for I
 havc accepted that fronl my
 I friend from xMississippL ought
 to oruanized and at the
 same time that this bill
 passes wc should provide also
 for the o uranizatlon of
 Jef fin son I en
 itory or Pike s Peak
 I like to postpone t
 hese political questions that excite
 cannot prevail upon my friend
 from Mississippi He proposes to
 introduce a proposition here I
 think and I only guess
 at it for the purpose
 of testing the sincerity and
 loyalty of members to the
 principles of the Federal Constitution
 In its practical effect f
 do not think it amounts
 to any thing If f
 am forced to vote I
 shall vote for it The
 same Senator introduced at the
 last ses sion a bill
 which was before the committee
 of which I am a
 member proposing to protect slaves
 in the Territories I reported
 it back and asked to
 be dischar ed from its
 further consideration I neither re
 and it is now upon
 the Calendar ported adversely nor
 favorably and the motives that
 influenced me then were these
 I saw no pres ent
 necessity for it and my
 uniform rule of action has
 been never to irritate the
 passions or intro duce a
 question which would be likely
 to divide our friends unless
 there is a necessity for
 it knew the bill could
 not pass the House of
 Rep resentativcs It was an
 undetermined question m the Senate
 whether it would recognize the
 1 rin ciple The principle
 was involved and embraced in
 the resolut ions of the
 Senator from Mississippi Mr DAVIS
 They were pending before the
 Sen I did not wish
 to precipitate action I wished
 first to see whether the
 principle would be sustained and
 that principle WRS not sustained
 and not voted for until
 near the close of the
 ses sion Then a majority
 of this Senate did sustain
 the principle The House has
 never yet sustained it nor
 do believe the House wili
 sustain it and from all
 the evidence we have before
 us it will not sustain
 this provision yet I shall
 vote for it now though
 under other circumstances when I
 expected practical legislation and expected
 acon tinuance of the Government
 I would advise my friend
 to withdraw it Under the
 circumstances however that sur round
 me now when a dark
 deep gloom that I cannot
 penetrate hangs all around will
 vote the truth whether it
 results in good or not
 Hence I shall vote it
 now but lherc is no
 real neces sit y for
 it except as a declaration
 of principle I he bill
 as it is now upon
 your lesk with the tunendrnents
 which I proposed this morning
 cives protection to all constitutional
 property I want no more
 What is constitutional property It
 is for the courts to
 decide and witl be perfVH2
 tly I have not only
 said that the content with
 that courts should have chancery
 and common law jurisdiction but
 I have added the words
 on n y own motion
 and authority to redress all
 wronøs committed against the Constitution
 of the United States or
 the laws of the United
 States or the laws of
 thc Territory affecting persons or
 prop What is property My
 friend from Missis sippi has
 madc an able aroument to
 provo that slaves are property
 That argument would be good
 in tho Supremo Court orin
 the district court or any
 other appropriate tribunal but in
 this Sen ate I do
 not deem it necessary to
 go into any such atffumerit
 What is property It is
 a judicial ques It is
 determined and settled Gy the
 Consti t ution of the
 United States by the treaties
 of the United States by
 the laws of the United
 States for it n y
 friend bad taken the trouble
 to exan ine it he
 would find laws of t
 l e United States to

 there is nö such thing
 as the right of prop
 erty in slaves unless you
 express ib to him in
 such palpablc language as I
 proposed this morning MI GREEN
 I thought L was aiding
 coöp eratinry and assisting the
 Senator in the reference that
 I made 1 thought I
 vas strengthening the I argument
 he had presented to the
 Senate thought I was making
 a reference which he had
 overlooked so as to confirm
 the assertion that hö had
 made but it turns out
 that he construes it differently
 I now say this sir
 an express declaration if he
 be correct as to tho
 sentiment and the controlling principle
 that will operate with the
 dominant party as he calls
 it being put into the
 law they will say it
 is null and void be
 cause it is against the
 law of God and man
 and will bc a perfect
 nullity If that p_revailing senti
 ment is to continue let
 us distinctly understand If it
 is to be open to
 this extremity we had it
 better as brethren at once
 cease controversy adjourn the Scnate
 and House of Representatives dissolve
 this Government and go home
 I say therefore it is
 idle to talk about this
 question so far as that
 is concerned But if we
 are trying to operate upon
 the public sentiment and to
 appeal to the honest hearts
 of men and to induce
 them to reflect to remember
 what their fathers have done
 what their Consti tution provides
 what the law stipulates what
 honorable good feeling would dictate
 if these be the motives
 that actuate us there is
 yet a last lingering perhaps
 forlorn hope left But if
 it be a determination or
 an existing resolution to push
 this doctrine to the extreme
 we had better term inate
 our session on the 1st
 day of January and go
 home I should prefer it
 and then let the States
 act Let the people of
 the States assemblc in convention
 and see x vhat is
 to be done in this
 emergency I am sorry however
 when I trying to put
 through a business matter for
 the bencfit of a distant
 people separated so far from
 New Mexico and Santa Fé
 that they cannot bc protected
 that this question has been
 forced upon us and have
 only digressed so far because
 I have been driven to
 it by the course of
 the argu ment prescotcd to
 day The Senator from Wisconsin
 indulged very lm gely in
 presenting the views of what
 he calls the Republican party
 and said that their policy
 was to do perféctju stice
 to the South and to
 give them equal privileges with
 themselves and that they would
 not deprive the South of
 anything but w hat they
 deprived themselves of That desire
 to looks very fair in
 its presentation illustrate his mode
 if he will allow me
 It re minds me of
 the fable written I think
 by Æsop The fox invited
 the stork to dine with
 him The stork has a
 very long bill The fox
 had nothing but soup and
 it was spread out on
 a flat dish r Perfect
 equality Mr Stork help Said
 the fox yourself T hc
 stork could not get a
 mouthful and the fox lapped
 it all up The next
 day the stork said Coxne
 over Mr Fox and dine
 with r ithc stork had
 had mince The fox went
 me meat put in long
 necked jars and said he
 Mr Fox perfect equality do
 not want to dcprive you
 ot anything but what I
 deprive myself of i help
 yourself S The fox could
 not get a single mouthful
 and the stork put in
 his long bill and ate
 it all up And so
 it is with the principles
 the Senator seeks to establish
 and spread over the Territory
 He does not want to
 deprive us ot anything but
 what he would deprive himself
 of he establishes a rule
 which he knows no southern
 man will submit to and
 which will excludc every southern
 man My friend the Senator
 frorn Vermont Mr COLLAMER said
 Our object in it is
 to surround you to cramp
 in slavery to put a
 cordon of free States around
 it so that vou will
 be forced to emancipate your
 slaves The object of the
 frce soil movement and the
 only motive that actuates you
 in advocating it to day
 is that you may force
 us to emancipate the slaves
 And how Either to make
 them unprofitable or dangerous one
 or the other of which
 you think willinducc us to
 liberate them and turn them
 loose Now Mr Peesident this
 is not right as breth
 rcn of Confederaey We were
 known slaveholding States All but
 one held slaves draw no
 distinction between them I will
 accord as much bravery as
 much patriotism to the one
 side as the other When
 it is thus acquired ought
 any rule to be established
 which Would be like the
 invitation of the fox to
 the stork to dine with
 him to say to us
 it is perfect equality But
 you know the peculiar circümstances
 undei which we are placed
 and you are trying to
 establish a rule which under
 the circumstances would cx clude
 us from the whole of
 the territory Mr President if
 truth is to prevail an
 immu table history which we
 cannot change or re verse
 will record the fact that
 the South has never asked
 anything of the North that
 infringed upon them It will
 record the fact that they
 never asked for anything that
 would endanger them or that
 had the least tendency to
 irritate them and if the
 Union is to go by
 the board if necessity drives
 us to the vercre and
 we must dissolve when the
 festie of history is made
 up whose fault will it
 be Not his who defends
 not his who re sists
 not his who importunes but
 the fault will be his
 who exacts who progresses and
 who brings to bear what
 he calls an irrepressible conflict
 the tendency of which is
 to involve us in war
 disguise it as you may
 Sir there are good people
 in both sections of this
 Union but there are people
 so indoctrinated and so preju
 diced thouoh they may have
 honest hearts edu cated from
 the school room with school
 tracts and Sunday school instructors
 advising them that tho slaveholder
 is a knave and a
 scoundrel and that slaver v
 is a curse all of
 which has spread over the
 Nolth and the storm you
 have stirred If it up
 you are not able to
 control yourselves cannot be controlled
 if it cannot be corrected
 then the doom must and
 will be pronounced We need
 not disguise the truth We
 ought not to avoid looking
 facts plainly and stubbornly in
 the face not by hreatening
 not by trying to intim
 idate not by seeking to
 get a political or personal
 advantage over each other When
 a great nation is at
 stake and the salvation of
 a great people is dependent
 upon our action you ought
 to let par ties die
 and personal aspirations perish rather
 than endanger the salvation of
 the people What then shall
 we do Are we to
 go for ward as we
 have during the short time
 that we have been in
 session Are we to continue
 to wrangle Had we not
 better at once see whether
 we can accomplish anything and
 if we cannot give it
 up and Ict the States
 and the people of the
 States take it in hand
 I have one last hope
 My only hope in the
 beginning was as I then
 stated simply to intcrposc obstacles
 to action long enough to
 let the people stop and
 reflect and when they have
 had that fair and honorable
 opportunity to reflect if the
 reaction does not come then
 our I hope we shall
 have no civil I doorn
 is settled war although I
 have already heard th at
 the flames I have already
 heard of have becn lighted
 up the nullification of an
 act of the Federal Govern
 ment in Pittsburg I deny
 and emphatically deny the right
 of any people within the
 Union to nullify the law
 of Congress or an order
 issued in pursuance of that
 law I contend for the
 right of a State to
 secede T hc pretext or
 the justification or the reason
 for her secession is a
 matter for herself to judge
 not for me The Senator
 frona Wisconsin is a little
 at fault when he says
 to contend for the right
 of may involve us in

 Mr President I hdve been
 Iéd off ihtd these remarks
 in consequence of r the
 remarks of others I come
 back to the real proposition
 bel fore the Senate and
 that is the amendment pro
 posed by th6 Senator from
 Mississippi The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 before the Senate is on
 the amendment to the amendment
 Mr GREEN Oh yes I
 remembei now that the Senator
 froni Illinois I thinkit wats
 proposed an amendment The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question is on
 the amendment proposed by the
 Senator from Illinois to the
 amendment of the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr GREEN That is
 just the reverse Of the
 proposition of the Senator from
 Mississippi The Senator from Mississippi
 proposes to give a law
 to tho Territory of Arizuma
 which will enable any man
 ownino a slave to cret
 redress if any other person
 interferes with his property I
 understand the Senator from Illinois
 to proposc that the law
 of Mexico as it existed
 wfien we acquired it shall
 be the law of Arizuma
 that itshali never be changed
 while it is a Territory
 That is my recol lection
 of his amendment Sir I
 have a great objection to
 that and I will state
 it in a few W
 heh Mekico ceded all this
 territory to uS by the
 Gadsden treaty Eno slavery existed
 there except the peonqgc brit
 the very moment it becamb
 ceded to us and became
 part of the United States
 it was under the Con
 stitution of the United States
 There is no such thing
 as a constitutional Government acquiring
 property and yet that prop_erty
 not be subject to the
 Constitution and It is a
 contradiction to say so If
 wc havc the power to
 acquire it is by virtue
 of our oræanization under the
 Constitution and the moment you
 acquire it it is subjcct
 to that Constitution But thc
 Senator from Wisconsin says if
 the Constitution gives you the
 right to hold slavery there
 when you do acquire it
 it gives you the right
 to hold slavery in Wisconsin
 I have heard that argument
 repeated often enough Its faHacy
 is so palpable that I
 think it must strike the
 mind of every man who
 will reason upon the subject
 Every State according to our
 Constitution is a sovereign Statc
 with sovereign power over the
 subject of slavery with an
 express reco nition of the
 right of each State to
 prohibit slavery if it I
 say the Federal Constitution itself
 chooses expressly recognizes the right
 of each Stato to prohibit
 slavery if it chooses butthe
 Constitution does not recognize tire
 right of a Territorytö PPO
 hibit slavery On the contrary
 a Territory is not known
 to the Congtitution Mr FESSENDEN
 Will Senator be kind enough
 to turn to that clause
 of tho Constitution Sion results
 from the fact that they
 are in by con sent
 and can go out by
 consent Expulsion would be against
 consent and is just the
 opposite of thc principle of
 secession But I do not
 intend to debate this question
 Whether we have a constitutional
 right reserved or an original
 right reserved is an unimportant
 question now The practical effect
 is this the State will
 do it if it pleases
 and then what will you
 do How are you going
 to help yourself Make war
 No Why W hothor you
 have a right to make
 war or not is not
 tho point The imprudence of
 the British commander at Lexing
 ton I think it was
 brought on the Revolution An
 attack made on a few
 soldiers there and a few
 countrymen who gathered tore hen
 to heip them have brought
 on the Revolution been a
 peaceful and hog iorable adjusunentand
 sep secession admits the right
 of expulsion Seces ii he
 retörs to I will refer
 Mr GREEN Yes sir 1
 will and why should we
 be excluded from the com
 aration from the Crown af
 Great Britain but for the
 inlprudeucc of that offcer The
 imprudence mon territory bought with
 a common treasure defendcd by
 the Army and as many
 of our existing offcers of
 our commanders or of our
 functionaries directing or cncouraTing them
 brave men from the one
 section as the other the
 Senator from Maine to that
 clause of the Constitution No
 person held to service or
 labor in one State under
 the laws thereof escaping into
 enothcr skall in conse quoncc
 of any law or regulation
 therein be discharged claim of
 the party to whom such
 service or labor nay he
 due Which implies that thcy
 have a right to make
 a rule or regulation therein
 which will bc adverse to
 slavery Mr FESSENDEN All wanted
 to know was where the
 express recoenition was That thero
 is an implied onc I
 never disputed Mr GREEN disputed
 Mr FESSENDE A State may
 do as it pleases with
 refirence to that matter It
 says in express Mr GREEN
 very we l words that
 they shall not be discharged
 from such service or labor
 by reason of any rcguln
 tion therein Mr FESSENDEN Thut
 is not in express 204
 words that they shall do
 as they please with reference
 to slavery I sec no
 express words Mr GREEN If
 the Senator thinks they have
 not that power I would
 like for him to reverse
 the procecdings of Maine and
 make slavery legal there Mr
 FESSENDEN Mr President if the
 Senator will allow me I
 do not dispute the power
 I only inquired of the
 Senator where the express clause
 of the Constitution was I
 have not found If he
 will have the kindness now
 to show it i will
 be much obliged to him
 Mr GREEN It is an
 express recognition of the power
 It is in express words
 It is a rec agnation
 and if that is not
 an express recogni tion v
 rhat do you make out
 of it Mr FESSENDEN Expressly
 recognizes what Mr GREEN The
 State to prohibit slavery if
 they choose Mr FESSENDEN No
 such thing Mr GREEN Besides
 all that I care not
 about quibbling on terms and
 does ex prcssly recogmze the
 retention of this power by
 the States Again the States
 nevcr surrendered it and this
 clause expressly recomnizes thc fact
 chat they do retain it
 and they exercise it Mr
 FESSENDEN Retain all power not
 granted Mr GREEN Again The
 migration or importation ot such
 persons as any of the
 States now existing shall think
 proper to admit shall not
 be prohibited by tbe Congress
 prior to the year 180B
 hut a tax or duty
 nuay he imposed on euell
 irnportation not exceedinrr ten dollars
 for each person fl here
 is no doubt of this
 fact that these States have
 the l ower to prohibit
 slavery They never parted witli
 the power and the Constitution
 rec otrnizes the fact that
 they may prohibit it Very
 well some of then do
 prohibit it In what char
 acter or capacity do thev
 tl rus prohil it it
 As sovereign States in thc
 Union In thus prohibit ing
 slavery they do not conflict
 with the Consti tution of
 the United States but in
 a Territory acquired by the
 Federal Government this is a
 general jurisdiction that jurisdiction to
 which the Senator from Wisconsin
 referred when hc said wo
 are under two complete jurisdictions
 Yes we are M hen
 you are under your Wis
 consin jurisdiction you may prohibit
 slavery under this general jurisdiction
 predicated upon slavery a part
 of which it is and
 without which It is no
 government without it l hen
 it is not i say
 going into the common territory
 bclong ing to the common
 general jurisdiction every man has
 an equal right to go
 and hold his prop crty
 When go from the State
 of Virginia and thc Senator
 from myVisconsin goes from his
 State into this now Territory
 of Pike s Peak I
 leuvc my Stat_e jurisdiction of
 Virginia and he leaves his

 wc corne then into Pike

 comc into a hostile trovernmcnt
 but we aro in this

 not prohibit slavery It is
 predicated upon slavery It does
 expressly rec ognize slavery and
 I can hold slaves and
 he can hold Yankee clocks
 if he has any I
 hese l rinciplcs are so
 clear so plain so pal
 pable and so striking t
 hat I am surprised that
 the Senator did not sec
 them If we acquire Can
 ada and it comes in
 as a Statc it comes
 in with present status save
 and except so far as
 it conflicts with the Constitution
 of the United If we
 acquire a I erritogy it
 comes in Stales subject to
 the Constitution of the United
 States ihcre being no conflicting
 jurisdiction authorized to cxcrcisc power
 that can destroy any existin
 y constitutional riffht rl hcse
 are my views and I
 only throw them out for
 the purpose of trying to
 have this subject undcrstood and
 to see whether we can
 come to Ihat point at
 which we may possibly agree
 Ive cannot possibly agree let
 the whole sub_ject I would
 be glad to have this
 amendment I pass withdrawn because
 I am anxious to get
 the Ter ritory ora anized
 without rningling with it these
 political questions I should like
 to have the peo plc
 there thrown into an organic

 Mr DOOLITTLE Mr President the
 sen ator from Missouri assumes
 as a proposition which ought
 not to be doubted that
 thc Consti tution of the
 United States enters the territory
 acquired from Mexico repeals the
 Mexican law abolishing slavery and
 establishes a law in its
 In addition to what I
 have already said favor desire
 now to say that this
 proposition is in direct contravention
 of the decision of the
 Su preme Court of the
 United States in the Prigg
 case in which they held
 expressly that the state of
 slavery is deemed to be
 a mere municipal reg ulation
 founded upon and limited to
 the range It is in
 violation of the of the
 territorial laws decisions of the
 supreme court of every State
 both north and south previous
 to 1848 When John C
 Calhoun on this floor first
 announced the doctrine that the
 Constitution of the United States
 by its own positive force
 guarantied tho right to take
 and hold slaves as property
 in the Territories of the
 United States it did not
 have halfa dozen supporters I
 believe rn either House of
 Congress Mr Clay Mr Webster
 Mr ton and the great
 men in this body denounced
 it as a hcrcsy It
 was so much against the
 estab lishcd doctrine of this
 country and of every court
 not only of the frec
 States but of the slavc
 holding States as well as
 of the Saprerne Court of
 the United States that it
 found support no where There
 was then no n ore
 respectable sup port to this
 new doctrine of John C
 Calhoun that the Constitution of
 the United States established the
 right to take slaves as
 property into a Terri tory
 than there is now to
 the doctrine of Lysander Spooner
 that the Constitution of the
 United States abolishes slavery iu
 every State within its jurisdic
 lion Mr MASON Will the
 Senator allow me a Inoment
 Mr DOOLITTLE Yes sir IVIt
 MASON I merely wish to
 say this Mr I Culboun
 lives no longer and there
 is no repre sentative of
 his State upon this floor
 I do not mean to
 interrupt the Senator further than
 to say that I never
 understood him nor did I
 ever uu derstand any jurist
 in the land ill rivino
 a con sidercd view of
 this question as declaring that
 the Constitution of the United
 States established sla very anywhere
 but I understood that great
 man and those who concurred
 with him in opinion to
 say this that a slave
 is property and nothing but
 property and that the Constitution
 of thc United States would
 protect that property in the
 Terri tories or upon the
 high seas as it would
 protect any other property It
 establishes nothing it recognizes property
 because it is property That
 I understand to be Mr
 s view Air DOOLITTLE And
 1 stand thc honorable Senator
 to draw this corol lary
 that the Mexican laws abolishing
 slavery in the Territories th
 instant acquired them werc abolished
 or abrogated sorne vay force
 of the Constitution and that
 a slavehoider from Virginia has
 a right t o enter
 into those Ter ritorics where
 slavery has been abolished and
 in spite of thesc laws
 to hold his slave as
 prop erty by virtue of
 the Constitution I hat I
 un derstaud to your conclusion
 Mr MASON The has no
 right to involve in any
 of his legal conclu sujns
 Mr DOOLITTLE It is the
 very point we are discussing
 Mr MASON It is purely
 legal I only want to
 contradict not offensively but to
 contradict any notion that Mr
 Calhoun or any other states
 man or jurist ever has
 in a considered opinion said
 that the Constitution established slavcry
 Mr DOOLITTLE Do 1 understand
 the orable Senator from Virginia
 then to maintain that the
 Constitution of the United States
 when we acquire territory where
 slavery has been already abolished
 repeals or abrogates the law
 abolish ing it Mr MASON
 I soy again sir the
 Senator shall not involve me
 in any of his legal
 conclu I understand it to
 be a part of the
 public sions law of the
 civilized world that when you
 acquire dominion the laws of
 that domain remain in operation
 until the new Power abrogates
 or estab Is not that
 public law lishes it Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 to that Mr
 MASON That 1 understand to
 be the public law I
 may bc wrong in it
 Now what legal conclusions may
 follow in the peculiar con
 struction of our Government with
 fundamental law or how it
 operates upon existing laws in
 a Territory newly acquired I
 arn not going to dis
 cuss with the Senator at
 all and therefore I pro
 test again that he shall
 not commit me to his
 legal conclusion as to the
 legal effect of the Constitu
 tion in the Territories I
 rnean to say this alone
 that the Constitution recognizes a
 slave as prop erty We
 say not that the Constit
 ution estab lishes slavery anywhere
 but that there is the
 same obligation upon those who
 administer the Constitution to protect
 the property in a slave
 as property as in anything
 else wherever the Con stitution
 is adlilinistered That is what
 we claiin Mr DOOLITTLE Mr
 President 1 do not dcsirc
 to be taken from the
 precisc point for in that
 is the whole point of
 controversy involved The law of
 Mexico abolished slavery in t_hese
 Territories before we acquired them
 Now when you r slaveholding
 const ituents are claiming that
 deny their constitutional riffhts in
 those Ter ritorics the simple
 question is whcther the Con
 stitution of the United States
 enters those Tcrri tories and
 repeals the law of Mexico
 aoainst slavery and guararkties in
 sorne form their rie ht
 to enter with their slaves
 I understand the ma jority
 of t11C judges of tl
 le Supreme Court in the
 Dred Scott casc to that
 the Congress of the United
 States have not the power
 to prevent it s entrance
 but I do not understand
 any one of the judges
 of the Supreme Court to
 distinctly affirm that the Constitution
 enters the I erritory and
 repeals or abrogates the former
 and previous law against slavery
 and gives the right to
 enter x vith property in
 slaves I say thcrotöre when
 you representing slaveholding cilizens of
 your State stand here insisting
 that we deny any of
 their constitutional rights you say
 it without any foundation in
 my opinion in constitutional law
 Mr WIGFALL Will the Senator
 me to interrupt him IVIr
 DOOLI I YLE Not at
 present There arc one or
 two points that I desire
 to discuss and hope i
 shall be allowed to do
 so now Mr WIGFALL It
 is merely in relation to
 that matter of law and
 it is this Mexico you
 know was a CathQ ic
 country Mr DOOLITTLE well sir
 1 do not wish to
 go into that rrhe PRESIDING
 OFFICER Does the sen ator
 from Wisconsin yield the floor
 Mr DOOLITTLE The gentleman may
 raise a question as to
 what the Mexican law was
 With out any discourtesy I
 do not propose to go
 into a discussion about that
 IMP WIGFALL well admitting fot
 the sake of argument that
 it was a Catholic country
 then a marriao c could
 not be solemnized except by
 a Catho ic priest Mr
 DOOLITTLE Mr President The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Doos the Sen ator
 from NvVisconsin yield the floor
 Mr DOOLITTLE 1 desire not
 to be drawn into an
 argument about the Catholic religion
 Mr WIGFALL You do not
 hear the facts Mr DOOLITTLE
 When 1 wish to into
 an on that subject it
 will be on so file
 other day and in other
 place too Kinz now upon
 this subject and do not
 desire to be drawn off
 I aryl coming down to
 the real I point in
 this controversy I wish to
 bring gen THE CONGRØSSIONAL tie
 nen rio ht down to
 the point and if I
 am wrono I want to
 surrender and to surrender likea
 man and if you are
 wrong I Want you to
 do the same I support
 this amendment offered by the
 Sen ator frorn Illinois Mr
 TRUMBULL because it affirms that
 the law of Mexico in
 relation to Afri can slaVery
 when wve acquired it ought
 to remain unabolished by Congress
 and remain tbc law of
 tl lat Territory up to
 the time vthen it shall
 be I say to you
 in all sin admitted into
 the Union cerity and I
 believe I speak the sentiments
 of nine tenths not only
 of the Republican party but
 of the Democratic party who
 supported the hon orable Senator
 from Illinois for the Presidency
 that they will never consent
 to the idea that the
 Constitution of the United States
 of its own force or
 hy any of its provisions
 is to carry the law
 of rl hey are willing
 to admit slavery anywhere that
 the Constitution of itself is
 neutral They are willing to
 say that it neither abolishes
 slavery where it exists nor
 establishes it where it does
 not exist that when we
 acquire slave territory it does
 not abolish it and when
 we acquire free terri tory
 it does notestab ish it
 orin any manner guar antee
 its rin ht to enter
 but they will never consent
 no sir the American people
 will never consent to say
 that wherever the Constitution goes
 slaves n lay go as
 property by force of its
 provisions against the local law
 of the Territory imposed by
 the sovereignty from which it
 has been ac quired that
 it has the power call
 it by what name you
 please establishing recognizing guar antying
 or what you will of
 overcoming the law of freedorn
 in the territory existing at
 the time of the acquisition
 The Senator from Missouri compares
 what I said upon this
 subject to tho invitation of
 the fox to the stork
 to con ke to the
 feast Let us look into
 history a little and see
 Sir we acquired Florida which
 was the fox and which
 was the stork at that
 feast We acquired the Louisiana
 Territory and gave you two
 thirds of all the good
 land there Who had the
 advantage when invited to that
 entertainment After you had got
 your full share and we
 were about to enjoy that
 portion which was expressly reserved
 for us just as we
 were ready to partake of
 it and enjoy it what
 then You snatched at it
 and undertook to take it
 from us by force To
 drop all figure you demanded
 the right to allow slavery
 to cn ter Mr POLK
 Mr President I merely wish
 to say The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Does the Sen ator from
 Wisconsin yield thc floor to
 the Sen ator from Missouri
 Mr DOOLITTLE well if it
 is fora simple explanation I
 will Mr POLK I desire
 to correct a mistake into
 which the honorable Senator fell
 He has re peated t
 wice over this morning that
 two thirds of the Territory
 of Louisiana was given to
 the South Mr DOOLITTLE 1
 said of good lands I
 did not say two thirds
 of the surface including meant
 the good lands deserts Mr
 POLK 1 think the Senator
 is entirely mistaken in that
 too Mr DOOLITTLE I say
 just as we were about
 to enterandtake possession with ot_n
 sysoein of labor the Missouri
 compromise was repealed and slavery
 wag invited to enter I
 shall not repeat the story
 of the sul jugation of
 Kansas We have had a
 struggle for the last six
 years grow ing out of
 that transaction which may God
 grant we shall never see
 again Jackson and Clay Webster
 and Wright were no more
 The only two Houston in
 this and Benton in the
 other I louse took part
 in the compromise of 1820
 opposed its repeal They warned
 the country i vllüt would
 be the effect but they
 werc unable to successfully resist
 it What they then pre
 dicted is ahnost history now
 Formy own part f aided
 the election of General Pierce
 and in put ting the
 Democratic party in power in
 1852 1 stood bcfore the
 people of Wisconsin and invited
 upon his lips hc repeated
 his pledge never to re
 open the slavery agitation The
 territorial ques tion was at
 rest The country Was at
 peace on this question Suddenly
 like a Clap of thunder
 frmn a cloudless sky the
 whole coutitry was starded by
 a proposition to repeal the
 Missoui i compromise and to
 open the Territory ofKansas to
 slavery Then followed a struggle
 to carry it there by
 force of arms Would to
 Heaven that page of our
 history could be blotted out
 will not dwell upon it
 Let us admit Kansas now
 into the Union and close
 up that controversy forever Now
 I ask you arc yoü
 not aboutto open a new
 point of quarrel Not satisfied
 with destroying the compromise of
 1820 vou now propose to
 repeal tlie compro mise of
 1850 in relation to New
 Mexico You see what peace
 has been given to the
 country by repealing one compromise
 How much rnore peace will
 you get by now undertaking
 to repeat another compromise that
 of 1850 by which the
 territorial question was settled in
 New Mexico and in Utah
 Breaking the compromise of 1820
 gave no peace in 1854
 Breaking thc compromise of 1850
 as to New Mexico will
 not restore peace now The
 proposition of the Senator from
 Mis sissippi is that Congress
 shall distinctly recog nize and
 protect slavery in all that
 territory I in the amendment
 cannot give it my support
 to it by the Senator
 from Illinois Mr TRUM BULL
 fully concur Mr President I
 have been drawn into a
 longer discussion than I had
 intended 1 shall not tres
 pass further upon the time
 of thc Senate Mr GREEN
 Mr President the Senator from
 Wisconsin is a little at
 fault When he says the
 proposition of the Senator from
 Mississippi pro poses to violate
 the compromise of 1850 he
 over looks the fact that
 the proposition now before the
 Senate the amendment proposed by
 the Senator from Illinois proposes
 exactly the same thing that
 he is supporting and when
 hc talks so loudly and
 so vehemently ahd so eloquently
 about BUS taining the c
 ompromise of 1850 he ought
 to look to the fact
 that the proposition of the
 Senator from Illinois is this
 to enact the laws of
 Mexico and make them like
 the laws of the Medes
 and Per sians irrepenlable I
 understand the law of 1850
 to be that the Territories
 shall regulate this ques tion
 as they please consistently with
 the Consti tution of the
 United States Mr SEWARD Will
 the honorable Senator allow me
 to ask him a question
 Mr GREEN 1 will hear
 it Mr SEWARD The subject
 is so entirely new and
 interesting that I beg the
 Senator s par don for
 interrupting him to ask him
 whether it cannot possibly keep
 over until some other day
 and let us adjourn Mr
 GREEN After a little while
 the subject will keep well
 but I have a few
 words to say I say
 therefore that he ought not
 to try to yet present
 himself before the country as
 the advo cate and peculiar
 defender of the compromise Ilieasures
 of 1850 because the very
 proposition he is now supporting
 proposes to vxolate that com
 promise Now one word upon
 his legal proposition that the
 Constitution does not proprio vigore
 give the right to carry
 slavery into a territory belongino
 to the United States and
 that the Mexican law continues
 until repealed by the proper
 authority I wilk give three
 answers to that and i
 want them distinctly understood First
 under the law of 1850
 New Mexico has passed a
 law on this sub ject
 and it is now the
 law over Arizona which after
 thc Gadsdcn treaty was made
 a part of New Mexico
 and was annexed to it
 and is to day a
 part of New Mexico The
 exact law word for word
 that the Senator from Mississippi
 pro poses to apply to
 Arizuma after we make it
 a separate oro anization is
 this moment the law of
 Arizona It is an enactment
 by the Territorial 204 ritory
 and you do not whep
 yo u anne c its
 ake it with that vail
 over it beeomes an existing
 custom and rights depend upon
 it then when annexagon takes
 place those priyate rights Are
 toe bé pfogéctedv You may
 have a thousand laws obsolete
 in Mexico neverexecuted no them
 and no occasion to which
 and when you take the
 Territory dö not take the
 law over it which existed
 in Fthe eity_ of Mexico
 and can be found among
 tholliiüsty records there in the
 proclamations of dictators oi in
 the decrees published by the
 variousohiefzåins that arise there You
 take the existing living customs
 We take them and we
 call them laws but they
 are nothing utcustoms They are
 prac ticed rules and whenever
 apracticed rule exists and that
 practiced rule hits been the
 cause of pri vate rights
 growing up those rights are
 protected after annexation Why there
 are a thousand lax vs
 there Did you take the
 laws of peonage It is
 a law of Mexico A
 wliite man according to that
 law can be made a
 peon and Can be kept
 in If he cannol work
 enough perpetual boridüge to pay
 his expenses his master kbeps
 him ih per petua slavery
 Did you annex that law
 No Why Because it is
 inconsistent with the genius and
 principles of the American Constitution
 am informed that they have
 just such laws against the
 Protestant religion Can you practice
 your Protestantism in Arizona now
 Yes Why Because our Federal
 Constitution which spfeads over the
 rl erritou y says there
 shall be no distinc tion
 madc in religion and the
 Senator can prac tice his
 religion there as fully as
 freely and as perfectly as
 I can mine and that
 w ould be a good
 deal Now Mr President the
 third reason is this if
 the law existed as a
 practical custom the very moment
 annexation took placd it would
 be null and void Why
 Because it is inconsistent with
 our present Constitution which is
 the supreme law of the
 land in the Territory and
 which has no intermed iatejurisdiction
 authorized to prohibit slavery Then
 the question is why is
 it incon sistent with _the
 Constitution of the United States
 or is it so 1
 answer because thc Supreme Court
 has Said that I have
 a right to go into
 any Terri tory thcre being
 no counter jurisdiction to in
 hibit this privilege by virtue
 of the Constitution not that
 it establishes slavery but that
 it guaran ties the riffht
 for any man to hold
 any property known to and
 rccocynized by the Constitution This
 is thc simple reason and
 the three points cover the
 whole casc to wit 1
 The Now Mexico law our
 own law passed under our
 own eyes our own jurisdiction
 estab lishes the very law
 that Senator BROWN propovs to
 spread over Arizona It is
 now the law of Arizona
 this moment oftime when I
 am speaking 2 The decree
 of the dictator vvY S
 but decree and its provisions
 were never carried out and
 3 It never became an
 existing and living cus tom
 and therefore there was no
 law Eut finally if there
 had been a law beinc
 in consistent with the Constitution
 it would be null and
 void If Congress has not
 the power under the Constitution
 to prohibit slavery t hen
 the pre vious prohibition madc
 bv any other powcr in
 the Ilerritory thc moment öt
 annexation would be come null
 and void Therefore it all
 resolves itself into this has
 the Congress the power to
 prohibit slavery in the Territory
 If Congress does not have
 the power under tho Constitution
 then it is inconsistent with
 the Constitution and if a
 previous prohibition had existed it
 would be null and void
 the moment the treaty was
 ratified Mr President I do
 not desire to prolong this
 discussion I see we cannot
 get through the bill to
 day and if my friend
 from New York will sug
 gest a time agreeable to
 him I will move to
 post pone it As he
 is not here I will
 move to adjourn The motion
 was agreed to and the
 Senate Legislature of Santa Fé
 The whole of Arizona adjourned
 is under the jurisdiction of
 Santa Fé and was HOUSE
 OF REPRESENTATIVES made so by
 law Therefore what the Senator
 from Mississippi proposes to do
 is simply to con THURSDAY
 Decembcr 27 1860 them to
 support General Pierce upon the
 ground that the slavery question
 had been settled in all
 tinuc the existing law of
 Arizona The House met at
 twelve o clock m Prayer
 the rrerritories of the United
 States north of 360 The
 second answer is this that
 the by the Chaplain Rev
 THOMAS H STOCKTON 30 it
 was settled by the act
 of 1820 in New ico
 or of any other country
 which would be con The
 C erk commenced the reading
 of the Journal Mexico and
 Utah it was settled by
 the act of tinued after
 the acquisition by this country
 is not of Monday I
 asked them to support him
 upon that continued because it
 is the command of the
 su CALL or TIIE ROLL
 ground It was upon that
 ground he was elected preme
 power that originally promulgated it
 The Mr JONES I make
 the point before the read
 law does not spread like
 a t hin vail all
 over a Ter i At
 while the oath of offce
 was yet 206 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 27 ing of
 the Journal is concluded that
 there is no quorum present
 and I desire to call
 attention to this rule TOUCHING
 OF SPEAKER I He shalt
 take the chair every day
 precisely at the hour to
 Which the House shall have
 adjourned on the preceding day
 shall inunediately call the members
 to order and on the
 ap pearance ot a quorum
 shali cause the Journal of
 the pre ceding day to
 be read The SPEAKER If
 the point is made by
 any member the reading of
 the Journal must be sus
 pended until it be ascertained
 whether a quorum present ME
 JONES I move that there
 be a call of the
 House Mr MAYNARD for the

 Mr CLARK of Missouri I
 ask my friend from Georgia
 to withdraw his point of
 order and his motion for
 a call of the House
 This is the first morning
 the House has met since
 the adjourn ment over Christmas
 and I presume it is
 doubt ful whether there is
 a quorum in the city
 Let tho Journal be read
 and then the House will
 per haps adjourn inmnediately Mr
 JONES With the that House
 will adjourn as soon as
 the Journal is read will
 withdraw the motion for a
 call of the House Mr
 EIINDMAN I renew the motion
 that there be a call
 of the House Mr MAYNARD
 1 renew my call for

 reason is that there will
 probably be a quorum present
 by the time the vote
 is taken by yeas and

 probably bc no necessity for

 were ordered The question was

 to PERSONAL EXPLANATION Mr STEVENS
 of Washington sent of the
 House to make a personal
 explana tion The SPEAKER If
 there be no objection gentleman
 will have leavc to make
 a personal explanation Mr STEVENS
 0fWashington Mr Speaker desire your
 very careful attention and that
 of 1 tho House to
 the cxplanation have to make
 find in the Boston Journal
 a copy of which I
 have before me a dispatch
 taken from the Boston I
 Icrald to this effect It
 appears upon investigation that the
 bonds were stolen fot the
 use of the central Breckinridge
 club during the late presidential
 election Mr MORRIS of Illinois
 I rise to a question
 I believe it has been
 over and over tvrain decided
 that newspaper para raphs are
 not sufficient foundation for persona
 explanations to bc made in
 this House If it is
 to be allowed to one
 it must bc allowed to
 all The SPEAKER The Chair
 distinctly stated that it would
 be permitted if there was
 no objec tion He heard
 no objection and it is
 now too late to raise
 it Mr MORRIS of Illinois
 raised the objec tion as
 soon as I could ascertain
 the character of the explanation
 the gentleman proposed to make
 The SPEAKER The Chair thinks
 he gave abundant time for
 any gentleman to make objec
 tion but no objection was
 made and hc thinks it
 is now too late to
 raise objection Mr LOGAN The
 gentleman from NYVashing ton stated
 asl understood him that he
 rose to a question of
 privilege The SPEAKER The gentleman
 stated that hc rosc to
 a personal explanation Mr LOGAN
 I wish to call the
 atten tion of the Speaker
 to the fact that a
 few days ugo my colleague
 Mr MCCLERNAND also rose to
 a per sonal explanation and
 was permitted to procecd on
 the point of order presented
 and unless an appeal taken
 from that decision I hold
 that debate ig 110t in
 order Mr FLORENCE is a
 point and I hope the
 gcntleman will insist on it
 Mr LOGAN I take an
 appeal from the dc cision
 of the Chair I do
 so with no discourtesy toward
 the gentleman from Washington but
 bea cause I do not
 want other gentlemen of this
 House to have privileges upon
 this floor which havc been
 denied to one of my
 colleaxues The SPEAKER Nobädy would
 regret than the Chair to
 know that the gentlenhan s
 col league was treated differently
 from other members Certail lly
 the Chair has never meant
 to do other than his
 duty as the presiding offcerof
 the House Mr HOUSTON 1
 do desire to prevent the
 gentleman from Washir gton making
 his ex planation bat I
 do think that this is
 the proper point foi bringing
 to the attention of the
 Chair and the House the
 point of order which neces
 sarily grows out of the
 proposed personal expla I have
 always understood that personal nation
 explanations propose d to be
 made in this House must
 under the rules relate to
 something that occurred in the
 House or to something t11Nt
 rnay be found in the
 official organ of the House
 To such personal explanations I
 do not object nor do
 1 think the House will
 object to them But the
 personal explanation which 1 he
 gentleman asks the privilege of
 Inaking is of an entirely
 dif ferent character He asks
 thc privilege of reply to
 some newspaper article something not
 connected with the offcial proceedings
 of this I louse If
 we permit gentlemen to make
 such personal explanations we will
 give a latitude to our
 proceedings that must destroy the
 harmony and seriously interfere with
 the business of the House
 I make the point of
 order and I ask for
 the Chair s decision I
 vlr FLORENCE The House is
 the best judge of whGthcr
 that is or is not
 a good point and the
 House has already given the
 gentleman unanimous consent to n
 ake his personal expla nation
 Mr HOUSTON If the House
 is the best judge of
 thc point of order then
 hope the gen tleman will
 take his seat and let
 the House de I have
 no doubt the House will
 give a good jud yrnent
 on the matter Mr FLORENCE
 1 submit that ponding an
 appeal another point of order
 is not in order Mr
 HOUSTON 1 will not be
 by the geritleman from Pennsylvania
 I have a right to
 state my point of order
 and I do not want
 to be interrupted every moment
 by little things which have
 no relevancy to the matter
 before the House Mr FLORENCE
 1 am submitting myself to
 a decision of thetChair on
 one point of order and
 I insist that the gentleman
 from Alabama is not in
 order The SPEAKER The gentleman
 from Ala bama has the
 right to state his point
 of order IVIu HOUSTON That
 is just what propose to
 do All I ask is
 that I may be saved
 from con stant interruption My
 point of order is this
 the gentleman from Washington Territory
 pro poses as a matter
 of personal explanation that which
 has no connection with his
 offcial conduct here and which
 is no part of any
 transaction which has occurred in
 this I louse It is
 nothing which has found its
 way into any of the
 official proceedings of the House
 either upon the Jour nal
 or in the Congressional Globe
 and it cannot therefore under
 the rules properly be a
 subject matter of personal explanation
 That is point until he
 had partially read a paragrapn
 in a news of order
 and I ask the Chair
 to decide it Mr MAYNARD
 The Chair has already paper
 when objection was made and
 the Chair decided that question
 of order decided that my
 colleague could not proceed The
 SPEAKER The gentleman from Illinois
 Mr HOUSTON The gentleman is
 mistaken N Ir BLAIR said
 that Mr GRAHAM had paired
 will remember Lhat on the
 occasion to which he He
 has not decided it for
 it was not brought to
 refers his colleague stated that
 he rose to a privi
 his attention until I raised
 it with Mr BURNETT The
 SPEAKER The gentleman from Wash
 and the Chair decided when
 ob Mr QUARLES stated that
 Mr LEAcH of leged question
 North Carolina had paired with
 Mr EDGERTON jection was made
 that it was not a
 privileged inc ton Territory asked
 leavc to make a personal
 question The gentleman from Washington
 now IMP DE JARLNLMI TE
 said his colleague Mr I
 however stated that ho rose
 to personal expla bad paired
 with Mr RTE COLFAX said
 that Mr McKNIGHT was detained
 the I louse in consequence
 of the death of a
 ber of his family Mr
 STO had paired off with
 Mr Nix ox otherwise he
 would vote ay Mr DAVIS
 of Mississippi said he had
 paired with Mr POTTER nation
 and the Chair put the
 question to the House whether
 there was objection to his
 pro ceedine and no objection
 was made MrjLOGAN l ask
 that this question be now
 settled Mr MAYNARD of order
 I understand that the Chair
 has made a decision explanation
 The Chair stated the question
 t o the I louse
 There was no objection to
 granting the request at the
 tilne and the gentleman from
 Washington proceeded to submit his
 remark s Thc Chair is
 of the opinion that the
 gentleman is entitled to be
 heard thö objection now coming
 too late Mr MORRIS of
 Illinois An appeal has been
 taken ft ora the decision
 of thc Chair 1860 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBfi Mr McCLERNAND 1
 hope that my col league
 wiit withdraw his appeal from
 the decision of the Chair
 It is true that r
 was cut off the other
 day ungenerously perhaps I might
 use stronoet term but I
 will not it is true
 that I was cut olf
 the other day by a
 gentleman on the other side
 of the House but the
 example is not worthy of
 being fbliowed and I therefore
 appeal to my colleague to
 withdraw his appeal from the
 de cision of the chair
 Mr LOGAN I withdraw my
 appeal Mr STEV ENS of
 Washington Mr Speaker in the
 Boston Ileraid of Monday last
 appears this paragraph It appcars
 upon investigation that the bonds
 were stolen to borrow Inoney
 on for the use of
 the central Breck inridge club
 during the kite presidcntiai election
 and the crisis in Inonetury
 atl irs has prevented the
 return of the bonds beiöre
 the usual time to use
 them tar tbcir legitimate purposes
 And the Washington correspondent of
 The World of New York
 city writes under date of
 the 24th instant as follows
 l he robbery of the
 Interior Department has caused sonke
 speculation here Lt is thouaht
 by some who are letnned
 au fait in Department införtnation
 that the defal cation of
 the bonds has been goin
 on since the commence njent
 of the presidential campaign and
 that toe Breckin ridgc campaign
 club and Mr Secretary Cobb
 know exactly how the securities
 werc used and iör what
 purpose There is tittle doubt
 but a large portion of
 the bonds were depos itcd
 as collaterai for the paylnentof
 nioneys raised to carry on
 the presidential campaign on behalf
 of Mr Breckin ridere Those
 sn are the two paragraphs
 to Which my attention was
 called last evening and they
 seem important enough to me
 to arrest the notice of
 It was my fortune to
 be the chair this House
 man of the Breckinridge central
 committee and in the presence
 of the gentlemen of this
 House I Thus the hard
 earned reputation of honorable men
 is exposed to the irresponsible
 reports and declarations of this
 foul and filihy horde of
 scav engers who creep in
 the gutters and endeavor to
 cast their slime upon men
 upon whom they are not
 worthy to look In the
 mvestigation of this great crime
 of the robbery of the
 Indian bonds from the Interior
 Department I would be glad
 if the committee could do
 something to put a stop
 to this slanderous and malignant
 defamation of character I close
 by saying that we the
 mem bers of the Breckinridge
 committee defy investi gation we
 court investigation we demand in
 vestigation at the hands of
 the committee with pride we
 can look all men in
 the fäcc and that no
 man has it in his
 power to cast any stain
 upon us Knowing full well
 that my opcrations In the
 canvass were governed by honor
 and truth I nevertheless deem
 it my duty now and
 at all timcs to vindicate
 my own reputation and to
 brand as they deserve the
 false aspersions of the slanderer
 and the calumniator LUDOVICUS BELDING
 Mr RUST by unanimous consent
 Introduced the petition of the
 heirs of Ludovicus Belding for
 the Issuc of a patent
 on an entry made by
 theta under the proémption act
 of the 29th of Ma
 1830 of one quarter section
 of land in West Wasl
 ington land district Arkansas together
 with the accompanying documents which
 were referred to the Committee
 on Public Lands Mr BOCOCK
 obtained the floor Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois I hope the
 gentle man from Virginia will
 allow me a single word
 in reference to he allusion
 made by the gentleman from
 Washington Territory will say that
 I endeavored to do my
 entire duty Mr JONES I
 object td debate Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois If the gentleman
 in that committee according to
 the best of mv ability
 My heart was in the
 business for I bé insists
 upon his obj tion of
 course I will desist lieved
 that in my humbic sphere
 I was striking a blow
 for the honor and the
 renown of my coun try
 and for the perpetuity of
 its institutions But here sir
 is a falsc and calumnious
 animadversion upon the honor and
 integrity of that committee and
 of my own honor and
 integrity as its chair am
 not known to fame bust
 I am known mar as
 u rnan who for twenty
 years has gone through a
 ife of peril and has
 faced death more than once
 in the discharge of his
 duty i speak in the
 pres ence of men who
 know these facts men who
 have seen me at the
 head of the forlorn hope
 when in the van of
 our victorious legions I did
 my part in the great
 drama of the second conquest
 of Mex ico They well
 know that on my person
 I bear the wounds of
 service In the far Northwest
 I have faced the savage
 foe endured the perils and
 hardships of the wilder ness
 and done my part toward
 causing that wilder I speak
 of facts ness to blossom
 like the rose known to
 men upon this floor and
 this most false this inost
 nvtalicious slander propagated against an
 honorable body of men requires
 here the most I never
 knew and I presumc the
 severe rebuke same is the
 case with the other members
 of the Breckinridge committee that
 such bonds were in existence
 until Sunday evenin r when
 the rob I have this
 morning bery wras made known
 cel ed on the honorable
 chairman of the commit tec
 raised to investigate this matter
 and insisted that he should
 probe it to the very
 bottom Let all the facts
 come out and let the
 punishment fall upon the guilty
 l desire to say a
 word or two more From
 an I have investigation which
 I made this morning ascertained
 that the words upon investigation
 wore an interpolation made in
 the Herald offce in Boston
 and put into the telegram
 sent by its reporter a
 young gentleman from this city
 The reporter sent it as
 a rumor The Herald published
 it as a fact disclosed
 by actual investigation which shows
 a disposition foul and loathsome
 on the part of that
 newspaper and worthy of rebuke
 and punishment a disposition to
 resort to slander Mr BOCOCK
 kvill yield to the gentleman
 from Illinois with great pleasure
 Mr MORRIS of Illinois I
 was merely going to say
 that the gentleman from Washington
 did call upon me as
 chairman of the select commit
 tee this morning and say
 that he desired an in
 I replied to him as
 of course it was vestigation
 ny duty to do that
 I had no control over
 the matter but would with
 pleasure lay any commu nication
 he might make before the
 committee for th eiraction leaving
 them to determine what should
 be done in the premises
 EXCUSED FROM SERVICE Mr BOCOCK
 On Monday last in pursu
 ance of a suggestion made
 by the Secretary of the
 Interior and under a resolution
 regularly passed by this House
 a select committee of five
 was appointed to inquire into
 and report upon an embezzlement
 and defalcation which has lately
 I oc cnrred in the
 Department of the Interior did
 not hear that committee announced
 at that time After the
 House adjourned I ascertained that
 the Speaker had done mc
 the honor to place I
 had no opportunity me upon
 that committee then of course
 to ask to be excused
 and I avail myself of
 this the first occasion which
 has prc sented itself to
 ask that favor of the
 House is an important committee
 and thc duties of the
 committee ought to be promptly
 and efficiently discharged In consequence
 of business arrancre ments at

 be called away from the

 not know when I do

 E COMMITTEE Mr MORRIS With
 the permis Sion of the
 gentleman from Ohio I desire
 tö lay a special matter
 beforc the House Mr SHERMAN
 1 will yield to thegentlc
 man for a moment Mk
 MORRIS of Illinois I am
 instructed by the select committee
 of five appointed to investi
 gate the alleged frauds in
 the Department Of the Interior
 to offer the following which
 they think important that the
 House should adopt Resolved That
 the select committee appointed under
 a resolution of the House
 of the 24th instant to
 investigate the a lcged frauds
 in the Department of the
 Interior have leave to sit
 during the sessions of the
 House and at such places
 in this city or elsewhere
 as they may deem advisa
 ble also that said committee
 be antllorized to employ a
 stenographer at a rate not
 exceeding that påid to the
 re porters of the House
 for the Congressional Globe Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 would inquire
 of the gentleman from Illinois
 what is the pros pect
 of the committee being requiréd
 to sit in other places
 I would nierely Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois state in reply
 to the honorable gentleman from
 New York that the committee
 think it very prob a
 ble that they may be
 required to sitin some other
 places where they have not
 exactly at this time determined
 They do not know what
 the future may develop r
 hey want the power to
 sit at some other points
 if it should become neces
 sary Mr STANTON That is
 a privilege which has never
 been granted to any committee
 of the House At the
 last session of Congress the
 priv I ilege was granted
 to one or two members
 of a committee to go
 wherever testimony might be found
 for the purpose of taking
 testimony to be used before
 the committee butl have never
 known an instance in which
 a select committee has been
 authorized to leave the District
 exceptin the case of the
 Kansas investigating committee Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois There records at
 other points which we cannot
 get here Mr McCLERNAND I
 am willing so far as
 I am concerned to allow
 the cornmitteé to go wherever
 they think proper to go
 in order to effect the
 object for which tbc committee
 was raised would be willing
 to rely upon their discretion
 that far but unless the
 chairman of tbc committee can
 satisfy me that there is
 a necessity for a stenog
 rapher to report the proceedings
 of this commit tee I
 shall bc very much inclined
 to vote against that part
 of his resolution It is
 an extraordmary proceeding and unless
 there is some satisfactory explanation
 upon that point shan move
 to strike out that part
 of the resolution which relates
 to the stenographer Mi MORRIS
 of Illinois In reply to
 my col league I wish
 merely to state in behalf
 of the committee that they
 think it will become imper
 atively nece ssary that they
 should hold their sit thinks
 proper from service upon a
 third com i tings at
 some other point w e
 cannot now go I am
 already a member of two
 regular into an explanation of
 this matter before the mittee
 It would not be proper
 for me to do it
 committees of the House But
 I do not care to
 House falsehood and calumny for
 political purposes press that point
 for I prefer under the
 circum I have consulted with
 the members of the com
 and to break down an
 organization simply be stances I
 first stated to throw myself
 upon the mittee since the
 objection was made We think
 the House ought to trust
 us with this discretion cause
 it was adverse to the
 one with which its generosity
 of thc House and ask
 them to excuse I wish
 to say in doing so
 that I return We think
 it is absolutely necessary And
 by observing the lan me
 föuunes are allied Mr KUNKEL
 Mr Speaker would sug my
 acknowledgment to the Speaker for
 thc guage in the world
 it will be seen that
 compliment he paid me in
 placing mc upon the gest
 to the gentleman from Iliinois
 the chairman I llOCGHT some
 who are DEEMED au fait
 in Dc I desire also
 to say that in taking
 of the select committee that
 his resolution is de part
 ment information that the defalcation
 of the bonds has committee
 this step mean not the
 slightest discourtesy to fective im
 two or three particulars The
 employ been coina on since
 the commencement of the presidential
 I could ment of stenographers
 by Vlect eommittees ca npftign
 and that the Breckinridge campaign
 club and any gentleman upon
 the committee Mr Secretary Cobb
 exactly how the securities were
 serve upon the committee with
 entire comfort to i investigation
 of this nature always complicates
 used Dild for what purpose
 208 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 27 the accounts which are
 presented afterwards by the clerk
 or stenographer employed for adjust
 ment to the committee on
 which I have the honor
 I would suggest to him
 the propriety to serve and
 necessity of fixing the amount
 of compensa tionto be allowed
 to the stenographer or clerk
 em ployed by the committee
 if the House should see
 proper to grant the enlarged
 discretion embraced in this resolution
 But Mr Speaker I would
 suggest another dif ficulty which
 occurs to my mind in
 reference to this i esöiution
 It proposes to authorize the
 com mittee to sit elsewhere
 than in the city of
 Wash ington It must be
 obvious to every gentleman who
 has had any experience in
 reference to the proceedings conducted
 by committees of this na
 ture that exiffencies arise from
 time to time in refi
 rcnce to the non attendance
 of witnesses be fore them
 and they have to apply
 to the House for compulsory
 process in such cases I
 low can that power to
 compel the attendancc of witncsscs
 which is vested in the
 House itself be exercised when
 the committee is ata distant
 point I should think it
 would bc more proper for
 the committee to appny to
 the House from time to
 time for leave to go
 elsewhere and conduct the investigation
 and not to ask this
 general power now when the
 chairman of the committee is
 unable to say to the
 House that there is any
 necessity at present ex isting
 for conferring it upon them
 I therefore appeal to the
 gentleman to consider well the
 terms of this resolution before
 he presses it upon the
 consideration of thc House Unless
 the gentleman will withdraw his
 resolution for the present I
 will move to lay it
 upon the table Mr FARNSWORTH
 1 ask that the tion
 be again reported I he
 resolution was acain rcud Mr
 CRAWFORD If the gentleman from
 Maryland will withdraw his motion
 to lay the rcsolution upon
 the table I will offer
 an amend ment which I
 think will meet his views
 Mr KUNKEL 1 withdraw inotion
 sir Mr CRAWFORD 1 move
 then to strike out all
 after the word elsewhere to
 the end of the resolution
 I am perfectly willing to
 allow thc cmynnittee to sit
 during the sessions of the
 House I have no objection
 to that I have no
 objection to their sitting at
 any place in the city
 w hcre tbcy may think
 it advisable but I do
 not scc any necessity for
 giving the comrnittec a rov
 ino commission to travel to
 any part the coun try
 for the purpose of investigating
 this rnat ter The uniform
 rule for the last six
 years I wiil state to
 the gentleman from Illinois has
 been wherc a committee has
 felt it necessary to go
 else where to send a
 sub committee Except in the
 case of the Kansas investigating
 committee a vhole committee has
 never been authorized to go
 away In the case of
 the Kansas it was thought
 better to send the whole
 commit tee because it was
 morc econornicai to send thc
 wholc than it would have
 been to brino the witnesses
 acre would have been ncccs
 sat y to in vestio
 ate what the committee were
 ap pointod to investiöate The
 committee were therefore authorized to
 go to Kansas There have
 been other committees appointed since
 that time and wherevcr it
 has been thought necessary to
 make in vestigations outside of
 the city of Wash ington
 a sub committechas been appointed
 That is the course which
 has been uniformly adopted so
 us I know and I
 arn therefore in favor of
 striking ont all after that
 portion of the resolution which
 authorizes thc committee to sit
 during the sessions of the
 House I am also opposed
 to the employ ruent of
 these stenographers It only af
 fords occupation to some géntlemen
 who lesn e to spend
 a few weeks in the
 city of Washington at four
 five six or seven dollars
 a day I do not
 know what is the amount
 I am informed by a
 member of the Committee of
 Accounts that we pay them
 fifty dollars a day Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland 1 hope
 thegen tleman from Georgia will
 allow mc to say a
 word or two Mr CRAV
 TFORD 1 am opposed to
 employ ing stonno raphers or
 any one else for the
 pur pose of reporting speeches
 for gentlemen to be put
 in thu nex vspapers of
 the country with a view
 of disti ng aisl i
 ng parties who make eloquen
 t speeches before the cozninittee
 We have had enough ex
 I do not see that
 thereisany in that way I
 therefore hope that the House
 necessity for it will vote
 it down all except the
 first portion of the resolution
 And now I will hear
 what the gen tleman from
 Maryland has to say before
 I yield the floor Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland The from
 Maryland will be very brief
 In the first place as
 to the employment of stenographers
 I will simply say to
 the gentleman from Georgia that
 unless the committee are allowed
 to employ a stenographer it
 will bc impossible for them
 to transact their business They
 must have a clerk and
 if their clerk is to
 write down the testimony word
 for word his pay from
 the extension of time will
 amount to as much as
 the pay of a stenographer
 We cannot get along s
 vithout a It be impossible
 for the com stenographer mittee
 to go into the investigation
 with which the Housc has
 charged them unless the House
 chooses to givc them the
 necessary facilities As to a
 roving commission the gentleman may
 bc entirely satisfied and the
 House may rest well assured
 that unless there is some
 controlling and imperative reason which
 requires it t he comnnit
 tee x vill never movc
 one step from this District
 They have sufficient information already
 I may be permitted to
 say to satisfy them that
 the au thority which they
 ask is essential to tho
 proper conduct of their investigation
 and I hope that without
 further discussion the House will
 have sufficient confidence in heir
 discretion and good sense to
 confer this power upon them
 Mr CRAWFORD Do gen tleman
 to say that the committee
 have already a clerk Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland No sir
 we have no clerk Mr
 CRAWFORD Do want both a
 clerk and a stenographer Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland No we
 want only a stenographer who
 will act both as a
 clerk and stenographer Mr MAYNARD
 I sugcyest to the gentleman
 from Georgia that it would
 be utterly irnpossiblc to conduct
 an investiæation of this kind
 without the aid of a
 to take down the evi
 dence it would be utterly
 impracticable unless the evidence was
 heard in parole and not
 pre I can readily conceive
 that in the served at
 all investigation ofa matter of
 this kind there might be
 an exicency requiring the committee
 to leave the District of
 such a nature that it
 would not be proper to
 disclose the object ul present
 for il might defeat the
 very purpose intended to be
 ac I hope therefore the
 resolution will be adopted Mr
 CONKLING 1 move the tion
 Mr CRAWFORD The gentleman has
 not the floor for that
 purpose Mr CONKLING 1 supposed
 the gentleman from Georgia had
 yielded the floor Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois The committee were
 informed at an informal interview
 with the Secretary of the
 Interior on thc day of
 their ap pointment that their
 labors would be extensive and
 laborious and that it would
 take some titnc to investigate
 this matter They have consulted
 him in the premises Mr
 CRAWFORD 1 would ask the
 gentle man from Illinois what
 amount of money will be
 paid per dienu to the
 stenographer under this res olution
 ME MORRIS of Illinois Just
 what is paid to the
 stenographers in the employment of
 the Globe office A MEMBER
 I low much is that
 Mr CRAWFORD that under this
 resolution the stenographer would receive
 fifty dollars a day and
 for one I an I
 not pro pared to authorize
 the payment of that amount
 Unless therefore the amount to
 be paid to the stenographer
 is specified I shall vote
 against the resolution Mr McCLERNAND
 1 would suggest to the
 gentleman from Georgia that before
 he yields the floor he
 move to arnend the resolution
 so as to limit the
 amount of compensation to be
 paid to the stenographer Mr
 CRAWFORD to strike out all
 after the word cisewaere In

 Illinois that the stenographer shall
 act as clerk and that
 his rate of compensation shall
 be 4 50 per col

 Mr MORRIS of Illinois 1
 have no objection to that
 The amendment was agreed to
 The SPEAKER stated the question
 to be on the further
 amendment striking out the clause
 of the resolution permitting the
 committee to hold its sessions
 elsewhere than in Washington city
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE Is that
 pending before the House I
 thought that amendment had been
 withdrawn Mr CRAWFORD 1 will
 state that aftor the remark
 of the chairman of the
 committee that the Secretary of
 the Interior has indicated his
 opin ion that the committee
 may be required to sit
 else where I am willing
 to withdraw that amend tnent
 The resolution as amended was
 then adopted Mr CASE moved
 to reconsider the vote by
 which the resolution was adopted
 and also moved to lay

 motion was agreed to INDIAN

 now renew my motion that
 the rules be suspended and
 that the House resolve itself

 CHAIRMAN The first reading of

 by avote of the committee
 Mr GARNETT It could not
 have been dis pensed with

 CHAIRMAN The Chair supposes it
 may be done by a
 majority of the committee Mr
 MAYN A RD In order
 to obviate any misapprehension in
 relation to these items r
 ask the chairman of the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 whether they conform to the
 estimates and are required by
 law or treaty stipulations Mr
 SHERMAN 1 will state to
 the ble gentleman that there
 is not a solitary item
 in the bill which has
 not been estimated for In
 some cases the Committee of
 Ways and NIeans have reduced
 the estimates but in no
 case have they exceeded them
 Mr MAYNARD 1 also asked
 the further question whether most
 of the estimates are not
 in conformity to law or
 treaty stipulation Mr SHERMAN Nine
 out of are required by
 law or treaty stipulation and
 all the others are for
 necessary contincencies for carrying on
 the service of the Indian
 department Mr COX I ask
 the gentleman from Ohio whether
 the bill contains a provision
 transferrincy the Indian Bureau from
 the Interior to the War
 Department Mr SHERMAN This is
 an appropriation bill and under
 the rules of the Honse
 no pro vision could have
 been inserted in the bill
 chang inff an existing law
 Such a provision would be
 an irnportantchange in the existing
 laws and the bill contains
 no such provision Mr KUNKEL
 I Ivould suggest respectfully to
 the gentleman from Ohio that
 this bill be laid aside
 until the select cotnmittee appointed
 to in vcsti rate the
 charges of fraud in abstracting
 bonds belonging to some of
 these Indian tribes are pre
 report that further legislation may
 be necessary for their protection
 in future Mr SHERMAIN l
 his bill has no connection

 WEDNESDAY On motion of Mr
 BIGLER it was Ordered Tbat
 whcn the Senatc adjourns to
 da it ad journ to
 meet on VVedncsday next DIPLOMATIC
 CORPS Mr CRITTENDEN Mr President
 1 leave to offer a
 resolution nnd to ask for
 the im mediate consideration of
 it The object of it
 is to request the President
 of the Senate to assign
 a portion of the gallery
 of the Senate for the
 use of honorable Senator that
 in that condition we should
 do what I believe is
 everywhere done make a peculiar
 provision for them if they
 honor us with their presence
 Mr DAVIS I will only
 say that they do not
 bear the relation of guests
 They are hore as the
 aments of foreign Governments the
 representa tives of foreign Governments
 not as our guests not
 here by our invitation or
 dependent on our civility They
 are here to perform certain
 func tions for their Governments
 Mr MASON Will the Senator
 allow me a moment Mr
 DAVIS Certainly Mr MASON I
 think if the Senator will
 ex amine the credential of
 a foreign minister he will
 find it is nothing in
 the world but a letter
 of in troduction and asking
 the courtesies of the host
 I the country to the
 person who bears it and
 res iöreign ministers their families
 and suits idence among them
 It is nothing but alettcr
 of T hc Secretary read
 the resolution as fi llows
 introduction a courteous letter of
 introduction Resotucd That the President
 of the Senate bc requested
 Mr DAVIS I am sure
 the chairman of thc to
 assign portion of the gallery
 ot the Senate Ibr the
 use but Committee on Foreign
 Relations is pushing this of
 the foreign ministers their families
 and suit nothing herein contained
 shall affect the provisions of
 the 48th rtiie the Senate
 Mr CRITTENDEN understand and that
 is all I Shall feel
 it necessary to say on
 the sub I that the
 House of Representatives have lect
 passed a similar rule and
 I hope the Senate will
 have no diffcully in agreeing
 to it The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr BRIGHT in the chair
 The Senator from Kentucky asks
 for t he immediate consideration
 of the resolution Mr TRUMBULL
 1 should like to it
 read again l he Secretary
 arvain read the resolution The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Is there any
 objection to the consideration of
 the resolution Mr DAVIS 1
 should like to the resolu
 tion explained by the rnovcr
 of it Mr MASON Under
 the state of the ladies
 of the families of foreiffn
 min istcrs cannot oct seats
 in 1110 galleries because bein
 o fijreitrners and guests of
 the country and with all
 the sensitivct ess that belongs
 to that sit uation they
 feel scruple and very natural
 scru plc in con i
 pcting for sents secretaries and
 the attachés of tho forei
 rn nninistcrs are also placed
 upon the same footing The
 difficulty has been overcomcin the
 HouSe of Representatives as signincr
 there u portion of the
 gallery for the use of
 these foreign ministers and their
 suits and fu I n
 flies I will state that
 from conversation with tl e
 Presiding Officer of the Senate
 I mean the Vice I
 resident on the subject and
 with one of the foreign
 ministers I am satisfied it
 can be done with great
 convenience without disturbing our own
 people and be very satisfactory
 Mr DAVIS the of the
 Senato foreign ministers are admitted
 on the floor of the
 I Senate So far as
 they are concerned therefore provision
 has been rnade As for
 the rest I do not
 see that our courtesy should
 go beyond the poikit of
 considering their families as good
 as our own and I
 thiillc it is rather stretching
 the point when we give
 t h nn a prefbreyu
 e over our I do
 not believe there is any
 propriety in own allowin a
 forei rner to have a
 seat which a citi zen
 of thc United States rnay
 not take in the Sen
 ate Chamber of the United
 States therefore object to it
 IVIr MASON do not Incan
 to protract this debate but
 tl lere is no man
 on this floor who will
 inore Immediately yield to the
 which I mn about to
 Inake tbal the honorable Senator
 These o entlernenand ladicstu e
 the guests of the country
 they are the guests of
 the nation Mr DAVIS No
 not all Mr MASON They
 are your guests and my
 guests as long as they
 remain in the country DAVIS
 at all M r MASON
 And know that honorable Senator
 wiil always say a guest
 has a preferable place e
 vcli to a nv unber
 of his own family Mr
 DAVIS he be a guest
 Mr MASON well that is
 As I said before ve
 know very wcli I tion
 of it Lhat thesc guests
 of ours for they are
 strictly so are not only
 foreispners but many of them
 do not speak our lancyuage
 and they have all the
 proper I and scrupulous If
 iic acy and sensitiveness that
 belono to their peculiaé position
 jn the country case beyond
 what would be his view
 of it under othercircumstances For
 instance when ve send such
 a man away we are
 certainly not turniv a guest
 out of our own house
 and it is by no
 means an uncommon thing to
 discharge the agent of a
 foreign Government when he ceases
 to be accept able to
 our own Mr MASON Why
 is it not turning away
 guest who docs not conduct
 himself as a guest should
 Mr DAVIS If t he
 Senator considers that the agent
 of a foreign Government sent
 here paid by it to
 perform its duties and take
 care of its inter ests
 and in collision with us
 upon every poii t where
 there is to be a
 diversity of interest is to
 be regarded as a guest
 invited into our house and
 to be entertained by us
 1 am really at a
 loss to un dersland the
 power of language It seems
 to me that nothing can
 be in Inorc direct antagonism
 than the two relations You
 receive an agent po lite
 y He brings you a
 letter of introd uction and
 yot_l treat him courteously That
 docs not make him your
 guest He is nothiY g
 in Lho na ture of
 a guest Jt is a
 matter of very little im
 portance to n e but
 I hold to the fact
 that every of the United
 States being a soverciffll in
 his own right his family
 has as good a right
 tou favorable seat in the
 Chamber of the Senate as
 the farnily of any foreicrncr
 IVh SEWARD Éhope sir this
 resolution Inay pass I think
 that the lawr of nations
 as now understood is regarded
 as obliging ail civilized nations
 to receive representatives from other
 civ i ized States and
 it is not allowed by
 that code to any State
 to isolate itself from communications
 by resident ministers and mnbassadors
 These representatives arc not yegarded
 as individuals but they are
 regarded as presenting themselves in
 forcio n countries as direct
 and immediate repre scntat ives
 not of monarchies or of
 rcpubiics not in reference to
 the particular forms Öt their
 gov ern ments but represen
 tatives of thc nations them
 selves from vhieh they come
 I think that this has
 been the universal sentiment of
 our people as it is
 of all other civilized countries
 The I louse of Represen
 tatives has practiced it pon
 this principle in assiøning a
 proper and convenient place to
 these representatives where they may
 hear the debates and inform
 themselves of the condition of
 the country The Senate has
 acted upon It in the
 sarne way bv allowing these
 per sons the privilege allowed
 to very few others of
 entering upon the floor of
 tho Senate For many of
 them that is less convenient
 while it is more inconvenient
 to us than it would
 be if they had aplace
 assigned to them in the
 galleries The principie on which
 we extend to them the
 priv ilege of the floor
 is exactly the same as
 sustains this resolution It is
 not honor it is not
 c on l plimentary it
 is a mere matter of
 courtesy We have made very
 spacious galleries They are seldom
 crowded Certainly there is room
 enough in them for the
 representatives of foreign Govern mcnts
 and as they are strancyers
 many of them not speaking
 our language they may often
 find it embarrassing to obtain
 for themselves a place in
 the audience generally and it
 would be better for them
 and better subservc their convenience
 to have a place specially
 assigned to them which Tl
 hcy cannot their way our
 own people should be known
 to be theirs to be
