THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 7, convention or by Legislature, I should never have made this motion for a reference of the question Mr
GWIN
The Senator from Georgia [Mr
It is the extraordinary condition TOOMBS] will take the floor at one o'clock to-day on the special order that was made on his motion, and Will address the Senate at large on that sub- ject
The Senator from Massachusetts ( Mr
W SON] -has a special order on which he wishes to nddress the Senate t0'-morrow•
I, therefore, in m;der not to' interfere with those Senators in t.heir speeches, move that the unfinished business of Saturday—the Pacific railroad bill—be made the special order on Wednesday next, at one o 'clock, at which time I will make some remarks ill an- swer to the objections which have been made to I hope there will be no objection to it
that bill
The VICE PRESIDENT
be no 0b- jection, the bill will be considered as before the Senate, and that will be considertld us the sense of the body
Mr
WILSON
1 would suggest to sena- tor from California that hc may assign that bill as a special order for two o'clock to-morrow
i only want the floor for a few moments, not an hour
Mr
GWIN
Then 1 will say two o'clock to- morrow
Mr
WILSON
1 should like to have this bill pressed as fast as we can
Mr
GWIN
Then 1 propose to the Pacific railroad bill the special order for to-mor- row, at two o'clock
I make that motion
The motion was agreed to

I hope tbc Senate will now proceed to its consider- , and I trust that we shall continue to con- ation • sider it until it is finally disposed of, to the ex- clusion of all other business; and I desire that to be considered as my motion

CRITTENDEN
No, sir
I do not do- sire it
Mr
President., I arn apprised that the honorable Senator from Georgia is entitled to the floor upon this subject, or one so entirely annlo- goug it that his' remarks will be applicablc to I do not wish to deprive him for a this subject
single rnoment of the possession of the floor

'l'he motion was agreed to
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Do 1 understand that my honorable friend from Georgia desired should proceed 
Mr
TOOMBS
Yes, sir
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 occupy the floor buta little while on this occasion
I do not de.sire to the people
of the country, the extraordinary circumstances by which we are now surrounded, and the pecu- liar situation in which Congress itself is placed, that has induced me to attempt so extraordinary a resort
We believe that amendments to the Constitution are requisite to give that permanent security which is necessary to satisfy the public mind, and restore quiet to the country
Those amendments cannot be recommended, nor can we proceed in the measurc of amendment, unless it be by a two-thirds rmiority
I have feared that that majority could not be hoped for here; and it is in this last extremity that I have proposed that we should invoke the judgment of the peo- ple upon the great question on which their Gov- ernluent depends
It is not an ordinary question; it is no question of party; it is no question of it is a question involving the existence of' the Union, and the existence of the Government
Upon so momentous a qucstion, where the pub- lic councils themselves are so divided and so dis- tractcd as not to be able to adopt, for thc want of the requisite majority, those means that are sup- posed to be necessary for the safety of the coun- try and the people, it has seemed to rue nou im- proper that we should resort to the great source of all political authority—the people themselves
this IS their Union; This is their Goverxnnent; i speak in no we are but their representatives
feeling of flattery to the people, sir
No; I call upon them to pronounce their judgment, and do If we cannot save their duty to their country
the country, and they wilk not save the country, I wish to preserve it by all the country is gone
the ordinary and extraordinary, that are 'Ithat
is the wholc within our possible reach
iöeling, and t I-iat, is L he entire princil)le upon which I see this have acted in rnakino• nothing irnpropcr in it
It unay be objected to as r)0t a mode recognized it
is not forbid.- by the Constitution
Well, sir, den by the Constitution, nor does it conflict with any the Constitution, and it aims at nothing but what is en titled 10 influence here
'I'hat influence wili be weio•hcd by the Senate properly and justly
It is simply an appeal to the people to aid us, their representatives, by giv- ino• us their und their opinion upon the 'i'hat..judgment and opinion will not bc If they should condescend to htnniliatino• to us
pronounce their judgment and give their opinion, there is no humiliation in our obeying the voice of great nation, whose representatives wc are, and whose servants we ate proud to call oursel ves
Their sentiments and their opinions will be our safi..ust "(tide upon this question , surrounded as it is by so nnany difficulties, and disabled as we are by our own diseractions and divisions in Congress fronl acting upon it some power to con- trol and to 'rovcrn individual opinion
K do not think it neccssary, l\'lr
President, that I should enlarge upon this subject
'The
object It is to to be obtained is a constitutional one
ascertain the sense of the pc )le, and for purposes necessary for the prcs- salutary to the
people, an crvation of the country •n all the circumstances which surround it
r i'hen, sir, as to thec nstitutional amendments which are proposed for thc sanction of the peo- ple, and upon which they are to their opin- ion, I had occasion some time a«yo to make a few remarks, and I interld now to add only a few I do not intend to cro very Inue,h at large more
do not kliow that shall at into this question
any tinie—certainly not now, when I am not fully apprised, perhaps, of the various objections that may bc made to them
The first remedy proposed consists in a new article to be added to the Constitution, and which proposes for its ob- cluding it or admitting it
This is all
To the North ail is given; to the South it is only pro- vided that things shall remain as they are until the territory becomes a State, and then it is to adopt this institution pf slavery or not, according to the wish of the people that are intercsted in the It seems to me there is sometl'iing new State
very just and very fair on the face of this propo- sition
We are a great nation, composed now of thirty- threeStates
Fifteen of these have this peculiar in- stitution of slavery; the others have excluded it, each acting according to its own free choice under the Constitution
Slavery existed in these and more States when the Constitution was formed
The Constitution took things as they were, recog- nized them as they were, and left them as they vvreu•e, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the several States
Those who haa the institution of slavery were left to the sole dominion over it; those who wore without it were left to the free and full course of their own and of their own wisdom upon the subject, on thc one side to continue to exclude it, or on the other side to continue to retain it
'i'his was the broad, general, reciprocal justice which the Constitution did to all sections of the cou n try
Now, sir, I ask the same standard and the same measure of justice
Let us take things as they are; that is the object
To the north of 360 30' slavery has been excluded
I say, therefore, sla- very is excluded
To the south, slavery exists ask you to recoonize it
as a matter of fact
'I'hat was the principle upon which the framers of our Constitution went, recorrnizing the status existing at the time, adopting that, accepting that r i'his is what I understand lu respect as a basis
to all the States
This is all now that I ask; all Tl'here arc south of that that this proposition is
line, thc Indian territory, and the Territory of New Mexico; that is all
Of the Indian terri- t01Y I need say nothing; that is appropriated to others, and upon the terms of that appropriation it rests
By those terms, however, slavery may be recognized as existing there; for the ihct is, It does exist
So in alk New Mexico; and how comes it to exist in New Mexico
It exists po- tentially in New Mexico in virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the so-often quoted casc of Dred Scott
They say that ull the people of the United States have the riffht equally to go into the cornmon territory of the United States, and carry with them any spe- cies or description of property recognized as such in the States from which they emigrate
Poten- tially, then, slavery does exist there; but more than that: by the great comprornise measures of 1850, a territorial government was formed for New Mexico; and one of the compronoises, one of the adjustments on that great occasion, was to give this Territory, which was a subject of dis- pute in respect to the question of slavery, power to legislate on all rightful subjects of legisla- It was intended to cover this case; it did tion
cover the case of slavery by the broad and dis- tinct terms in which the power was given to the Territorial Legislature
That was the agreernent between the North and the South: " We will say nothing about slavery ourselves, but we will con- stitute a territorial governrnent, and we will give to that territorial government, representing the local interests, representing the local population, the power to dispose of this subject according to the wishes and according to the interests of the In the exercise of that people of the Territory.' power, the people of the Territory did pass an act authorizing and regulating slavery in every particular; and that act now exists
Slavery only to a very limited extent exists there; but it exists by law actually
Now, what does this arnendment of mine pro- pose
Not that gentlemen shall agree that slavery ject to settle the question of territory, and the may exist there; not that they shall concede any question of slavery in respect to territory; and to principle; not that they shall concede any policy; settle that—Vow
Simply to provide t llat all tho but simply that they shall recognize a fact, a fact that they cannot dispute—the fact of the actual ex- territory north of 360 .3{)' shall bc free from sla- rpcog- l! istenceofslaveryunderactual law, emanating from very; that on the south slavery shall be to procrastinate, or see procrastinated, the coming nized and protected, as it now exists by the laws w that Territory under power granted in the compro- existing there for its protection, and to continue miseof1850,which wasintended to settle theaffairs to a final decision on this measure

so uj)t.il that territory, or any suitable proportion of the country, and to relieve us from the troubles Mr
Presi(lont, if I could indulge myself with It was hailed bv the it, shall bc forrned to a Sta.te and admitted which have now returned
hope that the resolution which I have nro- whole people, accepted as a peace offerincr on all they are to be ad lilitted posed for amondtue,nts to tho Consti!ution could into the Union

with sueli provision ns thcy njay choose to noakc obtain t.hat majority il't this which would I E recommend it to the States lheir adoption, by li in their constitution in respect to slavery—ex- Undcr lho power given by that act of Con€n•ess  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
265 of 1850, slavery has been admitted into that Ter- result of it may be, if the people of the Territory ritory, and all that is proposed by n') y amendment IS, as i said, simply to recognize that; an•d fur- thermore, the fact being recognized, that it shali be recognized that that state of things, that fact, shall continue as it is, until the Territory shall have acquired a sufficient population, according to the ratio-of representation for Representatives, to entitle it to one member in Congress, and then to be admitted into the Union on an oqual footing with the rest of the States, and with a constitution adopting or excluding slavery, according to the judgment of the people themselves
This is the whole proposition in that respect
Well, I confess, sir, it seems to me that it is very little to grant
Some gentlernen are averse to com- promise
Well, gentlemen, you may call this a compromise
May it not with equal propriety be called an honest adjustment of rights
But if it were a comptornise, is it not a fair compromise
And upon what principle are we opposed to com- promise
All human life is IJft a compromise, From the cradle to the grave, every step of it is a compromise between man and society
And when peace is the reward of compromise, it has been usually blessed
A man, it is said, in respect to the compromise ofa lawsuit, must be allowed to purchase his peace
Aman can purchase noth- ing better, nothing dearer than his peace, even in private transactions
How is it in relation to di- visions between great communities, different coun- tries, or great sections of the same country 
Are they not more necessary there
Are they not more demanded by the, interests of society, more de- manded by humanity itself, than in any other con- dition of life
Just as much more demanded as the consequences are greater and more moment- ous, and morc destructive ordinarily
If there were no compromise, parties would have to settle, by force or by war, these questions
Is there in this compromise anything repulsive to any section of this country
know the great Republican party of this country have declared themselves against the extension of' slavery
Is this, in the sense of that declaration, is this, in the sense of that tenet of their faith, an extension of slavery
I have before shown, what is the indisputable fact, that slavery does exist here by which covers the whole Territory
It is not extending slavery into a Territory where no sla- very exists
Slavery does exist there; and the question is, whether you will let it exist, accord- ing to the laws under which it docs exist, until the Territory becomes a State, and decides for itself whether slavery shall continue longer or not
Is there such striF)gency in the doctrine of the party upon this subject, that neither for weal nor for woo, neithcr for peace nor for war, will they, mediately or immediately, on a principle of com- promisc or on principle of justice, reco(rnize the existence of slavery In the Territory of New Mexico
Whatgentlcman, as a statesman,can stand upon that ground
What Senator can stand upon that grouhd
Say that
we are here , as I verily believe we arc, upon the brink of intestine and civil war, that t.hat war can be prevented by recognizing the fact of the existence of slavery, and agreeing that it shall continue for ten or fifteen years, until the Territory shall become prepared to enter the Union as a State, and that Senators had rather encounter civil war, had rather encounter the de- struction of this Union, and of this Government, than to agree to these terms—upon what grounds
Upon any grounds of pubiic welfare
Upon any avowed grounds of policy or of patriotism
Can any Senat.or stand upon that ground
What is his ground, thctt
The Republican party sees that by possibility, under this adjustment, that State, if it chooses slavery, may come into the Union choose, that it may hereafter be entitled, under i this amendment of the Constitution, to come in as a slave State
What do gentlemen say to that
i Is it a dogma that no slave State ever shall here- after be admitted into this Union; and will they, for the maintenance and preservation of that dog- ma, sacrifice the country
Will they encounter civil war and disunion and all its fearful conse- quences, rather than yield up in a single instance this dogma of no more slave States
Surely if that dogma were to be pressed with ever such heartfelt conviction, and such heartfelt zeal, it could not be but that, in the hearts that had so adopted and embraced it, such an exception might be made as this
When the fate of my country is on the one side and my dogma on the other, let the dogma go rather than the country be pros- trated
Is any member of the Senate prepared to say, in the face of this country and of the world, that rather than yield up his dogma in a single instance, he will see the country go to ruin, or he will attempt to enforce his opinion by the sword 
Is there any man who will do such a thing as that, so contrary to the law and teachings of the Al- mighty, and contrary to all humanity 
Sir, we are one people
1 glory in the thought
Will one half of the people undertake to say, we have a conscientious scruple about admitting a slave State, and we intend to substitute that scru- ple in place of ail your territorial rights
This Government, as made by our fathers, was made by States who held slaves and States who did not
We now stand in the same attitude
Then, in their time, most or all of the States held slaves, and now a minority of them only hold slaves
Shall the present majority, holding no slaves, plead, as an apology for usurping all the common territory of the country, a conscientious scruple, a dogma upon their part that no more slave States shall be admitted
I ask my honorable friends on this side of the Chamber if that is the political system or ethics upon which they intend to act; if it is that which they can avow, as a party, for monopolizing that which is common property 
Will they plead a conscientious scruple
Sir, it is a great nursery for conscientious scruples, in- deed ; if men can make titles in themselves to com- mon property in that way
I do not know why a man who held with Ine a tract of land might not take the same scruple against me, and say that I was hcretical, and violated all his dogmas, in pol- that his scruples would not itics and religion; allow him to be in such communion with me as to hold property in common
And how does he, gratify his conscience, and how does he dissolve this question of casuistry
By taking the whole property to himself and turning me out
I say it is a great nursery for scruples -of this sort, if an arcurncntof that kind is to be found here
And now, Mr
President, see hovv' exactly the I very territory in dispute comes within the line of all that reasoning which would show that every part of the country ought to be considered as equally cnt.itled to share in the enjoyment of it
That country was but recently acquired from Is it Mexico; and it was acquired by conquest
not as plain a case that every section of the coun- f try patd its proportionate part of the considera- tion, as if it had been bought with rnoney and each citizen had contributed the number of pence that his interest amounted to
Did not the South contribute her part of the trcasure which bore the expense of that purcllase
Did she, not contribute her portion of the blood that was shed in obtain- ing it
Did she not do even a little more of it than our northern' brethren, because of their re- mote situation
We ',vere nearer the scene of action, could get to it more easily, and therefore, unrestricted and unreserved equal -right , in die territory
Can this be proper
v, We afe bnt one community, With diverse institutions in reJation ! to domestic slavery, as well as in relation -to
many I other subjects
We have grown up in, and cur- I tivated hhbits suitable to, all the circumstances t surrounding us, just as every ' people r
on earth have
The institution of slavery has given a va- riety to the form of society -in which it exists
The absence of it has given form to a somewhat differcnt condition of society, but equally adapted to its people
So it will be everywhere
You say, then, for instance, by way of mitigating the wrong done, that you only exclude slaveholdcrs; you only exclude three hundred thousand—not | section of the country; not States; not fifteen States; but three hundred thousand slaveholders in those States
Whether that is a correct com- putation of them I do not know; nor is it of the least Importance to this argumcnt
No; the wrong i does not stop there
Ail the millions that have beeh reared in the society formed, and receiving its character, and receiving its complexion from that
institution, though they may.not bethe own- ers of slaves, have been brought up and habitu- ated to the habit and form of society .which that institution has given birth to
That makes a dif- ference in the habits of a people not to be worn off in a day or u I admit; but they are, for the present, their habits
Their feelings and their habits go along together; and neither would you northern men prefer to go into the society of these people under circumstances equal; nor would the southern man, with his habits and his feelings, prefer to go into northern society, simply because of changes in the custom and habits; that is all
By restraining the slave- holders from going into any Territory; then you restrain the formation of any such habits.as this other man, who is not a slaveholder in the southern States, has formed
You do not expel him, but you erect a barrier; not an insuperable one; you create a new diffculty in his way in going there, where he is to meet with strangers, and strangers of somewhat different habits from himself
But, as a matter of right, looking at it accord- ing to the political principles upon which our great political society is formed; looking at it upon the common popular principles upon which the Constitution was formed, have you a right, in the distribution of the public property, to make any distinction between the portions of the coun- try holding slaves, and those who do not hold I them
Why have you morc right to do it in rc- spect to the public lands and Territories of the United States, than in respect to any other spe- cies of public property
If you had money in the Treasury, would you insist upon taking all of that
No
I know you would not
Why 
Because it isa common property
When, instead of money, we come to davide territory, land, does not the same principle apply—not merely upon the ground of ordinary equity or justice, but be- cause our Constitution has been formed, those who made it well knowing that in different scc- tions of the common country for which it was made, different scruples might obtain, different I dogmas might prevail
But these were not t.o be looked to at all
Our Constitution, in ite provis- ions, leaves us all free to entertain these dogmas; but it does not leave us free to disregard the great principles of equality, and equal justice, and equal I distribution, as among honest fellow-citizens, of I land as well as money, and every thing else
No part of the country, no section of the country, i has a right to set up its particufar opinion on any subject as the image of orthodoxy, and say those who do not come up to this rule of orthodoxy shall not share with us in any thing that belongs hereafter as a slave Stat•e
Are they pledged I ao•ainst
that under all circumstances
Are their general rules rules that admit of no exceptions
The old Inaxim is, that the exception proves thc If the rule be reasonable, there always are exceptional circumstances that may occur, which would prevent the application of the rule; but here I perhaps, therc xvere more southern than northern to this Governtnent

 266 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 7, You have no right to bring up scruples of that sort, or questions of that sort, aoainst another
This question of slavery has been, to no small extent, connected with the question of religion
Thc pulpit has taken it in hand; the pulpit has become the
minister of politicians, and politicians have rninistered to ministers of the Gospel, neither to the benefit nor profit of the, Gospel; and now scruples—I may as well call them scruples of religion as well as scruples about slavery—are pleaded on one side
You do not plead it eo nomine as a religious preference that you are entitled to, or as a religious distinction
You plead it, to be sure, as a distinct opinion of your own upon the subject of slavery ; but you have been able to force that question of slavery into a great political po- sition before the country, by the aid of the pulpit
It has become with some a rekigious feeling
lam not one of those who feel a disposition to speak, or allow myself to speak, disrespectfully of reli- gion; but I point you to these things as facts that we sec and know, that there has been a combina- tion, a mixing up, of these questions with religion and with politics; and we arc taught from the pulpit daily, not of the political improvidence, not of the political impolicy of slavery; but we are taught that it is a great sin, and that we are to put it flu• away from us
Now, suppose all this doctrine is right: does it come underour Constitution
Does itcome within the principles of our Constitution that we shall set up any such standat(l
The Constitution has set up •a standard, and it is a standard of equal It recognizes and estimates I justice and principle
euch man, und each comrnunity of men, not ac- cording to their religious opinions at all, but according to political - rights; and their political rights arc equal, however different they may be in their religious opinions, or in any conscientious scru pies, however honorable
We have no right to apply Buch feelings to government, Our con- science nnay be a very good-governor for ourselves ; its teachings we nmy follow; but you have no ri'hht to insist, nor have f any right to insist, that I Shaik substitute my conscience for yours; or that you shall condemn my conscience, and put the penalty upon it of a fot'föit.ure of n) y political rights, if I continue to act upon it
You have no right to do that
MT hat is it now, my friends, that is insisted upon
Here is a vast community suffcicnt in extent of territory, sufficient in the number of its people, to make respectable na- tion
They have one opinion on this subject

Is it possib\c that any Senator could believe, with respcct to this arid and sterile Ter- ritory, it could be an object with any gentleman to desirc the extension of slavery
I do not be- lie ve myself that slavery can ever be invited there
Clilnute, soil, its rctnoleuess fron•n all the great avenues of conunerce, alk tend, in In y opinior;, to interpose natural barriers against it
That, how- ever, is not so much the question as our right to go there at all
You have no inore right to take away poor land than you have rich land, from our settlement
Upon the principles of the Con- stitution, you have no niore right to take at,vay onc than the other; and it is not so much the viola- tion of territorial authority as it is the violation of that pi'inciple of equality, that principle of equal riRht upon which every section stands
'That tho South has rcceived sorne wroncr in the course of our party action, is, I think, inos•t clear
has been introduced into this connt.ry, it hus grown up, forced on by party principles step hy step, without any man perhaps comprehend- ing the whole conclusion and the whole extent of i it, until it has appeared in all its fearful propor- tions, a great poxve.r, said to be the ruling power of this country, that has introduced an anti-sla- very system of policy in the United States
the original Constitution—and my •i'ricuds from the Noi•th look to that fact, and cherish it the slave" is not to be found
How often word have we heard that repeate(l here, my friends 
You cling 10 it with tenacity, as a great fact; and yet what have you done
Your system of policy, that upon which you havc triumphed—upon which your platförnl rests—is nothing but anti- slavery alone
Is this right
The opinions may be right as privatc opinions; but under the Con- stitution of the United States, upon thc great prin- ciples and policies which it contemplated, was it ever to be, imagined, or is it ever to be justified, that a great party should stand alone upon a sys- teln of anti-slaverv, making war by one section upon another section—a war of opinion, if no more 
It is in vain that you endeavor to mitigate this war of opinion, this war of denunciation, one arainst another, one system aoainst another, by saying: We do not lay otn• hands upon you; we do not touch slavery in the States." But you ward," have not the South some little cause to complain
But, as generous men, as American statesmen, as Alnericans, havincr an interest throughout this whole great continent, are not these motives sufficient to induce you to make, if I necessary, a compromise, and a liberal compro- mise
Now that you are the victors, be just; and not only just, but liberal
Less than this will create more dissatisfaction, more misappre- her)sion
Will you not do all in your power to quiet ar.d to put an end to these troubles
I hope I shall not be understood as addressing you with any language in a spirit of offense
i appeal to you as my countrymen; I do not
appeal to you as statesmen; I appeal to you as victors in a great political strife; and I implore you to make your victory useful to your coun- try and honorable to yourselves, by that greatest of all acts which you can ever havc thc power or the opportunity to do, of saving that country by settling this question
You are called upon to make no concession
I do not concede that I ask any concession in this proposition
It is nothing more than justice, bare justice
Allow me to recount here fora moment what has been out' history in relation to territorial ac- quisitions from the peace of 1783 down to this time
As I read from the book the other day, you had at that time one .hundred and sixty-sm thousand square miles, and the South six hun- dred and fifty thousand square miles
How is it The first change in these proportions was produced by the cession made by Vn•ginia of all the territory northwest of the Ohio
with a pro- vision excluding slavery
That changed tho pro- portion, and made the North over four hundred thousand square miles, and the South over three hundred thousand square miles
The North, at this early period, and by means of this voluntary cession, become the grcutcr in point of tcrritory
We went on to acquire Florida, Louisiana, and what we conquered and purchased from Mexico
AH these various acquisitions have been so divided out that, at this day, the North has two million two hundred thousand square miles, and the South less than one million square miles, even when you have given her this Territory of New Mex- co
Given her, did I say
You only agree that the present state of law there, in respect to per- sons held to servitude, shall continue until it be- comes a State—that is all
The condition it is now in was not produced by force, or by any ft hae obtained its present condition by law, passed with the consent of the Senate of tho United States
The act of September 18, 1850, gave authority to the Legislature to authorizc and sanction slavery
Then, if we can settle this matter of diffculty in relation to the Territories, there is, I think, in all the other propositions, nothing that anybody can complain of
As to the fugitive slave law, It is only changed and altered so as to mako it less obnoxious to our fellow-citizens of the North
That is the whole extent of the amendment
Therefore that can be no ground of complaint on the part of our northern friends
As to the prohibition to abolish or prohibit sla- very in the District of Columbia, and the places under the special jurisdiction of Congress within the slave States, it seems to me that stands upon a ground that no man can deny
These Territo-  1861, CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
267 us to renounce the pretension to go on its own ries have been ceded to the General Government by slave States
It could not be expected or ap- prehcnded that it was supposed that Congress would abolish slavery in little spots within the midst of the slaveholding States
At the time this cession was made, was any such thing contern- plated by any one
Is it to be presumedät was
if not, would it not be bad faith on the parb of the Government, to say the least of it, to use its juris- diction for purposes which they supposed inju- rious to them, and not contemplated by any of the parties at the time of the cession
Good faith requiring that these things should not be done, would it be too much to ask you, as an assurance that it shall not be done, to declare that the Con- stitution ought not to be so construed as to give power to do it
I think there can be no question about that
I do not intend to go more particularly or pre- cisely into the argument on this question at this time, and I hope it will never be required at my hands hereafter
There are some questions in- volve'(l in this matter in relation to the country, upon which I desire merely to give my opinion
I have said that ail parties have been to blame in these controversies
It is so of necessity
Our infirnlities necessarily lead to that in all long-con- tinucd controversies
It has been so here
Who can say that the South has not acted rashly 
Who can say that the South is not now actincr unwisely
I cannot
To say nothincp of tho past political errors which they have committed, but to iook to the present, do not believe in this It is a new doctrine
It has right
of secession
sprun(-r up and grown wonderfully in a very few it is not named in the Constitution
It dogma at the expense of the other, and let us make that odious thing, if it must be called so—a compromise—again to restore our fellowship and our brotherhood
Balance the consequences ofa i civil war and the consequences of your now' agree- inrr to the stipulated terms of peace here, and see how they compare one with another
I •.vill not repeat again what is asked of you
It is but a trifle in point of territory, a trifle in point of a-ny material value that can be assigned to it, and there is no breach of any principle
It is an exception, and a fair exception upon exceptional grounds, to the principle you avow
On the the other side, you have civil war— Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President The OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from Kentucky give way to the Senator from Ill inois 
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Yes, sir
Mr
TRUMBULL
Will the Senator allow me to ask him, if he has any assurancc that civil war is to be averted by his resolution; if he does not know that a State has already undertaken to secede, and says she wants no compromise, and will have none
Mr
TOOMBS
I must here interpose, and remind my friend from Kentucky, that I did not expect to surrender up the day, or that he would open a new discussion of anything else
'I'hat was not my of the arrangement between us
He is now running off into a i'iew field with other gentlemen
I yielded for the pur- pose of allowing the Senator to explain his projet; but I did not intend to give up the whole day
Mr
CRITTENDEN
[did friend years
i-;as no nayne anywhere in all our code of laws
If qui!e well
it means anything at all, it is revolution; and not- withstanding the attempts to secede from the bold front and character of revolution, it is nothing but n lawless violation of the Constitution
That is my ot"inion
I do not intend to ar•ue it; but I wish to take the responsibility of sayin% in these momentous times, when the Constit.ution of the is apt to be run down, and trodden down; when a right of secession is urged; a right to co off, and to take with them forts, and arsenals, and everything prepared for the common defense, that It is of It is new' to me
I cannot acrree with it
modern growth
But, sir, I do not desire to be carried off into want only to bear my testimony that question 
for the Constitution of my country
I want it to be known—and, as far as my poor voice can go, it shall go—that this Constitution, so far from its being liable, to be broken by any body that chooses to secede, as they call it, is a grand and inviolable instrument upon which no man should lay his un- hallowed hand, or attempt to withdraw himself
If he is oppressed, let him take the responsibilities of revolution; let him defy the war; let him proclaim himself a revolutionist, and not attenujt to hide his revolution iu the little subtilties of law, and the little subtilties with which he surrounds seces- It is Bion, as it is called
I do not believe in it
no justification
My honorable friend from Louis- iaria [LMt•
BENJAMIN] quotes Mr
Madison and Mr
Webster as authority for this doctrine
Why, sir, if the ger:tleman had extended his inquiry a little further, he would have seen that no doctrine was ever repudiated more precisely, exactly, and •sternly, than thisdoctrine of secession was by Mr
Madison; and Mr
Webster's name and fame are identified with the by which he was supposed to havedcstroycd every pretexton which such a doctrine could stand
If it is intended merely as another name for revolution, be it so
I do not know that gentlemen have nota right to so denominate their actions if they please; but a constitutional right to break the Constitution—a i constitutional right to destroy the Union—would be indeed a strange form of government
I am for the Union; but, rny friends, I unust be also for the equal rights of my State under this great Constitution and in this great, Union
You I hopo you will mast be prepared to grant them

You desire to maintain the Union
You say I do
But we i-nust pre- I believe it
Mr
TOOMBS
1 say it was not my under- standing that this debate should be extended with other gentlemen; but I gave way to allow him to I had not expected to yield explain his projet
the day to the Senator from Kentucky
That was not my understandin&
There is some mis- understanding between us, I presume
merely yielded for an explanation of the projet
Mr
CRITTENDEN
The gentleman, then, shall have the floor
Mr
President, it is proper that I should answer the question of the Senator from Illinois
licve it will
Of course, I cannot say for certain; I believe it firmly, and I be- I may be mistaken
lieve it without a doubt
It may not satisfy all
I never expected it would
That it will satisfy a sufficient portion of the country to preserve the peace, and to preserve the Union everywhere, is my belief
I think, if the gentleman is disposed to grant it, he will find in the experiment that all this commotion will be put an end to, not instantly
It may have commenced already, fbr all know, in Charleston
It may not sat!Sfv South Caro- lina
Hers is a peculiar case; buil believe it will satisfy almost all the southern States; at any rate, to such an extent that there will be no further pro- ceeding in this revolution, no further secession, no further revolution
That is my belief; and I hope and trust, sir, that we shall make the exper- I feel confident of the result, and that it iment
vr'ill be the restoration of peace amono• us, and then these gentlemen may go on honorably in this new Administration to serve the country
Let them cominence now by this first glorious act of pacification
It will be a noble starting point
But let them go on without it, let them think t.he best way is to take the sword in hand, and woe be to-• them; woe be to those
who are, under that policy, If the sword is to administer this Government! to be the only weapon relied upon, then woe to your Administration! Your victory will be turned to blood and ashes
Grant these measures, and you will bring happy and glorious days to our whole country
no w' (Five place, Mr
President, to the Senator from Georgia
Mr
TOOMBS
Mr
President and Senators, I obtained the floor last Thursaay with a view of addressing this body upon the various proposi- tions which were submitted to the committee of I am indif- thirteen, of which was a member
fi±rent as to this substitution; but not having seen serve it on the proper terms of equal respect and equal regard
The dogma of my State is, that II the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky, she has as much right to go into the 'I'erritories my remarks will be confined mainly to the action with hcr slaves as you, who do not choose co hold of the committee of thirteen
'Phis, I understand, is somewhat like one of thc propositions, though their dogma
it not be best for both of not identically that one, to which I may have oc- casion to advert in
the- course: the propositions submitted by the honorable Sen- atorfrom Kentucky in the committee of"thirtéen
The success of themA bolitionists and their alliesj under the name of the Republican party, häsrpro- duced us logical results already
They have for long years been sowing dragons' teeth, and -have finally got a crop of armed -men
The Uniönysii'•, is dissolved
- That is an accomplished factiivthe path of this discussion that men may as welt heed
One of your confederates has, already, wisely, bravely, boldly,.confronted public danger; and she is only ahead of many of hér sisters because of her greater facility for speedy action
' The greater majority of those sister States, under like circumstances, consider her cause as -their cause; and I charge you in their name to-day, " Touch not Seguntum." It is QOt only their cause; but it is a cause which receives the sympathy and will receive the support of tens and hundreds of thousands of honest patriotic men in the non- slaveh old ing States, who have h itherto:main tained constitutional rights, who respect -their-oath.s, abide by compacts, and love justice
•And while this Congress, this Senate and this House of-Rep- resentatives, are debating the constitut.ionality and the expediency of seceding from •the Union, and while the perfidious authors of this mischief are showering down denunciations upon a large por- tion of the patriotic men of this country, those brave men are coolly and calmly voting what you call revolution—ay, sir, doing better than that: arming to defend it
They appealed to the Con- stitution, they appealed to justice, they appealed to fratery)ity, until the Constitution, justice, and fraternity were no longer listened to in 'the legis- lative halls of their country, and then, sir, they prepared for the arbitrament of •the sword; and now you see the glittering bayonet, and you hear the tramp of armed men from your capital: tothe It is a sight that'gladdens the eyes Rio Grande
and cheers the heart of other Millions ready to second them
Inasmuch, sir, as 1 have labored earnestly, honestly, sincerely, with these men to avert this necessity so long as I deemed it possi- ble, and inasmuch as heartily approve tbeir present conduct of resistance, I deem it my duty to state tlleir case to the Senate, to the country, and to the civilized world
Senators, my countrymen have demanded no new Government; they have demanded no new Constitution
Look to their records at home and here from the beginning of this national strife until its consummation in the (fisruption of the Empire, and they have not demanded a single thing except that you shall abide by the Consti- tution of the United States; that constitutional rights shall be respected, and that justice shall be done
Sirs, they have stood by your Constitu- tion; they have stood by all its requirements; they have performed all of its duties unselfishly, un- calculatingly, disinterestedly, until a party sprang up in this country which endangered their social system—a party which they arraign, and which they charge before the American people and all mankind, with having made proclamation of out- lawry against four thousand millions of their property in the Territories of the United Stat.es; with having put them under the ban of the Em- Pire in all the States in which their institutions exist, outside of the protection of Federal laws; with having aided and abetted insurrection from within and invasion from without, with the view of subverting those institutions, and desolating their homes and their firesides
For these causes they have taken up arms
f shall proceed to vindicate the justice of their demands, the patriot- I will show the injustice ism of their conduct
which they suffer and the rightfulness OF their resistance
I shall not spend much time on the question that seems to give my honorable friend [Mr
CRITTEN- DEN] so much concern—the constitutional right of a State to secede from this Union
Perhaps he will find out after a while that it is a fact accom- plished
You have got it in the South pretty much in both ways
South Carolina has givén it to you regularly, according to the approved plan
You are getting it just below there; [in Georgia,] I believe, irregularly, outside of law, way
You witl find armed men to defend both
I Union have demanded nothing but clear, distinct,  268 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 7, unequivocal, well-acknowledged constitutional State, and fleeing to another, shall be delivered ered up every day in this way; but not slaves
rights; rights affrmed by the highest judicial tribunals of their country; rights older than the Constitution; rights which are planted upon the I immutable principles of natural justice; rights which have been affrmed by the' good and the wise of all countries, and of •all centuries
We demand no power to injure any man
We de- mand no right to injure our confederate States
We demand no right to interfere with their insti- tutions, either by word or deed
We have no right to disturb their peace, their tranquillity, their security
We have demanded of them sim- ply, solely—nothing else—to give us equality, se- curity, and tranquillity
Give us these, and peace restores itself
Refuse them, and take what you can get
I will now read my own demands, acting under my own convictions, and the universal judgment of my countrymen
They are considered the demands of an extremist
To hold to a consti- tutional right now makes one considered an ec- —1 believe that is the appellation these trennst traitors and villains, north and south, employ
I accept their reproach rather than their principles
Accepting their designation Of treason and rebel- lion, there stands before them as good a traitor, and as good a rebel, as ever descended from revo- lutionary loins
What do these rebels demand
First, that the people of the United States shall have an equal right to emigrate and settle in the present, or any future <lcquired territories, with whatever prop- erty they may possess, (including slaves,) and be securely protected in its peaceable enjoyment until suc.h territory may be admitted as State into the Union, without or without slavery, as she may determine, on an equality with all exist- ing States." That is our territorial demand
We have fought for this territory when blood was its price
We have paid it when gold was its price
We have not proposed to exclude you, though you have contributed very little of erther blood or money
I refer especially to New Eng- land
We demand only to go into those terri- tories upon terrns of equality with you, as eqt.lals in this great to enjoy the property of the whole Union, .and receive the protection of the common Government, until the territory is capable of ccnning into the Union as a sovereign State, when it may fix its ox,vn insti- tutions to suit itself
The second proposition is: that property in slaves shall be entitled to the same protection from tl')e Government of the United States, in ail of its departinents, everywhere, which the Con- stit9tion confrrs the power upon it to extend to any other property, provided nothing herein con- tained shall be construed to limit or restrain the right now belonging to every State to prohibit, abolish, or establish and protect slavery within its limits
We (letnand of the conunon Govern- ment to use its gran tod powers to protect our prop- erty as well as yours
For this protection we pay as nmch as do
This very prop)erty is sub- It has been taxed by you, and ject to taxation
sold by you for taxes
'I'lle titb to thousands and tens of thousands slaves is derived from t.he United States, We claim that the Government, while the Constitution recocrnizcs our property for purposes of taxation, shall give it the same protection that it gives yours
Ought it not to do so
You say no
Every one of you upon the committee
said no
Your Senators say no
Your House of Representatives says no
Th rough out, the length and breadth of your conspiracy against the Constitution, there is but one shout of 110! This reccvnitinn of this is the price of my allegiance
Withhold it, and you do not get my obedietnce
This is the philosophy of the anned i men who have sprung up in this country
Do up in the same manner as persons committing Slaves, black people, you say, are entitled to trial crimes against other property, and that the laws by jury; and in this way schemes have been in- of the State from which such persons flee shall bo vented to defeat your plain constitutional obliga- the test of criminality." That is another one of! tions
In January, last year, I argued this ques- the demands of an extremist and rebel
The Con- stitution of the United States, article four, section two, says: A person charged in any State with treason, felony, or other clinje, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another State, shall, on (leinand of the executive authority of the State from which he fled
be delivered up to be re- moved to the State havinrr jurisdiction of the crime." But the non-slaveholding States, treachéroüs to their oaths and compacts, have steadily refused, if the criminal only stole a ncgro, and that necrro was a slave, to deliver him up
It was refused twice on the requisition of my own State as lonff b as twenty-two years acro
It was refused by Kent and by Fairfield, Governors of Maine, avul rcp- I believe, each of the then Federal resenti ng, parties
We appealed then to fraternity, but we sul-)mitted•, and this constitutional right has been, practically, a dead letter from that day to this
The next case came up between us and the Statc of New York, when the present senior Scn- I ator [Mr
SEWARD] wras the Governor of that State; and hc refused it
Why
Hc said it was not against the laws of New York t.o steal a ne- go, and therefore hc would not comply with the demand
He made a similar refusal to Virginia
Yet these are, our confederates; these are our sis- ter States! There is the bargain; there is the compact
You have sworn t.o it
Both these Governors swore
to it
The Senator from New York swore to it
The Governor ot Ohio swore to it when he was You cannot bind them by oaths
Yot they talk to us of treason; and I suppose they expect to whip freemen into lovinn• such brethren! They will have a good time m dointr it! It is natural wc should want this provision of the Constitution carried out
The Constitution says slaves are property; the Supreme Court says so; the Constitution says so
The theft of slaves is a crime; they are a subject- nnatter of felonious asporta lion
By the text' and letter of the Constitution you agreed to give them up
You -have sworl'l to do it, and you have broken your oaths
Of course, those who have 
done so look out for pretexts
Nobody expected them to do otherwise
I do not think I ever saw a perjurer, however bald and naked, who could not invent some pretexts to palliate his crime, or who could not, for fifteen shillings, hire an Old il Bailey lawyer to invent some fbr him
Yet this requn•emel'lt of the Constitution is another one of the extreme demands of an extremist and rebel
tion, and presented at the close of my speech a compilation made by a friend of mine, of the laws of the non-slaveholding States on this point
The I honorable gentieman from Vermont [Mr
COLLA- MER] commented upon the reference to his State, and the greater portion of his speech was taken up with a discussion of the particular act which was quoted in my appendix
I have no doubt the Senator did not know of the act of 1858, because cert
inly his argument would not have been made if he did; he certainly was not informed as to the act of 1858
I will read him one or two of the sections of that act
1 referred to and commented on it then in my speech; but in the appendix con- taining the compilation there was an accidental misrefercnce
That act provides— That every person who may have been beld as a slave, who shall come or be brought or be
in this State, with or without the consent of his or her ancgcd Inaster Mr
COLLAMER
What date is that
Mr
'I'OOMBS
Eighteen hundred and fifty- It is entitled 'E An act to secure freedom to all persons in this State
" Mr
COLLAMER
That was not the one men- tioned'in the Senator's speech
Mr
TOOMBS
Ihave explåined why it was not in tl•ne appendix; but I had read it, and I sup- posed the Senator had
The Senator made his speech on this rcfercnce, because, I suppose, it was rnore, easily answered
Mr
COLLAMER
1 made the speech upon the one to which reférence was made
Mr
TOOMBS
That was very adroitly done, or very ignorantly done, I do not know which; but I want to set that portion of our record right
This was the act to which I referred, and upon which I commented in the body of the speech, though not in the appendix, which was prepared by another person: Every person who Inay have been held as a slave, who shall conne, or be brought, or be in this State, wit.h the con- sent of his or her alleged Inaster or mistress, or who shan come or be brought, or be in this State, shan bc free." The Constitution of the United States says they shall not bc free; Vermont says they shall; and yet all her legislators arc sworn to obey the Con- stitution
Vermont says if slaves come, _volun- tarily or involuntarily, with or without consent; if they flee from service, or come into Vermont in any way, they shall be free
The Constitution says they shall not bc discharged from service if they flee; Vermont says they shall be
That is The next stipulation is that fugitive slaves shall another one
of our sisters, for whom it is said we be surrendered under the provisions of the fugitive ii ought to have a deep attachment
slave act of 1850, without being entitled either to a writ of habeas corpus or trial by jury, or other similar obstructions of legislation, in the State to which he may flee
Here is the Constitution: No person held to scrvicc or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in conse- quence ot• any law or regulation therein, be discharged f'rorn such serviee or labor, but Shall be delivered up on clainn of the party to whom such servicc or labor may be This languacre is plain, and everybody under- Again: SEC

Every persor; who shall hold, or atternpt to hold, in this State, in slavery, or ax a slave, any free per- son, in any form or for any tune, however short, undcr tho pretense that such person is or has been a slave, shall, on conviction thereof, be, ilnprisoned iii the State prison a tern) not less than five years nor more than twenty years, and be fined not less than $1,000 nor rnore than $10,000." This is decidedly fraternal ! If a inan passes voluntarily through the State of Verrnont with his slave, that State, in her fraternal affection, will you ask ine to support a G-overnment that will tax my property; that will plunder me; that will demand In y blood, and will not protect me
would rather see the population of my own native State laid six it•et
beneath her sod than that they should support for one hour such a Government
Protection is the price of obedience everyvtzhere, It is the only thing that makes in alt cot.tnt.rics
Government respectable
Deny it, and you can- not have free subjects or citizens; you may have Blaves
We demand, in the next place, that persons comrnittincr crimes against slave property in one stood it the same way for the first forty years of keep him fifteen years in the State prison and fine your Govern tnent

MY
Lincoln and his party have stitutional oblicyation
How is it now
The North taken an easier position; and now such has been soQ(Fht
to evade it; following the instincts of their the rapid descent into error as Vircril describes national character, they conunenced with that into hell, " smooth is the descent and easy fraudulent fiction that fugitives were entitled to (he way," that now they even refuse to admit habeas corp•us, entitled to trial by jury in the State that legislative acts are necessary to enable them to which they fled
They pretended to believe to defeat Constitution; they profess to defeat that fugitive slaves were entitled to more rights it by circumvention; they think it better to be than their white citizens; perhaps they were right, I cuhning than strong
Personal liberty bills are they know one another better than do
You the bungling contrivances of a less advanced ac- Inay charge a white man with treason, or felony, complishment in crime
I should not be sur- or other crime, and you do not require ail y trial prised if they should repeal all of them, for they by jury before he is g•ivet) up; there is nothing to do not need them now
Lincoln says they are deterntine but that hc is legally charged with a unnecessary; that by the Constitution it is settled crime and that he fled, and Lf]en he is to be deliv- that all men are created free and equal, and that 
ered up upon White people are deliv- all Inen are entitled to an equal purticlpation in  1861

So was that treaty -between the States: be deprived of his lift) and liberty and property After a while, though, the politicians said it did without the judgment of his peers or the law df not work well
It carried us through the Revo- the land
Apply these principles as the Black Republicans Intend to apply them, and they have no need for personal liberty bills
They are far in advance of such contrivances
The progressive spirit of the ago will not wait upon such devices
They may now dispense with these superseded devices; but I undertake to say here that no Black Republican Legislature that repeals them will ever say that it is their purpose or duty to sur- render the fugitive
No, sir, they do not intend to do that
They may delude you in order to get power; they may deceive you to get possession of [his Government; but there is neither faith, nor truth, nor manhood in this conspiracy
T hc next demand made on behalf of the South " that Congress shall pass efficient laws for the punishment of all persons in any of the States I.V'ho shall in any manner aid and abet invasion or insurrection in any other State, or commit any other act against the laws of nations, tending to disturb the tranquillity of the people or govern- ment of any other State." That a very plain principle
The Constitution of the United States now requires, and gives Congress express power, to define and punish piracies and felonies com- mitted on the high seas, and offenses against the taws of nations
When the honorable and distin- guished Senator from Illinois [Mr
DOUGLAS] last year introduced a bill for the purpose of punish- Ing people thus offending under thatclause of the Constitution, Mr
Lincoln, in his speech at New York, which I have before me, declared that it was a " sedition bill;" his press and party hooted at it
So far from recognizing the bill us intended to carry out thc Constitution of the United States, it received their jeers and gibes
The Black Re- publicans of Massachusetts elected the admirer and eulogist of John Brown's courage as their Governor, and we may suppose he will throw no impediments in the way of John Brown 's success- ors
The epithet applied to the bill of the Sen- ator from Illinois is quoted from a deliberate speech delivered by Lincoln in New York, for which, it was stated m the journals, according to some res- olutions passed by an association of his own party, he was paid a couple of hundred dollars
r he speech should therefore have been deliberate
Lincoln denounced that bill
He places the stamp of his condemnation upon a measure intended to promote the peace and security of confederate States
He is, therefore, an enemy of the hu- man race, and deserves the execration of ali man- We demand these five propositions
Are they not right
Are they not just
Take them in de- tail, and show that they are not warranted by the lution
Thc diffculty was, that after the war there were troubles about the regulation of commerce, about navigation, but above all, about financial matters
The Government had no means of get- ting at the pockets of the people; and but for that one diffculty, this present Government would never have been made
The country is deluded v.'ith the nonsense that this bond of union was cemented by the blood of brave men in the Rev- oiution
Sir, it is false
It never cost a drop of blood
A large portion of the best men of the Revolution voted against it'
It was carried in the convention of Virginia by but ten majority, and among its opponents were Monroe and Henry, and othex rnen who had fought the war, who re- corded their judgment that it Was not a good bond; and i am satisfied to-dc.y that they were the wiser men
This talk about the blood of patriots is in- tended to humbucr the country, to scare the old women
Why, Sir, it never cost a drop of blood
It was carried in some of the States by treachery, by men betraying their constituents
That is the history of the times
Five votes would have tied it in Virginia
It passed New York by but three majority
Out ot nearly four hundred in the con- vention of Massachusetts, it passed by nineteen
That is the history of the action of the three greatest States of the Union nt that time
Some of the bravest and the boldest and the best men of the Revolution , who fought from its beginning to its end, were opposed to the plan of union; and among them was the illustrious author of the Declaration of Independence himself
Are we to be deterred by the cry, that we are laying our un- hallowed hands on this holy uilar
Sir, I have no hesitation in saying that a very largc portion of the peoplc of Georgia, whom I represent, pre- fer to remain in this Union with their constitu- tional rights—I would say ninety per cent
of them—tbelieving it to be a good Government
They have lived and prospered in it
Shallow- pated fools have told them this Government was the cause of their prosperity, and they have never troubled themselves to inquire whether or not this I think it had but little to do with were true
their prosperity bevond securing their peace with other nations, and that boon' has bccn paid for at a price that no freeman ought to submit to
These are my own opinions; they have been announced to my constituents, and I announce them here
Had I lived in that day, I should have voted with the majority in Virginia, with Monroe, Henry, and the illustrious patriots who composed the sev- enty-nine votes acrainst the—adoption of the present plan of Government
In my opinion, it' they had prevailed to-day, the Inen of the South would have the greatest and most powerful nation of the earth
Constitution, by the safety of our people, by the principles of eternal justice
W c will pause and Let this judgment stand for future ages
consider them; but mark me, we will not let you decide the question for us
But we are toid by well-meaning blit simple- minded people that adz-nit your wrongs, your remedies are
not justifiable
Senators, I have little care to dispute remedies with you, unless you propose to redress mv wronos
If you propose that in good faith, I iiill listen with respectful def- erence; but when the objectors to my remedies propose no adequate oncs of their own, know what they mean by the oujection
They mean sub- the musket will improve my defective remedy
But still, I will as yet argue it with them
These thirteen colonies originally had no bond of union whatever; no more than Jamaica and Australia have to-day
They were wholly sep- apate communities, independent of each other, and dependenton the Crown of Great Britain
All the union between them that was ever made is in writing
They made t',vo written compacts
One was k 1 own as the Articles ofCon federation , which declarcd that the Union thereby formed s.hould be It i Senators, the Cmnstitution is a compact

been content, to sustain it
While I doubt its perfection; while I do not believe it was a good compact; and while I never saw the day that I would have voted for it as a proposition de novo, yet-I am bound to it by oath and by that common prudence which would induce men to abide by established fortns, rather than to rush into un- known dangers
I have given to it, and intend to I choose to put that allegiance on the true ground, not on the false idea that anybody's blood I,vas say that the Constitution is the shed for it

All the obligations, the chains that fetter the limbs of my people, are nominated in the bond, and they Wisely excluded uny con- clusion aoainst them, by declaring that the powers publicists) which' acquired the- property; and therefore it_is not the pro perty of the so vereigfr
This right' of equality being, then,:
according-to justice and natural equity, a rightbelonging •to an States, when did we give itup
You say Cong*ess, has a right to pass rules and regulations ing the 'Iten•itory and other property of the United States
Very well
Does that exclude those I whose blood and money paid for iO Does '6 dis- pose of" mean to rob-the rightful- owners
You must show a better title than that, or a
better sword than we have
But, you say, try the right
agree to it
But how
By our judgment
No, not until the last -resort
What then; by yours
No, not until the same time
How then try it
The South has al- ways said, by the Suprcme Court
But that is in our favor, and Lincoln says he wili not stand that i judgment
Then each mast judge for himself of the mode and manner of redress
But you deny us that privilege, and finally reduce us to accept- ing your judgment
We decline it.- You say you will enforce it by executing laws; that means your judgment of what thehws ought to be
Perhaps you will havea good time of executing yourjudg- meat
The Senator from Kentucky comes to I your aid, and says he can find no constitutional right of secession
Perhaps not; but the Consti• tution is not the place to look for State rights
If that right belongs to independent States, and they did not cede it to the Federal Government, it is reserved to the States, or tothe people
Ask your new commentator where he gets your right to judge for us
Is it in the bond
The northern doctrine was, many years ago, that the Supreme Court was the judge
That was their doctrine in 1800
They denounced Madison i for the revjort of 1799, on the Virginia resolutions; they denounced Jefferson for framing the Ken- tuck y resolutions, because
they were presumed to impugn thc decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States; and they déclared that that court was made, by the Constitution , the ultimate and supreme arbiter
That .was the universal judgment—the declaration of every free State in this Union, in answer to the Virginia resolutions 01' 1798, or of all who did answer, even including the State of Delaware, then under Federal control}
The Su preme Court have decided that, by the Constitution, wc have a right to go to the 'Terri- tories and be protected there with our property
You say, we cannot decide the compact for our- selves
Well, can the Supreme Court decide it ! for us
Mr
Lincoln says he does not care what the Supreme Court decides, he will turn us out anyhow
He says this in his debate with the honorable Senator front Illinois, [Mr
DOUGLAS.] I have it before me
He said he would vote against the decision of the Supreme Court
Then you do not accept that arbiter
You will not take my construction; you will •not take the Supreme Court as an arbiter; you will not take the prac- tice of the Government; you will not take the treaties under Jefferson and Madison; you will not take the opinion of Madison upon the very question of prohibition in •18'20
- What, then, will you take
You will take nothing but your own judgment; that is, you will not only judge for yourselves, not only discard the court, dis- card our construction, discard the practice of the Government, but you will drive us out, simply because you will it
Come and do it! You have sapped the foundations of society; you have de- in a compact stroyed ahnost all hope of peace
where there is no common arbiter, where the par- ties finally decide for themselves, the sword alone at last becomes the real, if not the constitutional, , arbiter
Your party says that you will not take the decision of the Supreme Court
You said so at Chicago; you said so in committee; every man of you in both Houses says so
What are you not granted by the Constitution to the United going to do
You say we shall submit to your con- States, or forbidden by it to the States, belonged struction
We shall do it, if you can make us; i to the States respectively or the people
Now I but not otherwise, or in any other manner
That will t.ry it by that standard; I will subject it to is settled
You may call it secession, or you may The iaw of nature, the law of justice, l! cali it revolution; but there is a big fact standing perpetual—an argument very much relied upon by that test
would say—and it is so expounded by the pub- before you, ready to oppose you—that fact is, the friends of the Union" now
Those Articles of(.hnfederation in termsdeclared that they should licists—thatequal rights in the common property freemen with arms in their hands

The treaty of 1803 declares that the property of the people shall be protected by the Government until they are admitted into the I Union asa State
That treaty covers Kansas and Nebraska
The law passed in 1804 or 1805, under Mr
Jefün•son, protects property in slaves in that very territory
In 1820, -when the question of prohibition came up, Mr
Madison declared it X.,Vas not warranted by the Constitution, and Jefferson denounced its abettors as enemies of the human race
Here is the court; here are our fathers; here is cotemporaneous exposition for fifty years, all asserting onr right
The Black Republican party say, " VVe care not for your precedents or prac- tices; we have progressive politics as well as a progressive religion
Behold Spooner! We care not for the fathers; we care not for the judges." They have said more: their leaders on this floor have said they will get rid of thc court as James II
got rid of' the honest judges when they decided aøainst the dispensing power of the Crown
Onc scl refused; he turned them out and put in another; they refused; ho turned thein out and got another
They mocked the constitution and the laws, and decided for the Crown
What was the result
Hc became, and justly, a wanderer and an outcast, and his posterity were wandercrs and outcasts, houseless and homeless
The heir of his race— the son of Mary of Modena, the last scion ofa per- fidious race—died a pensioner of Rome
Read, thCli, the record of this reckless king, and profit by his cxample
When you appoint judges to make decisions, you make a mockery of all jus- tice,and of all decisions with freemen-everywhere
i Our ancestors told ns how to treat such oppres- Siou in IGS8
We have not forgotten the lesson
To come back from this digression, I will now road your proclamation of outlawry from the I Chicao•o platform, to wit: , nonn;u condition of the territory of the Uni- ted States is oi ; t.hat as our republican fathers, they had abolished slavery in our national terri- tory, orda that no person be deprived of' lift', liberty
or property witli0tn:due process of law, it bee.otnes our duty, by congressional legislation, whenever such legis

of a 'I'erritorial Legislature, of any individual or association ot• individuals, to give legat existence 10 slavery in any Territory of the United States.' • 'l'here you declare that the treaties -madc by MI'
Jefferson 1803 are null, void, and no law; there you declare that the acts by which property slaves was prolected and allowed, both by ter- ritorial and eoncrressional acts, in Florida, in Lou- Is:anu, in A i'kansas•, in Missouri, in Mississippi, and in Alabarnn, null, void, nnd no law
Yoa declare that the decision of the Supt'('lne Court is null, void, and no law; t,hat there is no Constitution but the Chicago platform; yet you
propose to corne here und take possession of this and swear to liltiintain the Consti- tution wit.ll this readi rig, and you are quite aston- ished at our having any objections to the peace- able least tbc Senator from Oregon [1M r: R era] theothOrday
Isuppose that or- it_l.st.ccnne out of' the woods
I do not knoxv ator hag has kept h inuself', if hc lias never heard this question than he told us
But any of no Inatt.er what may bc our grievances, the hon- oral)leSenator from Kentucky [Mr

secede
W c cannot revolutionize; he will say that is trea- son
W llat can we do
Submit
rl'hey say they the Supreme Court; and his declaration may be •safely left to judiciaf vindication
13ut I have promised to show that Lincoln has refused obedience to judicial interpretations of a In his speech of 10th constitutional question
July, 1856, he said: If were in Congress, and a vote should come up on the question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new Tcrritorv, in spite of' the Dred Scott decision, would vote that it should." I omitted to remark in its proper place that not only Mr
Lincoln repudiates the propositions which submitted to the committee of thirteen of the Senate, but they were all voted against by the five members representing the Black Republican party in the Senate öf the United States upon the committee of thirteen, and I presumed •they were not extreme men
Some of them, had been led to believe, were the moderate Inen who were among, and not of, the organization
But every principle which was propÖsed received the con- demnation of every onc of them
A resolution involving the
same principles, introduced by a distinguished colleague of minc in the I-lousc of Representatives, was voted down, believe, by a unar)imous vote of ail the members of that I-louse belongincr to the Republican party
'The samc lesson is taught by cvery declarat:on they make, even by thc treacherous silence which has been maintained by their most extreme men on this floor and elsewhere, on tbcsc subjects, since the beginning of this session
Probably sotnc of them thought it vvras best to be calm, supposing that perhaps the foot which was upon the neck of slavery was insecure
Possibly " the jubilant Senator from the Northwest ' [Mr
DOOLITTLE] thought the don') inali01'1 not be perpetual; and that it was well to bring thc coils of power, of piace, of armies, of navies, and of legality around us, in order to tighten our chains before we were alarmed
•w c understand this danger, and we will anticipate it
You will havc to use your strength, not ours, to rivet our chains; spend your own money and your own blood, not ours, to consolidate your power
have, then, establisbcd the proposition—it is admitted—that you sock to outlaw of property of our people in the 'I'erritories of the United States
Is not that a cause of war
Is it n grievance that of the property of the people should be, outlawed in the Territories of the United States by the corn tnon Governmerit.
What, then, is our reliance
Your treachery to yourselves
I will not accept that guaran tee
I know you are treacherous to us, but I see no rea- son but justice why you should betray each other; and that will not avai, you
think, therefore, you will do what yon say on that question; at least there can be no harm in my accepting your declarations as true
believe that however hos- tile nations may be, they take the warlike decla- rations the enctny as truc and sufficient for their action
you have declared, Line.oln declares, your platfornl dcc!arcs, your people declare, your Leo islaturcs declare—thero is one voice ru nning through your entire phalanx—Ebat wc shall I-)C outlawed in the Torritories of the United Slates
I I say we W'ill not be; and svc are willing to meet the issue; and rather than submit to such an out- lawry, we will defend our territorial rights as we would our household gods
But, alt.hough I insist upon this perfect equality are thc strongest, and they will hang us
Very II in the 'Territories, yet, when it was proposed, as I understand the Senator from Kentucky now suppose we arc to bb thankful for that
boon
NV e will take that risk
We will stand I proposes, that the line of 360 301 shall be extended, Yet, not only did your committee refuse that, butmy distinguished friend from Mississippi [Mr
moderate gentleman like my- self—proposed simply to get a recognition that we had the right to our own; that man could have property in man; and it t-net with the unanimous refusal even of the most moderate, Union-savine, compromisin.cr portion of the Republican party
Theydo not intend to acknowledge it
How could they
Mr
Lincoln says that, according to the Declaration of [ndependcnce, all men arc born free and equal
You do not want any fugitive slave law; all you want is a habeas corpus; with this you can set them fre.e in Georgia
According to this, notion Spooner is right in contending that the Federal Constitution authorizes the abolition of slavery
Mr
Lincoln thus accepts every cardinal principle of the Abolitionists; yet he ignorantly puts his authority for abolition upon the Declara- tion of Independence, wrhich was never made any part of the
public law of the United States
well known that those glittering generalities' were never adopted into the Constitution of tho United States
And what a spectacle does Mr
Lincoln present of the fathers of the Repub!ic by his absurd theory
T herc sat the representatives of thirteen slaveho}ding colonies, declaring that an men were freé and equal, and endowed by the Creator with the same rights
You say they meant their slaves
Every State then held slaves, and most of the gentlemen who were around that board themselves held them
Did those fathers, who pledged to God and to mankind their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honors, mean to cheat the human racc
Did they falsely and fraudulently utter that sentiment, and stiii hold on to their slaves as long as they lived
That IS the way you construe it
YVashington, during all his lifötime, held hun- dreds of slaves
He kept them as long as he lived, and left them to his wifiæ, with t hc provision, that after her death, they should be free—a very com- mon custom with gentlemen in onr countrv who have no immediate descendants, and from attach- rnent to their slaves are reluctant to let them pass even into the hands of collateral relatives
So strong was that sentiment, that my State was compelled to pass a law to prohibit ernancipation, or by this time a large portion of the slaves might have been free under the operation of that senti- ment
Jefferson held slaves all his lifetime, and lcft them to his heirs
Madison held them, and they went to his heirs
And thesc men are now
quoted as meaning to include their own slaves in Declaration of Independence; and seem, in Republican argument, base enough to hold on to " the sum of all villainies,' to rob freemen of their watres, and plunder them to the day of their deatl')
With your doctrines, you have the au- dacity to pretend to think well of such men
Shall we guve you credit for sincerity 
Yes, Mr
Lincoln says it is a fundamental prin- ciplc that all men arc entitled to equality in Gov- ornmont everywhere
'I'bat idea seems to be a hobby of his
Very well; you not only want to break down our constitutional rights; you not only want to upturn our social system; your people not only steal our slaves and make thenl freemen to vote against us; blit you seek to bring an race in a condition of equality, socially II and politically, with our own people
Well, silt, the question of slavery Inoves not, the people of Georgia one halt' as much as the fact that you insult their rights as a community
You Aboli- tionists are right when you say that there arc by the right; we will t.ako the Constitution; we acknowledging and protecting: onr property on the , thousands and tens of thousands of men in Georgia , ' south side of that line, for the sake of peace—per- and all over the South, who do not own slaves

blighted ruins of their fair land
We will tell you when we choose to abolish this thing; it must be done under our direction and according to our will; our own, Our native land shall determine this question, and not the Abolitionists of the North
That is the spirit of our freemen; beware of thcm
It was in this spirit of intermeddling and mis- chief that sixty-cight members of your party in the other House, and at least one member of the Senate, signed a recommendation to circulate as a campaign document an infamous publication to excite these very non-slaveholders of the South to insurrection against their follow-citizens
allude to the Helper book
'l"his Republican party sometimes say "We are not an abolition part!
" Take away their Abolitionists, and they arc 110body
They would be beaten even in New England
All Abolitionists arc Republicans, whether all Republicans are Abolitionists or not
We understand that
There may be perhaps an exception to abolition unanimity, and that is in regard to one class, an honest class—composed of the New England QI' Boston anti-slavery so- ciety, headed by Garrison
Garrison looks at it squarely and honestly
He says to these very Abolitionists of the other sort, the political Aboli- tionists, ' 'Your Government is a pro-slavcry Gov- ern ment; you take oaths and you violate thern•, II cred up to his justice
The matter is carried Still-further in States that arc more ckosely connected by friendship and good neighborhood
Even in cases of ordinary trans- gressions, which are only subjects of civil prosecution, éither with a view to the, recovery ot• dama"es, or the in- fliction of a slight civil punishment, the subjects of two neighboring States arc reciprocally obliged to appear before the Inagistrate ot• the placc where they are accused of hav- ing failed in their duty
Upon a requisition of that magis- trate, called letters rogatory, they tire summoned in due form by their own magistrates, and obiiged•to appear
An admirable institution, by means of which many neiglibor- ing States live together in peace
and see:n to foun only one republic! This is in törce through all Switzerland
As soon as the letters rogatory are issued in form, the sn- perior of the accused is bound to enforce them
it belongs not to him to examine whether the accusation be truc or false ; he is to presume on the justice of his neighbors, and not to suffer any doubts on his own part to impair an insti- tution so well calculated to preserve bannony and good understanding between the States." That is thc law of nations, as declared by one of its ablest cxpoundcrs; but, besides, we have this principle embodied in the Constitution; we have there the obligation to deliver up fugitives from justice; and, though it is in the Constitution, though it is sanctioned, as I said, by all ages and all centuries, by the wise and the good, every- where, our confederate States arc seeking false pretexts to evade plain
social duty, in which
are involved the peace and security of all civil so- ciety
If we had no Constitution, this obligation would devolve upon friendly States
If there we will not take these oaths, because we not But instead of givino• us this protection, v.re are break them." That is the difference between you met with reproaches, reviling, tricks, an(l treach- and them
One of the most able, and eloquent, cry, to conceal and protect incendiaries and mur- and well written exposés of thc position of the Garrison Abolitionists that have seen anywhere derers• This man Brown and his accomplices had sym- is to be found in a late annual report of the Massachusetts anti-slavery society; and they say I path izers
Who werc they
Onc of thern, as I I have before said, who was, according to his pub- "the Constitution isa pro-slavcry instrument
which does reco&nize slavery, and you perjure yourselves when you take oaths to support it, and break them
We cannot vote, we cannot take offce, because wc will not take oaths to break them; wo cannot vote for you, because we will not vote for Inen who will take oaths and break them." That is an authoritative exposition from this class of Abolitionists
So it seems that the Abolitionists with whom we have to deal arc so base that the honest Abolitionists themselves will not trust them
T have already adverted to the proposition in regard to giving up criminals who are charged with stealing negroes, and I have referred to the cases of Maine, New York, and Ohio
I come now to the last specification—the requirement that laws should be passed punishing all who aid and abet insurrection
These are oflinses recognized by the laws of nations as inimical to society; and I will read the opinions of an eminent pub- I said that you licist when 1 get to point
had aided and abetted insurrection
John Brown certainly invaded Virginia
Joh n Brown 's sym- pathizers, I presume, are not Democrats
'Two of the accomplices of John Brown fled—one to Ohio, one to lox,va
The Governors of both States refused to give up the fugitives from justice
The party maintained them
I am aware that, in both cases, pretexts were gotten up, to cover the shame I am gomg to show you that of the transaction
their pretexts were hollow, unsubstantial, not against constitutional law, but affainst the law of will show you that it was their duty nations
to seize them under the law of nations, and bring then-i to their confederate States, or even to a friendly State
The first aüthority I will read is If there had been Vattel on the law of nations
any well-founded ground, it the papers had been defective, if the case had been defectively stated, what was the general duty of a friendly State without any constitutional obligation
This gen- eral principlc is, that one State is bound to restrain its citizens from doing anything tending to create disturbance in another State, to foment disorder, to corrupt its citizens, or to alienate its allies
Vattel says, page 162: And since the latter [the sovereign] ought not to suil-tsr his subjects to rno\est, the uhjccts ot• other States, or to do thcnl an injury, much less to givc open, audacious offense to foreign Powers, he ought to compel the transgressor to make reparation for the dalliarre or injury, if possible, or to inflict on him an e.xe;nplai'.v punishine.nt; or, finally, ac- cording to the nature and circuinstances of the case, to dc- liver him up to the offended State, to be there brought to 'I'his is pretty generally observed iVith respect to great crimes, which are equally contrary to the laws and Assasgins, incendiaries, and robbers, safety of all nations
are seized everywhere, at the desire of the sovereign in whose territories the grime was comrnitte.d, and are deliv- lic speeches, a defender and a laudator of John Brown—is Governor of Massachusetts
Other officials of that Statc applauded Brown 's heroism, magnified his courage, and, no doubt, lamented his ill success
Throughout the whole North, public meetings, immcnse gatherinøs, triumphal processions; thc honors of (hc hero avid the con- queror, were awarded to this incendiary and as- sassin
TIN hey did not condemn the traitor; think you they abhorred the treason 
Yet, I repeat, when a distinguished Senator from a non-slaveholding Stutc "[Mr
DOUGLAS] proposed to punish such attempts at invasion and insurrection, Lincoln and his party comc before the world and say, Here is a sedition law To carry out the Constitution, to protect States from invasion and suppress insurrection, to comply with the laws of the United States, isa " sedition law," and the chief of this party treats it with contempt; yet, under the very same clause of the Constitution which warranted this in)portant bill, you derive your power to punish offenses aoainst the laws of nations
Under this warrant you have tried and punished our citizens for meditating the invasion of foreign States
You have stopped illegal expeditions
Yon have denounced our citizens as pirates, and commended them to the bloody vengeance ofa merciless enemy
Under this principle alone you 
protect our weaker neighbors of Cuba, Honduras, and Nic- aragua
By this alone are we empowered and bound to prevent our people from conspiring to- (Tether,- givincr aid, givzn• money, or arms, to fit out expeditions against any foreign nation
For- eign nations get the benefit of this protection; but we arc worse off in the Union than if we were out of it
Out of it, we should have fhc protection of the neutrality laws
Now you can come among us; raids may be made; you may put the incen- diary's torch to our dwéllings, as you did Jast summer för hundreds of miles on the frontiers of i Texas; you may do what John Brown did, and when the iniscrcants escape to your States, you will not punish them; vou will not deliver them up
Therefore we stand defenseless
We must I cut loose from the accursed body of this death," even to get the benefit of the law of nations
Hence we are armed, and hence we will stay so, until our rights are respected, and justice is done
We must take up arms to get the rights that the laws II of nations give us, Mr

We have -never sought to intérfere with cussion of any questions in ...your own country
The standing laws of ny own State only punish the words and acts that are intended .to incite in- surrection among any class of people
But you write, and speak, and form societies, and claim the right to become a nest of incendiaries, in order
to assail your neighbors; and you say you have the right to do it under the liberty of speech- güaran- tied by the Constitution
I Will not interfere with your rights, but you must so use them as not to injure us
You will not regard confederate obligations; you will not regard constitutional obligati0*is; you will not regal'd your oaths
What, then, am 1 to do
Am I a freeman
Is my State, a free State, to lie down and submit because politicatt fossils raise the cry of the glorious Union
Too iong already have we listened to this ,delusive song

We have wrongsÅ have recounted 1 have demonstrated that the party now them
into power has declared us outlaws, and is determined to exclude four thousand million of our property from the common Territories; that it has declared us under the ban of the Em- Pire, and out of the protection of the laws of the United States everywhere
They have re- fused to protect us frorn invasion and insurrection by the Federal Power, and the Constitution- de- rncs to us in the Union the •right either to raise fleets or armies for our own defense

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr
COBB
'I'hc second time in my life I feel Now, I '*vant to say that I happen not to be one of those in that dispatch mentioned
While I represent the State of Alabama in part—a humble representative though I may be—and whilst it is rarely that I am consultcd in relation to what the policy of Alabama should be, yet I represent people who, I think, are capable of speaking for themselves; and while I know their wishes, un- less they come in conflict with what I believe to be my constitutional duty, I shall endeavor to carry them out
Mr
HOUSTON
Will my colleague euow me a word in this connection
I understand that the consultation to which the telegraph refers, was a consultation upon the part of Senators alone; that no member of this House from any of those States was in the caucus, if indeed, there was any, and they had nothing to do with it
The meeting, if I understand it correctly from rumor, was a meeting for consultation among the Senators from a few of the southern States
No- bod else had anything to do with it
COBB
That was their privilege; but 1 did not happen to be with them
It is well known I trust 10 that I send no telegraphic dispatches
the wisdom, discretion, and ability df my con- stituents to direct the policy of Alabama accord- ino• to their own wishes; and I am always satis- fied that those wishes will reflect what believe to be the true policy of the country
This House, and you, Mr
Speaker, are well aware that I havc labored diligently ever since the commencement of this session of' Congress to heal, if possible, the difficulties which distract the two sections of the country
God knows my heart, and He knows my prayers are continually for the* restor- ation and continuance of harmony in this coun- try; that the stars and stripes which have so often floated in victory over our enemies, and which have floated over us in peace, shali still continuc to be our protection as long as we can remain united as equals
This Congress rnay decide the basis upon which we are to stand
A majority of the people of Alabama believe th.at they •will not i.)C permitted to reniain as equals in this Con- federacy; and I, as one of the Representatives of the State of Atabarna, am anxious to asccrtain 1 one of her Repre whether we can or not
sentativcs who have all along beticved that a con- sulcation shou}d be had by th-p southern States, to arrive at a detcnnination of what the South in- tend to demand; or, to use more respcctful terms, what they will ask shall be granted to them as rights which they are clearly entitled to
I, for one, was in favor of waitincr until the committee ot- tlfirty-threc should determine what policy they should pursue
I will say, in all frankness, that I havc very little hope in what they will do
True, I have met several gentlemen within the last four or five days who, to use their own languaere, said they felt itin their bones that something would be done to quiet this distracted country
i wish [ could If 1 could feel in n') y bones that it would be SD
I would, departing fronl my usual custom, telc- graph to noy couniry that a star had begun to rise that, in all probability, would illut-ninute the dark und clouded minds of a portion of OUi' country, and that peace would reio•n and justice be admin- compelled to make an uppeal to the, I-.lousc• would ask allow me a few mmnenl,s to make a personal istm•ed to the whole land

Speaker, as a fair-minded man— as I believe you arc disposed to be, and I trust I shall never have occasion to think otherwise—in your State do you not recollect that there were other questions brought into this controversy be- I call upon the Penn- sides the necrro question

what may or may not be "necessary for the ex- planation
Mr; HOUSTON
If 1 can get my colleague's ear, I will appeal to him, under the circumstances, • the point of order having becn made upon him, to let his explanation be of a personal character, or abandon the floor and let other gentlemen oc- cu it
Wr
COBB
I am very much obliged to my worthy colleague; but I must be governed in this matter by my own sense of duty
Mr
HOUSTON
I desire to present this view to my colleague
He obtained the permission of the Housc to make a personal explanation
The point of order is made that his debate is general, and not persdnal; and the Speaker says that my colleague, having obtained the consent of the House, has a right to go on
That, in my opin- ion, is opening the door very wide on the part of the Speaker; and, under his deciéion, great abuses may be made in the shape of personal explana- tions
A personal explanation ought to be some- thing that relates to the person or conduct of the member making the explanation
It occurs to me that, if the ruling of the Chair is the proper law of the House, all I have to do at any time.is to ask leave to make a personal explanation—which is seldom, if ever, refused—and when I get that per- mission, I can, Linder the decision of the Chair, on and make a speech on anything and every- I think, for the sake of the thing that I see fit
dispatch of the business of the House, that the Speaker ought to rule what the law of common sense is, gnd not permit a member, under the permission of the House to do one thing, to do everything
The SPEAKER
The Chair has very great difficulty in deciding how much it may be neces- sary to say in the way of personal explanation
It would be impossible, in a great many cases, to do it
-We must submit ourselves to the judg- ment of the member; and I tt•üst the gentleman from Alabama will restrict himself to what he deems necessary to his personal explanation
Mr
COBB
After the sage advicc given to me by my distinguished colleague and others, and particularly by the Speaker, I shall endeavor to confine myself, as nearly as possible, to what'l intend to be personal explanation
I have a dif- pevhaps, •of arriving at conclu- ferent manner, sions than other gentlemen have, and I cannot -reach them as suddenly as gentlemen who are I am sometimes, more in the habit of speaking
therefore, obliged to take a little latitude, in order to bring the application of my remark& to the question I am discussino•
I was goincr on to say, sir, that I did not regacd the slavery question as having been settled by the majority at the late presidential election; and I was endeavoring to call upon the Republicans, as patriots and men who love their country, to do what they say they cannot do because the 1 say that the people have decided the question
tariff question entered into the controversy at the last election; I say that the internal improvement question entered into that controversy; I say the homestead question entered int.o that contest; I say thc Pacific railroad question entered inio that contest; and I am ashamed to acknowledge that a question •entered into that contest in relation to I made the corruptions of the Administration
no charges of corruption; on the contrary, I en- deavored to defend the Administration; but I heard Democrats, who ought to have refrain6d from such things, charging the Administration with being corrupt
I did not bclicve thc charge; but it is a well-known fact that it had its effect upon the mind of the country
They said that corruption stalked abroad, and •that
it ought to be put a stop to
I denied it; but that had some- tlnng to do with the decision of the contest
I now come to a personal explanation as to what my people want; what they expect of their representatives; and what they are going to de- mand
I know they are making ho preparation to receive any proposition; but I am satisfied that if the House and Senate would do what is right, 18 THÜRSDAY, JANUARY 10, 1861
they would stay their movements.until such time R as the country could act upon the questions which now agitate the Union
My people say they have rights in the Territories; and I say they have
'l'hey say those rights must be recognized, or cisc we cannot remain together in this Govern- ment
That is onc of the issues
They say that we have rights of property' in slaves; and the North denies that we have any property in slaves
That is a question that must be settled
- , We hold that it was settled in thc organization of this Government
hold that the Constitution has settled it
We hold that the decision of the Su- preme Court has been, that property does exist m slaves
The right of property in slaves was recognized in the treaty of peace between Great Britain and this country, in 1782, by John Adams and other distinguished northern rnen who, lap- prehcnd, had as much knowledge of what con- stituted property as their descendants have to- day
restate the following: That slaves are property, and regarded as such by the Constitution, has been detenn ined by the highest authority, by every departinent of our Governnnent, and the great rnass of' the pronuinent statesrnen of our country
'I'he Supretne Court ot• t.he United States has decided that the Constitution Inakes no distinction between slaves and other property, and pledges the
Governrne.nt to protect 'I'his settled no new principle

if, according to the American system of arc recognized as property,: it comes with_in the constitu- tional guarantee, and the, Federal Government is bound to protect it the same as other property, wherever it has juris- diction

If the South have a constitutional right that slave property, the same as all othet property, shouldbe protected within the scope of the juris- diction of the Federal Government, and the

The SPEAKER
anyobject.ion to the consideration of the resolution at this time 
Mr
LOVEJOY
Is there any report accom- panying the resolution
Mr
BINGHAM
There is not; but 1 will explain it
Mr
LOVEJOY
1 seems that we ought ' to have a report before we ure asked to puss the joint resolution
Mr
BINGHAM
1 will state why is no In the first place, this case was fully report
considered by the Comptroller of the United States Treasury, Mr
Elisha Whittlesey
Mr
LOVEJOY
Mr
BINGHAM
In 1851
I have the whole report here, and it will fully explain this case
: i He states, among other things, that there are no taxable fees allowed to attorneys in the supreme court of Louisiana, their compensation not bcin-g taxable fees or costs, but quantum mei•uit, or such, sum as may be agreed on between clients and their attorney'
The rule heretofore adopted has been, as members well know, to fix the fees of the district attorneys of the United States ac- cording to the table of fees in the supreme court of the State in which they reside
There being no system of taxation of fees in the State of Lou- isiana—no rule by which to determine the com- pensation of this offcer, Mr
Elisha Whittlesey thereupon proceeds to say The laws now in force do not provide any compensa- tion for the services rendered, except five dollars per diem for attendarrce in court, anb the small salary, which are en- tirely inadequate for such services
The suits were of great importance, ditücult to
mana«e, and required high profes- sional attainments and ability, and much time and atten: tion
Being paid a small salary and a per diem for his at- tendance in court, Mr
Hunton has no legal ciaiiti on the Govermnent tor any greater compensation than the law prescribes and provides tor them ; but such compensation being entirely inadequate, and below the real value of the services, less than is paid in nearly all Lbc districts where there arc some taxable fees under the State laws, and less than was contemplated by Congress at the tune, of passing the act to il(hait Louisiana into the Union, April e, 1812, Mr
Hunton has an equitable claim on the Government for a reasonable cmnpensation for his services." Mr
BRANCH
Is this resolution before the House
I cannot hear what the honorable gen- tieman from Ohio is saying, there is so much con- fusion in the House
Mr
BINGHAM
If the gentleman will hear read what the Comptroller of the Treasury says upon this case, 1 am sure ho will' not object io the passage of this joint resolution
Let the Clerk road the passages I have marked in the offcial report of Mr
Elisha Whittlesey
Mr
BRANCH
I believe that it is not in order to put anything upon its passage at this time ex- 1 cept by the unanimous consent of thc House
think, therefore, that we had better go on under the rule, and let this resolution take the same course wit.h like resolu tions and bill-s
Mr
MALLORY
I hope the gentleman from North Carolina will withdraw his objection
This casc has been a long time before the House, and it is one of peculiar merit
Mr
BINGHAM
If the I-louse will the Comptroller's report to be read, I am sure all objection to this casc will be withdrawn
Mr
BRANCH
1 will not the wishes of all of my friends
If it bc the desire of the House to pass resolutions in this way, i 'Will not object
Mr
SHERMAN
As there seems to be adis- position to pass private bills without due consid- cration, I move that the rules be suspended, and the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union

LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION BILL
Mr
SHERMAN
I mpve, pending the•motion to go into committee, that •all generäl debate on the executive, legislative, and judicial appropria- tion bill in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union be determined within ten min- utes after its consideration shall be resumed
The motion was agreed to
LOGAN HUNTON—AGAIN
Mr
BINGHAM
1 ask the unanimous con- sent of the House, to move that, the joint reso- lution for the relief of Logan Hunton, of New Orleans, be ordered to be printed
There was no objection, and it was so ordered, LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION BILL—AGAIN
The question was then taken on Mr
SHER- MAN'S motion; and it was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
ETHERIDGE in the chair.) The CHAIRMAN stated chat the bill before the committee was House bill No
892, making appropriations for the legislative, executive, and judicial expenses of the Government for the year ending June 30, 1862; and that the pending ques- tion was on striking out the words " for station- ery, $12,000." On that amendment tellers were ordered
Mr
SHERMAN
That amendment, pre- sume, was moved by the gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr
LEACH,] to test whether a quorurn I hope he will withdraw it
was present
Mr
Carolina
Iwithdrawit
The Clerk proceeded with the reading of the For Congressional Globe, and binding the same, $49,300
Mr
QU ARLES
i move to reduce that appro- priation to $32,000
I do so for this reason: the appropriation here is the same amount as that which wus estimated; $32,000 was the amount provided in the bill for the last session, for these same services
It may be surgested that this sum of $49,300 is proper for the next session, because it ig the long session; but, by referring to the last bill, it will be seen that the amount for binding, &c., is the same for a tong as for a short session
I' cannot see what else enters into the cost of the Congressional Globe
I see the appropriation for binding is $50,000; and it was the same last year
T hc printino• is the same this year as it was last year
Now, what else can enter into the cost of the Congressional Globe
Nothing in the world ; and I propose to reduce the amount for the Globe and binding $17,300, which is the excess of ex- penses for the next session of Congress ('ver the present
Mr
SHERMAN
Tho gentleman from Ten- nessee labors und€ra misapprehension
The ad- (litional appropriation for reporting arises from the fact that the Globe extends over a greater number of pages during a
long session tltan a short one
Mr
QU ARLES
Last year wore ap- propriated for reporting; and tlus year it is pro- posed to appropnate $18,000
The amendment was not agreed to
Mr
LEACH, of North Carolina, moved to amend by striking out line sixty-two, as follows: For n)iscellaneoug items, $20,000." The amendment was not agreed to
The following clause being under considerat tion— For compensation and mileage of members of
the House of Representatives and Delegates from Territories, Mr
of North Carolina, said: I move t.o reduce the
amoLU)t to $550,000
I make this motion because, at the first session of the present Congress, I introduced a bill for the reduction of the pay and mileage of the members of Congress
I introduced that bill in good faith; and I believe that, if it could be brought to a vote of the House, it would pass; and if it shall pass, it will reduce the mileage and pay of members one half—the reduction that my amendment proposes
It ought to be adopted
The fearful condition of the coun- try; the bankruptcy of the Treasury; the finan- Cial crisis that
is upon us; considerationsof justice and economy, all require it; and if not adopted, I want the country to understand that at this ses- Sion we are borrowing money at kvelve per cent
interest to pay the compensation and mileage of members of Congress, and the interest on the public debt
believe retrenchment and reform ought to begin there; and then the people of the country would have some hope and confidence that Congress would cut down the e*penses of the Government in all its departments
It ought to be done; and I trust it wili be done
There is a bill before the House introduced by me for that purpose; and if it can bc brought to a •vote, I be- lieve that reform, beginning at the right place, rnay be brought about
The cost of printing has already bccn reduced forty per cent
, and a reduc- tion ought to be made in this matter
The esti- mate for the prcsent year is Last year it was $615,250
There was also, last year, an unexpended bal*nce of $93,000, which may be applied to the next year, as I understand it
There is, then, it appears, a difference of some four or five hundred thousand dollars between the estimate of last year and the present
Mr
SHERMAN
The difference is easily ex- plained
Under the new law, the money which becomes due to members durino• vacation is
paid the next December; and the con- sequence is, that one year the amount is much larger than it is the other
Next December we receive nine months ' pay; and consequently, dur- ing the next fiscal year, a larger amount of com- pensation is paid to members than during thé present fiscal year
Mr
McKN IGHT
Iam opposed to theamend- inent offered by the gentleman from North Caro- lina, because members of Congress are elected with an understanding of what is to be their com- pensation
But, at the Same time, I believe a good deal is paid to or received by members which they are not legally entitled to; and, if, when we reach those items, such as appropriations for newspapers, stationery, &c., which every man ought to pay for himself, the gentleman will move to strike them out, I will coöperate with him in those reforms
W c are allowed a com- pensation of $3,000 per annum, ahd a certain amount of mileage
I am in favor of reducin& the mileage to three or four cents a mile, and will so vote whenever I have an opportunity
The amendment was not agreed to
Mr
MOORE, of Kentucky
1 move to out of lines sixty-eight and sixty-nine the words, Clerk of the House of Represeß tatives, $3,600
I enter the list of reformers in this H.ouse with great diffidence
My •experience here does not give me that information which is necessary to enable me to discharge my duties in all respects, so far as reforming the expenses of this House are concerned; but what I see here I think I know
So far as the Clerk of the House of Representa- tives is concerned, I only know him in an omcial character by the Journals of this House
licve have had the pleasure of seeing the Clerk in this House once, performing the grateful duty of reading to the House the message of the Pres- ident, ',vhich was •,vell done; but the duties of the Clerk of the House of Representatives are not performed by the officer whom we elected
Those who have anything to do with the Clerk's offce know that its duties are performed by the polite and gentlemanly assistant clerk, Mr
Hayes, who performs all the duties of Clerk
I do not, there

words,] Mes- senxer in charge of the söubh' wing oftlie Capitol* $1,500
" [understand that there is ho ser,viee'what••• ever to be performed by that tnesseiger
There are two different persons clßiming the 'right to take charge of that portion of the Capitol, while thére is no service for either
If I am eori•ect.ly informed, by a resolution of the Thirty-Fourth Congress a messenger was appointed to take charge of a cer- tain room—the room of the Committee on Agt•icul- tur.e
That was
before the Hall of the -pÉesent House was occupied; and that gentleman claims to hold that offee to-day at a salary of $1,500 a year, although- the main chai•ge of -the romn is committed to laborers Who recei€e a'compensatiqn of $1 50 pet• day
I am satiSfied that ibere is no necessity for the services ofa perSon •tb take' charge of that room, as ghere are no duties: for, him, to perform
I hope the appropriation will be stricken out
The Doorkeeper has likewise the power to appoint a messenger for the same place; and he has a suffcient number of messel)gers under his chage to discharge all theduties (it any.) that can devolve upon this messenger
The messenger provided for in the appropriation is a very clever gentleman, placed there at the instance of another gentleman for whom I have great respect; and I am satisfied this fact induced some gentlemen to support a similar appropriation last session
I hope, however, this needless approprigtion will not again be made
The amendment was agreed to
Mr
QU ARLES
I see in these appropriatioas for the clerks and messengers of the House an ap- propriation for a messenger to the Postmaster of the House
i do not see that any estimate was submitted to us for the services of this messen- ger
The Postmaster of the House has no mes- senger
Mr
SHERMAN
The Committee of ways and Means called the offcer a messenger in- stead of " assistant Postmaster." Mr
QUARLES
It is all right, then
Mr
LEACH, of North Carolina, moved to strike
out lines one hundred and five to one hun- dred and ninc inclusive, as follows: For twenty-four copies of the Congressional Globe and Appendix for each rnmuher and delegate of the first see$on of the Thirty-Seventh Congress,' and one hundred of the same for the House Library, $39,688." The amendment was not agreed to
Mr
QU ARLES
I move to strike out lines one hundred and ten to one hundred and thirteen inclusive, as follows: For the compensation of the draughtsman and clerks employed upon land maps, clerks to-committces, and tem- porary clerks in the oflice of the Clerk of the -House Of-Rep- resentatives, $17,800
I understand there is no use fgr these draughts- men find clerks ernployed on these land maps; that the expenditure is entirely useless; (liat no use is Inade of those maps in the House of Rep- resentatives
This approprituion ought not to be made; and the services should be dispensed with
Mr
SHERMAN
I will say to the gentleman that there must have been a mistake in printing the bill; for the Committee of Ways and Means excluded the land-map clerks
I move to amend the original clause which the gentleman moves to strike out, by striking out the words " draughts- man and clerks employed upon the land maps." Mr
QUARLES
Then the gentleman from Ohio wants to leave in the whole ainount of ap- propriation, when there are no men to whom it to be paid
His amendment does not lessen the amount of appropriation at all
Mr
SHERMAN
Mr.' Chairman, 1 thought I explained to the gentleman that the Committee of Ways and Means did not allow anything for these land-map clerks
The amount estimatod for was $23,984
We struck out the land-map clerks, and reduced the appropriation to $17,800

-MI hat is now pro-• pose( is no deficiency at all, and for this reason: the act 26th August, 1842, which directed the Means, bow man v carriao•cs arid saddle-horses publication of thc results of the exploring expe- put that publication completely wiibin the dition , are purchased fün• the use of the Enembers of the control of the Joint Committee on the Library
I-_louso of Representatives, and for what purpose As a consequence of that, and makinæ use of tliC they are used powrcrs to that committee, they entered Mr
SHERMAN
heard this matter into various contracts writh authors and •artists, explained at every session of Congress since i havc been here
The horses are not for the inenl- the to be paid to each ot• whon"l was to That is to be a very large which will be peculiarly liable to abuses; and I think that the very bcst security we can take against abuses in that establishment, will be to insist, at the very outset, on the strictest respons• ibility on the part of all those connected with it; and that Congress Shan have the means of
judg- ing whether the money appropriated by law has been judicioUs)y and properly expended
The item in this appropriation bill IS, I presume, to be expended by the Government printing offce
We find here—and I make no complaint of the chair
man of the Committee of Ways and Means for it—that the whole appropriation for printing— put in in a lump, without any items or details at all as to the manner in which the money is to be used
I have—no doubt that the Committee of Ways and Means have examined that matter, and know that the money is to be properly used
•But think that, if we require the Superintendent of Printing hereafter to tell us in advance the particular items for which the money will be required, we will have taken one of the very best securities that we can take against abuses in the Government printing office
The amendment was agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
1 am directed by the Com- mittee of Ways and Means to offer the following amendment, to come in after line two hundred and eighty-three: For blank books, binding, omce furniture, carpettng, two daily newspapers published in the city of Washington, files and papers, bounty land service, and miscellaneous items, $1,000
The amendment was agreed to
Mr
MAYNARD
I propose to amend, by striking out the following clause in the bill: For additional clerks in the General Land Office, under the act of 3d March, 1855, gtttnting bounty land, and for Ia- borers ernployed therein, $58,400 : Pro-vided, 'I'hat the Sec- retarv of the Interior, at his discretion, shall be, aud he ig hereby, authorized to use any portion of said appropt•iatio:; for piece work, or by the day, weék, Inonth, or year, at such rate or ratcs as he may deem just and iäit." This is a special appropriation, providing for operations in the- Land Ofiice occasioned by the bounty land act of 1855, granting bounty lands to the old soldiers
The business arising under that law-*has, in a great measure, been completed; and I understand that there are in the Land Offce a great many more clerks than there is business for
I have understood, for example, that some of the clerks have only for their daily labor to fill up the blanks in twenty-five land patents that are laid on their desk, and then taken away—an amount of labor which any ordinary scrivener could per- orm in less than an hour
It is the same •in the other Departments of the Government
There are in all the Departments many more clerical employés than are necessary
They are merely a burden on the public 'l'rcas- ury
The clerks for whom this clause provides payment are so maniftstly urinecessary that I am opposed to having an appropriation madc for their further continuancc in offce
The omission of this i(cm will be a sufficiently significant expros- Sion of opinion on the part of Congress to the Secretary of the Interior, that
he should discharge that portion of the clerical force of his l)epart- therefore hope that it will be struck out, mcnt
and then we will not, of course, have an estimate made fbt• it again
Mr
SHERMAN
The clerical force of this Department has been very much reduced within depend on estiunatcs, to be afterwards made by the last year or two

and I think that if we wcrc to act in the dark and reduce the clerical force of the Departments, with- out full information on the subject, we might do I trust, there- great injury to the public service- fore, that the original appropriation will be Inade
We must depend, to some extent, on the discre- tiDn of these executive officers
The question was taken on Mr
MAYNARD'S amendment; arid it was not agreed to
 1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
Mr
MAYNARD
.1 would inquire of the chair- man of the 'Committee -of •Ways and -Means whether there has been any reduction •of clerical f'm•cc in the Pension Office
We know, as a mat- ter of fact,
that the business of that offce has been reduced one half or three fourths within the last two years
Mr
SHERMAN, 1 am happy to say that the appropriatidn for that offce is about $27,000 less than that of last year
There is, therefore, a decrease
Mr
MAYNARD
That is about twenty-five per cent
diminution
Is the chairman of ffe Committee of Ways and Means satisfied that this is as great a reduction as can be made consist- ently With the public service 
Mr
SHERMAN
I suppose it is
It has been made by the transfer of clerks from that bureau to otheu• bureaus, where their services seemed to be indispensably necessary
I move the followino• amendmen t, to comc in after the word warrants," in line three huncrred and seventy-six And for contingent expenses, under act of 3d March, 1855, granting bounty lands, and amendatory act of 4th May, 1856, {Or patents and other records, stationery, and miscellaneous items on account of bognty•land under said act
The amendment was agreed to
Mr
VANDEVER
loffet•thefollowingamcnd- ment, to come in after the clause: For compensation of the surveyor general of Kansas and Nebraska, and the clerks in his oflic'e, $8,300 : Provided, 'I'hat from and alter Ju— 30, 1861, the surveyor generaPs ofhcc for Kansas and Néfraska shali be discontinued ; that the office of the surveyor
generat of Wisconsin and Iowa shall be removed fronil)ubuque to Sioux city, in the State of Iowa ; and that Kansas and Nebraska shall be added to the district now cornposed of Wisconsin and Iowa and thO Territory of Minnesota, commonly called Dakota; which, together, shall -hereatter connpose one surveying district; the surveyor generat for which shall receive the saine cmnpcnsation heretotöre allowed surveyors-generak tor either of said districts ; and so much of the money as is herein appropriated for clerks, fuel, books, stationery, and other incidental expenses of the said surveyor generaPs offccs, as they have heretotöre existed, as Inay be neces- sary, be and the same is hereby appropriated for tllé' re- moval of the books and records to the new surveyor gen- eral's office at Sioux (.N*ity, and tor tbe support thereof: .Hnd provided further, That Wisconsin shall be added to the surveyor general of Minnesota
This amendment, Mr
Chairman, will have the effect ofdiscon tin uing one of the offces of surveyor general; making one offce less, and consequently reducing the cost of the service
At present, Min- ncsota is a surveying district by itself
The sur- veys in Iowa are nearly completed; and we are in- formed by the Commissioner of the General Land Offce that, in the course of a year or twö,• all the records will be ready to be handed over to the Generat Land Office
I have on my desk a letter from the Commissioner of the General Land OMce, stating that the office in Iowa cannot, for the pres- eut, be discontinued without detriment to the pub- It simply proposes, for the present lic service
time, to add that to Kansas and Nebraska, and to remove the office to Sioux City, on the Mis- souri river, contiguous to the lands Of Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota, and Iowa—the western part of that State near the Missouri river embracirv almost all of the unsurveyed lands within the limits of the State
My amendment will reduce the, amount necessary to be appropriated
This matter was referred to the Committee on Public Lands, by a resolution introduced into this House from the Committec of Ways and that resolution, applied for information to the De- partment of the Interior, or rather to the Com- missioner of the General Land Offce
I have here several letters in response to the inquiries of thc Committee on Public Lands
The substance of thcm is to the effect that the surveyor general 's offcc in Iowa cannot at present be dispensed with without serious detriment to the public service
It is recommended that thc consolidation proposed shall be made, and that Iowa shall be added to It is recommended that Kansas, the district
Nebraska, Dakota, and Iowa, compose one dis- trict
The proposition to remove the
surveyor general's offce to Sioux City is included in the amendment at my own instance
Mr
MAYNARD
Let the letters you have be Mr
VANDEVER
Here they are
The Clerk read, as follows: GENERAL LAND OFFICE, December 27, 1860
Slit: The resolution adopted in the Hduseof Represent- atives on the 19th, and filed in this office by you on the 21st instant, inquires, whether any of the offees of the surveyors genera} can be discontinued without detriment to the public service." I have, thereforej .Lhe honor to re- 'I'hat the first section of an act, approved June 12, 1840, For the discontinuance of the omee of surveyor general in the several districts," &c., (Statutes at Large, vol
5, page
384, and amcndatory act of January 22, 1853, vol
10, page 152,) confer sufficient authority for the disconånuance of surveyors general offices ; and, pursuant to the same, the following offices have been closed: For the surveying district of Mississippi, in 1849 Alabama, in 1850 ; north- west of the Ohio, in 1857 ; and of Arkansas, in 1859
'That there exist at' the present time eleven different offices of surveyors general in operation, to -wit : l
At St
Louis, Missouri, for the surveying district of Illinois and Missouri
2
At Donaldsonville, Louisiana, for the surveying dis- trict of Louisiana, both of which arc in contemplation •of being discontinued at an early period
3
At St
Augustine, Florida, for the surveying district of Florida
4
At Dubuque, Iowa, for the surveying district of Wis- •consin and Iowa, and the 'I'erritoi•y of Minnesota, com- monly•known as Dakota
5
At St
Paul, Minnesota, for the surveying district of Minnesota
6
At Nebraska City, Nebraska Territory, for the sur- veying district of Kansas and Nebraska
7
At Santa Fé, New Mexico, for the surveying district of New Mexico
8
At San Francisco, California, for the surveying dis- trict of California
9
At Eugene City, Oregon, for the -surveying district of Oregon
10
At Olympia, Washington Territ.ory, for the survcy- ing district of VVashington 'I'erritory; and II
At Salt Lake City, Utah 'Cerritory,lör the surveying dist.rict of Utah Tcrritory
The
foregoing oflices of the surveyors general, numbered 3 to II, both inclusive, cannot, in the opinion of this office, bc discontinued within the present, or perhaps • next fiscal year, without detriment to the public service under the provisions of the acts of Congress above mentioned, {Orthe reason that these laws contemplate the colnpletion of the surveys in a wholc district bcforc Winding up ; and this ha-s not been done in toto in these districts
It will be observed, however, that No
4 is a surveying district, consisting of, first..State of' Iowa ; second, State of Wisconsin ; third,' Minnesota, or Dakota, 'l'erritory
The surveys in .[owtL are cornpleted ; yet there is a large amount of office-work, rcquiring, perhaps, a couple years 10 complete, which Inust be done befOrc the surveying archives can be transferred to thc State authorities
Congress should confer power upon •the Deparuncnt för consolidation ot• surveying distrlcts, or annexing to others, contailiing also authority tor t.ransfer ot• location of surveyors general onicgs, in cases of such consolidation, then bhe Iowa portion of district No
4 could be attached to, say, the Kansas and Nebraska district omce, now at NC- braska City, and Dakota to Minnesot.a, leaving, if deemed proper, Wisconsin as a separate district

Hon
W
VANDEVER,Of Conunittee on Public Lands, United States House of Representatives
Mr
COBB
Let me exactly understand this proposition moved by the gentleman from Iowa
As I understand, he moves that the surveyor general 's officc shall be removed from the place where it now is, that is, from Nebraska City, to Sioux City
Mr
VANDEVER
1 merely propose to add Dakota and Iowa to the district of Kansas arid Nebraska, and to remove the 0Mce to Sioux City
Mr
COBB
There is no motion, then, to abol- ish the surveyor general's office in Iowa
It is proposed to add Iowa to the Kansas district
Now, sir, the public lands in Iowa have all, or nearly all, been surveyed, while the public lands in Kansas, Nebraska, and Dakota have not been surveyed
Yet the gentleman from Iowa boldly offers in this House_.a proposition to remove the surveyor general 's offce from Nebraska City to Sioux City; to remÖve it from Nebraska Terri- tory into the Statc of Iowa
He proposes, in other words, to, remove that office from the Ter- ritories, where the lands arc not yet surveyed, to a State where they are ali survcyed
Do not gentlemen, at the mcu•c statement of the proposi- tion, at once perceiVe its injustice with regard to Kansas, Nébi•ask4," a-rid: 'Dakotå

I •forget, this momVüt, where it is located.- Mr.
ALDRICH
It is located Dubuqü€.: Mr
COBB
•It is recommended that-tlfat at Dubuque shall be abolished
I do not see -why it should be abolished
it is not only not pro• posed to abolish that offee, but it.ris even moved by the gentleman from •Iowa, that
the shall be removed from Nebraska to Sioux City, in that State; thus compelling (he people of the Territories to travel five or seven hundred .miles further than they now have to do
As I have already -..stated, it is proposéd toh'erfiove.thé omce• from the Territories where-the* landÉ 'are net' sur- veyed, to where they are nearly ail' surveyed
There is no justice in the proposition
Why; theii, should we do this acknowledged injustice to Territories of Kansas, Nebraska, 'and DakOtå
Let the offce remain where it ought to be, -in the Territories where the lands remain to be sut€eyed
Mr
VANDEVER
lean, ation, remove the objection of the gentleman from Alabama
Even admitting all the Of thé gentleman to be correct, I do not see that the injustice would be so glaring as the gentleman suggests it would
It would not be so glaring even if the instructions for surveying the-public lands in any of these Territories were• required to emanate from Washington .city, or from any point inside or outside of the States
In the ress of things, these surveys will continue but u few years longer
It is a matterof-' comparatively little importance to the people in the Territories where the office of the surveyorgeneral may be located
The people at large have -lit!leor no busi- ness to do with the surveyor generaPs oMce
'I'hcy do not have any business with it until the completion of the surveys, and- the records aré handed over to the Statc authorities
The.gen- tleman from Alabama knows that
even to-day the most of the information sought for from the va- rious surveying districts
is sought for in the oity of Washington
The most of tlié dcsired is procured from the Generål La-nd Offce in this city
The surveyors of the United States are not authorized to enter into general corre- I spondence with the people of their land districts
is proper that thcy should not, and that the in- formation should be sought for at the General Land Oflice
Another thing: here is a vast body of unsur- veyed land within the limits of Dakota
Settlers arc crowding into that Territory; and if the gen- tleman 's argument bc a good one, the people df that Territory may justly complain that this offce is now so far off upon the Missouri river
Sioux City, however, is a central poin_t
Missoui•i -"J river divides Iowa from the, opposite
Territory, andGi does not matter whether this offce is upon the one or the other bank of the 'river
Sioux City is the terminus ofa railway Which Will soon be completed and in operation
It is easy of ac- cess from all points on the Missouri river
a safe as well as a proper placc to serve as the depository for the records of surveys
place where deputy surveyors may speedily receive their supplies to fit them for the field
I It is recommended by the offer the amcndment
Secretary of the Interior, as well a-s by the Com- missioner of the General Land Offce
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman's time has expired
Mr
COBB
I was not aware before that the gentleman's speech was being made in my time
I will respond to what he has said
It is not only the people at large who are interested; but the surveyors themselves, who contract to do the surveying, are also interested
Suppose man takes a contract to survey Dakota: is it fair-to compel him to go all the way to Sioux City, in the State of Iowa
I do not myself perceive the Feast I necessity for establishing this.surveyor general's office at Sioux City, when ali the lands:io Iowa havc been surveyed; iv.hen, sir, no lands ere left for survey
The question was taken; and tho amendment was rejected
 278 THE CONGRESSIONAL' GLOBE
January 7, The Clerk proceeded with *the reading of the Mr
BRANCH
I presume that the appropri- ations made in
this bill for the public printing are with a view-to its being executed in the Govern- ment printing offce 
Mt
SHERMAN
Such is the law
The Clerk read, as follows: For
paper and printing of the Executive Departments, including the paper, printing, and binding the Biennial Register and the annual statement of commerce Ond navi- gation,- and •the• paper and printing of the annual estilnates of appropriations, $55,000." Mr
PETTIT
I move to amend that para- graph by adding the following: Protided
That the preparation of the said Register shall be made under the direction of the Secretary of the In- terior
Formerly, sir, this work was prepared by the Secretary of State
It was when the Federal com- missions were countersigned by him, and issued under the seal then in his offcc
At this time this duty morc properly belongs to the Depart- ment of the Interior
Mr
N I BLACK
Is it not the law nour that it shall be prepared in the Department of thc In- terior
Mr
PETTIT
It is not the law
It was ommended at the last session by the Assistant Secretary of State
It is proposed in a bill now pending in the Senate; but
with a view to reach the matter at once, I have moved 'the amendment now before •the committee
The question Was taken; and the amcndmcnt was agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
move -to amend, by in- zerting the f0110'.virp: For contingent expenscs to reimburse Wilson Shannon, while acting Governor of the rrerritory of Kansas, $156
T hc amendment was agreed to
Mr
PORTER
1• move the following amend- ment: For providing proper furniture for Ehe new court-house and post office at Indianapolis, Indiana, $5,000
Mr
MAYNARD
Is that amendment in order
Mr
PORTER
The Government has nearly completed this public building in Indianapolis, and this furniture is necessary in order to allow of its beino• occupied
Mr
BRÄNÖH
I raise the point of order, if nobody else does
Mr
PORTER
If we do not appropriate this money, this building will not be in a condition to be occqpied for the purposes of a court-house and a post offce, for which it was designed
While $120,000 has been appropriated for the erection of this building, no appropriation has yet been made for supplying it with the necessary furni- I hold that tlNs amendment is not out of ture
It is within the spirit of the rule of the House, which is as follows: No appropriation sliüll be reported in such general ap- propriation bills, or be in order as an amendment thereto, för any expenditure not previously authorized by law, un- less in continuation ot• appropriations 'Or such public works and objects as are already in pro$ess, and the contin- gencies for carrying on the several deparunents of the Gov- enunent." This amendment must bc considered as provid- inz for the completion ofa work now in progress of construction
It' this furniture be not provided, the building cannot be used for the pui•poses for which it was designed
I hold the amendment is in order
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order raised by the gentleman from r l'en- nessee, and rules the amendment out of order
VI r
MAYNARD
There' is some information sometimes to be derived from the consideration of these appropriation bills, and a sort of informa- tion, too, very acceptable to the people, who want to know where the money of this Government goes to
On this 33d page of the bill provision made for the compensation of some thirty sub- ordinates around the person of the President, and among them I find that there are twenty-two la- borers employed in the President's grounds and gard on
Here is also a furnace keeper at a salary of $600 a year
Those of us who do not know any better, would suppose that those laborers would be employed principally during the warm season of the year, when they could work in the garden, and the furnace keeper only in the winter season when fires are necessary
It occurs to me, that out of these twenty-two laborers, one might be found, by rotation during the cold season, to attend to the fires, without the necessity of em- ploying an additional laborer for that purpose, and that that item might be stricken out
I would make the offce of President as dignified a one as possible, but I would rather that it should rest more upon the character of the incumbent than upon the number of subordinates placed around him
I think we can dispense with that offcer;and therefore I move to strike out lines seven hundred and eighty-six and seven hundred and eighty- seven, which, provide for a fireman
The ameridment was not agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
1 am directed by the Com- mittec of Ways and Means to offcr the following amendment, to come in just here: For furnishing the Prcsident's House, to bc c*pended under the direction of the President, in addition to thc pro- ceeds of sale of such of the furniture and equipage as Inay be decayed arid unfit for use, $20,000
For introducing the Potomac water into the President's • House, $4,420
I will state that the first appropriation is the same as has heretofore been granted every four years for refurnishing the Pi•esidont's House
Four years ago' the sum was $28,000
The sccond appropriation is for introducin<the Potomac water into the President's House
This is deemed proper, not only for the safety of the buildin€», but for the hcalth and convemcnce of the inmates
Mr
MAYNARD
I see in one of the papers thatgive the oublic everything w'hich relates to the private o'f public men, that the President elect was cither in, or about to bc in, the city of New York, to lay in furniture for the White House
I do not know whether this appro- priation is designed to cover those bills or not
[Laughter.] But I an-u in favor of doing us much fbr the incoming Presidcnt as we did fbr the out- going Prcsidont
The alncndment was am•eed to
Mr
PETTIT
As has now been read through, I offer, a's an amendment, the followin«r additional section: SEC
2
Jlnd be it further enacted, That there is hereby further appropriateä, in like manner, to pay arrears due the authors and artists of the exploring expedition, in pur- suance of the act of August 6, 1842, $11,036 26
The appropriation which is asked for in this additional section, is for the purpose of paying, as it is expressed therein, the arrears due the authors and artists connected with the expedition, under the act of August, 1842
The J (nnt Committee on the Library were directed to publish an account of the results of that expedi- lion
The form, as well as the mwtter, of the publi- cation, was prescribed by the law
The commit- tee has been steadily pursuing that object, acting merely as the right hand of Congress, without any discretion of their own upon the subject
At the last session of Congress, there being no ap- propriation for this object, a suspension of the work wras practically made
The arnount now proposed to be appropriated, is due to scientific gentlemen and artists who have been employed by the committee in connection with that work; and it is proper that it should be provided for in I have already said that I have this manner
moved this amendment under the direction of the Joint Committee on tho Library
Mr
BRANCH
As usual, there is so much noise and confusion that I cannot hear what is would inquire whether I understood (Y01ncr on
the gentleman from Indiana to say that this amount of money is necessary for the payment of salaries during the Ome this work has been sus- pended by reason of the non-action of Congress
Mr
PETTIT
In reply to the gentleman from North Carolina, I will read the first section of the act under which this work has been done
It" is enacted that— There shall be published under the supervision and di
rection of the Joint Committee on the Library an account of the discoveries made by the exploring expedition under the command of Lieutenant VVilkes of the United States Navy ; which account shall be prepared ',vith illustrations, and published in a torm *linilar to the
vovage of the astro- labe, lately published by the Government- oi• France." The Committee on the Library, in 1842, and subsequently, but all earlier than 1850, entered into engagements with •scientific gentlemen for the purpose of embodying, in proper form, the scien- tific results that expedition
" The contracts made at that time stipulated, either in the pro- gress or upon the completion of their work, a cer- tain compensation
Appropriations have been made from time time, and accordingly pay- ments have been made from time to time, to the various persons connected with the work
There is now this amount of arrear' due to the several gentlemen, all of whom, with one exception, are scientific gentlemen, among whom are Agassiz, Dr
Gould, and Professors Gray,' Torry, Sulli- vent, and others
Mr
BRANCH
If the gentleman states, as chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, that this money is duc, undcr the contract, I have nota word to say in opposition to the amendment
Mr
PETTIT
Such is the fact
T hc amendment was adopted
Mr
HUGHES
1 offer the following amend- ment as an additional section: SEC
3
,nnd be it further enacted, 'That there is hereby further appropriated, in like manner, for the preparation and publication of the charts of the exploring expedition under the command of Captain C
Ringgold, United States Navy, $7 ,500
I will briefly explain the object of the amend- ment
In 1852 Congress ordered the fitting out of an expedition for the purpose of making surveys of the Straits of Sumatra, the northwestern coast of Siberia, and of Behring Straits
In consequence of indisposition, after certåin duties had been per- formed, Captain Ringgold—tired from the expe- dition, and the command was turned over to Lieu- tenant Richards, of the Navy
Since then, appro- priations •have been made by Congress for the purpose of publishing the charts and the results attained by Lieutenant Richards
There is on hand a large amount of useful information—and I can speak of it from personal knowledge—which ought to be published for the benefit of the Navy and of cmnmerce
This amendment simply pro- poses to carry out the intention of Congress, under the law, that these results should be published to the world
Of course, when an exploring expe- dition is fitted out, it is not necessary, in the bill authorizing it, to specify that the charts shall be published
That follows as a necessary conse- quence, because it is in that way alone that the results of the expedition can be secured
sub- mit, therefore, that the amendment is not only germane to the purposes of the bill, but that there are reasons, and the stroncrest possible reasons, why the committee should adopt it
Mr
VANDEVER
1 raise the question of or- der whether this is an appropriation that is .pro- vided for by any existing law, and whether the •amendment is in order
Mr
HUGHES
Before the Chair makes his decision, would simply say that I supposed I had met that objection already
An appropriation was made under authority of law for the purpose of fitting out this exploringuexpedition; and tl-lis is merely a provision for the publication of the results ot• that expedition, •vhich must have been contemplated when the law was passed
It can- not be imagined for a moment that the Govern- ment intended to send out an expedition for the purpose of making surveys and explorations and gatherincr results together, which wore not to be published
I contend, th6refore, that this is a direct result of the law of 1852, providing for the fitting out of the expedition; otherwise all the money you have expended upon it—and you have expended a great deal—would be thrown away, bc- cause these astronomical observations and sound- incs are of no manner of use unless you give them substance through charts and reports
This is a necessary result—it is æcorollary from the previ- ous legislation
It is therefore as directly under the authority of law as any expenditure which could have been made under the law of 1852
Mr
VANDEVER
1 do not regard it as ne- cessary to carry on the regular operations of the Govcrnmcnt
The CHAIRMAN
Does the gentleman from Iowa insist on his point of order
Mr
VANDEVER
1 do
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair decides the amendment out of order
Mr
PORTER
1 offer the following
amend- ment, to come in at the end of the bill: SEC
and be it further enacted, That there ig hereby further appropriated, for completing and providing proper furniture for the new court-house and post offce at Indi- anapolis, Indiana, $5,000
 1861
Mr
MAYNARD
that the osition which came up awhile ago
If it is, I must raise the same point Of order upon it
Mr
PORTER
Thereis providing for the completion of this building
This amendment proposes an appropriation for that purpose
It for the continuation of ta public work
It seems to me that it is clearly in order
The CHAIRMAN: The Chair of opinion that the amendment is more out •of order now than it was when it was ruled out before

These questions will be decided by convention representing the sover- eignty of my State, which in session to-day
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM (when his nam.e was called) said: I prefer the original Crittenden prop- ositions, with -certain amendments, as a basis for action , because they would settle the slavery ques- lion in the Territories definitively, os well south as north of 360 30', as also in all territory hereafter acquired
Anything less than a complete, final, and irrepealable adjustment, right now, of the question of slavery, would bc idle and mischiev- ous

shall deem it reasonable to allow the writ of error or appeal
The bill was ordered to bc engrossed and rcad• a third time; and being engrossed, it was accord- ingl read the third time, and passed

HARDEMAN
The Secretary of War having unequivocally denounced Major Ander- son, I vote " no." Mr
HATTON
The same reason that has influenced me, duringzthis session of Congress, to vote a«yainst all such resolutions as the one now before the House—mere declarations of opinion, without any practical purpose in view—resolu- tions the consideration pf which is calculated, if not intended, to create only angry and- mischiev- ous discussion—satisfies me as to the propriety of my voting against this resolution
Without reference to the merits of the proposition, I there- fore vote " no." Mr
HILL
As the President has not been in the habit of deferring his action to this, the House of Representatives, and as he has on some occa- sions acted adversely to
the wishes of the House, I do not think it is necessary for them now to back him up
He will pursue whatever course he has marked out, regardless of their approba- tion

WASHBURNE, of Illinois
1 Mr
MALLORY
1 will vote for this or any other resolution indorsing _the conduct of Major Anderson in moving to a place of safety within his jurisdiction, but I will not vote for resolu- tion which goes further, and places me in the posi- tion of indorsing, beforehand, all the ineasures which the President of the United States .may choose to take to enforce the laws and- preserve the Union
Mr
MAYNARD
1 now vote against
this resolution for the same reason that I voted against the resolution introduced some days.since by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr:
PRYOR.] Mr
McKENTY
1 have the honor of repre- senting one of the most conservative districts or Pennsy vania—one that is strongly Democratic
Our pol' Lical amnities and sympathies have been always with the South; but do not believe there is a single man in my district that does notsustain the President in his course
While we have stood by South Carolina at
the ballot-box, we cannot sustain her act of treason [Mr
GARTRELL
What treason.] against the General Government
I feel that the act of the President is merely defensive; and, sir, the last page of our nation 's history is to be a bloody one, let the responsibility rest with those who will make it so
I vote ay." Mr
MOORE, of Kentucky
If this resolution were confined to Major Anderson, should vote for it with great pleasure; but I cannot vote for the residue of that resolution
Hence I votes ' no, Mr
NIXON
I stand upon the platform of the Constitution, the -Union, and the enforcement of the-laws as they are; hence I vote 2" a.y.' Mr
PEYTON
As 1 believe that ihe;object of the mover of
this resautionGs, to 'inaugurate civil war in our country, f vote no.' Mr
RUST
Knowmg that Major Anderson exhibited no extraordinary courage in going from n weåk position to a safe one, and believing, if it is the intention of the President of, the United States to maintain him in that position, it is in violation of his plighted word, I vote " no." SICKLES
Believing
that my constitu- ents are inflexibly opposed to coercion employed acainsta sovereign State; nevertheless,convinced as I am, that they regard the act of Major Ander- son as one •done within the spirit of fiié instruc- tions, and from-patriotic motives; and that it is the sworn duty of the President, according_to his oath, to preserve the Union by the employment of all constitutional means, i believe I only give expression to the sentiment of the city of New York, wher:t I vote " ay." Mr
SMITH, of North Carolina

Whenever he I' vote against it, believing it an improper subject does it, I shall be unalterably opposed to it from the beginning to the end; and I vote G' no." Mr
STOKES
I have no ohjection to the first part of this resolution; but I am certainly opposed to the•latter part of the resolution, if I understand it
Another thing< I do not- believe this resolu- tion,.has any tendency to reconcile the diffculties between the North and South, or to restore peace
[t is known to every member upon this floor that i am for peace, for compromise, and for healing all these disturbing questions which now distract the country; but I do not believe this resolution will have any tendency to reconcile these diffcul- ties
For these reasons I vote " no

QUARLES stated that his colleague, Mr

Mr

This resolution No remarks are in order, if ob'ected to
{ar
MOORE, of Alabama
Just onc word
Mr
BRIGGS
I hope the gentleman will be allowed to proceed, as that privilege has been —anted to others
Mr
MOORE, of Alabama
This resolution, Mr
Speaker, not only commends the conduct of Major Anderson in seizing Fort Sumter, butalso that of the President in retaining him there
For myself, I do not think that either deserves com- mendation
But as to Major Anderson 's conduct, this House and the public can only form a correct judgment when the orders under which he acted have been made known
As to the conduct of the President, think there can be no two opin- ions amon«y candid and impartial men
A solemn promise was made by him to the Representatives m Congress from South Carolina, that the forts in the Charleston harbor should not be reinforced, nor tl)eir condition in any manner changed, until all efforts at negotiation had failed; these Repre- sentatives promising at the same time that there should be no seizure of these forts by the, author- ities or troops of that State
A solemn compact was made between thcm
But history will record it, that this Government oc the United States, through its chief Executive, violated its pledge, and broke faith with that gallant little State
On the other hand, how did South Carolina act
Did she break her faith, or did she observe the stipulations made by her authorized repre- sentatives
'i*hcre was Fort Sumter, a strong and almost impregnable fortress, commanding the harbor of Charleston, overlooking that city, and invulnerable to a weaker power, threatened with invasion by a foe vastly superior to herself in numbers and in military appliances, Her troops could have taken possession of this strong forti- ficatiån at any moment
A dozen unarmed men could have seized it
W hut an inducement was there for South Carolina to have repudiated the made by her Representatives, and to have taken possession of this fort
She might have justified herself upon the grouild of self-de- fense; that it was necesSary to prevent any hostile troops from occupying a position from wh ich their chief city might perhaps be destroyed; that it was necessary to seize this fort the protection of t_heir homes and families
Had this, however, been done by South Carolina, what would the world have said
What execrations would have been poured upon her and het• citizens, and par- ticularly by those who are now offering incense to the President for failing to keep his pledgc ! Punic faith would have been affixed to her name, and hcr infamy would have been proclaimed throughout the civilized world
Nor would it have been different had some of hcr volunteers or a mere mob taken possession, actinc without or- ders•, provided the authorities of the State had so far ratified the act as to hold possession of that , fort
But, to her honor be it said, she kept her faith
[Crics of " Order I vote " no
Mr
BARKSDALE, in giving his vote in the negative, made an explanation, amid loud and continued cries of order, which rendered his re- marks entirely inaudible to the reporters
Mr
BARRET
so far -as concerned, Order! • ' ' 'Order ! ' 'J Lhave buta few words to say
[Cries of " Order!" ] So far as my knowl- edge extends, I justify the conduct of Major Anderson; but, as i have no offcial information in regard to the sukjcct-matter of this resolution, this time
I vote no." Mr
GILMER
Mr
Speaker, 1 have been under the most painful anxiety while this vote has been taken
Disconnect this resolution from the vote just taken, refusing, even, to have printed and considered, the resolution offered by the gen- tleman from Tennessee, [Mr
ETHERIDGE,] it is well enough
Had the rules, on his resolution, for a trial to settle the present alarming diffculty in some peaceful way, been suspended, as, in all deference to the opinion of others, I think they ought to have been, I would not feel at liberty to vote against this resolution
I know not what is to be the result of this vote; but if the resolution is defeated , and some gentleman who voted against the resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee, will move to reconsider that, I will move to re- consider the vote on this resolution, if it is dc- way, and under different circumstances, to do justice to Major Anderson, and to indicate my loyalty to the Constitution and my regard for the inviolability of the laws
To vote for this resolution, in reply to a denial of a proposition for peace, would, in my judg- ment, make up a record not desired at this time
.1 regret to feel it my duty to vote on this resolu- tion as I shall
If, after we shall have tried to adjust our troubles in a peaceful way, and all honest efforts in that direction shall have failed, it may then be time to hint at other remedies
Until all chance for a peaceful adjustment is gone, cannot feel it my duty to look after any other
If northern gentlemen do not feel at liberty to consider a proposition that may tend to peace, especially when the mover of it declared his only purpose was to secure reflections that might ap• pear by amendments, which any gentleman might desire—for me, after this stubborn refusal to indi- cate a willingness for peace, to vote för this reso- lution, would, in my honest opinion, bc wrong
I have had the most solicitous concern that we might pass this most fearful crisis in some satis- factory way, avoiding civil war and bloodshed; and that I may still be understood distinctly to be for peace, rejecting all suggestions for war, a sense of duty constrains me to votc " no." Mr
HARRIS, of Virginia
For the reasons assigned by my friend from Tennessee, I vote no
Mr
WEBSTER
Mr
Speaker, just one word before I vote
I approve of the conduct of iM4ior Anderson in his removal to Fort Sumter
I also approve of the determination of the President, i
such be the fact, not to order his return to Fort Moultrie, but to sustain him where he is
More than this, sir; believe in that principle of gov- ernment which is involved in the last part of this resolut.ion: that it is tho duty of our Government, as of all Governments, to see that its \aws are re- spected and its citizens protected
But, sir, fol- lowing, as tl)s resolution does, immediately after thc resolutions proposed for consideration by the gentleman from Tennessee, [MI'
ETHERIDGE]— resolutions which came from the conservative men of the South, and were held out by them as the olive branch of peace to the country, but which a very large majority of the members on the other side of the House not only declined to support, but actuallv refused to consider, it looks as if, instead of tha-t olive branch of peace, the sword of war was to be returned
Consequently, I cannot vote for this resolution
I vote " no.' [Slight applause on the floor and in the galleries.] Mr
FLORENCE

was not pqid, because the appropriation for the purpose of rhaintaining I ReSotöed, That the President be requested to inform the  284 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9, peace with the Indians in California was exhaust- ed.
Subsequently, Lane assigned, by indorse- ment, the draft to the petitioner for the sum of $-1;050; its full amoånt and value
At the first session of the Thirty-Fifth CongreSs, the peti- tioner presented his petition—and filed the draft with the Congress of the United States, which, together with the draft, was lost or mis- laid, without his negligence or fault
At the sec- ond session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress, he pre- senled his petition, setting forth the facts, and the loss of •x'the papers filed at the first session, and the Committee on Indian Affairs unanimously authorized a report in favor of the petitioner; but owing to the want of time, by reason of the expiration of the session, the report was not made, and the papers in the case were lost or mislaid, and cannot now be found
'The committee are satisfied of tho authority of Bar- bour to draw the draft, and of the legality and genuineness of the assignment to Martin, and that the draft has never been paid; therefore they reported the bill, and, in consideration of the pc- culiar circumstances attending the claim, recom- mended that it bb passed at the earliest possible 
day
The bill was ordeéed to a third reading, read the third time, and passed

I will give the reason Mr
SEWARD
No about the reason
I will waive it, of course, for the accommodation of the Senator

Then, Mr
President, 1 to take up the bill, and will give the Senate the rea- son why it ought to corne up now

RICK in the chair.) It beccnnes tho duly of' the i Chair to announce the messagro, as called for by the Senator from New York, unicss the Senate i sees fit to postpone it
Mr
SEWARD
1 withdraw my for a moment
Mr
LANE
Now 1 move to bill of last session, providing for military roads I in New Mexico
The motion was at-need to; and tbc Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con- sider the bill (H
R
No
200) to provide for the completion of the military road from Fort Union to Santa Fé, New Mexico, which proposes to ap- propriate $35,000 for the, completion of the mili- tar road frorn Fort Union to Sat) FF
" 'hc Committee on Military A {Fairs and Militia reported an amendment, to add to the bill: And for the cmnplct.ion of the in ilitary road fro:n 'Taos to Santa Fé, in New Mexico, The amendrnent was agreed to; and the bill was reported to the Senate, as amended, and the amend- ment was in, and ordered to be en- crrossed, and the bill to bc read a third time
The till was read the third time
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the pa*sage of the bill
Mr: EIALE
I wish solne one would cxplaill the character of the bill, the necessity of it, and the amount required 
Mr
LANE
This bill was reported in the House of Representatives, and passed on a recom- mendation from the War Department, I believe, showing the necessity of opening communication between these posts m Nevv' Mexico, that trans- portation might be carried at a much cheaper rate than it can -be at present
After it passed the House of Representatives, it was referred to the Committee on Military Affairs in the Senate; and upon a careful examination of the reports and of the opinions of the commnndi•ng offcers in New Mexico, they agreed to an amendment incrpasincr the, amount above that provided for by the House for one road, and insertimr anothér
'The Sena- tor from New York [Mr
IftNG] will recollect it
'I'he committee reported it to the Senate with a recommendation that it pass, uponthe conviction that it was necessary for the service
In New Mexico, the Senator from New Hampshire knows, military posts have to be kept up, and they are kept up at a very high expense, for trans- portation is diffcult
This bill will open commu- nication that will save to the Government directly very many thousands of dollars ab6ve the small amount now provided for making these roads
Mr
KING
My opinion is that this bill had better lic over
Mr.*SEWARD
I hope, then, the Senator will let it lie over, and let us take up the message
Mr
LANE
I desire to state the reason why it should pass morning
This day is set apart, I belicvc, by the House of Representatives for the consideration of territorial business
This If it pass ig a House bill with an amendment
this morning, and can go to the House within the day that territorial business is considered, the amendment will be concurred in, and in all human probability, the bill will become a law; but if it fails to pass this morning, it will be impossible to get up territorial business again durinæ this session in the other House, and it will be the death of the I trust no Senator will object to action upon it now
•Lct us have a vote on it, and if it does not pass, there is an end to it
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the passage of the bill
The bill was passed—ayes twenty-five, noes not counted
The title of the bill was amended so asto read: " An act to provide for the completion of the mil- itary roads prom.Fort Union to Santa Fé, and from Taos to Santa Fé, in New Mexico

Mr

Everythihkhas on here this morning, as Italways docs and al ways ought to I called for the read- do, by unanimous consent

want to may be the judgment of the Chair; but if my mo- tion to take up the resolution has precedence, under the rules of the Senate, I ask that it be taken up, or that a vote be taken as to whether it shall be taken up or not
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The
Chair state to the Senator from Virginia, that the call for the reading of the message .was made at an early stage of the morning business; but, by com- mon consent, the Senator from New York waived his call; and he had the right to resume it, and make the call whenever he saw proper, owing to the informal manner in which business has been transacted this morning, The Chair regards the call now as strictly in order; and will lay before the Senate the communication from the President of the (Tnited States
The Secretary read the message of the Presi- dent of the United States
Mr
BIGLER

The Secretary reåd the communication of Messrs
Barnwell, Adams, and Orr, to the Presi- den t, dated December 28, 1860, and the President's response, (lated December 30, 1860
Mr
DAVIS
Are thosc all the papers which accompany the communication 
The PRESIDING OFFICER
e Chair un- derstands that those are all, except he ordinance of the State of
South Carolina, a the commis- Sion of the commissioners
Mr
DAVIS
Mr
President, t a verv recent period, the country looked with anxious solici- tude to the condition of South Carolina, and Qar- ticularly the port of Charleston, apprehending collision between the United States and one of the States
That solicitude was intensified by the arrival of commissioners representing the sover
ci(rnty of the State, and offering by peaceful nego- tiation to adjust the
pending difficulties between South Carolina and the United States
character of those gendernen—one of them well known to those who servcd in the Senate many years acro—known, especially, for his Christian- lty, his urbanity, and his manliness in all the relations of life—gave
assurance that those neo-o- tiations might bc peaceable; gave reason to hope they might be successful
They were suddenly terminated; and at once rumors went forth that, notwithstanding tht high character of that com- mission, they had .violatcd the proprieties of life; had insulted the President; the rumor was, had used hillings(ratc to him in their reply
The fact was known everywhere that the commissioners had retired from Washington, and that negotia- tions veere abruptly terrninated
The President, in his message, does not even allude to the cause of the failure of those negotiations thus attempted on.thc par.t of South Carolina
He does not even tell us that the commissioners are gone
He stops with the letter which he sent to them; and which, I must say, with all the respect due to the offce he holds, was wantin« in fairness, and was a per- version of the argmnents which they had pre- sented
When they replied to him, however, and exposed the unfairness with which he had treated their efforts at peaceful negotiation, the facts which they stated certainly being most uncom- fortablc to him—he returned their Ictter as one which he would not receive; and his communica- tion to Congress docs not even permit us to know that those commissioners cvcr attempted to reply to the position which he had taken
Though they told him they had made no demand; though they told him they had never said peaceful nego- tiation wras impossible, and thus corrected the misstatement of his paper to them, he sends that paper to the world, without even any reference to the fact that it ever was answered
I have an authenticated copy of their answer; and I send that to the Secretary's desk that it may be read

KING

If the Senator has the meanness to object to the Clerk reading the paper, let him send it back to me, and II will read it
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Ifthe reading be objected to, the question must be put to the Senate; but the Senator himself can read it
Mr
BIGLER
The Senator has no right to object to tne reading of the paper, and I suppose will not
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is to be decided by the Senate, and without de- bate, whether the Clerk shall be permitted to read the communication sent up by the Senator from Mississippi
Mr
KING
I objected to its reception
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator is out of order
The question must be put and decided without debate
Mr

The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair understands that

The yeas and nays were' ordered
Mr
BIGLER
Mr
President, 1 hope that the Senator fr6m New Y ot•k— The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Pennsylvania Will pause, and allow the Chair to state the question
Those who are in favor of ordering the paper to be read will, when their names are called, say yea; those opposed to it will Mr
BIGLER
None whatever
Mr
TRUMBULL
If not, then are pro- ceeding under a rulc that does not apply to this paper
As I understand, that rule applies to a paper Which is in the posscssion of the Senate, and has been presented—a petition or any paper that may be communicated to the Senate—but it does not apply in this case
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Mississippi sent the up and called for its reading
It is competent, therefore, for the Senate to decide whether it shall be read or not, Mr
BIGLER
That rule has clearly no apa If the Senator from Mis- plication to this case
sissippi had read the paper himself, no Senator Insteåd of reading it could have objected to it
himself, he simply asks that the clerk read it; that It is not a proposition to receive a paper, Mr
COCLLthPü{ORthe Senate
The particular form in which this question arises, induces me to ask the I would ask the Chair one or two questions: Chair whether the reading of that paper by the Clerk, at the request of the Senator from Missis- sippi, makes it any part of the muniments of the Senate; and does the paper, by being read here, belong to the papers of the Senate 
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- derstands it is to be read as a portion of the Sen- ator's s eech
Mr
80LLAMER
Then it forms no part of the papers of the Senate
The PRESIDING OFFICER
No, sir
Mr
COLLAMER
Then Obiect to a tion being made as to its being read to the Senate; because that will make it a matter of vote, and make the paper a part of the proceedings of the It is a mere question of courtesy Senate •itself
whether it shall be read at the request ofa Senator
I had Mr
DAVIS
It is very simple thing
the paper in my hand, and sent it up to be read, and took it for granted that nobody would object to the readinT of it in that way
If' gentlemen make a question on that, I have no objection to meet that question
Mr
COLLAMER
I desire to object to this mode of taking a vote on reading a pnvate paper which a gentleman sends up to be read as part of his own remarks
Mr
DAVIS
The Senatoris right
The Sena- tor from New York is making this a part of the proceedings of the Senate; and I have no objec- tion to testing that, question
Mr
COLLAMER

This is not the kind of paper that comes within that rule at all

KING
The •Senator from Missigsippi has a right to read the paper, I suppose, as part I supposed, when he presented of his speech
it, that he wished to present it to the Senate
I do not want to hear it read
I maintain my objection
Mr
BIGLER
The Senator is not obliged to listen to it
• The Senate do not, by hearing the paper read, indorse its sentiments or its conclu- sions
The Senator from New York is not re- sponsible for it
Hc only allows a rule which has been firacticed from the beginning of the Gov- eroment; and I trust he will withdraw his objec- tion
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will state that this dcbate is out of order
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 should like to hear the ruie read in regard to tho readin(' of papers
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will read the rule
The Secretary read the rule, as follows: 14
When the reading ofa paper is called for, and the satne is objected to by any member, it shall be determined by a vote of the Senate, and without debate." Mr
TRUMBULL
I would like_ to inquire if that rule has any application to this paper
cided by the Senate; and on that appeal I •takc it I can make a few remarks, if not upon tl-ie other question
The Chair, in my judgment; misap- prehends (and I speak it respectfully) the rule
The rule that has been read has no application to I It applies to a paper a paper of this character
in the possession of the Senate, This is not a paper (and so the Senator from Mississippi has stated) in the possession of the Senatc at all
It is a private paper in-the possession of the Senator from Mississippi ; not onc in the possession of the Senate
He might have asked a brother Senator sitting near him to read it, and such things have been frequently done; but now, he having re- quested the Clerk to rcad it, it w•as scnt up, and the Presiding Offcer is applying to it a rule that is not applicable to a paper of this kind, Mr
DAVIS I call the Senator to order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator fror-n Mississippi raises a point of order
He will state his point of order
Mr
DAVIS
The point of order is, that the Chair, having submitted a question to the Senate which is not debatable, and ordered the yeas and nays to be called, a Senator rises to make an It cannot appeal, and to speak upon his appeal
be in order
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair is doing.' také ap eny -time aböüt it, I merely submit thegpropositioh to 'the
Senate that this rule is not applicable.to this casé;- and therefore appeal, from' the decision of the: Chaiv, which holds that this is a paper ori- the reading of which a vote can be taken underthat rule, Mr
MASON.
Mr., President, it
me the question stands before the Senate in this-way: the Senator from Mississippi sent a paper to-the desk and asked that it be read, declaring what paper
it Was—indicating its character
TheSen• ator from -New York objected to its being read
The Chair decided that thé•Senatorfröm Missis• sippi was entitled to have it it was prohibited-by-a vote of the Senate; or, in other words, that If a member called for the readifig- of a paper, and it was objected to, then it should be decided by a vote of thé Senate
A Senator asked for the reading of the rule, and.the rule was rea&
Then the Senator from New York renewed •his objection and demanded a vote; and another Sen- ator called for the yeas and nays; and' the yeas and nays were ordered upon that vote
There is now, therefore, the order of the Senate that the yeas and nays be taken upon the" vote; aridan appeal from the judgment of the Chair comes too late, in 11) y appiehension, if there be an error in it, which I am not prepared to admit or deny
It can only be done In Some mode by getting rld• of the order of the Senate directing the pgper to be read
That is my view
The rule of the Sen- ate is that, where a member asks—6' demands," I think, is the language—that the pending vote shall be taken by yeas and nays, it may be done by one fifth of the Senators present
One fifth of the Senators present demanded the yeas and nays, and the Chair so decided; and that is the order of the Senate
Several SENATORS
That is a mistake, Mr
MASON
1 beg pardon
That is my recollection
Mr
HALE
I simply wish to state, sir, what will govern my vote on this case
I apprehend that there is a mistake about it; but still, inas- much as the question is raised by an objection, I sce no other way to get rid of it than by the Sen- ate voting upon it
I have not the slightest doubt on earth that it was competent for the Senator from Mississippi to read that paper, or io ask any Senator that sat near him to read it, or to ask the Clerk to read it, and be -within the common and ordinary practice of the Senate
apprehend that the more orderly way to settle it, if the Chair had taken time to déiiberate, would have been, when an objection was made, to overrule it, and to have ordered the paper to be read inasmuch as that was not done, and objection has been taken, it seems to mc therc is no other way to decide it bute I by a vote of tho Senate; and I shall voté to have it read
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chairwill state to the Senator from lilinois that he misap- prehends the Chair
He has not determined this paper to be a paper in the possession of tbe Sén- ate
The Senator from Mississippi calls for the reading ofa paper
!llhe Senator from New York It is compe- objects to the reading of thc paper
tent for the Senate to determine whether the paper shall bc read; and if so, to determine it without debate; and hence,'the Senalor has nothing upon which to predicate an appeal
The whole ques- tion now is referred to the Senate; and that is, whether they will have the paper read; and it must be decided without debate
Mr
CAMERON
Mr
President-— The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator is out of order
Mr
CAMERON
Then I
sit down
Mr
TRUMBULL
certainlyhave a right to appeal from the decision of the Chair, that we cannot debate this question
The Chair decides that the Senator from Pennsylvania is out oforder
Now, I think he is clearly In order
Cannot that question be raised somehow 
If this paper is not such a one as I think the rule applies to—I think the rule does not apply to it—may I not raise that question in some shape
ThePRESlDING OFFICER.The Chair say to the Senator, that the Senator from Mis- sissippi sends up a paper to be read-; it is objected under the impression that where a Senator appeals to; and under the rule, whenever-the reading of from the decision of the Chair, it is competent for him to state his reasons why he dissents from the a paper is called for and -isobjected to, it is to be determined by thc Senate, and without deb9te
opinion of the Chair

That was what I designed li Hence the Chairdecidcsthat debateisnotin order

January 9, Mr
TRUMBULL
from the decision of the Chair, that this question is to be decided without debate
The very question that I want to present is, that it is not a case that is to be decided without debate; because that rule has nothing to do with it
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair, then, will state the position of the question to the Sen- ate, The Chair decides that this is not a debata- bier question when the reading of the paper is objected to
The Senator from Illinois says the decision of the Chair is not in conformity with the rule, and appeals from the decision of the Chair
The
quesüon now is: whether the opin- ion of the Chair shall stand as the judgment of the Senate 
Mr
FESSENDEN
That is debatable
The PRESIDING OFFICER
That question ia debatable
Mr
FESSENDEN
very well
Mr
CAMERON
Mr
President, you put me down a moment ago; but as you have decided that this is a debatable question, I may say a word, I suppose
I desire to say only, that I think we are giving more importance to this ques- tion than it deserves
The custom here has been to Ict Senators read what they thought proper, and when they did not feel able from any cause read themselves, to ask other Senators to do it, or to send the documents up to the desk, and let them be read by the Clerk
This is one of those every day occurrences which has never been objected to before
I regret very much that my friend, the Senator from New York, has made the objection; but he has a right to do so, and I have no right to say anything against it
I shall vote for the readin& of the paper, and shall vote for sustaining the Chair in his decision
I shall be willino• to leave the Senate whenever these little courtesies, which rnake our position here so pleas- ant, are dispensed with
I do not want to be here when a gentleman shall not have thc priv.ilege of having read for him that which he has not the physical power to read himself
Mr
BIGLER
1 haven single word to say on this subject
This is no question of courtesy
It is the clearest right a Senator can enjoy on this floor
I never knew it disputed before
Now, sir, thc line of distinction between the document presented here and the rule is perfect and clear, Ifthe Senator from Mississippi presented a docu- ment which was intended to be part of the files of the Senate, and presented for the cönsideration of the Senate, the rule which
has been read would apply to the reading of that document
But the Senator from Mississippi took the floor to make remarks on the message of the President of the United States
In the course of those remarks, he calls for the reading of a document which hc had a right to read himself
The Senator from Mississippi had a perfect right to rcad the pamr, 01', by universal courtesy, to ask the Clerk to read it ror him, and send it to the Clerk to bc read
I therefore hold, that it is not a papcr to which the rule would apply under any circumstances, no more than it would apply to a part oc the remarks of the Scrmtor frotn Mississippi i
he had written them in manuscript, and sent that manuscript to the Clerk to be read, in consequence of inability to do it himself, or frorn any other cause
I trust the Senator from Illinois will not further compli- cute this question by appealing from the decision of the Chair, but hope both motions will be with- drawn, and the Senator from Mississippi allowed to proceed 
Mr
FESSENDEN
Mr
President, 1 desire to add a word to what has been said with refer- ence to this matter
I shall vote in accordance with the appeal taken by the Senator from Illinois from the decision of the Chair
My object is sili)ply to settle the question as one of order, to prevent it being raised again
The rule which was read, and under which the Chair was acting, in my judgment, has reference to papers properly before the Senate, and on the files in a proper way, and introduced in the course of business, or a part of the E)apcrs of the Clerk's table, That rule has reference to these, and nothing more; but the Chair, in its haste as suppose, applicd the rule to a rnere paper sent up by a Senator addressi1P the Chair in the course of debate, with a request that the Clerk should read it, I think the rule does not apply to that case; I think the Chair was in error; and, therefore, as I feel bound to vote upon that matter, as the question has been raised, according to my convictions, I shall vote n'ot 'to' sustain the Chair in its ruling
But, sir, I wish to add, that I consider this as an ordinary occurrence
The Senator from Mis- sissippi was addressing the Chair
He sent a paper to the Clerk 's desk to be read for him,which, as has been well observed, he could have read himself, any of his associates could have read, or the Clerk could have »•ead if there was no objec- tion
I suppose there is no right to call upon the Clerk to read any portion of our speeches, or any papers that we may choose to introduce in the course of making those speeches, and I suppose that the material which is sent to be read must be offered on the personal responsibility—the re- sponsibility of character for courtesy and for proper treatment of the Senate—of the member who offers it
The Senator from Mississippi sent a paper to be read
It is an ordinary occurrence; it is a request to relieve him simply
Now, sir, I believe, in mv experience in the Senate, there never has been •the slightest objection in the x.vorld to reading a paper, or any number of papers, un- less it was perceived that it was used as an abuse by way of protracting time, or something of that description
Therefore, for myself, although I am happy to sustain the objections ordinarily raised by my friend from New York
I do not see at present any reason in the world why tho objection should be made, or why the ordinary courtesy extended to every one should, in advance, be re- fused to the Senator from Mississippi with regard to this readines and if it comes to that, and a vote is taken, I shäll vole that the Clerk read the pa- per, because nobody can suspect that the Senator from Mississippi had any design other than that of relieving himself with reference to the reading, which is common to us all
But, sir, I cannot vote to sustain the decision of the Chair, for I believe it is wrono•
Mr
BRIGHT
Mr
President, the decision of the Chair is correct; it is in conformity with the rules and past precedents of the body
This is the first time I have hoard a distinction taken betwcen a paper on the files of the Senate, and a paper presented by a Senator
I havc a perfect right to take any paper off my table, in the course of any remarks [ see proper to make, and ask the Secretary to read it
it is the privilege of any Senator to object to its being read; and there- upon it is the duty of the Presiding Officer, under the rules, to submit the question whether it shall be read, to the Senate; and that question is to be decided without debate
We have the previous question practically in two instances in the few rules we have in this body
One is a motion to lay on the table; that cuts off all debate
Another is the question whether a paper shall be read
That is not debatable, and there is no appeal froin the decision of the Chair deciding affirma- tively that it shall.be read
Mr

Will the Senator from Indiana allow me now, at this point, to ask a question
rrhe Senator from Mississippi was addressing the Senate, and in the course of his remarks it was necessary, as he thought, thal he should read, or have read, this cornmunication from the commis- sioners of South Carolina to the President
He preferred to ask that it bc read by the Clerk
Now, sir, does the Senator from Indiana pretend to say that a Senator, in the cotn•sc of debate, has ever been denied to have a paper read, as either part of his argument, or as presenting a case, or as necessarily connected with it
Now, suppose the Senate deny the reading of the paper, will the Senator from Indiana say that the Senator from Mississippi has not the right to read it himself
Then it will be read to the Senate ; makes it a part of his aro•urnent; and, therefore, I have con- tended that this is not the reading, nor the kind of paper, to which the rule refers at all
It is not offered to be filed in the Senate, and be con- sidered by the Senate; but it is offered in pre- cisely the same character that the Senator might offer part of a Inanuscript speech, which he did not feel able to read
That is the distinction which I make, and I cannot conceive how we could adopt a rule here by which a Senator would be excluded from reading extracts from author- ities, or even from newspapers, because it might be the pleasure of the majority not to hear them
it would only result in this, that you would tyr- annize over the Senator, and suppress his views and his argument; or it would simply amount to requiring the Senator to read the paper himself, instead of having it read at the desk
That is all there is in the question
Mr
BRIG-HI'
1 repeat, 1 never have heard before an objection made to the reading ofa paper, whether presented by a Senator or taken from the files
It is a distinction, in my judgment, with- out a difference
We all know what this paper is
I suppose the object of the Senator from Mis- sissippi was to make it a part of our proceedings to-day
If the Senate should object to reading the paper, the Senator from Mississippi would have a right io read it as a part of his argument
But, sir, all this debate is out of order
The Sen- ate have ordered the yeas and nays on the ques- tion whether the paper shall be read
If the ma- jority of the Senate are in favor of reading it, that is to be deterinined by taking the vote
It is the only way td determine it
Mr
KING
The Senator from Mississippi, in a course of remarks condemning the President for not having received or treated these commission- ers or gentleman from South Carolina with more consideration, stated that a certain paper of theirs had not been communicated by him to the Sen- ate, and proposed to send it up and have it read
The Chan•, regarding it as a paper presented to the Senate, made his decision; which, under those circumstances, would be a correct decision beyond all question
That was the modc in which the Senator from Mississippi presented it
Upon that presentation, the Chair decided it
objected to its reception by the Senate, as woul(L to the reception of any other paper which 1 considered an improper one to be presented to the Senate
We have rules in relation to the reception of petitiois
The which is now made for the read- ing of this paper is placed upon a very different footirp
It is that the Senator from Mississippi is to read this or make it a part of his speech, which is a different thing from the presentation of a paper to the Senate; but I think the Chair was correct in its decision, upon the ground that it was a paper presented to thc Senate, and as such, to be received by the Senate and read as a part of its papers
Upon the other ground—the right of the Senator to read any paper as a part of his speech— there never was any question under our rules
Mr
TRUMBULL
Now, Mr
President, it is manifest that this action has taken place under a misapprehension
I concur entirely With what the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr
BIGLER] says
It is not in the power of a majority of this Senate, unless they are going to choke down the freedom of speech here, to deny me the right to read an extract when I am addressing the Senate, unless there is something in the character of the extract that it is improper to read in the Senate
It would have to be put upon that ground
Here we are about to take a vote, as understand, whether a Senator has a right to make such a speech as he pleases
It is upon that ground that I obiect to the decision of the Chair
Mr
KING
The Senator from Illinois will allow me
That is not the ground, as I under- stand it, on which the decision is based
that this is a paper presented to the Senate to sup- ply an 0'nisuon in the President's message
Mr
TRUMBULL
well, Mr
President, 1 do not understand it in that way
Mr
KING
If it is a part of the Senator's speech, he has undoubtedly a right to say any.
thing he pleases about it; and I have no objection Mr
TRUMBULL
Then, 1 think, the better wav to get rid of the matter is for me to withdraw the' appeal, and the Senator from New York hiB objection, and let the Senator from Mississippi read what he pleases
Mr
KING
If it is made a part of the Sena- tor's speech, that is another matter; but that is not the view of the Chair, nor was it mine
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 understand the Chair to decide that it was a part of the speech of the Senator from Mississippi
May I inquire of the Chair if he did not decide that this was offered as a part of the speech of that Senator
'rile PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair did not
decide that
He decided that it was a paper falling within the rules; and if' its reading was objected to, the Senate had to determine the ques- tion without debate
 1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
Mr
KING
Certainly; whether it is a paper of the Senate or not
That is the question
Mr
WIGFALL
I wish to add a word, which I hope will be oil on the waters
I like harmony and peace
There seems, especially on this side of the Chamber, to be somer little feeling at what is called the most extraordinary course of the Senator from New York
Now, sir, these are extraordinary times in which we live; and we are acting under extraordinary circumstances
prehend that before this time never was there such an Administration, nor did such an Adminis tration ever intrust the keeping of its honor to such a party
The Senator from New York seems es- pecially apprehensive that this papér will be read ; and by way of inducing us not to read it, he al- ludes to Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr
Neither of these distinguished individuals, •I believe, re- sided on our Side of the creek
Aaron Burr, if I correctly recollect his biography, was, if not a native, certainly an inhabitant and a citizen of New York
Benedict Arnold committed the act of treason also in that State
•When treason at- taches•to the name of Robert Barnwell, it will be that sort of treason which was shown by the armed barons at Runnymede; that kind of treason that exhibited itself in England in 1688; that sort of treason that showed its head in South Caro- lina in 1776
Trusting, sir, that these few remarks may produce the effect which they are intended— may produce peace and harmony and good feeling on both sides of the —I am ready to vote
Mr
COLLAMER
Mr
President, 1 entertain the opinion that a misap*prehension still exists be- tween the Chair and the members of this body, in relation to the question before us
I understand that if this is to be considered a call for the read- ing of a paper within the rule, then, and in that case, the Chair rightly decided, when objection was made, to leave the question to the Senate
If, however, the reading of it was called for, not as a paper presented to the Senate to be referred to a committee, and to constitute apart of the papers and muniments of the Senate, but merely a part of the remarks of the gentleman, then and in that case, I take it, it does pot fall within this rule at all
I understand the Chair to say he has regarded this as a call for the reading of a paper within the rules
Now I take it that a call for the reading ofa paper within the rules is acall for some paper that we have, something that is in the cdurse of our proceedings, or it is a call for the reading of a paper on which some action is to be taken by the Senate, by referring it to acommittee,or doing something with the paper
Now, sir, under- stand that this paper IS not presented with either of these views; and in order to settle that ques- tion, I desire to know from the gentleman from Mississippi whether he asks for its reading, or sends the paper to the desk to be read, with any view to its constituting any part of the muniments and papers of this body, or simply as part of his remarks
I wish him to determine that himself
Mr
DAVIS
When I sent the paper to the Secretary's desk to be read, it was certainly as a part of my remarks; but the Senate, I suppose, considering it too valuable to be appropriated by one person,upon the objection of the Senator from New York have taken it to themselves
Now, I am perfectly willing that the Senate shall decide, as they would upon their own paper
If they do not keep it, it will be mine again
If they do keep it, I am content
Mr
COLLAMER
1 wish to understand the gentleman aright
H presented this paper in the fii•st place, not as a paper for the action of the Senate at all, but merely a paper to be read in con- tinuance of the remarks he was making
Mr
DAVIS
Just as if I was reading it my- self; and, consequently, the very great surprise which felt at any one making an objection; and hence the offer of my friends around me to read it for me
Mr
COLLAMER
Then 1 undcrstand that the gentleman merely offered it as a part of his I understand the Senator from New remarks
York objected to that as a paper presented to constitute a part of the papers of the body
That was the ground of his objection
Then his ob- jection was grounded on an utter mistake, for the paper was not presented with any such view; its reading was not called for as a paper belonging all
His objection was founded
on -the ground that it was presented to be a part of the-proceed- ings of the Senate, on' which action was to be taken
This is an entire misapprehension, so it appears now; and that being so, I desire to ask the Chair whethcr he will still regard it as being a paper coming within the rule, instead of being a paper to be read as a part of the remarks otthe Senator from, Mississippi, as he says he wished The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will state to the Sengte that he regards it as c@m- petent for the Senator from Mississippi to make it a part Of his speech if he sees proper
If, in- stead of doing that, he proposes to send the paper to the-Clerk's• table and have it read, he puts it in possession of the Senate; and it is for the Sen- ate to determine, and without debate, whether it shall be read or not
Mr
COLLAMER
the gentle
man now to say that he did not send it there with any such view
Mr
DAVIS
I did not send it there with that view; but the Senate has taken charge of it, and now I want the Senate to dispose of it
Mr
COLLAMER
It was not sent with any such view; and therefore the whole proceeding IS a mistake
Mr
DOUGLAS
I think it is very clear that when that paper was sent to the Clerk's desk to be read, it was done, according to universal usage in the Senate, to constitute simply a part of.the Senator's remarks
'Ihe only point was, whether the Clerk should he permitted to perform an act of courtesy by reading it for the Senator, or whether the Senator should be• compelled to read it himself
I think it was competent for any one to object to the Clerk 's reading it, and compel the Senator to do his own reading, if the majority of the body see proper; and there might be cases where I would resort to that act even of discourt- esy; but such*a case would only be where a Sen- ator x.vas speaking against time for the purpose of preventing a vote, and sent up a book—a whole volume—for the Clerk to read, to keep him a day or two in reading it, to defeat the object of the Senate
Where a Senator sends a paper to be read to relieve himself, I think it is a very great discourtesy to interpose an objection ; •and for that reason I shall give no vote •that would seem to imply such a discourtesy as that to the Senator from Mississippi
I would be willing to deny it if it was used for the purpose of defeating the ac- tion of the Senate and worrying us out by requir- ing long books or journals to read not pertinent to the matter before the Senate
hope that the Senator will be permitted to go on •with his re- marks
He offered, when objection was made, to take the paper back and read it himself; and if the other side had permitted him to do so, sub- mitting to the discourtesy that it implied, we should have gone on and been through with the subject long ago
Mr
KING
I understood •the Senator from Mississippi to present this paper, as one which the President had omitted or refused to send to I approved of the President's act in the Senate
I un- declining to send this paper to the Senate
derstood the Senator from Mississippi to present the paper to the Senate to supply a defect in the communication from the President to the Senate
Mr
DAVIS
If the Senator will allow me, I stated to the Senate that it was an authenticated copy

KING

The right of a Senator to speak here is a right that nobody questions; but the right to present a paper to the Senate, and to have it read to the Senate, without saying whether it is a part of his speech or not, is another matter

Before the yeas and nays are taken, I wish to state that there is a special order for-two o'clock to-day; but, in order not to inter- rupt the Senator from Mississippi, when he shall be permitted to go on With his speech, I move that the Pacific railroad bill be made the special order for one o'clock to-morrow
The PRESIDING OFFICER

Mr

I will state to the Senator from California that I had intended, after thc Close of the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr
WILSON,] who had the floor, asl understood* for one o'clock to-day, to move to postpone the subject on which he had the floor until to-morrow at one o'clock, for the purpose of addressing the Senate, upon it
Mr

Tha Clerk read it, as follows: WASHtNGTON, January I, 1861
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE: between the Far.Eies in regard to the possession of the Féd- oral forts, in: i'the -harbor of Charleswn; and I therefore déepiy that ib your opinion the events Of the last tWenty-fouihours render this impossible." We expressed no such opinion ; and the language which you quote as ours is-altered in its sense by the omission of a most important part of the sentence
What we did say was: But the events oftbe last twenty-four hours render Such an assurance impossible." Place that assurance," as contained in our letter,' in the sentence, and we are pre- pared to repeat it
Again, profeSsing to quote our lan- guage, you say : Thus the authorities of South Carolina, without wait- inror-asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you:have expressed it, that the oflicer had acted notonly without but against my orders," Cc
We expressed no such opinion in reference to the belief of the people of South Carolina
'I'he language which you have quoted wasLapplied solely and entirely to our assur- ances obtained here, and based, as-you Welk know, upon your own declaration—a declaration which, at that tune, it was ilnpossible for the authorities of South Carolina have known
But, without following this letter into all its details, we propose only to meet the chief points of
the argmnent
Sonne weeks ago the State of South Carolina declared her intention, in the existing condition of public affairs, to gecede froin the United States
She called a convention of her people to put her declaration in force
The convcn- tion Diet and passed the ordinance or secession
All this vou anticipated, and your courke of action was thoroughly conside:ed in your annual 'nessagc
You declared you had no right, and would not attempt, to coerce a seceding State but that you were bouud by your constitutional oath, would definid the property of' the United States within the borders of South Carolina, if an attetnpt was made to take it by törce
Seeing very carly that this questiont)t• property was a difficult and delicate one, you nnanifestcd a desire to settle it without collision
You did not reiniOree thb gar- in the harbor of Charleston
You removed a (lis- tinguished and veteran officer from the connnand of' Fort Moultrie because he attempted to increase his supply of mmnunition
You refused to send additional troops to the same garrison, when
applied for by the officer appointed to succeed him
You accepted the resignation ot• the old- est and most enninent tnetnber of your Cabinet, rather than allow the garrison to be strengthened
You compelled an ofliccr stationed at Fort Sun-ner to return itmnediately to the arsenal iOrty muskets which he
had taken to ann his Incn
You expressed, not to one, but to many, of the most distinguished of our public characters, whose testimony will bc Placed upon the record whoncvcr it is necessary, your anxiety ftn• a peaceful terrnination ott this controversy, and your willingness not to (listurb tbc rnilitae•y status of the torts, if conunissioncr.s should be sent to the Govern- nncnt, whose conununications you promised to submit to Congress
You received and acted on assurances frorn the higl)Ost
official authorities Ot'Sout11 Carolina that no att.e.xn pt "'()tlld be ntade to disturb your Ibossession ot• the forts and property of the United States if you would not disturb their and the attenil)t to negotiate had failed
You took fro") the metnbers of the House of Representatives a written njcxnorandum that no such attempt should be Inadc, " ' pro- vided that no reinfOrcements shall be sent into those forts', and their relative Ini\itary status shall runain as at present
SIR : We have the honor to acknowledge receipt or your 'letter of the 30th of in reply to a note dressed by us to you, on the '28th of the same Inonti), as commissioners from South Carolina
t In retercnce to the declaration with which your reply -commences, that your position as President Of Unit.cd States was already' defined in the message to Congress of tbC'3d instant;" that you possess no power to cha•nge the -relations heretofore exiBting between South Carolina and niuch less to acknowledge the inde- the-United States II pendence of that State," and that consequently you could meet us only as private •gentie:nen ot• the highcst pharaetcr, with an entire willingness to communicate to Congress any proposition we Inight have to Illake, we deeur it only ne- cessary to gay that tbc State ot- South Carotina having, in the exercise of that great right of selt2govenuncnt which underlies all •our political organizations, declared herself sovereign and indcpendent, we, as her representatives, (Olt no special solicitude as to the character in which you might recognize us
Satisfied that the Stato had simply exercised her un- questionabie right, we svere prepared, in order to reach substantial good, to waive the ibrmal considerations which yonrconstitutional scruples mighthave prevented you from extending
We came here, therefore, expecting to be re- ceived as you did receive us, und perfectly content, with any proposition to Congress which Ive might have to make upon the subject of thew independence of the State
"I'hat willingness was arnple recognition of the condition of pub- Jic affairs, eM1icii rendered our presence accessarv
In this position, however, it is our duty both to-the State which we represent and to ourselves, to correct several irn- ! portant misconceptions of our letter into which- you havc fallen
You say It was my earnest desire "that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by Congress, who alone-pog- sesses the power to prevent the inauguration ofa civil war And although you attach no törce to the acceptance ot• such a paper—although you considered it as nothing rmorc in enect than the protnlse of highly honorable gcntlemen'•' as an obligation on one side without corresponding obliga- tion on the other, it tnust be rcmenibered (if we are rightly infonned) that you were pledge(l, if you cverdid send rein- •forcements, to return it to those from whom you had re- ceivcd it before you executed your resolution
You scnt orders to your ofliccrs conunanding them strictly to follow a line of conduct in coniörmity with such an underStand- I!csidcg all this, you had reeeived forinal and official notice froni the Governor ot• South Carolina that we had been appointed commissioners, and were, 011 our way to Miasl)itæton
You knell.' the implied eöndition under which we c:une; our nrrival was notfticd to you, and an hour ap- pointed for an interview
We arrived in Washington on Wednesday, at three o'clock, and you appointed an interview with ns at one tho next (lay
Early on that day, ('Rhursday,) the news was received here of the rnovement of Major Anderson
That news was counnunicated to you inemediate]y; and you post.poned our meeting until halt• past two o'clock on Fri • day, in order that you Inight consult your Cabinet
On Friday we saw you ; and we called upon you then to rc- deem your pledge
You could not deri.v• it
With the Iäcts we havc stated, and in the face of the crowning and con- had resigned his elusive Caet that your Secretary at War seat in the Cabinet upon tbc publicly avowed groilnd that the action of Major Anderson had violated the pledged faith of the Governtnent, an(l that unless the pledge was instantly redeemed he was dishonored, denial was impos- sible; you did not deny it
You do not deny it now ; but you seek to escape frotn its obligation on the grounds : first, that
we terminated all negotiation by demandinz
as a pre- liniinary, the withdrawal of the United States troops from the harbor of Charleston ; and, second, that the authorities of South Carolina
instead of asking and giv- ing you the opport'unity to vindicate yourself, took posses- Siou other property ot• the United States, We will ex- anuinc both
in conclusiqm, we would urge upon you the- imrpcdiate -withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of Charleston
Under-present circumstances, they are
a standing menace, Which renders negotiation impossible," " Under pres- ent Circumstancc.É." What circmnstances
Why, clearly, the occupation-of Fort Suxnter and the disinantling of Fort Moultrie by Major Anderson, in the f•äce of your; pledges, and without explanation' or practical disavowal
And there is nothing in the letter which would or could have pre- vented you from declining to withdraw tbe troops and of- fering the
restoration of the status to which you were pledged if such
had been your desire
It would have been wiser and better, in our opinion, to have withdraw•n the troops; and this opinion we urged upon you, but-we de- maudcd nothing but suctran explanation of the events of the last twenty-four hours as-would restore our confidence in the spirit witli which the .negotiations should be con- ducted
In relation to the withdrawal of the troops from the har- bor, we are compelled, however, to notice one passage of your letter
Reterring to it, you say This-I cannot do
This I wilt not do
Such an idea was never thought of by •me -in any possible contingency
No allusion to it had ever been made in any communica- tion between 'nyselt• and any human beino." In reply to this statement, we ave coinpelled to say that your conversation witli us left upon our minds the distinct impression that you •did seriously contelnplate the wilil- drawal of the troops from Charleston harbor
And in sup- port of this irnpression, we would add that we have the positive assurance of gentlmnen ofthe highest possible pub- 'ic reputation and the Inost unsullied integrity—men whose natne and fatne, securcd by Ion" gcrvice and patriotic achievernent, place their testimony beyond cavil—that such suggestions had been Inade to and urged upon you by them, and had törrned the subject of more than one earnest dis- cussion with you
And it was this knowledge that induced us to urge upon you a policy which had to recommend it its own wisd01n and the might of such authority
Ag to the second point—that the authorities of South Carolina, instead ot- asking explanations, and giving you opportunity to vindicate yoursett•, took possession of other property ot•the Unitcd States—we would observe : 1
'l'hat even if this wcrc so, it does not avail you for defense, for the opponunity for decision wyas afforded you before these facts occurred
We arrived in Washington on Wednesday : the news from Major Anderson reached here early on 'I'hursday, and was immediately communicated to you
Ali that day inen of the highest consideration ; men who had striven successfully to lilt you to your greatoflice ; who had been your tried and true friends through the troubles of your administration, sought you and entreated you to 'l'hey told yo•.l that every hour com- act—to act at once
'J'hey only asked you to give the plicated your position
assurance, if the facts were so ; that if the conunander had acted without and against your orders, and in violation of your pledges, you wÖuld restorc the
status you had pledged )'our honor to Inaintain
You refused to decide
Your Secretary of I.Var, your innnediate and proper adviser in this whole Inattcr, waited anxionsly• fer your decision until he felt that delay was becolning dishopor
More than twelve hours passed, and two Cabinet meetings had ad- journed before you kne'v what the authorities of South Carolina had done, and your prompt decision at any mo- nnent ol'lhat tinie would have avoided the subsequent eoni- plications
But, if you had known the acts of the authorities of South Carolina, should that have prevented your keeping your faith
What was thc condition of things
For the last sixty days you have had in Charleston barbornot force cnough to hold the forts against an equal enemy
Two of them were cmpty ; one ot• those two, tine Inost importqnt in the harbor
It could have
been taken at any time
You ought to know better than any man that it would have been taken, but Ibr the efl01tg of those who put their trust in your honor
Believing that they were threatened by Fort Suunter especially, t.he people were with difficulty re- strained from securing without blood the possession of this itnportant rortress
Atter Inany and reitera ted assurances given on your behalf, which we cannot believe unauthor- izcd, they deterniined to forbear, and in good faith sent on their connmissioners to negotiate with you
They meant you no harm—wished you no ill
They thought of you kindly
believed you true, and were willing, as far as was consistent with duty, to spare you unnecessary and hostile collision
Scarcely had these connuissioncrs left than M ajor Anderson vv%ged war
No other words will describe It was not a peacefu\ change from one fort to his action
another: it was a hostile act in the highest sense, and only justified in the presence of a superior enemy, and in immi- He, abandoned his position, spiked his guns, nont peril
burnt his gun -carriages, made preparations for the destruc- tion of his post, and withdrew under cover ot• the night to a safer position
This was war
No.-man could have be- lievgl (without your assurance) that any offcer could have taken such a step, not only without or(lers, but against orders
What the State did was in simple self-defense ; for this act, with ail its attending circumstances, was as much war as firing a volley; and war being thus begun, until those commencing it explained their action and disavowed their int.ention, there was no room for delay ; and even at this moment, while we are writing, it is more than probable, from the tenor ot• your letter, that rein(örcements are hur- rying on to the conflict, so that when the first gun shall be fired there will have been, on your part, one continuous, consistent series of actions, commencing in a de:nonstra- In the first place, we deny positively that we have cver, in any way, inade, any such demand

And all this in your possession ; we iniörrn you of the objects of our mission
We say that without the slightest provocation; for; arnong• the many things which you have said, there is one thing you cannot it would have been our duty to have assured you of our say—you have waited -anxiously for' news from the seat of readiness to commence neøotiations witi) the most earnest war, in hopes that delay would furnish some excuse for this and anxious *desire to settle all questions between us arn- icably and to our enutual advantage; but that events had precipitation
But this tangible evidence ofa design to proceed to a hostile act, on uie part of the authorities of rendered that assurance impossible
We stated the events, and we said that untit satisfäctöry explanation of these South Carolina," which is-the only justification of Major events was given us we could not proceed : and then, hav- Anderson, you are forced to admit, has not yet been al- ing made this request fox explanation, we added : And, leged."

Be the issue what it may, of this we are assured, that it Fort Moultrie has been recorded in history as a memorial of Carolina gal- lantry, Fort Sumr.er will live upon the succeeding page as an irnperishable testimony of Carolina faith

ADAMS, JAMES L
ORR, Commissioners
To His Excellency the PRESIDENT United States
Mr
DAVIS
Now read the indorsement
The Cierk read the indorsement, as follows: EXECUTIVE MANSION, 3} o'clock, Wednesday
This paper, just presented to the President, is of such a character that he declines to receive it
Mr
DAVIS
Mr
President, an episode is said to delay the progress, but not to change the character of a poem
Certainly a very long epi- sode has been introduced into the remarks which I have proposed this morning to make; and they do change the conclusion to which I would have arrived
I feel, now even more than before, pity for the Executive of the United States
When proposition was made to read a paper as a part of the remarks which I proposed to submit, the Senator frmn New York appears taking charge of the Executive and protecting him from a con- Btructive rebuke by the Senate
Sorrowful, in- deed, is the position of that Executive, so lately borne to the high office which he holds upon the- shoulders of the great Democracy of the country, when he r•nust turn to the Senator from New York to protect him from them
But I know that new converts are always zealous
They havcanexcess of zeal, which has grown even to a proverb
To that excess of zeal am willinff to attribute the discourtesy to which I made a harsh reply this mornmg
But I -ask, when the peace of the country was at stake, when all men who love the Government we inherit from our fathers looked anxiously to a peaceful solution, why, if mistaken in the chur- act.er of the paper of these commissioners, did this paper (harsh, I admit, in sorne of its terms) 1101 change the purpose of the President
Why did he not then call upon them for the means by which peace may be restored to South Carolina
Thus he would have initiated a measure which might have led to beneficial results
Thus he might have turned the threatening brow of civil war away
Then wc should not have stood as we do to-day, waiting hourly for what the tele- graph may bring, to decide whether we have peace or war in our land
I did not intend this morning, however, tehave protracted my remarks so as to havc inte ered with tbc Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr
SON.] I sent a page to him, and offered t re- sign the floor; but-I learned from him that he did not wish to occupy it to-day
I have already occupied the floor some time, though was not upon it discussing a question raised in my own case, in which I have verificd the proverb that 'i our curses sometimes do a blessing prove;" for I intended to havc read and incorporated in my own remarks, the Senator from New York has taken from t\iat hiding-place where men might never have found it, and brought it out into the I thank him
broad light of the Senate Journal
But there wag a special order for to-day Mr
BIGLER

SLAVERY QUESTION
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Mr
President, 1 rise for the purpose of moving that the resolution which I believe was left as the busi- ness on the last day of our session, bc taken up, and that all other business be postponed
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will state to the Senator that that is the unfinished business, and comes up as the business now in order before the Senate
The Senate resumed, as in Committcc of the Whole, the consideration of the joint resolution (S
No
54) proposing certain amendments to thc Constitution of the United States
Mr
CRITTENDEN
I presume, sir, as a matter of course, that the question wilt be taken on the distinct articles which aro Proposed as I hope, there- i amcndmcnts to the Constitution
fore, that the question will be first taken on thc first, article
Mr
CLARK
I move now to strike out all the preamble of the resolutions, and all after thc word resolved," in the first resolution, and add what NEW SERins...:..No
The PRESIDING OFFICER
There thtee special orders for to-day, as the Secl•étary informs thc Chair
The first one was postpohed until to-morrow; the second öiie is the one now
under consideration; and the third is the bill (S
No
230)
declaratory of the acts carrying into effect the ninth article of the treaty between the United States and Spain
Mr
IVERSON
If the Senate allow me, will move to take that bill up, in order to post- pone it and make ita special order for anodnet• d4Y, so as to get it out of the way
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It requires unanimous consent
Mr
CRITTENDEN
As I understand, the Senate has agreéd to take up these resolutions.' Mr: IVERSON
It will take but a moment
1 merely want to postpone the bill to another- day
Mr
WILSON

The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator accept that motion 
Mr
IVERSON
What is it
The PRESIDING OFFICER
To postpone the further consideration of the joint resolution until half twelve o'clock to-morrow
Mr
IVBRSON
1 have nothing to do with the resolution of the Senator from Kentucky
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- derstood the Senator to refer to it
The question is on the motion to postpone the further consid- eration of' the joint resolution now under consid- eration, until half past twelve o'clock to-marrow
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Why.l should like to know of gentlemen
If there is any special rea- son for it, micrht be disposed to acquiesce
Mr
CLARK
I wish that it might be post- I introduced certain resolutions t.his poned
morning which were ordered to be printed, and have now gone to the Printer; and I cannot get a copy
so as to move them as an amendment
Mr
CRITTENDEN
is all the better for Mr
CLARK
It may be; but I desire to have The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the Senate ready for the question 
Mr
PUGH
Is the question on postponing the joint resolution
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on postponing the resolution now under con- sideration, until to-morrow at half past twelve o 'clock
I think it is high Mr
PUGH
1 hope pot
time that we had taken a decisive vote
The President urges it upon us
Every Senator must sec that we are to go in one direction or another, and to go at once
W c heard the amendment of the, Senator from New Hampshire read this morn- ing
We know what it is.- We can easily vote w'hcther or not we will substitutc it
Senators rnay speak upon other resolutions connected with this subject; but I hope that we shall have a vote, and have it now; and if there is not a constitu- tional nutjority to carry these amendments, let us try some other proposition
•The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the postponement of the joint resolution
Mr
SIMMONS
I have not heard the prop- I did not happen to be in when osition rca(l yet
it was presented
Mr
PUGH
Which proposition
Mr
SIMMONS
Thc onc by the Sen- ator from New Hampshire
We have not had the President, 's message printed yet either
There appears to be unusual haste about this matter
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The further consideration 01' that subject was postponed until to-morrow
Mr
BIGLER
I sincerely hope that this mo- If ever we in- tion to postpone will not prevail
I sent to the Chair this morning and requested to tend to act upon these resolutions at all, we ought II to do it promptly
If they arc to be of any ser- be printcd, as an amendment
Mr
IVERSON
I desire to ask the Chair vicc to the country, '„vc all know they must be whether the Florida claims bill was not made a considered immediately
T hc Senator New Hampshire can offer the manuscript amendment, special order for to-day 
 290 and She Seriatæ can understand it at pnce, and be I do not thipk that is a prepared -twact upon it
suffcient reason för the postponement of a- meas= üre sq vitally important
As has been said by the Senatov from Obio; if this proposition be not agree- able, the time has arrived when we ought to con- sider some measure
trust the proposition of the Senator froni' Kent3ucky will be considered now; that we will .pi•oceed in good earnest, and adhere to that consideration until the Senate has arrivedM at 'a determination
It is utterly unnecessary for me, or any Other Senat0%to attempt to-picturc tlie condition of our 6n3ce' håppy- eoUntry
We are in imminent peril
The Government even is•in danger
The whole country is deeply agitated
Mutual exasperation is inflaming the whole land
Sir, I feel that every other question sinks into insignificance compared with that embodied in the proposition of the Sen- ator from Kentucky; and I will only repeat that action ought to be had on his proposition as it now stands; for you will remernber it contem- plates, first, getting an expression from the peo- ple in order that his amcndmcnts may bc adopted by a two-thirds vote in Congress, and subn)itted to the States for ratification
We have now but about seven weeks remaining of tho session; and unless '•.ve act promptly, it will be idle to act upon the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky at all
There will be no time to get the sense of the people, and afterwards act upon these proposed I therefore trust that no Senator amendments
Will ask a- postponement; that no other business will be interpOscd—the Pacific railrodd bill or any- thing else-—but that we shall proceed to consider this great' quéstion that involves the peace of the country, nnd that we shall adhere to that consid- eration late and carly until we have decided, and, 1 trust, decided happily
Sir, I feel deeply the impression that we have already neglected this great question
I am onc of those ',vho believe that there is a political and moral influence in this city, to save the country from civil war, and the Union from dissolution; and the hour lias come when mcn must assume the responsibility and act
I cannot believe that there a member of this body who is not pre- pared to act, and, I trust, act with thc utmost de- sire to rcclaim our country from its unhappy con- dition.
I am not wilting, for one, even as threat- ening as the aspects are, to conclude that it is too It is never too late to struggle for this great late
country, forz this Union under which -we have grown and prospered as 40 other people ever did before on the face of the earth
For onc, I shall not be willing to consider any other proposition; and I say that, intended more especially for my friend •from California, [Mr
Gw1N,] who is anx- ious to get up
his rilih•oad bill
For one, I shall insist upon- final action upon these questions that concern the peace of the country, before we at- tempt to consider anything else
Mr
SAULSBURY
Mr
ture Gibbon shall describe the decline and fall ot this great Republic, he will date that fall from the rejection of the resolutions oß'créd by the Senator from Kentucky
I belicvc, firrnly attached as I am to the Union of these States, that if those prop- ositions are rejected by this Senate
peace '"'111 have fled the land, and it will in future be in vain that we sing hosannas to the Union
I hope we shall- have vote now, that the country may know whether there is patriotism enough in the Senate, whether t'here is asincere love enough of the Union actuating the minds and governing the action of Senators hete, to save it by the adoption of these resolutions
I will not detain the Senate
I feel that the moment is an important one
I feel that the very continuance of this Government rests upon the adoption of these resolutions; and I hope that we shall proceed to vote upon them
Mr
CLARK
Mr
President, I introduced certain resolutions to the notice of the Senate at the commencement of the session to-day
I gave notice that I would move them asan amendment to thc resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky, and asked that they might be printed
The Sen- ate ordered then•i to bo printed
The manuscript went to the Secretary of the Senate, and has gone into the hands of the Printer
1 have no manu- script, nor any cop V of these resolutions, for the information of the Scnate as to the amendment desire to make; and, therefore, my amendment CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9, cannot be acted on now if these resolutions are pressed
I feel the importance of the occasion, Mf
President, but I do not believe that an hour or two this afternoon wilt be the
salvation of the country; and I do not think that we shall receive any detriment if we postpone these resolutions until to-morrow, in order to act on the amend- ment which I propose
I cannot offer it now any further to the Senate because i have not the amend- ment in my possession
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It is moved to postpone the further consideration of the resolu- tion until to-morrow
Mr
POWELL
Before that motion is put, 1 will ask the unanimous consent of the Senate to propose an amendment to the first article pro- posed by my colleague
The amendment carries out the Intention of the draftsman of the resolu- tion
My colleague will accept it
Mr
SIMMONS
should like to hear the amendment read
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will report the amendment
The Sccrctary read it: to insert in linc fourteen of the first article of the resolution, after the word territory," the words, now held or hereafter to be acquired;" so that it will read: In all the territory now held or hereafter to be acquired south of said line of latitude, Cc
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It will not be in order to act upon that amendment unless by common consent
Mr
POWELL
I understand it was received I hear no objection

WADE
Let us hear it read

Let him the article with the proposed amendment in, in order to let us see how it will read
The Secretary read it, as follows: ART

In all the territory of the United States now held or hereafter acquired, situate nort.h of latitude 360 30', sla- very or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment tor critne, is prohibited, while such territory shall remain under territorial govcrnm•ent

The OFFICER

The motion was agreed to

It was taken up; but there is a prior order set for to-day, and I think that of course must crowd this out

Mr
YVILKINSON
1 move that this bill be referred to a select committee of five members
It seems to me, the bill is so imperfect as it came from the House, that for the Senate to go on at this time and consider it, would mnkc necessary so many amendments, and so much alteration in the bill, that the safcst and most direct way to perfect it is to refer it to a select committee, so that it may be carefully considered
Mr
G WIN
I hope the Senate will not adopt the motion of the Senator from Minnesota
I be- lieve that if this bill is taken from before the Sen- ate, it will be its destruction during this session ; and I ask every friend of the Pacific railroad to stand by the bill as it is, and keep it before the Senate
It can be amended, if, in the opinion of the majority of the Senate, it is nota perfect bill, just as well when it is under consideration in the Senate
As to the idea of referring it to a select com- mittee, why, sir, it has been before six select com- mittees of this body already in the last eight or nine years, and every one of those bills was be- forc the select committee of the lower I-louse when they reported this bill
If we '.vere to sit upon tbc bill until doomsday we could get no more information than there is now on the files of the Senate
We have got twenty Pacific railroad bills now on the fiies of the Senate, to which any mem- ber can refer if necessary to make an amendment to the bill before the Senate
This motion seems to me to be destructive to any action on the Pa- cific railroad bilk during this session
There are motions now to amend that bill, and it can be per- fected by the time the vote is taken —on them, as much as it will bc by reference to a committee
I have served for years and years as chairman of a select committee on the subject
We have spent days and weeks of labor in maturing bills which are now on the files of the Senate
One that was reported during the last session of Con- gress is now the first biil in order regularly on I the files of the Seuate; and I undertake to say thul no committee of this body will ever make a more pcrfect bill in its details than that
'I'he great question of difference now is in regard to tho nun-r- ber of routes, and we can settle that as wcl\ here before the Senate as we can by a select commit- I hope, therefore, that the bill will not be tee
destroyed by being referred to a select committee
MI'
BRAGG
According to the Senator from California, it seems that this body is to take the bilk as it comes from the House of Representa- tives, and no other bill
Now, sir, I do not uri- derstand that sort of lc«-rislation or that sort of management
Mr
G WIN'
I said nothing of the sort
1 said the bill could be amended
Mr
BRAGG
1 beg the Senator's pardon
1 know he said the bill could be amended, and I going on to øive the reasons why I think it ought to be referred to a committee
The mere fact that itcomes from the other branch of Congress affords no reason, it seems to me, in this body, why we oue•ht not to take the same course with it as we do with other bills of an important character
This is a bill of a very important nature
volves a large expenditure ofmoney and of means by this Government
Now, shall not go into the matter at all, nor do-I propose at any time, perhaps, to go into the question as to tho number of railroads which shall be constructed; but when this bill was before the Senate the other day, various objections were presented, and sorne of them, I think, of a very substantial charac.tct•; and it was the evident sense of the body that the bill did require amendment in several important particulars
Nobody knows better than my ox- perienced friend from California that, when divers and I think the Senate evinced a disposition to do it on Saturday—it is requisite that it should go to a committee, in Order that we may not have con- fusion produced, and contradictions in the bill
It is a long and elaborate bill, and I care not what the Senator may say as to the number of similar bills that have been before this body, this bill is so framed as to require amendment, and I think the Senate will amend it
They have already amended it in one particular; and the best place to see, first, whether amendments ought to be put on, and next, how to arrange the whole bill, so as to make the amendments cöno•ruous, is a select committee
We are not able here to see what amendments are necessary in order to per- fcct a bill after we once alter it; and it is abso- lutely necessary—indispensable almost—that the bill, with amendments, should go to a committee,' in order that this state of confusion may not be produced
I hope, therefore, that the motion made by the honorable Senator on the other side will prevail
I have no ideæthat it x.vill result in the way the Senator from California says it Nill I see no reason why it should result in result
that way
I see no reason why we should hurry this bill through this body, particularly at this time, and with the hot haste willi which it is pressed
It is an important noeasure
It is due to the country, and to tho whole country, tum- bling to pieces as it is now, that this bill should not be hurried through under the circumstances, as it is attempted to hurry it through now
It ought to be considered, and well considered
In- stead of that, •we are met on every occasion here with the objection that this bill has been before the other House; that it has passed there; and appeals are made to gentlemen who arc in favor of a Pacific railroad, to stand by this bill, and nothing else
Is that the proper spirit of legis- lat.ion in the Senate of the United States
With all proper respect for my friend from California, I say that it is not
I hope that the motion •will prevail, and that this bill, with the various amendments offered, will be allowed to go to a committee; and I sup- pose, upon that committee, there will probably be I a Inajority in favor of the bill
It can be consid- crcd, it can be arranged, and it can be reported t.o the body
But as it is now in the way my friend is endeavoring to hurry through this bill— we are legislating in a great degree in the dark
I want the test of a committee as applied to this bill
It is a patch-work concern
care not where it was got up
There
are objections to it; and the more we consider it, and discuss it, and examine it, the more manifest will those objec- lions be nnude, I think
I want to have the aid ofa cotnmittec to examine this bill delibcrately, tb see where it ought to be amended
Mr
G WIN
The Senator has answered him- self in his own speech
He here moves to refer this bill to a select commiltec, in order to exam- ine it, and to examine the amendments of the Sen- ate, when the Senate has put but one amendment on it
He says the bill has been urged by its friends
Why, Mr
President, we have had but one day daring this whole session to consider it; and I appeal to the Senate if there has been any importunity exhibited by the friends of the bill to press it through withouta fair discus- If it were to go to a select committee, it sion
would come back from that committee and be con- sidered here probably for weeks; and that is one of the very means adopted by the Senator from North Carolina, who is an enetny to any species of Pacific railroad bill
A thousand committees could not frame a bill that he would vote for
is part oc the tactics of the encmies of this meas- urc to refer it 10 a select committee; and when it comes back to the Senate, it will have to undergo i the samediscussion as heretofore
A few years ago we discussed a bill reported by a select commit- i It was disc.usscd tec after elaborate investigation
amendments are put toa bill, they in some degree t i in the Senate for six weeks—that very bill re- disarrange and disorder the bill itself, and that it ported by the select committee, who examined I becomes necessary, when those amendments are the subject with as much attenti0k'1 as an V com- made, to examine with care in order to see how mittee can now
After six vveeks' discussion, the bill will workafter the amendments have been when we had done precisely what the Senator says should bc done with this bill; that is, after put upon it
I take it for granted, from what occurred in the discussion and amendment in theSenate, we then Scnatc on Saturday, that this bill will be amended, had the bill as amended printed, in order that we could consider it as a whole, and see that the amend - mentsu)nformed to the original bill
If:this bill shall •be amended in the Senate, and- those amend* ments be material, I shall, when the proper time- comes, be in favor of printirp the bill as a'mended , in order that we may
examine and see that there is no incongruity between the amendments and the original bill
But, Mr
President, if this bill is evertaken from before the Senate at this period of the session, it is utterly impossible that we can bring it forward again under as favorable auspices as at present
We are all ready to vote on the amendments— they arc befor& us—offered by the-Senator from Minnesota and others
There are various amend- ments which the Senator from North Carolina notified us he would offer
The Senator from Missouri indicated amendments
We are ready to act on them now
Here is the bill
You can strike out all of it from the enacting clause, und insert whatever you please
If it is now referred to a select committee, it is the destruction of the- measure
Mr
GREEN
1 am not particular about re- ferring this bill to a select committee; I am per- fectly willing to consider it in the Senate; but there is one point which strikes me with a little- surprise, and to that 1 wish to call the attention of the Senator from California
In the th irty-sixth ling of the first section, there must be a mistake
It makes a donation of every alternate section of land within one mile of such railroad line;" but when we get to the fifty-eighth and fifty-ninth lines of the same section, it reserves from sale the sections within six miles of the road
Is that a misprint, or a mistake, or what is it
Mr
GWIN
Those lands are to be reserved, I presume, until the selection of the sections within one mile can be made
Mr
GREEN
Then 1 must say this: the south- crn road which passes through Texas of course o•ets Texas land; when it passes through the 'Ilerritory of the United States, it gets 'Ünited States land; from Ek Paso to the eastern line of California, it gets ten sections of land to thé mile, and from that point to San Francisco it gets six sections of land to the mile, while the central route gets but one section of land to the mile
I do not think that fair treatment
i think it ought to have the
samc amount of land as the other, and I wish to call the Senator's attention to that, becaüse, frorn the form of the bill, I supposed it was a misprint
I must make this other addilional remark: that while the subject of a Pacific railroad has been considered foi• twelve years, this identical bill has never been considered
It was noteven considered in the House
It was passed under the whip and spur of the previous question, without a word of debate
So far as my incormation extends, and so far as the Journal of phe proceedings in that body indicates, and in this body, the gen era} scope and tenor of the bill has not been discussed—only a few points to which our attention has been called by several members
Now, I want this bill put in a proper shape, and I want the central route to get an equivalent to what the southern route gets
Capitalists will not take hold of itin t.his way
YVe are passing a bill and calling it a central railroad bill; and yet we so frame it and shape it that nobody takes hold of it, and tho work is never done
'I'he •easiest way, and the most way, ofaccomplishing works of this character, consistent with the Constitution of the United States, is to make donations of land
would rather diminish the amount of money and give an increased amount of land
1 only make these remarks now to show the Senate that this bill is the most immature bill, the least considered, the most ilk-prepared, of any that I have e.ver read yet; and while, with the Senator from Ohio, I am in favor of a railroad, and while I will not be technical and particular in exacting everything to conform to my view; still, I think ••tve ought to consider the general subject, and throw It into the best possible shape
If the Senate think they can take it in hand and make the requisite amendments—we having dis- cussed the general scope and tenor of the bill— belter than by referrincr it to a select committee, do so, and I will be content; but I am paming these defects, to which I will call the attention of the Senate if we take it up _ for consideration in this body without a reference  292 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9, LATHAM
I merely desire to- say, sirs that-Lenter my solemn protest, as-one of the Sen; ators from California, against the reference of this I -trust sincerely bill to any select committee
that the friends of the measure •vill regard it as a test vote, whether we are to- have axailroad bill passed this
winter or not, Now, sir, I do not care, as has been justly remarked by my col- league, how.
many select cornmigtees may L'e ap- pointed.by the Senate:t whenever they report the bill back to Qis body, it will have to be discussed just as much as now; there will be found just as mazny.objectio.ns- to it, as many criticisms; and I think the Senate is suffciehtly informed already in relation- to
this great scheme and measure to frame a bill -- themselves; and they can do it with certainly more economy of time, and with a greater certainty of having a bill which will please not only Congress, but the -country, than by referring 1 therefore trust that it to any select«20mmittee
the friends of this measure, in voting upon it, will regard this vote as a test vote whether-we are to have a Pacific railroad bill passed this winter or not
Mr
RICE
Iam satisfied, from the discussion which took place the other day, and also from the few remarks that have been made to-day upon the subject now before;the Senate, that those rep- resenting in this body the interests of the center and of the North were not in any manner what- The' northern route was entirely ignored and-it appears, from- what has fallen from böth the Senators from Missouri, that the bill, as brought from the House of Representa- tives, was unsatisfactory to them
do not know that those interested in the southern route have spoken
I am satisfied that -there is a question now before the Senate—one great question to which the eyes of tho entire community are di- rected—so much more important than this that it is hardly proper for us to consider this at present
Such being my honest conviction, I am compelled to move the indefinite postponement of the entire I now make thc inot.ion
Mr
BAKER
I second the motion
I want the question tested in that way
Mr
WILKINSON
Mr
President, 1 do not want to bo understood as an opponent of this I believe that I am as strong and firm measure
a friend of a Pacific railroad as any man upon this floor—the Senator from California or anybody else
But, sir, I •want bill which, when it passes this body, conferring so huge monopoly as this upon any company, shall be so framed that it wilt bé just arid equal to all sections of the country; I want it so guarded as to protect the rights and interests of tho people of this country
if we are to
vote away, a marvelous amount of money and a marvelous-amount of land to a corporation for the construction of this great work, il should be done with carc aud w 0.11 deliberation; and I do not at all agrec or assent to the which is u here for pushing this measure through 1 110 P
, therefore, thal without any delibcration
it will be referred to a comrnittec, with instruc- tions to report in two days, if the Senate l')lcase so to instruct them; but I mn in favor of inn-ne- diate action, and I made this Inolion {Or ren- son that I supposed it would lead to immediate action- on this bill, and be the safest and surest way procure harmonious action in this regard
For that reason I hope trhab the motion of my col- league will
not.prevail, but that this bill will bc referred in good faith, for the purpose of procur- ing immediate action upon it
'Mr
LATHAM

XIMMONS
I hope this bill will not be in- Mr
definitely postponed
We have had a railroad bill of sorne kind before the Senate now for three or four years; and i thil)k the Senate understand thc question much better than when it was originally brought here
I t'hought it was a matter of demon- stration, the last time this bill was up, that
the think the better way to deal with the
subject, as important amendments have been presented here, is to commit the bill
We cannot, on the mere impulse of the moment, look through all the details
We ought to have a committee to take all these propositions and make such provisions, after due deliberation, as are found to be neces- sary to insure the faithful execution of this work, and the security of the people when it shall be I have never known much progress to be made
made in a bill merely by presenting it here, and havingy amendments proposed to it
The result proves that we debate all day on a proposition that I do not believe three men in the Senate would vote against, as we did the last time we had this bill up
I do •not there are three men in the Senate who would vote against the proposi- tion of the Senator from North Carolina, that the various charters for the corporations under which this road is to be built, and which are to have bc submitted to and approved I by Congress before the securities are handed over, and yet we debated it all day
Now, think proper guards and restrictions and provisions in an Important bill of- this kind should be looked into and provided for when people are quiet and can read over things and spell out things and put proper provisions in the bill, and not here, in open debate, when a man scarcely hears what is said
f never knew a bill of such importance as this pass through Congress without a reference to a com- mittee
I have thought it advisable to make a road to the Pacific ever since we undertook to settle the Territory of Oregon
I was on a committee of this body that reported in favor of it fifteen years ago
"L'hen, however, we were not able to build it
Now •,ve have become more able
I want to sec a bill drafted by a conunittee embracing the propositions that they approve; and it can be so digested t.hat wc can get a vote upon it much sooner than could by going on with debate i would instruct the conunit- here in the Senate
tee to report in a week
I want no delay
I think If they it is necessary to have such a report
report this bill back •willi two or three t.rifling amendrnents, it will be very soon disposed of; and if they can think of other amendments that ought to be put in it, it had better be matured in committee than in the whole Senate
Mr
BAKER
iV.1t•
President, the Senator from Rhode island does not meet what we say He, says that there has been a project about it
for a bill cvcr since Oregon was settled; and I apprehend that if it goes on at the rate at which it is going on, there will be n project for a bill, and that only, here, until Orcgon is depopulated
We tell him that sad experience shows that send- ing it to special committee kills it
Mr
SIMMONS
1 should like to know what authority the gentleman has for saying that send- ing tbe bill to comrnittee kil}s it
'I'he authority is the history of Mr
BAKER
Fifteen years since, according to his own staternent, we ought to have had s•cnnc kind of a bill
'W c havo got yet
The crentle- man from California says truly, that there have been, believe, six special comrnittees, and there is no bill passed yet
Now, i submit, as i did the other day—and hate to delay the Senato by submit to ali our friends, it' talking about it— they really are our friends, to follow the lead those who have the mall•er most at heart, a little
"I'he Senator from North Carolina presents very plausible objections
-Why
He wants to I kill the wholc bill
The Senator from Min l)esota is particularly anxious about thc state of the Union; and he is so anxious about the stale of the Union that hc wilk take no measure in the world to preserve it
Why
Boeause the routes here do not suit him, ana he wants to kill this bill; and I am sorry to say the same thing of my i friend, his colleague
Mr
WILKINSON
Do 1 understand the Sen- I ator to say that I want to kiH this bill
Mr
BAKER
I understand that my friend is so devoted to his own route that he is putting all I the obstacles he can in the way of this bill, until his reoute is iiR!luded in it
That is all I mean to say
I only ask that thcrc Inay be a direct vote amendment of the Senator frrnn North Carolina, taken upon the motion of the Senator from Min- requiring the several acts of incorporation to be nesota, to postpone the bill indefinitely
If it be examined and approved by Congress before the the pleasure of the Senate to kill the bill, let it be I I done, and let it perish in the face of day; but if money was Tiven
was a propor amendment
there shall- be a decided vote against that motion, and in favor of the bill, I ask, in common justice to the greatest measure that ever was before this Senate, that we shall go along calmly, deliber- ately, with as -much discussion as may be de- sired, in the face of the whole Senate, and meet the direct proposition, by way of amendment, either affrmat.ively or negatively, and end the whole matter; and, sir, I ask that it may be ended in such time that, if there be amendments which shall ultimately pass the Senate, they may be passed in such way and at such a season that they may go to the lower House with some chance of passage there
Mr
HARLAN
Mr
President, 1 think the objection which has been suggested to the bill as a reason for its reference to a select committee, by the Senator from Rhode Island, is not a valid one
By reading the proviso, on the 7th page, it will be seen that the drafters of this bill have attempted to provide against the very objection I ask that the Secretary that hc has suggested
read that proviso, commencing on the forty-ninth line of the 7th page
The Secretary read, as follows: Provided, "Phat said corporation or corporations shall have iit•ty mile sections of a railroad and teregraplr line, coni- pleted as herein mentioned, and sucb State or territoriai opinion ofthe Attorney General of the United States, render thc mortoage lien herein contemplated a legal securit.y 'Or the bonds advanced before lands or bonds shall be
conveyed by the Governinent of the United States
And the corpo- ration or corporations undertaking the service herein pro- vided shall agree to have five hundred miles of their road and telegraph line completed within six years after the passage of tilis act." Mr
HARLAN
That is all 1 wish to have read
It will
be seen here that the Government is not to udvancc a dollar of money nor an acre of land until, in the opinion of the Attorney Gen- eral, the Government will be perfectly safe in doing so; he having examined the chartersgranted by the 'erritorics through which tlie road is States proposed to e located; and also having exam- Ined all the facts, in a legal point of view, con- nected 'Nith the subject, so as to enable him to form the opinion that it will be perfectly safe to make this advance
Mr
SIMMONS
I understand that the mo- tion now is thc indcfinitc postponement of the a motion seconded by the Senator from Ore- o•on
Mr
IRAKICR
I want to brine it up; but want to vote against thc indefinite postponement
Mr SIMMONS
1 thought it singular that you should second a motion that you were going to vote against
Mr
BAKER
I thank the gentleman for put- ting me right if I was wrong; but I thought it very clear what I meant
Mr
SIMMONS
My friend from Iowa reads the provision in regard to finishing fifty Iniles of railroad as a suitable provision on which io pred- icate an outlay of and about as many acres of land
1 was in favor of the swygestion made by the Senator from North Carolina
He I do not know Ilia y be opposed to this road
but that he is in favor of it
All the Ilie believe that people can make will not, make I have been uniformly in that I am a«yainst it, ' favor of it fbr fifteen years, and n)ean to vote it; but I mean to meake it as perfect as I can be- I dare say many people can make fore I do vole

I shall be in favor of this bill, if theu•c are proper and decent provisions to securc the public
have heard many arguments made against facts; want but they never weigh much with me
some provision in this bill to show where these corporations derive their o.uthority, and from I do not whom, and whether it is leo•itimate
see, myself, how you are going to get an act of incorporation in the Indian country
It Inay be, perhaps, that the Indians can give one; but it what authority they can cut through an indian farm, without some power from thQ United States, I have endeavoæd to understand I do not see
this subject as well as I could
I wanted, in the room of the bill, two or three years ago, to sub- stitute a proposition to have all the routes actually  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE: 253 surveyed; and have United States surveyors do I thought then we had -not sufficient informa- it
tion to enable us to decide where to build these roads; but that was laid on the table by the par- ticular friends of tho measure, and somehow or other it never got up; but it was not by any op- position on this Sidc that it was not got up
Mr
G WIN
It was passed in the Senate, but killed in the I-louse
Mr
SINIMONS
I do not know where it wcnt to
I voted for it
Now, thc Senator from Ore-•• gon says that committees have destroyed this bill
The committees always have reported the bills; and i
they have been destroyed, it has been in open session, and not by any committee
There never has been a committee that did not try to make a good railroad bill, that ever I knew
You cannot force your bilk, that you make in the Scn- ate, through the House
Mr
BAKER
Will the Senator allow me
Mr
SIMMONS
Certainly
Mr
BAKER
1 did not mean to be under- stood, most certainly, that the committee would kill the bill, but sending it to the committee
I mean that the timo kills it
Mr
SIMMONS
1 said, when 1 favored this method, that I was willing to instruct the Com- mittee to report in one week
Ido not want them In my deliberate to have more time than that
.iudgment, it is the quickest way, and a great sav- mg of time, to send this bill to a committee
Mr
LANE
The motion now', I believe, is to postpone indefinitely all bills upon thc subject of a railroad to the Pacific
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The motion is to postpone indefinitely the bill under considera- tion
Mr
LANE
well, sir, 1 am in favor of a Pacific railroad, and have been for the last teri years; and I svould be glad if a bill to make such a road had passcd before
But, Mr
President} this bill is not such bill as, in my judgtnent, ever ought to pass any deliberativc body
it is as near a Bill of abominations as any ever (.l%xwn up by the skill of man, as I look at it
'I'here is I')0ta redeeming clause in the whole bill, if I read it cor- rectly
If has been offered here as a peace meas- ure, and urged as necessary to give pcacc to t.be country
Now, sir, if peace prcvaiied in the coun- try, if good W'ill existed between the sections, the passage of such.a measure as this would greatly disturb it, unless I be tnislaken; and it would be very near cause of breaking up thc Union itself; and yct it is offered as a peace measure
'I'he Senator from New York, [Mr
SEWARD,] if I rec- olkect aright, in Inaking his speech tbc other day, urging the passage of this bill, said it was a great peace measurc, necessary to restore harmony in the country
Violatc the rights of the States; refuse them equality; trample upon the Constitu- tion; disregard the decision of the Suprcmc Court, and do every other thing to the injury and op- pression of nearly half the States of this Union, and then come forward and say: We will buy you off; your principles are not worth much ; $36,000,000 will compromise the whole thing; and Is that the way to talk your principles may go.' to a people who believe they have been injured 
Is that the kind of measure that can restore peace in the country
Is the passing of a bill that is more objectionable than any one ever introduced into either branch of Congress—a measure that is to be a reward for all the injuries perpetrated upon independent and sovereign States of this is that the mode of making peace, that Union— gentlemen propose here
If so, I will say to my honorable friend that he has made a mistake; that he ha*d better retrace his steps; he had better say: 4' The irrepressible conflict that he desired to in- augurate shall be suppressed; shali be stopped now." Hc had better say: " The idca of put- ting slavery in course of ultimate extiHction shall be abandoned." And he had better say to the South: " We will Ict you alone in the enjoyment of your rights; the States of this Union arc equal, and have equal rights under the Constitution in the common territory of the country; and every man of every State has a right to go there with his property and have it protected." If he wiH do all this, and do it in earnest, and get his north- ern friends to go With him, they may say, as they have it in their power to do, " We were just trif- ling with you; we never had any intention to in- terfere with your rights; we know that you have the same right in thc common territory that we have; we knowr that all the principles and views of the Republican party are wrong; we resorted to them for thc sake of power; and now that we have succeeded in electing our man
we are will- ing to say to you, to the country, and to the world, that justice shall prevail." Then peace can be restored without undertaking to purchase it with rvfr
President, this is not the time to diseuss the I do not regard principles of this Government
this Governmentas a great consolidated Govern- ment—a national Government in which State lines are notknown or State sovereignty is not regarded
The other day, when the Senator from Oregon [Mr
BAKER] was on the floor, he took occasion to speak of this Government as a great consoli- dated Government in which States werc not known as such, or the sovereignty of States not con- sidered entitling thern to rights, if I understood him aright; but I have not read his speech
The idea was, that thc States had no rights securcd to them; that it was a great Government in itself, without reference to States 01' Stat.e sovereignty
Now, sir, I took occasion to look over the Con- stitution a little afterwards, and I found in the nineteen articles of the Constitution, including the amendments, that States are specially mentioned over thirty times; that State sovereignty is recoo nized over that rnany times; that States are rofer- red to; and I think any rnan, who has examined the question, will say that it is a Government of States, a confederation of States, a voluntary as- sociation of States; and as the Senator from Ohio [Mr
PUGH] so handsomely said: the Atlas upon which this Union rests, is the sovereignty of these 'I'his Government is an agent created by States
them, by their voluntary consent
r l'herefore„ it is a voluntary association of States, cach of them E having equal rights in tho Union
Respect them as such; regard them as such; main tail') that per- fect equality; maintain justice, and deal fairly by every man of over y State of the Union; recognize every State alike, and peace can be restored with- out the passage oc this bill
It is hardly the time to pass such a measure
I did not intend to say anything about the ques- tion of government, or of the equality of States; but in connection with the remarks made by the Senator from Ncw•York, I have incidentally al- But, sir, this bill is pressed at a ino- laded to it

'I'hese are rights and pos,vers that they believe they have, whether it is so or not
Can you expect at such a time to restore peace by passing this bill
If the country was in a peaceful con- think not

My desire through life hag been and shall be,- to deal justly, fairly, and honestly by every portion of this Confederacy; and i will say to the Senator from New Hampshire, or any other Senator from a northern Staté, that if any constitutional- right should be refused his State, no living man would rush sooner than myself, to the restoration, Or I live north—further maintenance of his right

Though this country is about breaking up, and, as I believe, this rail- road bill cannot save it, or restore peace, nor pre- vent the action of the States that believe it their duty to go out, J desire it understood by all par- ties, from every portion of the country, that that dissolution, if it takes place, ought to be a peace- If wo will not deal fairly by our south- ful one

POSTPONEMENT OF TERRITORIAL BUSINESS
Mr

I must object to the postponement of territorial business, unless there is some reason for it

I know of no reason for postponing the territorial busi- ness, unless it be to •wrait for the report of the special committee of thirty-three

Mr

A week ago the Committee on Military Affairs was instructed to make certain inquiries, with leave to report at any time
I now report from that committee a letter from the Secretary of War, accompanied by a statement as to the distribution of arms during the past year to the States, the arms sold, and the condition of the arsenals and other public property in tho port of Charleston
There are a good deal of rumors, and speculations, and misapprehensi01') as to the true state of facts in regard to this matter
The committee
has instructed me to report to the House, and to ask that the statement be printed and recommitted to the Committee on Military Affairs
It was so ordered
MESSAGE FROM 'I'llE PRESIDENT
The SPEAKER laid before the House the fol- lowing message from the President of the United States: To the Senate and House of Representatatioes: At thc opening of your present session I called your attention to the dangers which threatened the existencc of the Union
I expressed mv opinion freely concerning the original causes of those dan- gers, und recommended such measures as I be- lieved would have the effect of tranquilizing the country and saving it from the peril in which it had been needlessly and most unfortunat.ely in- volvcd
Those opinions and recommendations I do not propose now to repeat
My own convic- tions upon the whole subject remain unchanged
The fact that a great calamity was impending over the nation was even at that time acknowl- edo•ed by every intelligent citizen
It had already Inade itself felt throughout the length and breadth of' the land
T hc necessary consequences of the alarm thus produced were most deplorable
The imports fell off with a rapidity never known be- fore, except in time of war, in the history of our foreign commercc; the Treasury was unexpect- edly left without the means which it had reason- ably counted upon to meet the public engage- ments; trade was paralyzed; manufactures were stopped; the best public securities suddenly sunk in the market; every species of property depre- ciated moie or less; and thousands of poor men, who depended upon their daily labor for their daily bread, were t.urnod out of employment
I deeply regret that I am not able to give you any information upon the stateofthe Union which is more satisfactory than •„vhat I was then obliged to communicate
On the contrary, matters are still worse at present than they then were
When Congress met, a strong hope pervaded the whole public mind that some amicable adjust- ment of the subject would speedily be made by the representatives of the States and of the peo- ple, which might restore peace between the con- flicting sections of the country
That hope has been diminished by every hour of delay; and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fades  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
295 away, the public distress becomes more and more aørrravated
As evidence of this, it is only neces- stu•y to say that the Treasury notes, authorized by the act of 17th of December last, were adver- tised according to the law, and that no respons- ible bidder offered to take any considerable sum at par at a lower rate of interest than twelve per cent
From these facts it appears that, in a Gov- ernment organized like ours, domestic strife, or even a well-grounded fear of civil hostilities, is more destructive to our public and private inter- csts than t.he most
formidable foreign war
In my annual message, I expressed the con- viction, which I have long deliberately held, and which recent reflection has only tended to deepen and confirm, that no State has a right, by itsown act, to secede from the Union, or throw off its Federal obligations at pleasure
I also declared my opinion io be, that even if that right existed, and should be exercised by anyState of the Con- federacy, the executive department of this Gov- ernment had no authority, under the Constitu- tion, to recognize its validity by acknowledging the independence of such State
This left me no alternative, as the chief cxecutive oflicer under thc Constitution of the United States, but to col- lect the public revenues, and to protect the public property, so far as this might be practicable un- der existing laws
This is still my purpose
My province is to execute, and not to make, the laws
It belongs to Congress, exclusively, to repeal, to modify, or to enlarge their provisions, to meet exiccncies as they may occur
I possess no dis- pow'er
I certainly had no right to make aggressivc war upon any Slate; and I am perfectly satisfied that tbc Constitution has wisely withheld that poxve.r even from Congress
But the right and the duty to use military force defensively aoainst t.hosc who resist the Federal officers in the execution of their legal functions, and againsl those who assail the property of the Federal Government, is clear and undeniable
But the dangerous and hostile attitude of the States towards each other has already far trans- cended and cast in the shade the ordinary execu- tive duties already provided for by law, an(l has assumed such vast and alarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond executive control
The fact cannot be disguised that we are in the midst of a great revolution
In all its various bearings, therefore, I commend the question to Congress, as the only human tribunal, under Providence, possessing the power to meet the existing emercre.ncy
r l'o thern exclusively belongs the power to declare war, or to authorize the enhploymentof military force in all cases con- templatcd by the Constitution; and they alone possess the power to remove grievances which might lead to wm•, and to secure peace and union to this distracted country
On them, and on them vinced, that the secession movement has been chiefly based upon a misapprehension at the South of the sentiments of the majority in several of the northern States
Let the question be transferred from political assemblies to the ballot-box, and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievances which the South have suffered
But, in Heaven's name, let the trial be made be- före we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there is no other •alternative
Time is a great conservative power
Let us pause at this momentous point, and afford the people, both north and south, an opportunity for reflec- tion
Would that South Carolina had been con- vinced of this truth before her precipitate action ! I thcrefore appeal through you to the people of the country to declare m their might that the Union must and shall be preserved by all con- stitutional means
I most earnestly recommend that you devote yourselves, exclusively, to the question how this can be accomplished In peace
All other questions, when compared to this, sink into insignifieance
The prcsent is no time for palliations
Action, prompt action, is required
A delay in Congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for concilia- tion, may drive us to a point from which it will be almost impossiblc to recede
A common
ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produced, is surely not unattain- 'I'he proposition to compromise by letting able
the North have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line, and to give southern institu- tions protection below that line, ought to receive In itself, indeed, it rnay universal approbation
not be entirely satisfactory; but when the alter- native is between a reasonable concession on both sides and a destruction of the Union, it is an im- pucation upon the patriotism of Congress to assert that its members will hesitate for a moment
In several Even now the danger is upon us
of the States which have not yet seceded , the forts, arsenals,and maøazines ofthc United States, have been seized
This is by far the most serious step which has been taken since the commencement of the troubles
This public property has long been left without garrisons and troops for its protec- tion ; because no person doubted its security under the flag of the country in any State of the Union
Besides, our small Army has scarcely been sufli- cient to ffuard our remote frontiers tvainst Indian incursions
The seizure of this property, from all appearances, has bccn purely aggressive, and not in resistance to uny attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the Union
At the begmnmg of these unhappy troubles, I determined that no act of mine sl'iould increase the excitement in either section of the country
If the political conflict were to end in a civil war, it was my determined purpose not to commence it, nor even to furnish an excuse for it by any act after this movement, from which the following is an exti•a-ct: will add, as my many: things con#inééd me that the authorities of the State
designed tp a hostile act." Evidently referring to the orders, dated Decem- ber II, of the late Secretary of War
Under this impression, I could not hesitate that it my solemn duty to move mv command from a fort Which we could not probably have held longer than forty-eight or sixty hours, to this one, where my powér of resistance Is increased to a very great degree." It will be recollected that the concluding part of these orders was in the following terms: The smallness of your force will not permit -you, pet- haps, to occupy more tha-ii one of' the three forts but an attack on or attempt_to take possession ofeither one ofthem will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you
rnay deem • most proper to increase its power of resistance
You are also authorized to take similar defensive steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a-hos- tile act." It said that serious apprehensions are, tQ some extent, entertained, in' which I do not
share-, that the peace of this District may be disturbed before the 4th of March next, In any event, it will be my duty to • preserve it, apd this duty shall be performed
In conclusion, it may be permitted to me to re- mark, that I have often warned my countrymen of the dangers which now surround us
This may be the last time I shall refer to the subject omcially
I feel that my duty has been faithfully, though it may be imperfectly, performed; and, whatever the result may be, I shall carry to my grave tho consciousness that I at least meant well for my country

Under its shadow American cit- izens have found protection and respect in all lands beneath the sun
If we dcscerld to coy)sid- orations of pnrely material interest, when, in the history of-all time, has a confederacy been bound together by such strong ties of mutual interest
Each portion il is dependent on alf, and all upon cach portion, for prosperity and domestic SQCU rity
Free trade throughout the whole sup- plies the wants of one portion from the produc- lions of another, and scatters wealth everywhere
The great planting and farming States require the aid of the commercial and navigating States, to questions at issue between the Nort.h and the South
Entertaining this conviction, I refrained even from sending reinforcements to Major Rn- derson, who comtnanded the forts in Charleston harbor, until an absolute necessity for doing so should make itself apparent, lest it might unjustly be regarded as a menace of military coercion, and thus furnish, if not a provocation, at least a pre- text for an outbreak on the part of South Caro- lina
No necessity for these reinforcements I was assured by distinguished seemed to exist
and upright gentlemen of South Carolina, that no attack upon Major Anderson was intended; but that, on the contrary, it was the desire of the State authorities, as much as it was rny own, to I avoid the fatal consequences which must eventu- send their productions to domestic and foreign ally follow a military collision

the *ule of the House now, that part of the resolution would be unimportant and unne- cesÉäry
The; fact that a committee can make but ono- report, undef the rules of the House, on one subject, niükes
necessary the instructions which- the- gentleman now seeks to have agreed the committee authority t.o report more frequently than once
I prcscnt that point to t.hc Chair, because am satisfied that the Chair mis- conceives the point which I presented
I believe that the Chair will rule that, unless there be authority given to the committee now proposed to bc raised when it reports once, if will be dis- charged
That is the universal law applied to special committees
Ira committee reports once, and -is discharged, then it -has no further power or duty in the nrcmiscs

Mr
Speaker, the practice, since I have been a member of this House, has been, in regard to the reception of reports from committees, if I -recollect aright, to rcccive reports in part

He points us to the fact that the public credit is prostrate and almostal together destroyed
He recommends that we shall direct our attention to devise some
remedy to restore the fraternal rela- tions which ought to exist between the States of this Confederacy; and his recommendation is en- titled to the highest respect of the American peo- plc
But, sir, we have here a motion to refer the message to a select committee, with instructions to indict somebody

The com- mittcc is already brokon up
The SPEAKER
The gentleman from Ken- tuck y will observe that the resolution is not yet before the House
Mr
HOUSTON
Then 1 object to its being recei ved
Mr
DIVIAN
In order to whether this committee of thirty-throe is doing anything, or whether it has failed entirely to operate, as is said to be the case, I call upon the chairman of that committec to state whether the commiltco has agreed any report; when it met last; •what number of members attended its meetincr• and other particulars, which may be calculated to shed some light upon the probable result of the action of that committee 
Mr
MAYNARD
1 have not yielded the floor
I am not member of that committee, and profess to have no knowledge of its proceedings; but I do know that, under the rules, they cannot report until all the committec.s are callcd, and the special committee is reached in the ordinary way
It is important that they should have leave t.o report their action or non-action
The committee ought not to be kept in abeyance
We ought to know thc result of their labors
Mr
BURNETT
1 have been just informed by the gentleman from Arkansas, a member of that committee, that there is not the remotest prob- ability of that committee twreeing
That the case, and the committee being broken up, a large number of the members from the southern States having withdrawn from it, I appeal to the gentleman from Tennessee, whether it is politic and wise to continue the committee, and to confer upon it a power to report at any time, and that too, when there is not the remotest probability that they ever will make a report

CIVIL APPROPRIATION BILL
Mr
SHERMAN
1 move that the rules be suspended, and that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, to take up bill No
895, making appro- priations for certain civil expenses of the Gov- ermuent for the year ending the 30th of June, 1862
Before that motion is put, I move to make that bill a special order in committee
Mr
CRAMTFORD
1 desire to ask the chair- man of the Committee of Ways and Means, whether it is his purpose to allow no general debate upon any appropriation bills
Mr
SHERMAN
1 have, on two occasions, proposed to allow debate upon appropriation bills, and in both cases both sides of the House com- bined to .vote down the proposition
I am per- fectly willing to do so whenever the House ex- presses such a desire
But my impression is that we bettor any general debate until after we get through our appropriation bills, and then there will be time •for debate
Mr
BOCOCK
After the appropriation bills are disposed of, what wili there be upon which general debate will be in order
Mr
SHERMAN
1 think that if we pass the appropriation bills this week, next week, or the week after, general debate may be had upon the report of the committee of thirty-three, or upon the President's message
I desire to get the appro- priation bills out of the way
Mr
CRAWFORD
At what time does the gentleman propose to take up the Army bill
Mr
SHERMAN
1 shall move to the Navy bill to-day or to-morrow, and the Army bill immediately after that is disposed of
Mr
CRAWFORD
understand, then, that the gentleman from Ohio intends, during the pres- ent wcck, to dispose of the Navy and the Army appropriation bills
Mr
SHERMAN
1 propose to dispose ofthem as rapidly as 1 can; but the House can control its own movements
Mr
CRAWFORD
The gentleman under- stands very well that, having the power to deny debate, by calling the l)revious question upon any proposition he liluy Inake, he can carry the bills through t.his week; and I desire to understand whether or not wc shall have an opportunity to debate the Army and Navy bills
We want debate upon one or the other of those bills; and I would like to havo them left open for general debate
Mr
SHERMAN
As a of course can debate the details of these bills as we go along; and 1 think we ought to pass these appropriation bills before we enter upon general debate
Mr
REAGAN
dition now, as, it seems to me, to require that somc expression of opinion should be made by the members of this House; and] hope the chairman of the Committee
of *Ways and Means will leave the naval appropriation bill open for general de- bate, at least for a short time
Some of us may be called away, and wc may desiro to make some It seems to me that suggestions before we leave
the country requires that we should not smother all general debate
I want to call thc Mr
CLARK, of Missouri

SHERMAN, to make the bill a special order, was agreed to
The question recurred on Mr
SHERMAN'S mo- tion, that the House resolve itself into tbc Com- mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union; and being put, it was agreed to
The House accordinosly resolved itself into the Committee of the Wholeon the state of the Union, (Mr
in theehair,) and proceeded to Ehe consideration of the special order, being at bil (H
R
No
895) making appropriations for Stins dry civil expenses of the Gövernment for the year ending the 30th Of June, 1862
The bill, at the request of Mr
PHELPS, wag read in catenso
The Clerk then proceeded to read it by clauses, for amendment
Mr
ELIOT
I -move to amend -the first-clause of the bill by striking out $100,000," -and ine serting " $250,000" in lieu thereof; so as to make it read : Survey of the coast.—For continuing the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the thiited Ståtes; (including- compensation Of civilians engaged in the work, and ex- cluding pay and emoluments of offcers Of the Army and Navy, and petty omcers and men of the Navy, empiOyed On the work,) $250,000
Mr
Chairman, it seems to -me that there are three amendments to this bill which the commit- tee oucrht to adopt
The- first of halve just offerea
I have done it because ofa communica- tion which have received from the Superintend- ent of the Coast Survey, in which he says that the, estimates made by the Department for this service have been so much reduced by the Com- mittee of Ways and Means in this bill, that the operations of his dcpurtment will be very scri- ously interfered with
I find, by an examination of the estimat.es of the Department, that thero are nine sections of the coast embraced in the first clause of the bill now under consideration
The appropriations asked for are: for the northern part of the coast, $76,000; and for the southern about one hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars
Mr
MAYNARD
1 desire to ask the gentle- man from Massachusetts.if he has any idea what will be the expense of the coast survey, includ- ing all the expenditures already incurred since the commencement of the work, down to its comple- tion, so far as any completion Ivas ever contem- plated 
Mr
ELIOT
I cannot answer that question
Mr
MAYNARD
Will it not be than it would cost to pay for the entire amount of the soil of the country, at the rates at which it is now held in the market
Mr
ELIOT
The gentleman from Tennessee has the same means of information upon the sub- ject as I have
I cannot reply to that question
I was going on to say that $250,000 is asked for; #70,000 for the northern coast, and $176,000 for the southern coast
A detailed estimate is given, showing how this money is to be expended and where
think, Mr
Chairman, that so long as we have omcers of this Government whose duty it is to furnish to the Department detailed estimates, we ought not to withhold the appropriations asked for, unless there is some good reason for with- holding them
My object is not so much to have a debate upon this question as to call upon the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means to say whether there is, in his judgment, a good reason, and what that reason is, for withholding the appropriation asked for
If we are to prosecute this work -at all, we ought to provide the means sufficient, in the judgment of the Department who have this matter in charge, to prosecute it successfully and properly
I desire to ask the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means whether there is any reason, and i
so, that reason is, for reducing the estimate from $250,000 to and whether, in the judgment of the Committee of Ways and Means, the sum of $100,000 would enable the Coast Survey to continue successfully the work upon which they are now engaged along the northern, and especially along the middle and southern, Atlantic coast 
Mr
SHERMAN
I supposed the gentleman from Massachusetts knew very well that there was a necessity for decreasing the expenditures of the Government
The Committee of Ways and Means did not know what to strike at better than this Coast Survey
W c had to choose between a reduction of the cost of this survey and its entire I think that in this period of financial suspension
and political disturbance we had better suspend the operationsofthis CoastSurvcy
The Committee of I •ways and Means were not, however, prepared for tha.t radical change, and they agreed to allow one i half of what was asked for, to continue the work  298 where.most needed
The amount estimated by the: Superintendent of the Coast Survey for the survey of the Atlantic and Gülfcoast was $250,000
That would enable him to carry on his operations upon Che same basis that he has done during the present fiscal yean
• But it is very easy to dimin- Ish -the force employed one half, and carry on the survey only at particular, localitieN where it has not heretofore been carried forward., The Super- intendentxni#t expend $120,000 judiciously; and he ought to b
confined to that sum
I can give no other -reason for the action of the Committee of Ways and Means
The matter was fully con- Sidered, and this reduction was deemed a matter of-absolute necessity
Mr
ELIOT
I do not understand that the Com- mittée of Ways and -Means have reported the amount which tho chairman has indicated
The sum reported is $120,000
The amount estimated forby the Department is $250,000
Whatl want to know is, whether the work now in operation upon these nine sections of the coast can be done fbr the amount appropriated in the
bill
Mr
SHERMAN
My friend from Massa- chusetts will see that the third item of the bill is an appropriation of $20,000 for the survey of the Florida reefs, which makes up the sum of $120,000 for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts
Mr
ELIOT
It seems to me that one of two policies ought to be pursued—either to stop the work or continue it in such a way as that the force now employed can be successfully continued
It seems to me that this is not the time to discon- tinge appropriations for this purpose
It seems to me•-ninently important that thc survey of the coast should be continued, and that this work, go 
admirably and thoroughly pcrformed upon one part of out' coast, should continued on others
I hopc my amendment will meet with the favor of the committee
Mr
QUARLES
1 am opposed to the amend- ment of' the gentlunan from Massachusetts, [ Mr
ELIOT,] and I would ask Illim if, in his judgment, the Treasury of the country is in a condition 10 justify an increase of the appropriations for this year upon the last, I sec from the estimates that the appropriation last year for this purpose was $250,000; and if the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts sl'iould prevail, it would be this year $290,000, and that at a time when it is known that we are paying tweive per cent
for money to meet the ordinary current expenses of the Government
Seventeen years aøo we appro- prialed $100,000 fbr this very sarne purpose; and annually, from that time, a sin-lilar appropriation has boon made, and the appropriation has in- creased in amount, Where thig thing to stop 
Is the survey of our coast never to terminate 
In the estimate
covered by this appro )riation there is provision madc for the survey of coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts
Is this to become one of the permanent appropriations of the Goveri)ment
It was not originally so in- let) dcd
I think that, so ihr from adopting the tunell(l Incnt of the gentlernan frorn Massachusetts, we should strike out the entire appropriation, and suspend this branch of (he public service unt.il the condition of the country will justify its being taken up and carried on to completion
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9, Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 do not wish to detain the committee any length of time in pre- senting any views on the question which this amendment proposes; but I think that the whole question which the appropriation bill presents at this point, is one of significant importance, and one which should receive the calm deliberation of the committee, so that they may specifically vote with intelligence and judgment upon it
has been alleged, sir, inferentially, that this great prftect is unwise, and, as a Government project, use ess to the country
I infer that that is the judgment of gentlemen who have addressed the committee thus far, in opposition to the scheme, from the fact that it is stated that probably the expenses of this survey, when it shall havc been completed, will be equal to the value of the whole land of the United States, at its present valuation
Well, sir, and what if it be so
I presume that, when completed, the influence of that survey will, in fact, duplicate the present value of all the land of the United States
' Rhe value of that land de- pends not only on its capacity for production , but on the value of that produce in the markets of the world; and it is intended, by this improvement, to afford facilities for the transportation of that produce to every market of the world
Would the gentlemen Vt.'ho oppose this appropriation take a deliberate position here, before this committee, and before thc world, that the United States of America shall be commercially isolated
That it s)'lalk be, by an embargo in the law of the land, prevented from transporting its produce to the commercial markets of the world
Why, Sir, such a proposition would be absurd—would be legislatively preposterous—and a gentleman svho would rnuke it would be at one pronounced a maniac or madman
And yet, in its ultimatum and extremity, foolish and absurd as would be that proposition, it is equally applicable in a pro- portionatc degree t.o tho proposition that the ex- pensiveness of this Coast Survey is an obstacle to Its further prom•ess
Sir, it
is efléctually wise, it is a mark of en- lar«yed legislation, that the country should embark in proiects of this kind
it is not only the safety of the'land, but it is the safety of the approach to tho land, which conununicntes value and ilnpart.s character to the cou n try
Were we, buta weather- beaten rock, to be approached by shoals, that rock would be valueless in the eye of ail nations
It
would be unapproachable
Were we a cullivated parcel of property, with a salubrious climate, in- vit.irj(r emigration to all parts of the world, and every local part of the land, whether disjected or retained in their orbits .at•ound the confederate center
Every par! will equally feel hereafter the benefits of this work
Therefore it is, sir, that if the Capacity of the national exchequer is to be dis- tended to its ultimate limits, it should be in order that the requisition of the head of this depart- ment may be fulfilled and complied with
For such considerations as these, which might be magnified and dilated upon to apy extent here this day, I shall cast my vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts
Mr
MAYNARD
In my opinion there
is a very wide difference between surveying the coast, and the Coast Survey
The gentleman from New York has made a very sensible ar&urnent, as ho always does when he undertakes to talk sense, [laughter,] on the importance of surveying the coast, and of giving to the country and to the commercial world charts of the topography and hydrography of our shores
I suppose there can be no two opinions on that subject
Bub the Coast Survey is another and a very different It is a sort of mythical establishment which has in some way attached itself to this great Government
It is sucr«yested that it is a sort of barnacle which has fastened itself on the operations of the Government; and which, under prctcnse of surveying the coasts, amuses itself at almost any and all kinds of occupation; concern- irp itself with making celestial observations; con- cerning itself in the operations of observatories as far in the interior as the city of Albany, and I know not in what else besides
I am for having our coasts surveyed
They ought to have been surveyed long ago
I verily believe, and I havc no hesitation in asserting, that if the money which has been afroady expended for this purpose had been judiciously and prudently and economically expended, we could have had every reef on our coast surveyed from onc ocean to the other
I regard this as a great abuse—as one, sir, that ought to be lopped off; and, as has been well suw«restcd by t.he gentleman from Ohio, the chair- rnal) of the Committcc 'of Ways and Means, it is a question whether the service ought not to bc cat off altogether
I might be, in favor of that policy if it
wore proposed
_l\t
all events, I anl now in favor of reducing the Coast Survey service within some reasonable, some comprehensible i dimensions
Let it be so arranged that we may understand the extent to which this annual leak is to be carried
I am unwilling to say, herc in my place, what m,vcre yet inaccessible by reason of dangerous i I have good evidence of as to tbc operations of navigation, equally valueless would be our soil, equally ineffc.rent would be our geographical posi- tion
It is essential, sir, in order to impart char- actet•, in order to give to ourselves a position in the estimation of the civilized commercial •world, and in order to enhance the value of our soil and its products, that we should, by incrcased facilities, the danger of access to our coasts, so that we (_•.an safi•ly transport prod ucc to our shores, and fronl O\.u• shores all over the world wherever want is fi)lt and want is to bc supplied
Now, in regm•a to this Coast Survey, it has been •of great value to this country
It has been o
great value not only to the country at large, but to every class occupyino• its vast area; not only I have no data on which to estimate the amount to every class, but there is not an individual in thc Coast Survey; but suffice it to say here that my reasons are sufficiently cogent to induce me to oppose the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr
EL10T,] and to offer at the proper tirne the amendment which i now hold in my hand
When the pending amendment is dis- posed of, I NVill send it to the Clerk's desk; and 
when it is read I think it will commend itself to the approval ot• tbc commiltee
Mr
STANTON
The district
which 1 have tho honor to represent upon this floor has no particular interest in the Coast Survey of the Uni- ted States; but, sir, I do not myself believe we ought to suspend necessary and proper appro- priations for carrying on its operations on account ofa temporary in tho finances of the alroady appropriåted for this very a-hast Survey
t.ho land, however humble he may be, who quaffs Government
If it be urged, as a good reason But* find that, so long as seventeen years acro, his water, or partakes of his food, or is clothed for not making this appropriation, that the Gov- there was only $100,000 appropriated for it; and i with apparel, who has not felt, and who does not ernment has now to pay a heavy percentage for I venture the asscrtion that the expense has been continue to feel, the advantage of this treat im- money, would it not apply, as an equally good increased instead of diniiniabcd cvcry year since provetnent.
Every rock renr»ved is n humanita- reason, to all other appropriations
This Coast then; while, of course, the extent of coast to be rian accomplishment
Ever v shoal pointed out is Survey servicc is pursued upon a line of policy surveyed has been regularly diminishing
I f' for the benefit of human lite, as well as for the ad- long acro adopted, and which has been adhered $100,000 was enough seventeen years ago, when vantage of human acquisition
It cannot be con- to fi)l' a series of years
The arranoemcnts and there was no part of the coast surveyed, I want cealed, that if we take the view of this subject which estimates of the Coast Survey offe,e have been to know why can the department not naanage to II legislators should take, it is of greathnportancethat adapted to that policv
The expenditures for the year, provided for in ihis bill, are predicated upon do with that amount now
I-lave we as much this Coast Survey should be not only rnaintained, coast to survey now as we had seventeen years but that
it should bc increased
It is felt not only those for preceding years
Gentlemen will see, ago
Ilave we made no progress in the survey
along our Atlantic shore, and thc Gulf shore, an(l if we adopt the proposition reducing the appro- Why i* it that this amount will not do us now, when it was enough for us seventeen years acro 
If I had time to examine, I could perhaps furnish to the committee something as to the amount expendcd
As intimated by my colleague, [Mr
MAYNARD, I I venture to say that if this thing goes on, the su r vey of tl'le water linc will cost more than the whole territory of the United States

299 the persons engaged in it, the material employed in it, and everything connected with it
The gentlemen of the Coast Survey service have stated that, upon the present.rate of expenditures, the survey of the Atlantic and the Gulf coast would be completed within eight or ten years; and Congress, for the past five or six years, have been acting on the idea that such a scale of expend- iture ought to be pursued, in order that the work may be brought to a close within the period fixed
I hardly suppose that any gentleman contem- plates the permanent suspension of the work
It IS a work Indispensable to the commercial inter- ests of the country; and the commercial interests of the country are intimately connected with all other interests
An increase of insurances oper- ates unfavorably upon the prices of agricultural productions
The whole country is interested in bringing about a state of things that will insure cheap commerce—that is, cheap transportation, cheap freights, and cheap insurance
I do not see anything in the existing condition of the Treasury, anything in our present affairs, which calls for this particular reduction of ex- penditure
I see no special reason why we should not proceed upon the system which has been adopted after full discussion and pursued for a series of years
At every session of Congress since I have been a member this subject has been regularly gone over, tbc same arcrumcnts have been advanced and met, and the House Was uni- formly arrived at tho same conclusion; and that is, to pursue the existing svstem of expenditure
I do not myself see, because there is a temporary suspension of imports and exports, and conse- quently a temporary reduction of the revenues ot the Government—difficulties which in all human probability must pass away in a short time—I say 1 do not see what occasion there is for sus- pending• this or any other considerablc portion of it
The Committee of -yvays and Means pro- pose to reduce the appropriation to one half of am opposed to it, be- the usual expenditure
cause it is opposed to what has been and still is the settled policy of the Government
We have acted on that policy, as I have already stated, for I think that the full appropriation years past
IS cssential to the successful prosecution of the work
At all events, I think in thc long run it will be best to pursue this system of expenditure, and bring the work to a speedy close
I do not propose to occupy the tin)e of the c.otn- I mittee unnecessarily
Let the vote be taken
will sustain the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, because it follows the estimates of the Secretary of the Treasury, and is neces- sary to carry on the existing arrancements
Mr
STEVENS, of Nit
Chan- in Europe
The system of economy has
been strict; and if I were called upon to point to a bureau in this Government where all the require- ments of faithful public servants, in respect to the supervision of the expenditures of the public money are completely answered, I would point to the Coast Survey, I have risen, sir, simply to make this brief state- ment
As I observed when I rose, I am very fa- miliar with the operations of this Coast Survcy
have followed it for long years
I know its progress upon the Atlantic, and upon the Pacific; and I would consider it a blow at the commercial prosperity of this country—a blow at the wisdom and prudence of the Government—if its operations were even partially suspended
trust, therefore, that the amendment Qf the gentleman from Mas- sachusetts, [Mr
ELIOT,] will be agreed to
Mr
PHELPS
Mr
Chairman, having con- curred in the recommendation of the Committee of Ways and Means for the reduction of this ap- propriation, I will
now briefly state the reasons which led mk) to that course
Some twelve or fif- teen years ago, the expenses of the Coast Survey to the Government was from a hundred to a hun- dred and fifty thousand dollars per annum, and no more
The• estimates submitted to the House at this time by the Secretary of the Treasury for the coast survey of all the coasts of the United States, together with the incidental expcnses connected therewith, amounts to the sum of $457,800
The Committee of Ways and Means coricluded to re• duce that amount; and they have reduced the total estimates for the Coast Survey to the sum of reduction of little mue than fifty per cent
The Treasury, twelve 0k' fifteen years ago, was in afar better condition than it is at this timc
At that time the credit of the United States was good, and its securities commanded par, or a pre- mium
At the present time, when your Secretary of the Treasury invites proposals for the purchase of $5,000,000 of Treasury notes, you have a tender of loans of less than threc million dollars, and that at a rate of interest ransring from eight to thirtv- six per cent
per annt.un•, and you ai•e able to ob- tain the whole sum only at an average interest of twelve per cent
Under these circumstances, the Committee of Ways and Meuns believed it their duty to curtail and reduce the cxpenscs of the Government where ever it could bc done, and to endeavor to restore the expenditures upon this hend to what they formet•ly were
Whcn the Treasury was over- flowing; when there was an abundance of money, c very one felt disposed—at Icast those favorable to a continuation of the Coast Survey and its com- pletion—to appropriate as much rnoney as could be reasonably expended during the ensuing fiscal • - year; and oftentimes we made
appropriations ranging frorn four hundred and fifty to five hun- man, I propose to occupy the atteuLion of the I trust that II dred thousand dollars
But for the last three committee only for few moments
the arnendment of the gentleman frotY) Massachu- years the Govermnent has been continually in the market borrowing money
At the same time, setts will receive the sanction of this committee
1 am somewhat familiar with the operations of your revenue has diminished, and a majority this House has evinced their determination, by the Coast Survey, and I am sonlewhat familiar with the rigid economy exercised in the applica- giving away the public lands to those who choose to settle on them, to strike down the receipts of tion of the fund to the special object of the appro- I venture to say that in no other de- the Treasury daring the nextfiscal priation
partment of the Government has there been equal In other words, you did, by that measure, cut economy, or equal success in the application of off one twentieth portion of the revenue of the the public money
I venture to say that in no il Government; for the receipts from the sales of other service, at home or abroad, has there been I the public lands (luring the next
fiscal year arc so little diversion to matters purely of an abstract estimated at the sum of $3,000,000, The receipts from the customs for the last three I will go further, and say that no man 
character
can show that there has been the diversion of or four years have been inadequate to meet the ordinary expenses of the Government; and during onc cent of this money to purposes not essential, not indispensable, to the Coast Survey
We arc i the last two years the debt of the country has engaged in a survey of the coasts of the United been increased $50,000,000, and we are still bor- rowimr money
The Governmcnt is very much States, and we have to have celestial observations in the condition of an embarrassed merchant

notes, because we could do no bett.er
Even of the It is essential to observe the celestial bodies
It is last, $20,000,000 loan proposed to be raised to rc- essential to have observatories
Besides reducin« the expense, the use of the electric telegraph has deem 'l'reasury notes, you have realized less than I wish, | of the $10,000,000 advertised: and the vagtly increased the accuracy of results
sir, that a special committee of this House could bidders for the residue have refused to pay the after the close: of that war, therevenues increased, under the tariff of •1846; and, gome-siX yea_rdag.o, the inquiry was, what shall we do with the surplus
We were raising more revenue thaw was cient for the ordinary expenses of the
Govern- ment; and the securities of the Government were bought at sixteen per cent
premium
• Now:they are below par
I ask, then, if the committee is to be reproached because they bring forward a proposition to reduce the expenses of the Gov- ernment
I ask if any great distress is_to befall the country if the Coast Survey be prosecuted in a way not quite so magnificent or so expens- ive as the last- year
I ask if there, to be -any suffering except to the employés of the COast Survey
And they are the men who, duri6g each session of Congress, when we come to act upon the appropriation for the continuæion of the sur- vey, throng the hotels and boarding-houses of Washington, and raise a clamor that we are strik- ing down the prosecution of a magnificent work
There i* where all, complaint comes from.
You would have heard no complaint uttered in this Hall if it had not been for the employés in Coast Survey; 1 do not say the Superintend- ent of the Coast Survey, but those connected with it
There is still a necessity, if this Government keeps together, that we go into the market and bor- row more money; for the Treasury notes we have authorized to be issued will afford an inadequate supply for the ordinary and necessary expenses of carrying on the Government
We must resort to and negotiate the balance of the loan aut.horized by the act: of last Congress; and even then; if your commerce remains in its present depressing condi- tion, we cannot ne(F0tiate it exce_pt at a ruinous rate of interest
The only remedy, then, is this: to reduce the expenditures wherever they can be In this particular j I think, properly reduced
they may well be reduced for the ensuing fiscal I am willing to say, if the Treasury was year
full, and there was an abundance of money, I should feel no disposition to disturb the estimates of appropriations submitted to us upon this head
I may furthermore say that, if peace and quiet can be given to this country and prosperity Shall prevail, at the next session of Congress, un- der such' circumstances, I would be willing to make additional appropriations for this service for the ensuing fiscal year, if such appropria- tions shall be needed, and can be judiciously expended
These are the reasons which have induced mc, as a mcmber of the Committee of Ways and Means, to reduce this appropriation
The reduc- lion is about fifty per cent
upon the total estimate submitted to us for the prosecution of this Coast Survey
Mr
SHERMAN
For the purpose oflimiting debate to five minutes upon amendments, I move that the committee rise
Mr
PHELPS
1 would suggest to the gentle- man from Ohio that, as this debate is legitimate thus far, and as the whole subject-matter is still under consideration, he will not close debate now
Mr
SHERMAN
My opinion is, that five minutes' debatc would be more serviceable; but I will not press my motion now
Mr
FLORENCE
I am sure the gentleman will have no disposition to close debate upon this amendmcnt; for I belicve the cormnittee is becom- incr lirepared to restore the item to #250,000
T gentleman from Missouri [Mr
P,HELPS] has redeemed himself very much in my estima- tion by saying that if the present appropriation is not sufficient, he will, in the next Congress—if there be another Congress—vote for an additional appropriation
In what respect does he redeem Mr
HILL
himself
What is he redeemed from 
Mr
FLORENCE
He has •enerosity and liberality which a gendeman occu- pying his position ought to have

Why, everybody knows that they are po- be raised to inquire into the matter; for it would be balance, preferring to fbrfät the one per cent
litical and not financial diffculties
Everybody satisfied that the rationale pursued not only does they paid in on their proposals
Such being the condition of the finances of our knows that it is in the power of this House to re- credit to the eminent chief of the survey, but in- iicvc the country of these difficulties within an finite credit to the wisdom and the forecast of this country, I ask whether it is unwise to reduce tbc hour; and if these difficulties were removed, the expenditures to what they were during the admin- Government

January 9, Because of th is-political panic thathas swept over the

an item
that is economical; in- my judgment, an- item that may very well
bé ap- propriated, in view of the restoration of peace and quiet
•The Coast Survey has conferred upon the commerce of the country innumerable and incal- eulable benefits
It;is an economical institution ; saving more to the countrythan it has ever.cost; opening up the path ways of the great deep; giving shelter to the •commerce and shipping of the coun- try; and saving, in intrinsic values millions more than the cost of:th-e survey of the coast
That is the;reason not wish that the work shall bé interrupted
'I did, not suppose that there was any institution so froe from censure as the Coast Survey.
I have -never heard, since I have been a -membci• of this body, of any hotel influence be- ing brought to bear uoon members of the Housc in this connection
r was therefore surprised at the remarks of the gentleman from Missouri
venture my reputation that there is not a depart- ment freer from political influences than the Coast Survey
Mr
PHELPS
1 did not mean to charge that any political influences controlled the action of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey or his empk)Yés; but I believe that if we reduce this ap- propriation, many of those now employed may be 'discharged
Mr
FLORENCE
very well, then; it is an appeal for bread, and I never close my ears to such an
appeal.'
I trust that this great Govern- ment will" not turn off its employös at a period like this
This is a small item of expenditure; but I believe that it would be economy to appro- priate the money necessary to carry on this Coast Survey
The question being on Mr
ELIOT'S amendment, tellers were ordered; and Messrs
BURCH and GOOCH were appointed
The committee divided; and thc tellers reported —ayes 65, noes 59
So the amendment was agreed to
Mr
MAYNARD obtained the floor
Mr
SHERMAN
I suggest to the gentleman from Tennessee that he yield me the floor, to allow me to rnove thal the committee riso, for tho pur- pose of stopping the general debate upon this bill
Mr
MAYNARD
think that thus far the debate has becn confined pretty closely to the qucstion before the committee, and that it has been legitimate debate
I will, however, yield to the gentleman
Mr:SHERMAN
I move that the committee do now rise
The motion was agreed to
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr
BURNETT reported that thc Committee of the Wholc on the state of the Union, had, according to order, had under con- sidcration the bill making appropriations for sun- dry civil expenses ortho Govcrnrnent for the year ending June 30, 1862, and had comc to no con- clusion thereon
Mr
SHERMAN
1 move that debate on the bill now pending in the Committee of the Whole on the etate of the Union shall closc in five, minutes after the committcc shall have resumed the consideration of thc same
The motion was agrccd to
Mr
SHERMAN
1 move that the rules be suspended, and that the House resolve itself into tho Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Tho motion ••.vas agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committeeof the Whole on the state of 1110 Union, (MI'
BURNETT in the chair,) and resumed the consideration of the special order, the civil appropriation bill
Mr
MAYNARD
men t: At the end of the amendment last adopted, add as ft)l- lows : To be expended under thc direction of the Bureau or Ordnance and Hydrography, the payments to be audited at the 'i'reasttry in the same manner as all other expenditures of tilC Governjnent
The object of the.amendment is to put the Coast Survey under the direction of the Secretarv of the Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
I submit that that amendment proposes to changeahe ex- isting law, and is therefore out of order
Mr
MAYNARD, What existing law does it change 
Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
The law which confines the appropriation to the channel in which it now is
Mr
MAYNARD
I suggest to the Chair that in making appropriations we certainly have a right to say in what manner particular money should be expended
Mr
WASHBURNE5 of Illinois
Where the lawprovides thata n appropriation shall go through a certain channel, the appropriation cannot be di- verted from that channel without a change of the law
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order, and rules the amendment out of order
Mr
MAYNARD
I then offer the following amendment, to come in at the end of the clause: And the payments to be audited at the Treasury in the same manner as other expenditures of the Government
I do not propose to dwell upon that amend- Its character is sufficiently obvious from ment
the terms in which it is couched
I submit it to the good sense of the committee
Mr
ELIOT
My objection to the amendment is, that it contains a censure upon one of the De- partments of thc Government which, it seems to me, ought not to be cast
There is, however, a disposit.ion on this side of the House to vote at once; and I will not, therefore, detain th8 com- mittee by any further remarks
'I'eltcrs were ordered on the amendment; and Messrs
HARRIS, of Virginia, and COLFAX, were appointed
Mr
SHERMAN
1 hope the gentleman from Tennessee will tell us how these accounts are audited now
Mr
MAYNARD
They are simply audited by the Superintendent of the Coast Survey
The committee proceeded to divide; and the tellers re )ortcd eleven in the affirmative
Mr
MAYNARD
In to prevent the breaking up of tl•ne committee, I will withdraw my tunendment

HOUSTON

HOUSTON
the amendment; and I say to the gentlcman from Tennessee, and to the committee, that if the expenditures of this de- pnrtment are
not now audited as the expenditures m other departments and bureaus are, this fimend- ment ought to be, agrced to 
Mr
ELIOT
I rise to a point of order
I in- quire whether this debate is in order 
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from Ala- bama offers an amendment ; and he certainly has a right to speak to it for fivc minutes
Mr
HOUSTON
r repeat, that if it be that the expenditures in the department of the Coast Survey are not
audited and passed upon precisely as the expenditures of other departments and bu- reaus of the Government are, they certainly ought In that event this zunendment ought to be agreed to
I do not know that such is or is not the case; but I take it for granted that the gentle- man from Tennessee, [Mr
MAYNARD,] when he offered his arnendment, had looked into that sub- If so, and if the accounts of the Coast Sur- vey arc not audited at the Treasury, then I be- lieve there ought to be a vote of the committee and of the Housc upon it
I do not, therefore, intend to withdraw my amendment, unless f am satisfied that there is a quorum present
I have two ob- jccts in view in renewing this amendment
One is, that i think the amendment ought to be agreed to
The other is, that if there be no quorum of the committee present, I am opposed to the adoption or rejection of important propositions by less than a quorunn of members
Mr
SHERMAN
I am opposed to the amend- ment
Mr
LOVEJOY
1 think that, ifthestate•ment made is correct, the amendment ought to be agreed I to
It is a question of fact as to whether the ac- counts of the Coast Survey are or are not audited as the accounts of other Departments
Mr
MAYNARD
1 would not have intro- duced the resolution
causelessly
If the accounts are not audited at the Treasury, they ought to be; and this amendment should be agreed to
Mr
HOUSTON
I hope the gentleman from Tennessee will state whether he has looked into the matter, and whether these accou'nts areaudited at the Treasury
If they are not, this amend- If they are, I shall withdraw ment should pass
it
Mr
MAYNARD
My information is, that the accounts are not audited at the Treasury
Mr
ELIOT
1 ask simply to have an answer from the gentleman from Tennessee
I do not understand him to say that he has himself made examination into this matter
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair respectfully svo•ests to the gentleman from Massachusetts that all this is out of order, debate on the amend- ment being exhausted, unless the gentleman offers an amendment
Mr
ELIOT
No, sir
I do not want to offer an amendment
The question was taken on Mr
HOUSTON's amendment; and it was not agreed to
Mr
ELIOT
1 move to amend the fifteenth line, by striking out $70,000," and inserting in lieu •thereof $130,000;" so that the clause will read : For cbntinuing the survey of the western coast of the United States, including the compensation of civilians en- gaged in the work, $130,000
I understand that several gentlemen, members of the committee, have voted on the amendment just now adopted, under the apprehension that the amendment itself called for an appropriation which was larger than the sum asked for by the proper office-rs, and under the impression that I had asked that the appropriation shoufd be in- creased on our own responsibility
I desire [0 say, both in regard to that amendment and to the onc which I have just now offered, that the prop- osition was made because it is believed by the Department having this business in charge that the amount of $130,000 is the least sum thalshould be appropriated by Congress to the work at this time
This #130,000 is required for the purpose of continuing the x,vork on the coast of Oregon and of Wasllington Territory
The Committee of Ways and Means halve reduced that amount to $70,000; and the question is, x.vhether this com- mittee will appropriate the' sum that is believed to be necessary by the Department, or will reduce the amount for the reasons assigned in the dis- cussion on the previous amendment
I do not feel disposed to' go into that debate again
I de• signed to reply to some suggestions that fell from gentlemen, in regard to the statc of the Treasury, in regard to the diffculty
of getting money, and in regard to the state of the times; but it seems to me that these suggestions found sufficient and complete answer on the other side of the House
We all know well enough that the trouble is not that there is no money to be had, but that there is no confidence in the Government
That is why the securities of the Government have been selling at the discount stated by the gentleman from Mis- souri, [Mr
PIIELPS.) It is not that there is any lack of means
Let confidence be restored, and there never has been a moment when the Govern- ment could command, more easily than now, all the money that is needed for all proper purposes
Mr
PHELPS
1 desire to the gentleman from Massachusetts whether he believes that con- fidcnce will be restored before the close of this session of Congress
Mr
ELIOT
1 cannot answer that
I think that, if we all do our duty fairly and faithfully and justly, some way will be found by which the Government can be carried on, and the confidence of the people restored to it
Let t.hat come, and money will come in abundance
The only ques- tion now is, whether that is a reason for reducing by one half the appropriation asked for this pur- It seems to me that, unless there be some pose
better' reasons assigned than those which I,ve have heard, the comrnittee is prepared to sustain the Government in its call for this appropriation
Mr
MAYNARD
J shall much time, especially after the vote which has been taken in regard to the former amendment pro- posed; but I will ask gentlemen before they vote  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
on these propositions to turn to the estimates at pages 90 and 91, where they will find estimates for surveys on the coast of New England and on the coasts of New York and New Jersey, the oldest settled portion of the Atlantic coast—large sums; the same as last year and as the year' before
They go back more than forty years
Now, why is it
Can any of the gentlernen who live on the coast, and who tell us of the importance of this work, who are presumed to understand something of its details, and to be versed in the question of science complicat.ed with it; can any of them tell us why it is that the surveys of this old portion of the Atlantic coast are npt completed; why it is that we must continue expenditure upon them at this late day
Mr
PHELPS
Perhaps they find it very con
venient to spend the hot summer months on the New England coast
Mr
MAYNARD
I know that Newport is a very pleasant place to spend the summer in
Mr
ELIOT
1 rise to point of order
This amendment refers to the coast of Oregon and Washington, and the remarks of the gentleman from Tennessee apply to no part of that coast
Mr
MAYNARD
The gentleman from Mas- sachusetts does not manifest his usual astuteness, or he would have perceived the point of my argu- men t
Thc CHAIRMAN
The section couched in such language that it is impossible for the Chair to determine upon •what coast this appropriation is proposed to be expended
He therefore cannot say whether the gentleman from Tennessee is in order or not
Mr
MAYNARD
The gentleman from Mas- sachusetts does himself great injustice—or rather he does me injustice—in not havincr attended to If he had, he would have scen my argument
that the point of my argument is that we shall not launch out upon a system of survey on the coast of Washington and Oregon which will pro- gress at the rate of your recent coast survey for forty years, and then be no nearer to termina- tion than that survey is now
I want to have the survey done, and not have it always being done—to have it executed, and not always con- tinued
The question was taken on Mr
ELIOT 's amend- ment, and it was agreed to
The Clerk read, as follows: For continuing tho survey of t.he Florida reefs and keys, (including cornpens•ation of civilians engaged in the work, and excluding pay and of orücers of the Anny and Navy, and petty officers and Inen of the Navy enn- ployed on the work,) $20,000." Mr
ELIOT
I move to increase that appro- priation to $40,000
I have only to say, Mr
Chairman, in regard to this amendment, what has been said in regard to the other amendments
The sum of $40,000 is called for by the offcers in whom we ought to have confidence; the officers who have this work in charge, and who have made their detailed state- ments to the Treasury Department, upon which that Department has made its recommendation to us
They say t.hüt., for-rthe purpose stated here, is requisite
Unless there is some reason why that amount should be reduced, it seems o me that it ought to be voted
I have notl further to say
The amendment ',vas rejected
The Clerk read, as follows: "'l'o supply deficiency in t.he fund Ibr the relief of sick and disabled seamen, 900,000: Provided, 'l'bat the Secre- tary of the 'I'reasury is hereby authorized to rent either of the several marine hospitals to the proper authorities of the cities, towns, or counties, in said hospitals are located, and contract with such authorities tar the, relief of the sick and disabled seamen entitled to relief under the act of 3d of May, 1802, and ill cases of infectious diseases, to make such regulations for their rekief as he deems ex- pcdient." I move to Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
strike out the proviso in that section
I want, Mr
Chairman, to direct the attention of thc committee to an important change of ex- isting law which, as I consider, has been improp- erly attempted to bc made in this bill
viso which I *nove to strike out changes a law law for taking which has existed since 1802 care of sick and disabled seamen
Under that law, sir, marine hospitals have been erected in different parts of the United States
First, let me say one word for the benefit of the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means in reference to this provision as being in order and germane to this bill
We all understand per- fectly well that under the rules of the House no general legislation can be moved as an amendment to one of the general appropriation bills
Yet, sir, here is one of the most important changes Of existing law—a provision looking to general le- gislation—embodicd by the Committee of Ways and Means in this, a creneral appropriation bill
I would make a point of order on it, and insist on the point being ruled by the Chair, if I thought it would do any good
The House having sent this matter to the committee, I presume we are bound to act upon it
Let me call the attention of the committee to the language of this proviso, x,vhich, as I have already stated, repeals a law enacted in 1802 for taking care of sick and disabled seamen
It is well known that each seaman has deducted outof his wages twenty cents each month in the year, which makes a fund out of which marine hos- pilals have been erected and kept up
Those hospitals are located in various parts of the coun- try, where seamen are taken care of when they are sick or disabled
They are taken care of in that way out of the fund which they themselvcs have contributed
The Committee of Ways and Means, by this proviso, undertakes to discontinue all these marine hospitals, and to leave sick and disabled seamen to be taken care of by the coun- ty, city, town, or village, where they may happen to be for the time
I protest against it
'We had a like proviso offered in the Thirty-Fourth Con- gress
The Committee of Ways and Means, in that Congress, introduced substantially the same provision as this, without having had any con- sultation with the Committee on Commerce, which legitimately has the subject under cohsidcration; but it was rejected by a vote of more than two to one
The House then said that, as these sea- men paid this money into the 'I'reasury, they should be taken care of by the Government, and not be put out as paupers upon the mercy of any city, town, or village, which had no interest in their welfare whatever
But the gentlernen from Ohio [Mr
SHERMAN] may say that this fund is notsufiicient to maintain these semnen
Grant it
Grant, sir, that we have to make an additional appropriation of $200,000, $300,000, otVven whatis that
Is it not through the commerce of the country, is it not through the seamer) , that your revenues are raised 
Yet it is here proposed, in reference to thesc hard}, these useful and brave men, whose march is on the mountain wave, whose home is on the deep, to turn then-I over to the sympathies of the Cities, the towns, and the villaues of the country! I say that the present system is a just one
Out of the moneys contributed by these seamen, manne hos- pitals have been erected, where sick and disabled seamen can bc taken care of by the Government
There are proper buildings, where arc kept by the United States physician', stewards, and rnatrons, to provide for the sick and disabled seaman
If this proviso be adopted, these marine hospitals are abandoned, and you will then Icave these sick and disabled to the tender mercies of thc cities and towns, wherever they may be cast I protest against the change, and I hope ashore
the committee will strike out the proviso
Mr
NIXON
I will say a word or two in re- ply to my honorable friend from Illinois
I come, Mr
Chairman, from a commercial district, and one deeply interested in those who are engaged in a seafaring life
My people, indeed, are as 111 uch interested in this proviso as any other peo- ple in the country; and, as I understand it, they are satisfied with it
A large number of my con- stituents are engaged in a seafaring life, and they are of the opinion that the present system v.rorks badly
These hospitals arc generally oat of the way of the very men for whose benefit they have been erected
'The proviso cnables these men to receive support, when sick or disabled, in the I have received neighborhood where they belong
a large nun-iber of petitions from my district in favor of the change proposed by the proviso in- sorted in this bilÜby the Committee of Ways and Means, and 1 hope it will not be stricken out
Mr
PHELPS

twenty dollars
Mr
Chairman, I wish tosubmitsome in justification of the- course of the Committee: Of Ways and Means in inserting the proviso that-it is: proposed to strike out
I am not sorry -that lthiS provision has called forth the_ eloquencé of- the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr
opposes it; but, sir, with all his epcomiums upon
the gallant seamen of the country, I think his eloquence was, to a certain extent, inspired by a recollection of the existence of a marine hospital in his own town of Galena, and that, if it be aban- doned, its patronage of a physician, a steward, and a matron, witl have to follow, of course
16 that case, sir, ..the authorities
of will be allowed to take better care of the steamboat men of the Mississippi river than they have heretofore received
Mr
SHERMAN
1 will ask my friend from Missouri if he knows how much it costs to keep a patient one week at the hospital- at Galena
Mr
PHELPS
1 do not
Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
- Will my friend yield to me a moment
I will state that the Government very properly erected marine hoséital at Galena for the purpose of taking care of szck and disabled seamen, and there is a large number of that class there; but the hospital never has been put in operation by the Government
There has been a large sum of money collected from seamen and paid to the Government
But the seamen, instead of being taken care of, as they ought to be, in the hospital building of the Umted States, are to be taken care of by the lowest bidder, and the sick seaman is cast off into low doggeries
Mr
PHELPS
There are but a few of these marine hospitals established in the country, and of course, where there are no marine hospitals, the seamen are taken care of precisely In the manner in which it is now proposed, by the Sec- retary of the Treasury, that they shall be taken care of where there are marine hospitals
- There is a marine.hospital in the State which have the honor in part to represent, and where there are many patients; but I do bclicve that the patients no'.v in that hospital can be taken care of equally as well, if that marine hospital were under the con- trol of the authorities of the city of St
Louis, in which they could also place such patients as that city might have , withoutinterferin%with the rights of tl'ie Government
This is a measurc of econo- my—a measure
which, if adopted, will reduce the r I'here are marine hospitals expenses $100,000
in the country in which, according to the report submitted to Congress a year ago, the expense of keeping patients was more than twenty dollars per weck, while at the places where the seamen were taken care of as proposed in this bill, they were taken care of equally, at an expense rawing from three 10 five dollars per week
It.is now proposed to dispcnse with Government patronage in this matter; it is proposed to dispcnse with the super- intendents of marine hospitals; it is proposed to dispense with offcers employed at annual salaries ranging from $1,200 to $2,000 per •annum; it is proposed to dispense with the scrvices of other employés, amounting to ten or a dozen -persons at some of the Inarine hospitals, and still you wili have the seamen better provided for and taken care of than under the existing 'law
I vote for the measure, then, as a matter of economy, and as a measure of humanity to the seamen -who have contributed to make up the sum from which they are supported
As my amendment was merely pro forma, if there is no objection, I will withdraw it
No objection being made, the amendment was withdrawn
Mr
LOOMIS
I propose to amend by strik- ing out all after the word provided,' in line thirty-eight, and inserting in lieu thereof the fol- 'I'hat the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized to change the present systmn of providing relief for sick and disabled bv disrnissing frorn service the em•- ployés of the Government, and leasing the marine hospitals, at such places as in his judgrnent t.he, public interest may individuals, citv, require a chawre
to private etnunty authorities, or private associations, on terms pro- viding for the necessary attention to seamen entitled to relief
I offer this as a substitute for the proviso, be- cause I deem it an important change which ought  302 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9, In the proviso contained in -the bill, to sb6• made
there is no authority given to the Secretary of the Treasury to employ private individuals or private associations; and it is obvious that it may be ne• cessary, in many Cases, or at least very desirable, to do so
Indeed, at the present time, where there are no organized hospitals, the Secretary of the Treasury now authorizes the employment of pri- vate individuals and private associations
I -havé also modified the proviso in another particular, so that it may resvin -the discret.ion of the Secretary of the Treasury to lease the marine hospitals at places where, in his judgment, the public interest may require such a change
There are many places where I think the regular organ- ized marine hospitals should be leased
In such cases the Secretary may be advised of the fact
I think- the general purpose of this proviso is one Of great importance, and that its adoption will save immense ßums to the Government
I hold in my hand a report of the Secretary of the Treasury in reference to the expenses and con- dition of these hospitals, from 1854 down to the presen t time, in which he recom mends this change ; and he bases his recommendation upon Facts which I think incontrovertible; because it is proved by the tables prepared by the Secretary that, in all cases where private individuals, or pri- vate associations or town authorities, have taken care of' disabled seamen, they have been at least as •well taken care of as in the organized hospitals
We have invested in marine hospitals $3,000,000, ornearly that amount; and yet, in spite-of that fact, we find '-by actual experiment that we can sup- port sick and disabled seamen much cheaper through the agency of private individuals, private associations, or town and county organizations
It appears from a table prepared in 1855 that the cost of maintaining patients by contract was as follows: Bridgeton, New Jersey...
................$1 50 Portsmouth, New Hmnpshire ....

....
2 00 Middletown, Connecticut...
...

A t the organized hospitals, the average cost during the same year of each patient, per week, was as follows: Cléveiånd, Ohio

...70 70 And here let me can the attention of the House to Executive Document No
27, and Report No
655, of thc first session of this Congress, the latter of which I had the honor to make at thé last ses- sion, under instructions from the Corn [nittee on the Expenditures in the Treasury Department
We find -from that document that at Paducah— which is* only an illustration—a hospital has been erected at a cost of between fifty and sixty thou- sand dollars; and yet, since the year 1854, •there has not been a single sick and disabled patient ad- mitted there; and yet ib,has been provided during all that time witha physician and laborers, to whom we have paid large salaries
So that our presént organized hospitals, instead of being asylums for sick and disabled seamen, are, in most cases, asylums for the relief of disabled physicians
Mr
SHERMAN
Mr
Chairman, 1 approve of the remarks of the gentleman from Connecti- cut, but I do not approve of his amendment
The only difference between his proposition and that of the Committee of Ways and Means is: he pro- poses to let out this charity at private enterprise, while the committee propose to intrust it to cities, counties, or municipal corporations
I do not, rnyself, believe that it would do to Ict out this charity to private persons, who would be inter- ested in depriving sick and disabled scamcn of relief
Mr
LOOMIS
I did not propose to substitute, by my amendment, private individuals and asso- ciations for cities, towns, and counties; but only to add them
Mr
SHERMAN
1 am opposed to the prop- osition; because I think that all the cities or mu- nicipal corporations within which marine hos- pitals exist might be safely intrusted with the administration of this charity
But I do not think the matter ought to be intrusted to private indi- viduals, because they would have a direct intérest in depriving sick and disabled seamen of the re- lief to which they are entitled
I hope, therefore, that the proviso reported by the Committee of Ways and Means will be adopted
It was care- fully considered, and is carefully worded
Mr
L00M1s's amendment was disvreed to
The question recurred on the motion of Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois, to strike out the whole proviso
rMr
LOOMIS
I move to amend the matter proposed to be stricken out, by substituting for the words under the actof 3d May, 1802," the ivords "under acts of the United States now in force.' • I offer that amendment, because I be- lieve that there are laws applicable to the matter, other than that of 3d May, 1802
Mr
SHERMAN.' It is under the law of 1802 that all that appropriations have been passed
Mr
LOOMIS
According to my recollection, there is a law of 1798 relating to this matter; and also, an act amendatory of that, passed in 1846
Mr
McKNlGHT
I desire to oppose the amendment; and I desire also to oppose the pro- viso reported by the Committee of Ways and Means, for the reason that it confrrs upon the Secretary of the Treasury powers which he will not have thp time or the leisure properly to dis- charge
Ifthe Committee of Ways and Means, or any other committee, were to propose the ap- pointment of a commission to inquire into the abuses that have grown up in these marine hos- pitals, and report an act for the correction of these abuses, I would vote for that proposition
I be- lieve there are abuses in connection with these marine hospitals
I believe there are men em- ployed as surgeons about those hospitals who are not fitted for-the position
I know that, in my own district, there is a marine hospital; and yet a number of seamcn are forced to go to hotels, and to employ private medical advice, because they cannot obtain it at the hospital
Bat it is only the correction of abuses that is required
The Government has expended millions of dol- lars in the erection of these buildings; and to turn them over now to coun ty commissioners would be, it strikes me, a great waste of the public money
Even if you could get those offcers to undertake the duties—which I am satisfied they would not do—I do not bclieve you could get the county com- missioners to take charge of those hospitals; nor would it be advisable for them so to do
How is the Secretary of the Treasury to decide as to what hospitals ought or ought not to be turned over to the county commissioners
Let the gentleman proceed in the right way
Let him propose a , commission to inquire into abuses and reform them, and I shall be ready to vote with him
The atnendment to the amendment was dis- am•eed to
The question recurred on the motion of Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois, to strike out the whole proviso
Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
I move to amend the clause proposed to be stricken out by inserting, in lieu of the word " rent," the words surrender to." Mr
Chairman, I have listened to the remarks of thc gentleman from Connecticut in relation to the amendment which he proposed
'The question we have to deal with herc is, whether this Con- gress is prepared to surrender up all the marine hospitals, which have cost
millions on millions of dollars, to town, city, and county authorities
There is no limitation on the power conferred by this clause upon the Secretary of the Treasury
He may rent the hospital at New Orleans, at Charleston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, or Boston
There is no limitation upon him as to the arnount of rent
As to what the gentle- man has read in relation to the expense of main- taining patients in these hospitals, it has nothing whatever to do with the question
MI e have built these hospitals for the purpose of taking care of our sick and disabled seamen, who have contributed, to a large extent, from their earnings
The gen- tleman from Connecticut has referred to the cost of taking care of them
I say that the price is In a few instances it may be; not exorbitant
but, on the average, I am astonished at the srnall charge against the Government for the care of these men
What do the Committee of Ways and Means propose
Why, they propose that you should let out these merl as paupers to the lowest bidder
The gentleman from Connecticut tells you that they can be taken care of for three dollars a week
In my own town, i -know how this thing is
where there are a great many sick and disabled seamen, I talked with the physician who had been employed to take care of them, and he
informed me of the wretched hovels in which they are placed
Mr
BURNETT, (Mr
BRANCH having taken the chair pro tempore.) The policy proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means under the proviso in this bill, is to rent out the marine hos- pitals to the several corporations, town councils, &c., and to place the seamen of this country on the charity of those coroorations
Gentlemen make objection to the present system as now rnanaged in these marine hospitals, complaining that tho cost of maintaining the sick and disabled scamen in them is so large
Granted that that is an objec- tion
Granted that the fact, ak stated by the gen- tleman from Connecticut, [Mr
Loonns,] is true
Is that a reason why this Congress should change the whole system of the Government in regard to its sick and disabled seamen, and should commit them to the charity of towns and villages and cor- porations, which will not treat them as well as they are treated now, and from which they will sufün• the very same inconveniences of which gentlemen now complain in regard to medical treatment, and in other particulars
One gentleman remarks that these marine hos- pitals are asylums for broken down physicians
I do not know how true that is
I know that
the physician appointed to the hospital in my district IS, for medical knowledge and professional skill, not surpassed by any man of his profession in the country
That honorable gentleman says that, in sorne of these marine hospitals, it costs the Government sixteen dollars per week for each of the patients
Granted that that is an abuse, arid ought to be corrected: but is that any reason why Congress should surrender all the marine hospitals of the country, which were erected from motives of humanity, to take care of those broken down, sick, diseased, and disabled seamen, who have been laboring for the good of the entire coun- try
because it is from commerce that we derive our greatest prosperity
If this proviso of the Committee of Ways and Means be adopted as a system of legislation, it will change the whole pol- icy of our former system
I am opposed to that
But I agree with the gentleman from Pennsyl- vania, [Mr
MCKNIGHT,] that if there beabusesin the system, we should correct them by legisla- {ion
Get rid of these abuses, but do not sur- render this large amount of property to cities and towns and counties
Do not place your sick and disa led seamen at the mercy of the local author- ities
lb ieve that it would be wrong to do so
I believe that the whole object for which these ma- rine hospitals were erected would be defeated by the adoption of such a line of policy
Hence I am opposed to it
will go with the Committee of Ways and Means in any rneasure which they may suggest for the purpose of correcting abuses
If it costs too mucl-i to keep sick and disabled sea- men in the marine hospitals, let us throw around them restrictions by which to keep the expend- iture within reasonable limits; but 1 will never consent to transfer that class of our countrymen to the charity of corporations of any kind
The question •was taken on Mt•
WASHBURNE's amendment to his amendment; and it was not agreed to
Mr
MORRILL'
I move to amend by striking out, after the word " rent," the words " or sell." I believe it will be conceded by all gentlemen in this House that there are abuses in the manage- ment of our marine hospitals
-Now, what does this proviso propose to do
It is very carefully  drawn
It merely authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to rent them, or take such course as he may see fit to take
It does not say that he shall rent the whole of them; but that he shall rent either of the
severa} mafine hospitals
Again: it is not -proposed to send these sick and disabled seamen as paupers
It not pro- posed to commit them to the irresponsible care of individuals
But it is proposed to make contracts with the authorities of cities, towns, or counties to take care of them
Why, sir, the only way in which we can defend this system of having• marine hospitals at all, is to have the abuses cor- rected; and I hope that this committee will not show itself indifferent to the correction of abuses so notorious as those in the system of marine hos- Mr
MALLORY
If *here be abuses in the management of the marine hospitals of the Uni- ted States, how do I understand gentlemen to pro- pose to correct them
By transferring these hos- pitals to the authorities of the State, county, or city in which they are respectively situated
We have no evidence, that I know of, showing that these abuses in the manacement do actually exist
I have heard charges to that effect; but we have no proof before the House on which to support such charges
I know that there is a marine hos- pita* in a town in my district, in the State of Ken- tucky, and I have never heard of any abuses havinff crept into the management of that institu- have heard of no complaint of the kind
lion
I believe that sick and disabled sailors receive there every attention that their cases require
have never heard the least complaint against its manacement
But, if there be abuses in the management of the various marine hospitals of the United States, how are you to correct these abuses
By trans- ferring the management of these institutions to the town, city, 01' county in which they happen to be located'
If you have abuses in your forts and dock-yards and arsenals, would you there- fore support a proviso to an appropriation bill, transferring those institutions to the States or towns or counties in which they happen to belo- cated, in order that these abuses may be corrected 
Have we come to that point that acknowledgment is made in Congress that where abuses creep into the rnanacrement of things over which the Gov- ernment has control, such abuses cannot be cor- rected or remedied; and that the only cure for them is to transfer the itself to sonle othcr power than that which has charge of them 
That IS an acknowledgment which I am not
willing to make
For that reason I oppose this proviso
I hope it will not be adopted by this committee
hope that the motion of the gentleman from lili- 1861
nms, [Mr
WASHBURNE,] that this proviso be •l Government
At the hospital located in my THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
903 It is known to a great many gentlemen in the committee that these seamen contribute yearly a considerable sum of money to maintain these hos- pitals
Every seaman has levied upon him a monthly tax of twenty cents, which is taken out of his vv'ages for that purpose
Under-the pres- ent system, if a seaman be disabled by sickness or otherwise, at a point remote from any hospital, there is no law for affording him any proper re- lief, I propose, in my amendment, to confer upon the Secretary of the Treasury discretion in all such cases; so that such sick and disabled seaman may be supported outside of these marine hos- pitals
It is right that we should compensate those Individuals who take care of sick seamen when they are so situated that they cannot reach one If my amendment be of our marine hospitals
agreed to, propose, in the next place, to strike out the words " infectious diseases," and to sub- stitute for them the word " sickness;" and then the proviso will read: That the Secretary of the 'I'reasury be, and he hereby is, authorized, in cases of sickness, to make such regulation for their relief as he deezns expedient
I trust that the pending amendment will meet with the sanction of the committee
Mr
NIBLACK
Mr
Chairman, 1 am opposed to the retention of any part of the proviso; am opposed to the whole of it; and I vv'ill vote for the motion of the gentlernan from Illinois [Mr
WASH- BURNE] to strike it out
The dbject of the Com- mittee of Ways and Means woutd seen-I to be to abolish the existing system, and to substitute for it a discretionary power, to be conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury
I think that such a It will inaugurate a system of chance is wron'Y
contracts; and if the new system be badly man- aged, a favoritism worse than any and all of the evils which may be imagined to exist under the It Xtvill allow the Secretary of present
•system
the Treasury to provide onc system for taking care of the szck and disabled seamen in one local- ity, and an entirely different system in another locality
In that way the system now in force under the law would be entirely destroyed
The proviso substitutes a discretion, not only incon- venient to the Department, but which, in my judg- ment, is wrong in principle
If there be anything in the present system tend- inw to abuse, it' be corrected; but do not let us abolish the system, and substitute a discretionary power which will destroy whatever rules may I think have been adopted bv the Goverrnncnt
that such a course is no remedy for the present abuses, whatever they may be
My judgment, however, is that the alleged abuses are overstated
The marine hospitals are as economically and as well managed as any other department of the stricken out, will prevail, and that the manage- II district, is one of the best managed under the I he.pc the proviso will be stricken ment of these marine hospitals will be left to ihe I Government

act of 3d of May, 1802, and." So that tho proviso will then read: Provided, That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby anthorizcd, in cases of infectious diseases, to make such regulations for their relief as hc dccms expedient." Mr
Chairman, I offer the amendEnent in good faith, and I trust that it will meet with the appro- It will relieve us, for the batiou of the House
present, of the consideration of the propriety of authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to rent these
hospitals, while at the same time it will correct an evil which all now complain of as ex- istincr in the present system
These marine hos- pitals, a great man v cases, do not 1110 w afford proper security for taking care of sick •and disa bled seamen, By adopti1V my amendment, dis- crction be conferred upon the Secretary of the Treasury in cases where 'seamen are sick at places remote from any hospital
Congress
We found that there have been num- berless abuses in the mana«ement ofLhese marine hospitals
Some have been located at points where they ought not to be, and from which they ouo•ht to be Femoved
Look, for instance, at the one at Napoleon, Arkansas; who would think of sending a sick rnan there who could be sent any- where else—to a ptacc, indeed, surrounded by swamps which engender fever
Un\ess you ena- ble the Secretary of the Treasury to rent or sell these buildings, the sick rnust be carried there
The gentleman fu•orn Kentucky [Mr
BURNETT seems to think that this is o
new thing
The gen- tlcman from the Louisville district [Mr
MALLORY] thought it was something simi\ar to a transfer of forts and arsenals
Tennessee
with two rivers with a of eight hundred miles, has not a marine hospital within its borders
The city of Nashville takes care of sick and disabled seamen coming there
Yet gentlemen seem to think it is a great hardship when we say there are abuses in - t the marine hospital system
*The gendeman from Connecticut [Mr
L00M1s] in his report at the last session ofCongrcss, specified some of these abuses
They are palpable and susceptible of proof, and yet gentlemen are found here resisting them
1 believe, on the contrary; that
the Committee of Ways and Means have taken a stepin the ifight direction.
Let these abuses becOrröOted.-- "Let the Secretary of the Treasury be invested;with a discretionary power

SECRETARY ofr WAR
The VICE PRESIDENT
If there be no fur- ther petitions, reports from standing committees are in order
Mr
SLIDELL
If there be no reports from standing committees, I move that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of the resolution I offered yesterday, calling for certain information from thc President
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 suggest that the hour has arrived now, according to the order of the Senate yesterday, for calling up the resolutions that were yesterday under consideration
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair will state that they covne up at half past twelve o 'clock
Mr
SLIDELL
I presume that t.hcre will be It will not occupy any time
If the Senator from Pennsylvania quotes the law under which the President derived authority for this appointment, I shall be under the necessity— The VICE PRESIDENT
Will the Senator from Louisiana pause for a moment
Either i some motion must be madc to postpone the spe- Cial order for this hour, or there must be unani- mous *consent to lay it aside, or the Chair must enforce it
Mr
SLIDELL
I move to postpone the con- .sideration of the special order
The VICE PRESIDENT
Is there unanimous consent to consider this resolution
The Chair hears no objection
Mr
BIGLER
As far as 1 am concerned, 1 will agree to the passage of the resolution, and will not read the law
Mr
SAULSBURY
1 call for the yeas and nays
The ycas and-nays werc ordered
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 would only inquire of the honorable Senator from Louisiana what object is to be attained by this; what good is to result, and to whom
If I could see any rele- vancy that it has to our proceedings, or to any object of public good, I would vote for it; but It seems to me to be very unusual and extraordi- nary, and I do not see the importance of it
Mr
SLIDELL
1 will very cheerfully respond to the inquiry of the Senator from Kentucky
I conceive that there has been a gross violation of the Constitution of the United States by the ap- pointment of an acting Secretary of War, holding It is simply one of no (lobate of this resolution
Inqun•y
The VICE PRESIDENT
Tho question is I on the motion to take up the resolution offered by the Senator from Louisiana
The motion 'vas agreed to
The Sectetary read the resolution, as follows: Resoltcd, rl'hat, the President, be reqtrested to införm the I Senate Whether John Floyd, whose appointment as Sec- retary of War was confirmed bv tbc Scnate on the 6th ot• Marci), 1857, still continues to liold said office ; and if not, when and how said oilice becatne vacant; and further to iniörm the Senate how and by whom the duties of said of- iiee are now discharged; and if an appointment of an act- in" or provisional Sceretary OC War has been madc, how, when, and by what authority it so made, and why the fact of said appointnncnt has not been connnunieated to the Senate
Mr
FESSENDEN
that
the Sena- his offce for twelve or fourteen days, as I believo to be the case, without that fact having been com- municated to the Senate, and without that nomi- nation having been submi tted to their approbation, The Constitution of the United States, among other powers which it confers upon the President, contains the following: Ile shall have power, by and with the advice and con- sent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators concur ; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint atnbassadops, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the *uprcnne Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointrncnts are not herein otherwise pro- vided for, and which shall be established by law ; but the Congress Inay by law vest the appointmentof such inferior of)icers, as they may think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in thc heads of Departments." Not only has this appointment to the office of Secretary of War not been léft by implication to the uncontrolled discretion of the President; but the law creatinc-r it expressly declares he shall be appointed by and with the advice and consent of thc Senate
The section gocs on to state: The President shall have power to fill up ail vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by grant- ing cornmissions, which shall expire at the cnd of their next session.' The only law,' I presumc, towhich thc Senator from Pennsylvania referred—that of 1795—is in these words Mr
DOOLITTLE
1 understand honora- ble Senator from Louisiana is going into a general tor has omitted the ordinary condition in wre- qucst,madc to the President for information; and discussion Of the question
ask whether it is that is, that it be not incompatible with the pub- i lic interest
Perhaps it was omitted accidentally
Mr
SLIDELL
was not omitted ally
I do not conceive how it can be inconsist- ent with the public service to inform the Senate when certain offccr may havc vacated his post, and when and how another was appointed; but if the Senator thinks thc resolution obnoxious to that objection , he can offer the amendment
Mr
FESSENDEN
Ido not offer it
1 merely mado the suguestion to the Senator
The VICEWPRESIDENT
The Chair must call up tho unfinished business of yesterday at this hour
Mr
BIGLER
I do not intend to make objec- tian to the passage of this resolution; but I desire, before the vote IS taken, to read the law under which, undoubtedly, this appointment has been made Mr
SLIDELL
1 will suggest to the Senator from Wisconsin that I am only addressing the Senate at the instance of tho•Senator from Ken- tuck y
['6 Go on." ] I had supposed that, as this was a simple resolution of inquiry, it would be passed without opposition from any quarter
think the information is essentially necessary, and one which the Senate have a right to demand
The act of 1795, upon which, as I understand, the Sen- ator from Pennsylvania relies for his authority, is in the following words
Am I right in sup- posing that is the law 
Mr
BIGLER
That of 1795
Mr
SLIDELL
it is: An Act to amend the act entitled An act making altera- tions in the 'l'rcasury and VVar Departments

The Chair has just ment of War, or or any officer of either of the said l)cpart- anr,ounced that he has called up the unfinished mcnts, whose appointment is not in the head thereof, whereby they cannot pert0rm the duties of their said re- business of yesterday
Mr
BIGLER

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C
RIVES, WASHINGTON, 1)
THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, 2D SESSION
I think that this latter clause abundantly estab- lishcs that this discretionary power confided in the President to appoint an acting Secretary of the Treasury, or of the other Departments, was only to be exercised when the Senate was not in If such were not the case, what would session
If it bc consid be the necessary consequence
ered that this power can be exercised during tho session of the Senate, I again say, what would be the consequence
No vacancy shall be sup- plied in the manner aforesaid for a longer term than six months
" This session of Congress will If the President expire in less than sixty days
has the power, without t.he control of the Senate, to make the appointment of an actine Secretary for six months, the individual who is now dis- charging the duties of that office may, if the suc- cessor Of the present Executive thinks proper to retain his services, act as such for four months after the adjournment of Congress, without sub- mitting his nomination to the Senate
Further than that, when that six months shall have ex- piped, the President may then nominate another mdividual, whose appointment will be valid, con- ferring upon him all the power and responsibility of that offce, who will hold his office until the expiration of the next session of the Senate
The consequence of giving aconstruction so monstrous as this to the act of 1795, would be to deprivc the Senate altogether of its constitutional power to control the Executive in the choice of the officers I believe it is the first time that of his Cabinet
such a proposition has been seriously asserted
I did not intend to make any argument on the subj.ect
I have merely responded to the inquiry of the Senator from Kentucky, as to what was the object of this resolution
We want to knovv' who is the Secretary of War; and if the Sccrelary of War be really the person whom the public prints suppose to be exercising thoseduties, I say, and I say confidently, that that gentleman never could have obtained the approbation of this Sen- ate
He would not be Secretary of War, by and With the advice of this body
Mr
BIGLER
Mr
President, 1 certainly had no idea of any debate on the subject; nor was I I i looked at the 'law yesterday, prepared for it
when the Senator from Louisiana offered the res- olution, and was under the impression that that law was conclusive; and "10 w I am by no means convinced as to the Senator's constitutional argu- [ shall not attempt to reply to it, but shall meat
insist upon the adoption of the resolution
That, I think, will be necessary now, in order to do the President and t.he Administration justice
It I have would bo better to have their reply to It
no doubt that it will turn out that the question has been thoroughly understood by them, and that the President perfectly satlsfied of his authority under the law of 1795
I will remark, however, that the Senator from Louisiana is not unaware of the diihcultics that surround this case, It is a very easy mat- of no ordinary character
ter to make appointments under some It stances, and it is very difficult under others
FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 1861
Mr
GREEN
I shall vote for the resolution without implying any censurc or condemnation I think the on the acting Secretary of •War
information which is called for very important, because it rnay involve a departure from the con- stitutional provisions and the practice of the Gov- ernment
We ought to be strict and exact in fill our proceedings; but I will not, by my vote, im- ply a censure either on the President or the pres- ent acting Secretary of War
Mr
PEARCE
I should like to know whether any law has been passed on this subject since the period of General Jackson 's administration
I recollect that during his administration, Mr
B
F
Butler, who was Attorney General, acted, I think, for an entire session of Congress as Secretary of -War
Has a law been passed since that period 
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Secretary will call the roil
Mr
DOOLITTLE
Allow me to inquirc what is the question
'The VICE PRESIDENT
On the passage of this resolution
Mr
DOOLITTLE
thought the motion was i to postpone some l)rior order

I-shall move to post- pone that
Mr
GREEN
As the Senator from .Missis
sippi is not present—and other Senators desire to- give him the privilege of making any remarks bé desires—while we are considering about what will bo the proper subject to take up inthe mean- time, if the Senate will indulge me, I desire •to call up a little private bill and pass that
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 hope the gentleman I am sure he will concur will not insist on that
in the superior importance of this subject for thp preservation of the Union
Mr
GREEN
1 will not press it
Mr
WILSON
The Senator from Mississippi has the floor at one o'clock, on the President's message, and has partly concluded his speech
In the situation of his State, do not- w-ish to I desire to make some remarks interrupt him
upon these resolutions; and I assure the Scnator frorn Kentucky that they cannot pass the Senatc without the most thorough and searching inves- I thercfore move tiaation from several Senators
to postpone them until to-morrow, to allow the Senator from Mississippi to go on and finish his speech upon the President's message
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Iwas that the
Senator from Mississippi desired to speak

The yeas and nays have been ordered
Mr
POWELL
Isball resolution; but in doing so, I do not intend to cast any cen- sure upon the President or upon the gentleman who is acting ts Secretary of War ad interint
Neither do I -wish to be understood as concurring in the declaration of the Senator from Louisiana that the distinguished gent.lcnnan who is actin«y as Secretary of War dd interim would not bc con- I firnuecfby this Senate
That is a matter of fact I will say, that I will not undertake to decide
however, that I believe tlpc actinms and doings of the gentleman who now acts as Secretary ad interinL have been very much misrepresented, as on a proper occasion I shall be able to show

It ww•s necessary—it was indispensably necessary—that some member of the Administration should forthwith assume the duties of the War Department ad interim
That was an absolute necessity
The Senator from Louisiana may know that thcl•c has been no dif- ficulty whatever in thc way of filling that place in the mcan time
Very true, the distinguished gentleman who is performing the duties, might I have been nominated to the Senate; but, as 1 un- derstand the Senator from Louisiana, that would have been, in his judgment, a very injudicious all, the President of the United States has been doing faithfully and vigilantly the best he could I an-x not authorized to speak, on this subject
and do not pretend to know all tho facts or par- ticulars of this case, but I certainly do know that the Senator from Louisiana must be aware of the difficulties which have surrounded a selection
20 So the resolution was adopted

The resolutions which were under consideration yesterday
The VICE PRESIDENT
Yes, sir
If, in the peculiar situation in which he stands here, he desires to occupy the floor, anxious as I am to procccd with these resolutions, certainly shall not press them now
Mr

I have no particular anxiety to speak now
I shall not detain the Senate long
I do nob think it is probable that-I shall -require Inorc than an hour; and f would as soon take it at, a later period of the day
I have no desire on the sub' ect
Mr

As there five minutes left of the morning hour devoted to morning busi- ne", I hope I shall be allowed to offer ti resolu- tion
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair will state to the Senator from Pennsylvania that the •I question before the Senate is the motion of the Senator from Massachusetts, to postpone these resolutions until to-morrow at half-past twelve o'clock; und if no other motion be made, the Chair will put that question

What hour
The VICE PRESIDENT
Half-past twelve o 'clock 
Mr
GREEN

The unfinished business of yes

Mr

The VICE PRESIDE{T
The Senator from Califo•rnia moves to postpone the special order— the Pacific railroad bill—until Tue*day next, at one o'clock
IVfr
WILSON
I would suggest to the Sena- tor from California that we might take up the Pacific-railroad bill after the Senator from Mis- sissippi has spoken, if no one wishes to speak on the President s message, and make some progress with it to-day
We can have two or three hours to devote to It
Mr
GWIN
very well
Let it go over
1 did not wish to interfere with the Senator from MissisSippi in his speech
The VICE PRESIDENT
As it lacks but a minute or two of the time when the special order is to be called up, if there be no objection, the Chair will call it up now
Strictly, the Pacific railroad bill is the only special order before the Senate, but as it seems to be the sense of the Sen- ate, the Chair will call up the motion to print the President's message, on which the Senator from Mississippi is entitled to the floor
Mr
DAVIS
Mr
President, when the floor yesterday, I intended to encracre somewhat in argument which has heretofbre prevailed in the Senate upon the great questions of consti- tutional right, which havc divided the country from -the beginning of the Government
tended to adduce some evidences, which I thought were conclusive, in favor of the opinions which I entertain; but events, with a current hurrying on as it progresses, have borne me past the point where it would be useful for me to argue, by the citing of authorities, the question of rights
To- day , therefore , it is my purpose to deal with events
AbBtract argument has become among the things that are past
We have to deal now with facts; and in order that we may meet those facts and apply them to our present condition, it is well to inqun•e what is the state of the country
The Con- stitution provides that the President shall, from time to time, communicate information on the state of the Union
The message which is now under eonsideration gives us very little, indeed, beyond that which the world, less, indeed, than rcadinz men gcnerally, knew before it was communicated
What, Senators, to-day is the condition of the country
From every quarter of it comes the wailing cry of patriotism pleading for the preser- vation of-the great inheritance we derived from our fathepg
Is there Senator who does not daily receive letters appealing to him to use even the small' power which one man here possesses to save the rich inheritance our fathers gave us
Tears now trickling down the stern face of man; and those who have bled for the flag of their country, and are willing now to die for it, stand powerless before the plea that the party about to como into power laid down a platform, und that come what will, though ruin stare us in the face, consistency must be adhered to, even though the Government be lost, In this state of the case, then, we turn and ask, whatis the character of the Administration
What is the executive department doing
What assu- rance have we there for the safety of the coun- try
But we come back from that inquiry with a mournful con viction that feeble hands now hold the reins of State; that drivelers are taken in as counselors not provided by the Constitution; that va&illation is the law; and the policy of this great Government is changed with every changing ru- mor of the day; nay more, it is changing with every new phase of causeless fear
In this state of the case, after complications have been intro• duced into question after were brought to the Verge of war, after we were hourly expecting by telegu•aph to learn that the conflict had com- menced, after nothing had been done to insure the peace of the land, we are told in this last hour that the question is t,hrown at the door of Congress, and here rests the responsibility
Had the garrison at Charleston, representing the claim of the Government to hold•the property in a fort there, been called away thirty days, nay, ten days ago, peace would have spread its pinions over this land, and calm negotiation would have been the order of the day
Why was it not re- called
No reason yet has been offered, save that the Government is bound to preserve its property; and yet look from North to South, from East to West, wherever we have constructed forts to de- fend States against a foreign foe, and everywhere you find them without a garrison, except at a few points where troops are kept for special purposes; not to coerce or to threaten a State, but stationed in sea-coast fortifications there merely for the purposes of discipline and instruction as artiller- ists
You find all the other forts in the hands of fort keepers and ordnance sergeants, and before a moral and patriotic people, standing safely there as the property of the country
I asked in this Senate l.veeks ao•o what causes the peril that is now imminent at Fort Moultrie; is it the weakness of the garrison." and then I answered, " no, it is its presence, not its weak- ness." Had an ordnance sergeant there repre- sented the Federal Government; had there been no troops, no physical power to protect it, I would have pledged my life upon the issue that no ques- tion ever would have been made as to its seizure
Now, not only there, but elsewhere , we find move- men ts of troops further to complicate th is question , and probably to precipitate us upon the issue ofcivil war; and worse than all, this Government, repos- ing on the consent of the governed; this Govern- ment, strong in the affections of the people; this Government (I describe itas our fathers made it) is now furtively sending troops to occupy positions lest " the znob" should seize them
When before in the history of our land wras it that a mob could resist the sound public opinion of the country
When before was it that an unarmed ma&istrate had not the power, by crying, " I c.ommand the peace, to quell a mob in any portion of the land 
Yet now we find, under cover of night, troops de- tacbed from one position to occupy another
Fort Washington, standing in its lonely grandeur, and overlooking the home of the Father of h is Cou ntry , near by the place where the ashes of Washington repose, built there to prevent a foreign foe from coming up the Potomac wit.h armed ships to take the capital—Fort Washington is garrisoned by marines sent sccxctly away from the navy-yard at Washington
And Fort McHenry, memorable in our history as the place where, under bombard- rnent, the star-spangled ban nor floated through the darkness of night, the point which was conse- crated by our national song—Fort McHenry, too, has been garrisoned by a detachment of marines, sent from this placc in an extra train, and sent under cover of the night, so that even the mob should not know it
Senators, the responsibility is thrown at the door of Congress
Let us take it
It ig our duty in this Inst hour to seizo the pillars of our Govern- ment and uphold them, though we be crushed in the fall
Then what is our policy
Are we to drift into war
Are we to stand idly by and allow war to be precipitated upon the country
Allow an oßicer of the Army to make war
Allow an unconfirmed head of a Department to make war
Allow a general of the Army to make war
Allow a President to make war
No, sir
Our fathers gave to Congress the power to declare war, and even to Congress they gave no power to make war upon State of the Union
It could not have been given, except as a power to dissolve the Union
When, then, we see, as is evident to the whole country, that we are drifting into a war between the United States and an individual State, does it become the Senate to sit listlessly by and discuss abstract questions, and read patch-work from thc opinions of men now mingled with the dust
Are we not bound to meet events as they come before us, manfully and patriotically to struggle with the diffculties wrhich now oppress the country 
In the message yesterday we were even told that the District of Columbia was in danger
In danger of what
From whom danger
Is there a man here who dreads that the deliber- ations of this body are to be interrupted by an armed force
Is there one who would not prefer to fall with dignity at his station, the representa- tive of a great and peaceful Government, rather than to be protected by armed bands
And yet the rumor is—and rumors seem now to be so authentic that we credit them rather than other means of information—that compan i es of arti [lery are to be quartered in this city to preserve peace where the laws have heretofore been supreme, and that this District is to become a camp, by call- ing out every able-bodied man within its limits to bear arms under the militia law
Are we in
vaded
rs there an insurrection
Are there two Senators here who would not be willing to go forth as a file, and put down any resistance whic.h showed itself in this District against the Govern- ment of the United States
Is the reproach meant against these, my friends from the South, who advocate southern rights and State rights 
If so, it is a base slander
We claim our rights under the Constitution; we claim our rights reserved to the States; and we seek by no brute force to gain any advantage which the law and the Constitu- tion do not give us
We have never appealed to mobs
We have never asked for the Army and the Navy to protect us
On the soil of Missis- sippi, not the foot of a Federal soldier has been impressed since 1819, when, flying from the yel- low fever, they sought refuge within the limits of our State; and on the soil of Mississippi there breathes not a man who asks for any other pro- lection than that which our Constitution gives us, that which our strong arms afford, and the brave hearts of our people will insure in every con- tingency
Senatorss we are rapidly drifting into a position in wliich this is to become a Government of the Army and Navy; in which the authority of the United States is to be maintained, not by law, not by constitutional agreement becween the States, but by physical force; and will you stand still and see this policy consummated
Will you fold your arms, the degenerate descendants of those men who proclaimed the eternal principle that govern- ment rests on the consent of the governed; and that every people have a right to change, modify, or abolish a Government when it ceases to answer the ends for which it was established , and permit this Government imperceptibly to slide from the moorirws where it was originally anchored, and become a military despotism
It was well said by the Senator from Now York, whom I do not now see in his seat, [Mr
SEWARD,] well said in a speech, wherein I found but little to commend, that this Union could not be maintained by force, and that a Union of force was a despotism
was a great truth, come from what quarter it may
That was not the Govcrnment instituted by our fathers; and against it, so long as I live, with heart and hand, I will rebel
This brings me to consider a passage in the message, which says: I certainly bad no right to make, aggressive war upon any St.atc ; and am perfectly satisfied that the Constitu- tion has wisely withheld that power oven froxn Con- Very good
but the right and the- duty to use military förce defens- ively against those who re ist the Federal officers in the execution of their legal fu ctions, and against those who assail the power of the F era) Government, is clear and undeniable." Is it so
Where oes he get it
Our fathers were so jealous of a standing army, that they scarcely would permit the organization and main- tenancc of any army
Where does he get the clear and undeniable" power to use the force of the United States in tho manner he there proposes
To execute a process, troops may be summoned as a posse comitatus; and here, in the history of our Government, it is not to bc forgotten that in the earlier, and, as it is frequently said, the bet- ter days of the Republic—and painfully we feel that they were better indeed—a President of the United States did not recur to the Army; he went to the people of the United States
Vaguely and confusedly, indeed, did the Senator from Ten- ncssee [Mr
J 0HNs0Nl bring forward the case of the great man, Washupgton, as one in which he had used a power which, he argued, was equiva- lent to the coercion of a State; for he said that Washington used the military power against a  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
307 portion of the people of a State; and why might he not as •veil have used it against the whole State
Let •rne tell that Senator that the case of General Washington has no application, as he It was a case of insurrection within supposes
the State of Pennsylvania; and the very message from which he read communicated the fact that Governor Miffin thought it necessary to call the militia of adjoining States to aid him.
President Washington coöperated with Governor Miffin; he called the militia of adjoining States to CQöp- erate with those of Pennsylvania
He used the militia, not as a standing army
It was by the consent of the Governor; it •was by his advice
It was not the invasion of the State; it was not the coercion of the State; but it was aiding the State to put down insurrection, and in the very manner provided for in the Constitution itself
But, I ask again, what power has the Presi- dent to use the Army and the Navy except to execute process
Are we to have drum-head courts substituted for those which the Constitu- tion and laws provide
Are we to have sergeants sent over the land instead of civil magistrates 
Not so thought the elder Adams; and here, in passing, 1 will pay him a•.tribute he deserves, as the one to whom, morc than any other man amona• the early founders of this Government, credit is due for the military principles which prevail in its organizat.ion
Associated x.vith Mr
Jefferson ori- ginally, in preparing the rules and articles of war, Mr
Adarns reverted through the long pages of history back to the empire of Rome, and drew from that foundation the very rules and articles of which govern in our country to-day, and drew them thence because he said they had brought two nations to the pinnacle of glory—referring to the Romans and the Britons, whose military law was borrowed from them
Mr
Adams, how- ever, when an insurrecti01'i occurred in the same State of Pennsylvania, not only relied upon the militia, but his orders, through Secretary Mc- Henry, required that the
militia of the vicinage should be empioyed; and, though he did order mounted troops from Philadelphia, he required the militia of the northern counties to be employed as long as they were ubie to execute the laws; and the orders given to Colonel McPherson , then in New Jersey, were, that Federal troops should not go across the Jersey line except in the last say, then, when we tracc our history resort
to its early foundation, under the first two Presi- dents of the United States, we find that this idea of using the Army and the Navy to execute the laws at the discretion of the President, was onc not even entertained, still less acted upon, in any case
Then, Senators, we are brought to consider passinff events
A little garrison in the harbor data on which I based those resolutions
1 then invoked the attention of the Senate in that form to the question ns to whether garrisons should be kept within a State against the consent of that State
Clear was I then, as I am now, in my conclusion
No garrison should be kept within a State during a time of peace, if the State be- lieves the presence of thatgarrison to be either offensive or dangerous
Our Army is maintained for common defense; our forts are built out of the common Treasury, to which every State contrib- utes; and they are perverted from the purpose for which they were erected whenever they are gar- risoned With a view to threaten, to intimidate, or to control a State in any respect
Yet we are told this is no purpose to coerce a State; we are told that the power does not exist to coerce a State; but the Senator from Tennessee [Mr
JOHNSON] says it is only a power to coerce individuals; and the Senator from Ohio [Mr
WADE] seems to look upon this latter power as a very harmless power in the hands of the Presi- dent, though such coercion would be to destroy the State
What is a State
Is it land and houses
Is it taxable property
Is it the organization of thelocal government
Or is it all these combined, with the people who possess them
Dost.roy the people, and yet not make war upon the State! To state the proposition is to answer it, by reason of its very absurdity
It is like making desolation, and calling it peace
There being, as it is admitted on every hand, no power to coerce a State, I ask what is the use ofa garrison within a State where it needs no dc- fense
The answer from every candid mind n ust be, there is none
The answer from every pa •i- otic breast must be, peace requires, under.all su circumstances, that the garrison should be wit - drawn
Let the Senate to-day, as the respons- ibility is thrown at our door, pass those resolu- I tions, or others which better express the idea contained in them, and you have taken one long step towards peace, onc long stride towards the preservation of the Government of our fathers
The President's message of December, how- ever, had all the characteristics of a diplomatic paper, for diplornacy is said to abhor certaintv, as nature abhors a vacuurn; and it was not wit.lnn the power of man to reach any fixed conclusion from that messa«e
When the country was agi- tated, when opinions were being formed, when we are drifting beyond the power ever to return, this was not what we had a right to expect from the Chief Magistrate
One policy or the other If a federalist, if believ- he ought to have taken 
this to be Government of force, it to be, a consolidated rnass and not a confedera- tion of States, he should have éaid: no State has of Charleston now occupies n post which, I am a right to secede; every State is subordinate to sorry to say, it gained by the perfidious breach of II the Federal Government, and thc Federal Gov- an understanding bet',veen the parties concerned; and here, that I may do iustice -to one who had not the power on this floor, at least, to right him- self—who has no friend here to represent him —let me say that remark does not apply to Major An- derson; for hotd that, though his orders were not so designed, as I am assured, they did em- power him to go from one post to another, and to take his choice of the posts in the harbor of Charleston; but, in so doing, he committed an act of hostility
When he Fort Moultrie, when he burned the carria«res and spiked the guns bearing upon Fort Sumter, he put Carolina in the attitude• of an enemy of the United States; and yet he has not shown any just cause for appre- hension
Vague rumors had reached him—and causeless fear seems now to be the impelling mo- uve of every public act—vague rumors of an in- tention to take Fort Moultrie
But, sir, a soldier should be confronted by an overpowering force before he spikes his guns and burns his cart•iames
A soldiershould be confronted by a public enemy before he destroys the property of the United States lest it should fall into the hands of such an enemy
Was that fort built to make war upon Carolina
Was an armament put into it for such ernmcnt must empower me with physical means to reduce to subjugation the State assertin«r such If not, if a State-rights man and a Dem- ocrat—as for many years it has been my pride to acknowledge our venerable Chief Magistrate to be —then another line of policy should have been taken
The Constitution gave no power to the Fed- eral Government to coerce a State; the Constitu- tion gave an army for the purposes of common de- fense, and to preserve domestic tranquillity; but the Constitut.ion never contemplated using that army against a State
A State exercising the sovereig:n function of secession is beyond the reach of the Federal Government, unless we woo her with the voice of fraternity, and bring her back to the enticements of affection
One policy or the other should have been taken; and it is not for rne to say which, though my opinion is well known; but one policy or the other should have bccn pursued
He should have brought his opinion to one conclusion or another, and to-day our country would have been safer than it is
I What is the message before us
I)oes it ben- efit the case
Is there a solution offered here
We are informed in it of propositions made by commissioners from South Carolina
MI e are a purpose
Or was it built for the protection OF not informed even as to how they terminated
it, and made war upon when the inhabitants of a Territory disgraced -byv institutions Offensive to the law of every' State of the Union •held thig attitude of rebellion; when the, Executive
there had poxver to use troops, he first ,sent$dommis-o sioners of peace to win, them back to their duty
When South Carolina, a sovereign State, resumes the grants she had delegated; when South.Cåro- lina stands in an altitude which threatens within a short period toinvo]ve the country in a civil war, unless the policy of the Government be changéd —no suggrestion is made to us that this Govern- ment mig%t send commissioners to her; no sugges- tion is made to us that béttér information should be sought; there is no policy ofpeace, but we are told the Army and the Navy are in the hands of the President of the United States, to be used against those who assail the power of the Federal Government
Then, my friends, are we to allow events to •drift onward to this fatal consummation
Are we to do nothing to restore peace
Shall we not, in addition to the proposition I have already made, to withdraw the forcc which complicateä the ques- tion, send conomissioners there in order that -we may learn what this community desire, what this community will do, and put the two Governments upon friendly relations
I will not weary the Senate by going over the argument of coercion
My friend from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH,] I may say, has exhausted the sub- I thank him, because it came appropriately from one nol identified by his position with South Carolina
It came more effectively from him than it wou\d have done from me, had I (as I have not) a power to present it as forcibly as he has done
Sirs, let me say, among the painful reflec- tions which have crowded upon me by day and by night, none have weighed more heavily upon my heart than the reflection that our' separation severs the ties which have so long bound us to our northern friends, of whom we are glad to recognize the Senator as a type
Now let us rcturn a moment to consider what would have been the state of the case if the gar- rison at Charleston had been withdrawn
fort would have stood there—not dismantled, but unocc•pied
It would have stood there in the hands of an ordnance sergeant
Commissioners would have come to treat of all questions with the Federal Government, of these forts as well as others
'They would have remained there to an- swer the ends for which they were constructed— If South Carolina was an the ends of defeF)sc
independent State, then shc might hold to us such a relation as Rhode Island held the dissolution of the Confederation and before the formation of the Union, when Rhode Island appealed to the sympathies existing between the States con- nected in the struggles of the Revolution, and asked that a commerciai war sliould not bc waged upon her
T Ilese forts would have stood there then to cover thc harbor of a friendly State; and if the feeling which once existed among thc peo- ple of the States had subsisted still, and that fort had been attacked, brave men from every section would have rushed to the rescue, and there im- periled their lives in the defense of a State iden- tified with thcir early history, and still associated in their breasts with affection; and the first act of this time would have bcen one appealing to every generous motive of those people again to recon- sider the question of how we could live togcther, and through that bloody ordeal to have brought us into the position in which our fathers left us
There could have been no collision; there
could have been no question of property which that If it was ques- Stat.e was not ready to meet
tion of dollars and cents, they came here to adjust If it was a question of covering an interior it
In whatever State, their interests were identical
way the question could have been presented, the consequence would have been to relieve the Gov- ernment of the charge of maintaining the fort, and to throw it upon the State which had resolved to I be independent
Thus we see that no evil could have resulted
We have yet to kearn what evil the opposite policy Charlcscon harbor; and was it armed to make No countervailing proposition is presented; no If so, what right had suggestion is made
We are left drifting loosely, may bring
Telegraphic intelligence, by the man that protection complete 
who occupied the scat on the right of me in the any soldier to destroy that armament lest it should without chart or connpass
'There is, in our recent history, however, an old Chamber, was never relied on

When foreigners, having no citizen- subject, drawing from the Constitution itself the II ship within the United Slates, declared war affainst now passina; whose clear intellect elaborating  908 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

Needl say mean Calhoun
No other man than he would have answered this description
I say, then, not relying upon telegraphic- dispatches, we still have information enough to notify us that we are on the verge, of -civil war; that civil 'war is -in the hands of men irresponsible, as it seems tp us; ,their acts unknown to us; their discretion not cov- ered by any existing law or usage; and we no_w have
the responsibility thrown upon us, which justifies usin demanding information to meet an emergency in which the„country is involved
is there any point of pride which prevents us from withdrawing that garrison
I have heard it said by a gallant gentleman, to whom I make no special reference, that the great objection was an unwillingness to lower the flarr
To lower the flag! Undel' what circumstances
I)oes any man's courage impel him to stand boldly forth to take the life of his brethren
Does any man in- Fist upon going upon the
open field with deadly weapons to ficht his brother on a question of courage
There is no point of pride
These arc your brethren ; and they have shed as much glory upon that flag as any equal number of men in the Union
They are the men, and that is the local- ity, where the first Union flag was unfurled, and where was fought a gallant battle before our inde- -pendence was declared—not the flag with thirteen stripes and thirty-three stars, but a flag with a cross of St
George, and the long stripes running through it
When the gallant Moultrie took the British Fort Johnson, and carried it, for the first
time, I believe, did the Union flag fly in tho air; and that was in October, 1775
When he took the position and threw up a temporary battery with palmetto logs and sand, upon the site called Fort Moultrie, that fort was assailed by the Brit- igh fleet, and bombarded until the old logs, cling- inc with stern tenacity to the enemy that assailed them, were filled with balls, the flag still floated there, and, though many ble(l, thc garrison con- quered
rl'hose old logs are gone; the eroding current is even taking away the site where Fort
Moultrie stood; the gallailt men who hell' it, now mingle with the earth; but their memories live in the hearts ofa gallant peoplc,_ and their sons yet live, and they, like their fathers, are ready to bleed and to die for the cause in which their fath- triumphed.- Glorious are the, memories cling- ing around that old fort which now, for the first time, has been abandoned—abandoned not even in the presence of a foe, but under tho imagin- ings that a foe might come; and guns spiked und carriages burned where the band of Moultrie bled , and, with an insufficient armament, repelled the common foe of all the colonies
I-ler ancient his- tor\ compares proudly with the present
Can there, then, be a point of pride upon so sacred a soil as this, whcrc the blood of the
tilthers cries to Heaven against civil war
Can therc be u point of pride agail'lst laying upon that sacred soil to-day the flag för which our fathers died
My pridc, Senators, is different
My pride is that that flag shall not sot bctwcon contending broth- .ers; and that, when it shall no longer be thecqm- mon flag of the country, it shall be foldcd up and I laid away like a vesture no longer used; that it 
shall be
kept as
a sacred memento of the past, to which e2wh of us can make a pilgrimacc, and remember the glorious days in which we were born
In the answer of the commissioners, which I caused to be read yesterday, 1 observed that they referred to Fort Sumter as romain ino a memento of Carolina faith
It is an instance of the accuracy of the opinion which I have
expressed
It stood with- out a garrison
It commanded the harbor, and the fort was known to have the armament in it ca- pable of defense
Did the Carolinians attack it
Did they propose to seize it
It stood there safe as public property; and there it might have stood i
to the end of the negotiations without a question, if garrison had not been sent into it
It
was the faith on which they relied, that the Federal Gov- I et•nment would take no position of hostility to them, that constituted its safety, and by which they lost the advantage they would have had in spiz:ng it when unoccupied
I think that some- thing is due to f4ith as well as fraternity; and I think one of the increasing and accumulative ob- ligations upon us to withdraw the garrison from II that fort is from the manner in which it was taken —taken, as we heard by the reading of the paper yesterday, while Carolina remained under-the as- surance that thestatus would not be violated ; while I•was under that assurance, and haifa dozen other Senators now within the sound of my voice felt secure under the same pledge, that nothing would be done until negotiations had terminated, unless it was to withdraw the garrison
Then we, the Federal Government, broke the faith; we.com- mitted the first act of hostility; and from this first act of hostility arose a-II those acts to which refer- ence is made in the message as unprovoked ag- gressions—the seizing of förts elsewhere
Why Avere they seized
Self-preservation is the first law of nature; and when they no longer had confi- dence that this Federal Government would
not seize thc forts constructed for their defense, and use them for their destruction, they only obeyed I the dictates of self-preservation when they seized the forts to prevent the enelny from taking pos- session of them as a means of coercion, for they thon were compelled to believe this Federal Gov- ernment had become an encrny
Now, what is the remedy
To assure them that you do not intend to use physical forcc affainst them is your first remedy; to assure them that you intend to consider calmly all the propositions which they make, and to rccognize the rights X.vhich the Union was established to secure; that you intend to settle with them upon a basis in ac- cordunce with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States
When you d hat, peace will prevail over the land, and force b comeathingthatno man will considernecessary
1 turn hero confronted with a question which I vill not argue
The position which I have taken necessarily brings me to its consideration
With- It is the out arguing it, I will merely state it
right (if a State to withdraw from thc Union
'Ehe Pi•e.sident says it is not a constitutional right
The froin Oh io, [Mr
W ADF„] and his ally, the Senator fron-l 'I'cnuess•ee, argucd it as no right at all
'Well, let us see
-What is meant by a constitutional ri('ht
1B it to be a right derived froin the Constitution—a grant made in the Constitution 
that is what is meant, of course we all sce at once we do not derive it in that xvvay
Is it intended that it is not a constitu- tional right, because it is not granted in the Con- stituti0ii
That shows, indeed, buta poor appre- cialion of the nature of our Govcrnmcnt
All that is not granted in the Constitution belongs to the States; and nothin«y but what is granted in the Constitwion belongs to the Federal Government; alid keeping this distinction in view, it requires but
lilt.le argument to see the conclusion at which we necessarily arrive
Did the States surrender their sovereignty to the Federal Government
Did the States atyrec that they never could with- draw from the Federal Union 
I know it has been argued here, that the Con- federation said the Articles of Confi)dcration were to be a perpetual bond of Union, and that the Constitution was made to form a noorc perfect Union; that is to say, a Government beyond per- petuity, or ono day, or two or three days after doolnsday
But
that, has no foundation in the Constitution itself; it has no basis in the nature of ourGovcrnment
Constitution wasacompact between independent States; it was not a national Government; and hence Mr
Madison answered with such etTeetivcness to Patrick I-Icnry, in the convention of Virginia, which ratified the Consti- tution, den ving his proposition that it was to form a nation, and statincr to him theconclusive fact, that we sit here as a convention of the State to ratify or reject that Constitution; and how then can you say that it forms a nation, and is adopted by {lie It was not adopted by mass of the people
the mass of the people, as wc all know, histor- ically; it was adopted by each State; each State voluntarily ratifying it, entered the Union; and that Union was formed whenever nine States should cntcr it; and in abundance of caution, ib was stated in the resolutions of ratification of three of the Slates, that they still possessed the power to withdraw the grants which they had delegated, whenever they should be used to their injury or I know it is said t.hat this meant
the oppression
people of all the States; but that is such an ab- surdity that I suppose it hardiy necessary to an- swer it; or to speak of an elective government whole body of the people by whom it is elected is such an absurdity, that no man can believe it; and to suppose that a State convention , speaking for a State, having no authority to speak any- body else, would say that it was declaring what the people of the other States would do, would be an assumption altogether to the sound sense and wGll-known sentiments of the men who formed the Constitution and ratified it
But in abundance of caution not only was tl)is done, but the tenth amendment of Ibe Constitu- tion declared that all which had not been delegated was reserved to the States 01' to the people
Now, I ask where among the delegated grants to the Federal Government do you find any power to coerce a State; where among the provisions of the Constitution do you find ar,y prohibition on the part of a State to withdraw; and if you find neither one nor the other, must not this power be in great depository, the reservedrights of the States
I-lox,v was it ever taken out of that source of all power to the Federal Government
It was not delegated to the Federal Government; it was not proh ibi ted to the States; it necessarily remains, then, among the reserved powers of the States
This question has been so forcibly argued by the Senator from Louisiana, [Mr
BENJAMiN,] that I think it unnecessary to pursue it
FL'ht•ee
times the proposition was made to give power to coerce a State, in the convention, and as often refused; opposed as a proposition to make war on a State, and refused on the ground that the Federal Government could not make war upon a State
The Constitution was to form a Government for such States as should unite; it had no application beyond those who should voluntarily adopt it
Among the delegated powers there is none which interferes with the exercise of the right of seces- Sion by a State
As a right of sovereignty it rc- mained to the States under the Confederation ; and if it did not, you arraign the faith of the men who framed the Constitutign to which you appeal, for they provided that nine States could secede from thirteen
Eleven did secede from the thirteen, and put themselves in the very position which, by a great abuse of languam), is to-day called treason, against the two States of North C.arolina and Rhode Island, they still claiming to adhere to the perpetual Articles of Confederation, these clevcn Statos absolving themselves from the obli- gations which arose under them
The Senator from Tennessee, to whom I must refer again—and do so because he is a southern Senator—taking the most hostile ground against us, refers to the State of Tennessee, and points to the time when that State may do those things which he has declared it an absurdity for any State to peyforrn
I will read a single paragraph from his speech, showing what his languagc is, in order that I may not, by any possibility,
pro- duce an impression upon others which his lan- guage does not justify
Here are the expressions to which I refer
I call the Senator's attention to them : If there are grievances, why cannot wc all go togcthcr, and write them down, and point the:n out to our northern friends after we have agreed on what those grievances were, and say, here is '.vhat
we de:naltd ; here our wrongs are entnnerated; upon these terms Ive have anteed • , and now, after wc have given you a reasonable tinw to consider these additional guarantees ill order to protect ourselves against these wrongs, if you refuse then-I, then, havina inade ail bonorahle eflOrt—having exhausted all other Ineane— we *nay declare the association to be broken up, and we Inaj•' go into an act of revolution Mie can then say to thern, ' vou have refused to give us; guarantees that we think are needed for the protection of our institutions and (or the pro- tection oc our other interests.' When they do this, will go as rar as hc who goes the furthest." Now, it does appear that he will go that far; and he goes a little further than anybody, I be- lieve, who has spoken in vindication of the right, for he says: We do not intend that you shall drive us out of this It ig our house that was reared by the harlds ofour fathers
house
It is the constitutional house
We have a right here ; and because you coine forward and violate the ordi- nanees of' this house, do not intend to go out; and if you persist in the violation of the ordinances of the house, we intend to eject you from the building and retain the posses- Sion ourselves." I wonder if this is what caused the artillery companies to be ordered here, and the militia of think it was a mere this city to be organized
I do not believe thc Senator figure of speech
from Tennessee intended to kick you out of the house; and if he did, let me say to you, in all rendering itself injurious and oppressive to the sincerity, we who clairn the constitutional right  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
309 of a State to withdraw from the Union, do not intend to help him
He says, however, and this softens it a little:" " wc do not think, though, that we have just cause for going out of the Union now
We have just cause of com- pktint; but wc are jor rcmaining in the Union, and fighting the battle like men." What does that mean
In the name of com- mon sense, I ask how are we to fioht in the Union
•we take an oath of offco to maintain the Constitution of the United States
The Con- stitution of the United States was formed for do- mestic tranquillity; and how, then, are we to fight have heard the proposition from in the Union 
I under- others; but have not understood It
stand how men fight when they assume attitudes of hostility; but I do not understand how men remaining connected together in a bond as breth- ren, sworn to mutual aid and protection, still pro- I do not understand pose to fight each other
If he chooses to answer what the Senator mcans
my question, I am willing to hear him, for f do not understand how we are to fiffht in the Union
Mr
JOHNSON, of 'i'ennessee
When my speech is taken altogether, I think my meanincr can be very easily understood
What f mean by fighting the battle in the Union, is, I think, very distinctly and clearly sct forth in my speech; and if the Senator will take it from beginning to end, 1 apprehend that he will have difficulty in as- certaining what I meant
But, for his gratification upon this particular point, I will repeat, in sub- stance, what I then said as to fiffhting the battle in the Union
I meant that we should remain here under the Constitution of the United States, and contend for all its guarantees; and by pre- serving tho Constitution and all its guarantees we would preserve the Union
Our true place to maintain these «uarantees, and to preserve the Constitution, is in the Union, there to fight our battle
How
By argument; by appeals to the patriotism, to the good sense, and to the judgment of the whole country; by showing tho people that that, all its the Constitution had been violated; guarantees were not complied with; and I have entertained the hope that when they were pos- sessed of that fact, there would be found patriot- ism and honesty enough in the great mass of the people, north and south, to come forward and do what was just and rimht between the contending sections o
tho country
I meant that the true way to ficrht the battle wqs for us to remain herc Mr
DAVIS
I receive the answer from the Senator, and I think I comprehend now that he is not going to use any force, but it is a sort of ficrhting that is to be done by votes and words; and I think, therefore, the President need not bring artillery at)d order out the militia to sup- press them
I think, altoocther, we are not in danger of much bloodshed m the mode proposed by the Senator from Tennessee
I had not Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
quite done; but if the Senator is satisfied— Mr
DAVIS
Quitc satisfied
I am entirely satisfied that the answer of the Senator shows me he did not intend to fight at all; that it was a mere figure of speech, and does not justify con- verting the Federal capital into a military camp
But it is a sort of revolution which he pro- poses; it is a revolution under the forms of the Government
Now, I have to say, once for all, that, as long as I am a Senator here, I will not use the powers I possess to destroy the very Gov- ernment to which am accredited
i will not at- tempt, in the language of the Senator, to handcuff I will not attempt to destroy the the President
Administration by refusing any offccrs to admin- I should vote, as I have done istel' its functions
to Administrations to which I stood in nearest relation, acrainst a bad nomination; but I never would agree, under thc forms of the Constitution, and with the powers I bear as a Senator of the United States, to turn t.hose powers to the destruc- tion of the Governnncnt I was sworn to support
1 leave that to gentlemen wbo take the oath with It is not my policy
If I a mental reservation
must have revolution, I say let it be a revolution such as our fathers made when they were denied their natural rights
So much for that
It has quieted apprehension; and I hope that the artillery will not be brought here; that the militia will not bc called out; and that the female schools will con t.inue theirsessions as heretofore
[Laughtnr.] The
authority of Mr
Madison, howcvcr, was relied on by tbc Senator ! from 'Pennessce; and he read fåirly an extract from MI'
Madison 's Ictter to VVebste1', and give him credit for reading what it sccms to me It is this clause: destroys his whole argument
'I'hc powers of thc Goverrnncnt being exercised, as in other electivc and responsible Governincnts, undcr the control of its constituents, the people, and the Legisla- ture,s (it' thc States, and subject to t.he revokutionary rights of the peoplc in c.xtrmnc cases." Now, sir, wc arc confusi ne langua very much

Why (lid I mak_c that speak of revolution; and When they say rev- that they might- possess those inalienable rights which they hasl declared—terminäted•- their- great efforts by transmittingposterityqo a-conditiöh in which they could only gain those iights by force
If so, the blood of the Revolution was shedz in vain ; no great principles were established ; for Bree was the law of nature before the battles of •the Revolution were fought
I see, then—if gentlemen insist on using -the word c' revolution " in the sense of a •resort to force—a very great difference between their opin- ion and that of Mr
Madison
Mr
Madison put the rights of the people over and above everything else; and he said this was the Government dejure and de facto
Call it what name you will, he undcrsto.od ours to be•a Government of thc peo- ple
The-people never have separated themselves from those rights which our fathers had declared to be inalienable
They did not delegate to the Federal Government the powers which the British Crown cxercised over the colonies; they did not achieve their independence for any purpose so low as that
They left us to the inheritance of freemen, living in independent communities," the States united for the purposes which they thought would bless posterity
It is in the exercise Of this reserved right as defined by Mr
Madison, as one to which all the powers of Government are subject, that the people of a State in convention have claimed to resume the functions which in like manner they had made to the Federal Gov- crnmcnt
-I pass from the argument of this question, which I have previously said I did not Intend to enter into at large, to ask, why is the right denied
It is part of the history of our times, It is part of the condition of tho country, that the right is denied, because this conflict between sections, in which one was struggling for domination, the other for existence, has been brought to the point where the dominant section insists that it will hold thc other for its purposes; where it claims that we shall not go in peace, nor remain with our rights; and if the attempt be made to hold that position by force, we accept the wager of battle

We have used your ships for the purpose of trans- port and navigation

I was reading, a short tirne ago, an extract from the speech of the Senator frorn Tennessee which referred to the time when ' pose t.ake the position which it was said to be an absurdity for South Carolinn to hold
How can the change of narnps thus affect the question; and who is to judge in tho case
Tennessee still was put, ill the same spcech, in the attitude ofa great objector ocrainst the exercise of right of secession
Is there anything in her history which thus places her
Tennessee, born of secession, rocked in the cra- die of revolution, t.aking her position bcfore she was matured, and clain)ing to be n State bccause she had vioiently severed her con nection with North Carolina, and throuoh an act of secession and revolution, claimed to %ave become a State
I honor her for it
I honor the gallant old Sevier rights of which Norlh Caro- lina attempted to deprive hirn, and i admire the talent which made recruits from every army which was sent to subdue him
Washington and Jack- son-, too, are often presented as authority against it4Vashington, who led the army of the Revo- lution; Washington, whose reputation rests upon the fact that with the sword he cut the cord which bound the Colonies to Great Britain, they not having the justification of the sovereign attributes belongintr to States; Washington, who presided when the States seceded fron•i the Confederation, and ibrmed the Union , in disregard of the claims of the States not ngrecing to it; and -Jackson , glorious old soldier, who, in his mirroi•ity, upon the sacred soil of South Curolina, bled fin• the cause of revolu- tion and Lhc overthrow of a Government which he believed to bc oppressive; who, through his whole life, indicated the same cast of character, st.anding in an attitude which to-day would bc called re- bellion and treason, when hc opposed the Federal Government, denied their power, contemne&their orders to disband his troops, threatened to put any offcer in irons who camc into his camp to recruit, and marched his force, the Tennessee militia, back from Washington in Mississippi, to the place whence they hadstarted
Bad authorities are these for out opponents; yet they are names under the shadow of which we can safely repose ! If we were reduced to arguing the question on the ground of cxpediency; if we had to convince the dominant section that it was good for them that their best customers should leave them; if we had to convince them that they should not any longer have the power to tax us, that they should not collect the revenue which fills the 'Treasury and builds up their vast public works, fear we should not succeed; but if they are sin- cerc in bclicving that are of no advantage to them; if they look upon the southern States as a burden; if they think we rc,quire their protection, then we are ready to relieve them

January 10, The question which now presents itself to the country is, what shall we do with events as they stand
Shall we allow this separation to be total 
Shall we render it peaceful, with, a view to the chance that when hunger shall brighten tho intel- lects of men, and the teachings of hard experience shali have tamed them, they may come back, in the spirit of our fathers, to the task of recon- struction
Ot• will tlvy have that separation par- tial; they give to each State all its military power; will they give to each State its revenue power; will they still preserve the common agent; and will they thus carry on a Goverrnnent differ- ent from that which now exists, yet not separat- ing the Statcs so entirely as to make the work of reconstruction equal to a new creation; not sep- arating them so as to render it utterly impossible to administer any functions of the Government in security and peace 
waive the question of duality, considering that a dual Executive would be the institution ofa king-lord
I consider a dual legislative depart- ment would be to bring into antagonism the rep- resentatives of two different countries, to war per- pctually, and thus to continue, not union, but the irrepressible conflict
There is no duality pos- Eible (unless there be two Confederacies) which seems to me consistent with the interests of either or of both
It miffht be that two Confederacies could bc so organized as to answer jointly many of the ends of our present Union; it might be thät States, agreeing with each other in their internal polity—havino• a sinhilarily of interests and an Identity of purpose—in igh t associate together; and that these two Confederacies might have relations to cach other so close as to give them a united power in time of war against any foreicrn nation
'L'hesc things are possibilities; these things it be- comes us to contemplate; these things it devolves on the majority section to consider now; for with every motion of that cloek is away your opportunity
I I was ffreatel' whcn we met on ibe first Monday in Decenlber than it is now; it is greater now than it will bc on the first day ot' ncxt week
We havc waitcd long; we have come to the conclusion that you moan to do nothing
In the of thirteen, whcre thc resolutions of the Scnatot• from Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN] were considered, various attempts were made, but no prospect of' any a(rreemetlt on which it was pos- Sible for us to stnnd , in security t•or tho futu .•e, could be matured
I offered a proposition, which was but the declaratiön of that which the Constitu tion announces; but that which the Supreme Court had, from time to time, and from an early period, asserted; but that v,'hich was necessary for equal- ity in the Union
Not one singlc vote of the Re- publicall portion of that committee was given for the proposition
Looking then upon separation as inevitable, not knowing how that separation is to occur, or at least what States it is to embrace, there re- mains to us, I believe, RS the consideration svhich is most useful, the inquiry , how can this separation be effected so as to leave to us thc power, when- to the southern States will be mainly to their for- eicrn commerce
All will feel the deprivation of that high pride and power which belong to the flag now representing the greatest Republic, it' not the greatest Government, upon thc face of the globe
I would that it s'
ill rcnuained to consider what we might calmly have considered on the first Monday in December—how this could be avoided; but events have rolled past that point
You would not make propositions when they would have been effective
I presume you will not make them now; and I know not what effect they would have if you did
Your propositions would have been most welcome if' they had been made before any question of coercion, and before any vain boasting of pox.ver•, for pride and passion 
do not often take counsel of pecuniary interest, at least among those whom I represent
Ent you havo chosen to take the policy of clinging to words, in disregard of cvel')ts, and have hastened It is true, as shown by the his- them onwards
tory of all revolutions, that they arc most precip- itated„ and intensified by obstinacy and vacilla- tion
T hc want of a policy, the obstinate adhe- rence to unhuportant
things, have brought us to a condition where I close my eyes, bccausc I can- not sce anytl'ling that encourao•es mo to hope
In the long period which elapsed after the down- fall of the great
Republics of the East, when des- potism seemed to brood over the civilized world, and only here and there constitutional monarchy even vvas able to rear its head; when all the great principles of republican and representative gov- ernment had sunk deep, fathomless, into the sea of human events; it was then that the storm of our Revolution moved the waters
The earth, the air, and the sea, became brilliant; and from the foam of ages rose the constellation which was set in the political firmament as siffn of unity and confed- eration and community independence, coexistent with confederate st.rcngth
That constellation I-las served to bless our people
Nay, more; its light has been thrown on foreign lands, and its regen- crative power will outlive, perhaps, the Govern- ment as a sign for which it was set
It rnay bc pardoned to mc, sir, who, in my boylk00d, was giver) to thc military service, and who have fol- lowed under tropical suns, and over northern snows, the flao• of Ille Union, suffering from it as it does not
become me to speak it, if f here express the deep sorrow which always overwhelms me when I think of takink a last leave of that object i of early affection and proud association, feeling that henceforth it is not to be the banner which, by day and by night, I am ready to follow, to hail with the rising and bless with the sctting sun
But God, who knows the hearts of men, will between you and as, at whose door lies the respons- ibility of this

And yet the only response which has come froin the other side has been a stolid ever we shall have the will, to reconstruct

Sirs, remember temple fall, we do not care." It can only be done by denying to the Federal It can .only be Government all power to corece

Oar State I that such conduct is oflOnsive, and that men may becotne indifferent even to the objects of' their early attachmcnfs
If our Government shall fail, it will not be the defect of the sy stern, though its mechal')ism was tem furnishes our contemplation; for it had had no center of gravitation; each planet was set to revolve in an orbit of its own, each moving by its own ilnpulse, and all attracted by the affec- tions which countervailed each other

doctrine of passive obedience whicll, in England, cost one monarch his head, and drove another into exile; a doctrine whicb, since the revolution of 1688, has obtained nowhere where men speak the English tongue; and yet all this it is needful to admit before we accept this doctrine of coercion, which is to send an Army and a Navy to do that
which there are no courts to perform; to execute the law without a judicial decision, and without an officer to serve process
This, I say, would degrade us to the basest despotism under which man could live; the despotism of a many-headed monster, without the sensibility or regardful con- sideration which might belong to a hereditary king

Yet you have believed—not looking to the great end to which our cyes were directed—that it •wras a mere political resort, by which we would intimidate some of your own voters
You have turned upon those true friends of ours at the North who have
vindicated the Constitution, and pointed out to you the danger of your course, and held them responsible for the censure you received, as though you had not, in fact, aggressed
Even at thi session, after forty years of debate, you have ed us what was the matter

1 will take the opportunity to say, in conjunction with what the Senatog from Mississippi has said, that there is not one man in a million, as faros I know and believe, in thc State of Georgia, or elsewhere in the South, who would be in favor of any such principle
Mr
DAVIS
If, Mr
President, a paper con- taining such dourine could subsist upon sub- scription anywhere in the United States, I should esteem it nearly as bad an indication as the adop- tion of the doctrine of slavish submission; and either the one or the other I should consider afar worse sign of man's incapacity to govern hilnself than any which iö
presented by the resumption I have no of the grants that a State has mode
idea that there is any such feeling within the limits of the southern States
There ace two modes, however, of dissolving the Union
One alone has been contemplated
It was that which proceeded from States separating themselves from those to whom they are united
It is by destroying the Con- There is another
stitution; by pulling down the political temple; by forming a consolidated Government
Union, in the very meaning of the word, implies the junc- tion of separate States
Consolidation would be the destruction of the Union, and far more fatal to popular liberty than the separation of the States
But, if fanaticism and sectionalism, like the blind giant of old, shall seize the Wllars of the temple to tear them down, in order that they may destroy its inmates, ith but remains for us to with- draw, and it •will be our purpose tocommence the erection of another on the same plan on which our fathers built this
We share no such common ruin as falls upon a people by consolidation and de- struction of the principles of liberty contained in the Constitution, by interference with comrnunity and social rights; and we go out of such a Gov- ernment whenever it takes that form, in accord- tions of the country during the last summer, even , after the election was over, when no purpose of the canvass remained still to excite them, an- nouncing the triumph which had been achieved, as tbc downfall of our domestic institutions; and still you ask us to make specifications, to filc an indictment as though we intended to arrairn you before a magistrate's court
Our fathers united with yours on the basis of equality, and they were prompted to form a union by the fraternity which existed between them
Do you admit that equality
Do you foe! that fraternity
Do your actions show it
They united for the purpose not only of domestic tranquillity, but for common de- fense; and the debates in the convention which formed the Constitution set forth that the navi- gating and manufacturing interests of one section, and the better defense in the other, 'vvere the two great objects which drew them together
Are you willing now tQ fulfill the conditions on which our fathers agreed to unite
When you use figurative language, its harsh- ness indicates the severity of your temper and the bitterness of your hate
When you talk about having your heel on the slave power and grind- ing it into dust; when you talk about the final tri- umph; when you talk about the extinction of sla- very, an institution writh which you have nothing to do and of which you know nothing, is this the fraternity, is this the Union, to which we were invited
Is that an administration of the Govern- ment under which we can live in safety
Is this a condition of things to which men , through whose veins flows the blood of the Revolution, can stoop without acknowledging that they had sunk from their birthright of freedom to become slaves ! I care not to read from your platform; I care not to read from the speeches of your President elect
You know them as I do; and the man who is regarded over this country as the directing in- tellect of the party to which •he belongs, the Sen- ator from New York, [Mr
SEWARD,] has, with less harshness of expression than others, but with more of method, indicated this same purpose of deadly hostility in every form in which it could be portrayed
Did we unite with you in order that the po wers of the General Govern men t should Do you believe that now; in our increased and increasinc-r commercial as well physical power,' we will consentto remain united to a Government exercised for such a purpose' as this 
What boots it to tell me thatno direct act-of_-ag
gression will be made
I prefer direct- tbcifidiréct hostile measures which wilF produce the sametre- suit
I prefer it, as I prefer an open to a-seerettbe
Is there a Senator upon the other side who to•aay will agree that we shall have equal enioyment of the Territories of the United States
rs there one who will deny that we have equally paid 'in their purchases, and equally bled in their acquisition in war
Then, is this the observance of your- com- pact
Whose is the fault if the Union be dissolved
Do you say that there is one of you who confro- verts either of these positions
Then I ask you, do you give us justice; do we enjoy equality
-If we are •not equals, this is not the Union to whiéti we were pledged; this is not the Constitution hYöu have sworn to maintain, nor this the GoVernme:nt we are bound to support
There is much, too, which is exceeditrgly_of- fcnsive in thc speculations you make upon our servants when you talk about negro insurrection 
Governments have tampered with slaveg•, bad men have ffone among the ignorant and credulous people, an incited them to murder and arson; but of themselves—moving by themselves—I say his- tory does not chronicle a case of negro insurrec- tion
San Domingo, so often retirred to, and so little understood, is not a case where black heroes rose and acquired a Government
It "„•vas cage in which thc French Governrnent, tramplil'!g upon the rights and safety ofa distant and feeble colony by send ing troops among them, brought on a revo- lution, first of the mulattoes, and afterwards of the blacks
Their first army was not even able to It required a second army, and t.hat effect this
army to be quartered on the plantations; nay, after all, it required that the master should be ar- rested on the charge of treason and taken to France, before thc ne«roes could be aroused to insurrection
Do you wonder, then, that we pause when wo sec t Ins studied tendency to convert the Govcrn- ment into a military despotism
Do you wonder that we question the right of the President to send troops to execute the laws wherever he pleases, when we remember the conduct of France, and that those troops were sent with like avowal, and quartered on plantations, and planters arrested for treason—just such charges as are made to-day against southern men—and brought away that in- surrection might be instigated among their slaves 
I seek not to exaspcratc or intensify the causes of diffculty, It is needful that we should un- I thought we had done so derstand each other

' ' The last canvass, I thought, had expressed the feelings and the opinion-s of the southern States
The State of Mississippi gave warning in solemn resolutions passed by her Legislature
Those resolutiöne were printed elsewhere, and were generally known
She declared her purpose to take cöyh- scl with her southern sister States whenever a President should be elected on the basis of sec- tional hostility to them
With all this warning, you paused not
The quarrel was not of ou making
Our hands are stainless; you upon our rights and our homes, and, under the will of God, we will defend them
There is a strange similarity in the position of affairs at the present day to that which the colo- nio occupied
Lord North asserted the right to collect the revenue, and insisted on collecting • it by force
He sent troops to Boston harbor, and to Charleston, and he quartered troops in those towns
The result was, collision, and out' of that collision came the separation of the colonies from the mother country
The same thing is being attempted to-day
Not the law, not the civil magistrate, but troops, arc relied upon now to ex- ecute the laws

The time is near at hand when the places which have known us as colleagues laboring togcther, can •know us in that relation no morc forever
I have striven to avert the catastrophe which now impends over the country, unsuccessfully; and I regret it
For the few days which I may remain, I am willing to labor in order that that catastrophe shall be as little as possible destructive to public peace and prosperity
If you desire at this last moment to avert civil •q,var, so be it; it is better so
If you will butallowus to separate from you peace- ably, since we cannot live peaceably together, to leave with the rights we had before we were united, since we cannotenjoy them in the Union , then there are many relations which may still subsist bc- tween -us, drawn from the associations of our struogies from the revolutionary era to the pres- ent ay, which may be beneficial to you as well as to us
If you will not have it thus; if in the pride of power, if in contempt of reason and reliance upon force, you say wc shall not go, but shall remain as subjects to you , then, gentlerncn ofthc North,a war is to be inaugurated the like of which men have not seen
Sufficiently numerous on both sides, in close contact with only imaginary lines of di vision , and with many Incans of approach, cach st.tstaincd by productive sections, the people of which will give freely both of money arid of store, the con- flicts must be multiplicd indefinitely; and Inassos of men, sacrificed to the demon of civil war, will furnish hecatombs, such as the recent campaign in Italy did not offer
At thecnd of all this, what will you have efli.•cted
Destruction upon both sides; subjugation upon neither; a treaty of peacc leavilp both torn and bkeeding; the wail of tine widow and the cry of the orphan substituted for those peace- ful notes of domestic happiness that now prevail throughout the land; and then you will agree that each is to pursue bis separate course as best he may
Tins is to be the end of wttf
Through a long series of years you may waste your strength , distress your people, and get at last to the posi- tion which you might have had at first, had jus- ticc and reason , instead of selfish ness and passion , folly and crime, dictated your course
Is there wisdom, is there patriotistn in the land 
If so, easy must be the solution of this question
If%not, then Mississippi 's gallant sons vs'ill stand manifestations which did not exist
In one case, I .well remember when the Senator from Vermont [Mr
COLLAMER] was serving with me on a spe- Cial committee, it was reported that a gentleman who had gone from a commercial house in New York had been inhumanly treated at Vicksburg, I and this embarrassed a question which we then had pending
I wrote to Vicksburg for informa- tion, and my friends could not learn that such a lilan hud ever been there; but if he had been there, no violence certainly had been offered to him
Falsehood and suspicion have thus lcd you on step by step in the career ofcrimination , and per- haps has induced to some part of your aggression
Such evil effects we have heretofore suffered, and the consequences now have their fatal culmina- tion
On the verge of war, distrust and passion increase thc danger
To-day it is in the power of two bad mcn, at the opposite ends of the telc- graphic line between Washington and Charleston, to precipitate the State of South Carolina and the United States into a conflict of arms without other cause to have produced it
And still will you hesitate; still will you do nothing
Will you sit I,vith sublime indifferencc and allow cvents to shape themselves
No longer can you say the ra€ponsibikity is upon the Exec- utive
He has it upon you
He has noti- fied you that he can dt nothing; and you there- like a wall of fire around their State, and I go hence, not in hostility to you, but in love and i forc know he will do nothing
He lias told you the responsibility nox,v rests with Congress; and I close as
I began, by invoking you to meet that responsibility, bravely to act the patriot's part
If you will, the angel of peacc may spread hcr wings, though it be over divided States; and the sons of the sires of the Revolution may still go on in friendly intercourse with each other, ever renewing tho memories of a common origin, the sections, by thc diversity of their products and habits, acting and reacting beneficially, the com- mercc of each moy swell the prosperity of both, and the happiness of all be still interwoven lo- gcthcr
Thus nnty it be; and thus it is in your power to inake it
[Applause in the galleries.] The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
FOSTER in the chair.) rl"he Sergeant-at-A.rms will take care to remove disorderly persons in the gallery
Order *nust bc preserved
Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, it has very hard for me, and I doubt not my Republi- can associates around to bear the many mis- apprehensions, not to say misstatements, of our position, and to sce a perverted state of facts day after day urged upon the Senate and the country by gentlemen upon the other side
-w c havc listened to the Senator from Mississippi; and one would suppose, in listening to Irim here, that he was friend of II-lis Union, that he desired the perpetuity of this Government
He has a most singular way of preservin«r it, and a most singu- lar way of Inuintaininrr thc Constitution
What is it
Why, he proposes that the Government should abdicate
If it will sirnply withdraw its ' forces froxn Charleston, and abdicate in favor either of a mob 01' of Lhc constituted authorities of Charleston, we will have pc.abe! Ile dreads civil war; and he will avoid it by a surrender ! He talks as if we Republicans were responsible fin• civil war if it ensues
If civil war comes, it comes from thosc with whom he is acting
Who proposes to makc civil war but South Carolina
Who proposes to nnake civil war but Mississippi allegiance to her, to take my place among hcr sons, be it for good or for evil
I shall probably never again attempt to ulter here the language cither of warn ing or of argument
I leave the case in your hands
If you solve it not before I go, you wilt have still to decide it
To- wards you individually, as well as to those whom you represent, I would that I had tl')e power now to say there shall be peace between us forever
would that i had the powet• nosv to say the in- tercourse and the commerce l:etween the States, if they cannot livc in one Union, shall still bc unin- tcrrupted ; that all the sociai relations shall remain undisturbed; that the son in Mississippi shall visit freely his father in Mainö, and the reverse; and that each shall be welcomed when hc gocs to the other, not by himself alone, but also by his neiæhbors; and that all that kindly intercourse which has subsisted between the differcnt sections and Alabama and Georgia, seizing, by force of urrns, upon the public property of the United r l'alk to us of making civil war! You States 
inautrurate it, and then talk of it as if it came
from the friends of the Constitution and the Union
Here stands this great Government; here stands the U Ilion—a pillår, so to speak, already erected
we propose to pull it down
Do we propose undermining foundations of the Constitution or disturbing the Union
Not at all; but the proposition comes from the other sidc
They are making war, and modestly ask us to have peace by submittillg to what they ask! i agree in onc thing with thc Senator from Mis- of the Union shall continue to exist
It is not sissippi
I agree with hill) that there should havc only for the interest of all, but it is my profound- been more decision and more resolution on the est wish, my sincerest desire, that such remnant of i part of the Government at thc Ol.ttset
If, when that which passing away may grace the memory he was secretly informed, as it seems he was long ofa glorious, though too brief, existcl)ee
ago, that tbc public property of the United States Day by day you have becon».e more and more at Charleston was not to be protected; if, at that exasperated
False reports have led you to sup- time, he, as a military man, had advised the P WS- pose
therc was in our section hostility to you with ident of the United States to Fut the public prop- erty at Charleston in a position to- be defended, secession would never have made the progress it has
But, sir, it seems there was a complicity with this thing
It was at Icast to be tolerated
Assurances, it was said, were given that the Uni- ted States would not protect itself: " Go on, you seceding States; gather your strength; the United States •will do nothing to protect itself against your assaults
" Mr
DAVIS
1 did not hear Senator's re- marks
Does he refer to me as havino secret in- formation 
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 to the Senator from Mississippi as having said he understood the pledge was given that the fortifications at Charleston were to remain as they were; that that pledge was given some time before the com- missioners came here, and that they were to re- main in that condition until after therc i.vas an opportunity to treat
Mr
DAVIS
well, sir, since you have got through a windy sort of explanation, allow me to ask you where said 1 got the information 
IVIr
TRUMBULL
1 do not know that the Senator stated where he got it
Mr
DAVIS
It was a great pity, then, you did not listen; for I think my remark •wras very clear: in the papers that were here read yesterday
Mr
TRUMBULL
Then the Senator is not responsible
I am informed by Senators around mc, that thc Senator from Mississippi did reinark that Senators around him knew of the pledge at the time it is said to have
been •ivcn
Mr
DAVIS
Five or six Senators knew of the agreement to maintain the status then existing
Mr
TRUMBULL
That is the point
Mr
DAVIS
When I spoke of the assurance, however, I referred to the papers which were read
If the Senator wants to know whether i understood, before those papers were read at the desk, that the status should remain, I tell him yes; émphatically yes
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 should like to know if he understood it before South Carolina seceded, or passed her ordinance of secession 
Mr
DAVIS
1 think not, sir
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 hope not
Mr
DAVIS
You hope not! v,7hy
Mr
TRUMBULL
Because 1 should have hoped that that Senator would have discounte- nanccd any such idea as leaving the Government of the United States dcfenseless against the peo- ple who were preparing to attack and assail and destroy it
Mr
DAVIS
Then 1 have to say to the Sen- ator, his ideas of honor and my own are very dif- ferent•, that I should hold the man to bea scoundrel who did not desire to have a garrison withdrawn, if he believed that garrison might produce blood- shed and could not do good
Mr
TRUMBULL
do good; and it was the very weakness of the garrison that has invited this secession in South Carolina
know not whether the rumors circulated about the Capitol to-day bc true; whcther thc gallant Anderson, in addition to putting himself in Fort Sumter, where he could defend himself, has now sent a message to Charleston' that has prevented an attack upon the succor sent to his relief
I know not whether the rumor be true that Major Anderson informed the Governor of South Car- olina that he would shell the city of Charleston, and burn it to the ground, if another gun was fired at tbc Star of the 'West; but I understand the Star of the MT est has been permitted, after a show of attack was made, to cntcr peacefully the harbor of Charleston
If so, it is by the resolu- tion of Major Anderson
The noble conduct of that man has saved the shedding of blood NIr
GREEN
Let me ask the Senator one ques- tion 
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does thesen- ator from Nlinois give way
Mr
TRUMBULL
Yes, sir
Mr
GREEN
Docs the Senator know—and if he does, will he give me the information—on what ground there vv•as any just apprehension on the part of Major Anderson for the movement he made 
Mr
Isupposc the try knows
Mr
GREEN.
I do not want a supposition
I 'tvant the facts
Mr
TRUMBULL
well, sir, the fact, 1 take  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL qLOBE
319 it, is known to that Senator, as well as myself, that South Carolina has pretended to assume her sovereiffn rights; and it has been publicly talked of, that if she is to bc a sovereign State—and he knows it as well as I do—she must assert her sovereignty over her territorial jurisdiction
Mr
GREEN
Let me ask this question: does her secession irnply her right to assume jurisdic- tion over the whole of her territory
Mr
TRUMBULL
If she has the right to secede, it would; but, in my judgment, her seces- Sion amounts to notl'iing
Mr
GREEN
All! Mr
TRUMBULL
It is nothing but rebellion, it is nothing but insurrection But not only in South Carolina, wherc there was the pretense secession to justify the act, which, I think, really amounts to nothing, but in Georgia, and in Ala- bamu, which have not seceded, wc are told that thc bubiic property of the United States has becn seized; and tho Senator from Mississippi thinks the best way to avoid civil war is for the United States to withdraw their forces, to surrender their forts, and strike the flag under which he was nurtured, and beneath which he has marched so often
The stars and stripes have been taken down from the United States buildings in the city of Charleston, and trampled in the dust, and a palmetto flag, with a snake, reared in their place; but if we would avoid civil war, we are told, we must submit to this! Why, sir, any people can have peace at the price of degradation
No despot makes war upon subjects who submit their necks to the tread of his heel
But if we would main- tain constitutional liberty; if we would maintain constitutional freedom; if we would maintain this great Government; we must not suffer ever fac- tion, and every mob, and cvery State, tha links proper, to trample its flag under foot
Now, sir, I have a word to say, and shall be brief, in regard to this doctrine of secession
The Senator from Mississippi supposes that a State has the right to secede, because he cannot find in the Constitution the clause which says t.hat a State shall not secede
I believe the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH,] whom the Senator from Missis- sippi complimented so highly to-day, made that wonderful discovery a few days ago, and he read that clause of the Constitution x,vhich declares The powers not delegated to the United States by Lite Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, arc reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Now, he says, show us the clause of the Con- stitution of the United States that prohibits a State If he will look at the Con- from withdrawing
stitution of the United States hc will find that it imposes many inhibitions upon the States: No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any 'itnposts or duties on itnports or exports." &c.
No State shall
without the colisent_ of Congress," " enter into any agreerncnt or compact with another State, or with a foreign rower " If It can secede, clearly it may enter into an twreement or compact, if it is a sovereian inde- pendent nation, as the Senator from Mississippi contends
Well, it has no power to do this
But he will say, after it secedes it may do it
Then what is your Constitution good for
If a State, by declaring itself out of the Union, can release itself from all its constitutional obligations, do you not perceive that no constitutional obligation is binding upon it at ail
It is only another way of Is not here evading a constitutional obligation
a positive prohibition in this Constitution that no State shall exercise these sovereign powers
And yet the Senator from Ohio wants to see the clause that she shali not secede
YVhy, do you not find it here
If she can secede, cannot she exercise every onc of them, and is not the power expressly granted in the Constitution— 'l'o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and other powers vested by this Vonstitution- in the Governtnent ot• the United States." Now, what power is vested by this Constitu- tion
The power to preventa State from coinino• money; the power to prevent a State from making compacts and entering into alliances with other States; the power to preventa State from levying imposts or duties; and yet the Senator wants to know where is ti'le authority in the Constitution to prevent a State from seceding 
Sir, it is very clear to my mind that this doc- trine of secession is utterly destructive of a con- stitutional Government
On the game principlo, a county may secede from a State, and a town from a county
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN] has been talking about com- promises, and has introduced a string of resolu- tions here
When they are adopted, what is your Government good for
What is to prevent the State of Illinois next week, or the State of Ken- tuck y the following week, from seceding, as South Carolina has done, and demanding new guaran- tecs as a condition of the
existence' of the Union 
By submitting to this doctrine, you destroy the stability of the Government
Constitutional Gov- • ernments are worth nothing if this doctrine is to obtain; and hence it is thai those of us who are for sustaining the Constitution and sustaining thc Union, believe that thc question involved is the existence government
We now have nothin• to do with the extension of African slavery—that is not the question before the Amer- ican people; but the question is, Has this Gov- ernmcnt any power to protect itself." In other words, have we a Government at all
That is what is to be tested
The people of Illinois be- lieve we have a Government, and a Government that has power to maintain itself, not by making civil war, but by enforcing the laws, and defending itself against those who would make war upon it
But we are told that 'svc cannot coerce a State; and this is repeated here from day to day
No one proposes to coerce a Statc
Rcfin•ence IS inade to the debates in the convention which formed the Constitution of the United States, to show that it was there argued that the Federal Governmcnt I agree to it
Why could not coerce a State
were those ar(yurnents made
Because, under the old Confederation, the Federal Government acted upon States; and it was to show the inefficiency of that system a.s reason for formincy a more perfect union, to get rid of the difficulties of the old Conföderation
When, under that system of government, Congress made requisitions upon States to raise money or to raise Inen, each State acted at its discretion
Some States raised the money and the men, and thc others did not; and there was no way by wl•rich the Congress could compel the States to act
This defect in thc old Articles of Confederation was pointed out in the convention which formed thc present Constitu- tion; and hence they adopted a different form of Government
Flow different
Why, a Govern- ment actin€y upon individuals; a Government un- der which the, power should exist to execute the laws by thc Government itself upon individuals in portions of the Republic; and that is the difference between this Govcrnment of ours as it exists under the Constitution, and that under the old Articles of Confederation
But, sir, what is this cause of complaint
Why is it that the southern States are inaucruratin«y civil I have as nruch horror for it as the Sena- tor from Mississippi
I would do anything hon- I certainly will not be the orablc to avoid it
instrument to inaucuratc it
But what is it the Senator frmn Mississippi [Mr
DAus] complains of
To use his language, hc says, if you are to make us hewers of wood and drawers of water for you in the North, we will not submit
If they are to be reduced to subjection to the North, they will not submit
I will not ask them to do so
So far as I am concerned, I will ask them to submit to nothing that I will not submit to myself
f ask to impose no incquality upon the State of M.ississippi
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator allow to ask him a question
IVIP
TRUMBULL
Yes, sir
GREEN
It is a very simple one
No State, neither Illinois, nor Missouri, nor Missis- sippi, can go into a rl'erritory, but the citizens Ilia y
Does he accord to each of those citizens the same right to take property, and to hold and enjoy it there, under the provision of law Mr
TRUMBULL
1 am glad to hear the Sen Mr
TRUMBULL
-1 sorry to to borrow any from my friend from Missouri
Mr
GREEN
-1 have to Mr
TRUMBULL
He has discovered, he says, that a State cånnot go into a Térriiory•,- an'd yet he says a State has a right in a Tefritou•y-
: has no right in a Territory
I have stated 4thåt once, and I will come to it again by and by
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President—— Mr
TRUMBULL
If the fro!mMis- souri will keep his seat, I understand him better than he understands himself; nnd I will show him directly what I understand about the Citizens of a State going into a Territory
Mr
GREEN
Mr
notun- dcrstand me
claim the right to explain myself
Mr
TRUMBULL
If the Senator from Mis- souri will be a little patient, he will find that I understand him; and that, I will state his position fairly
Let him wait until I get through
Mr
GREEN
I am misreprcsented' by the Senator from Illinois, and I claim the right to explain myself
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Illinois is entitled to tbc floor, unless he yields it to the Senator from Missouri
Mr
GREEN
The Senator has already mis- represented me, and I claim the right to explain
Mr
TRUMBULL
If 1 have already mis- represented the Senator, I will hear his statement
Mr
GREEN
1 did not say State mad no right in a Territory
I said a State had a right in a Territory because that Territory belonged to all the States; but as a State had no right to go into a Territory, but the citizens of a State had, [ wanted to know whether the citizens of that State should all have an equal right to enjoy their property undcr the protection of law
Mr
'TRUMBULL
I understood the Senator precisely as I understand him now
I understood him to say that the State could not go into a Ter- ritory; and I anderstand him now to say a State has a right in a Territ.orv
Now, I deny that a Statc has any right in a *Territory
The Terri* tories do not belong to the States; and the States have no more to do with the Territories than the counties of a State have
The Territories of the United States belong just as completely to the General Gofernme.nt as if there were no subdi- visions of the United Statcs into States
The State of Missouri has no more rightin the Terri- tory than the city of St
Louis
Docs the Senator from Missouri understand that, with all his sense
I tell him, that I will give to a citizen of the State of Missouri precisely the same righl to go into the territory of tbc United States that 1 claim for myself or anv constituent of mine
Mr
GREÉN
the Senator allow me one half minute 
Mr
'TRUMBULL
1 think understood the Jf 1 have misrepresented him, I will Senator
hear him; but otherwise, 1 prefer to go on and expose this fallacy
If he declines to Mr
GREEN
very well
allow me to make an explanation, I will answer him at some other time to his heart's content
Mr
TRUMBULL
Sir, am tired to death of this constant cry about the inequality of States
The Senator from Oregon—I do not mean the one who sits nearest me [Mr
ever i makes a speech, that hc docs not speak al)out equal ricyhts and the equality of the States; as if any man in America denied the equality of the i States in this Confederacy
I ElaviDR shown, then, that, as a State, no State has a rightin the conunon r I'erritories, I now say, in regard to individuals, that I will give to thc in- dividuals all over this land the same rights to go into the Territories of the United States; but I will give none of them, frotn rny State or Mis- sot.u•i, the right to take the law of Illinois or the law of Missouri into the Territories
Ifthe Sen- ator from Missouri cannot go into a Territory If the Senator , - l! with his slaves, neither can l
ator from Missouri say that no State has a right I from Missouri cannot go into a Territory with the in the rrerritory
I have often argued that
I i i banking system of Missouri, neither can I take \ the banks of Illinois in which I am interested into agree with him
Mr
GREEN
I did not say so
They have a Territory
Noth ing which is the creature Of å right, but they cannot go there
A State is a local law can any man take to a Territory
I sovereignty, and canno\ go outside of its juris- i { apprehend, sir, there is nothing in this cry Of diction; but yet it may have rights, in property inequality in regard cithnr to the States or _to We .are all to have the same rights
belonffing to all the States; and I am sorry the citizens
Senator has not sense enough to understand that But thc Senator froin Kentucky has presented a very strangc one; and, as I am point
 314 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, January 1.0, up, .1 will say a few words in regard to that
In the speech accompanying it, he speaks of it as similar to thc Missouri compromise
A great misapprehension is made to prevail in the country in reg41•d either to the Missouri gompromise or I see it stated in the the Senator's propositions
newspapers t_hat the Senator from.Kentucky (and I am sorry he is not here) proposes to restore the Missouri compromise, and, that _that- will- give pegee to the country; and we are •asked, now, why can.you not assent to the Missouri compro- mise
You objected to its repeal, why not re- store it
I tell the Senator from Kentucky I will agree to the Missouri compromise to-morrow
I urn quite willing that you should reénact the Mis- so-un compromise justas was, in totidemverbis—in the
very words iri which it was enacted in 1820
What was it
That in all the territory which we acquired from France lying north of 360 30' north latitude, and not embraced in the State of Mis- souri, heither slavery or involuntary servitude I am willing to vote for that should ever exist
to-morrow if it will be at all gratifying to my friend from Kentncky
The cffect of that would be, to do what
To exclude slavery from Kansas and Nebraska
That is all
That is the Mis- souri compromise; and if you want to reenact it, I will vote for it; you may copy the words from the statute of 1820
But, sir, that is a very different proposition from-the one ••.vhich the Senator from Kcnt.ucky has niade
His proposition is to run a line through other territory
That is a different ques- tion
Because two individuals who have had a dispute about a quarter section of land, have, in a spirit of compromise, divided it by a particular line of latitude, it does not f0110'„v that they must divide all other lands which they may afterwards It is acquire, by thc same parallel of latitude
a very different, question
Thc Senator's propo- osition is very different in another respect
The Missouri compromise did not establish slavery south of the linc of 360 30' north latitude
It said It prohibitcd slavery north of nothing about it
that line
The Senator from Kentucky propos(hs, by the Constitution, to recognize and cxtablish slavery south of 360 30' That is a very different thing from the Missouri compromise
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Will the Senator allow mc a word 
Mr
TRUMBULL
Certainly
Mr
CRITTENDEN
There was another compromise, if you recollect
This territory did not belong to the United States at the time of the Missouri compromise; but it did belong to the United States at the time of the compromise of 1850
.By the compromise of 1850, a po.wcr was, in substan•ce, given to the Letrislature of New Mexico to establish slavery, In the exercise of that power, she has cstablished it; and it cxists thcre now
My resolution only proposes that you shall recoo•nizo the oxisling and indisputable fact
of its existene,o; and to agsumc that status as the status that is to continue until it becomes a State; and then the peoll)le al'C to decide for them- selves
Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, why does thc Senator from Kentucky want to interfere with thc compromises of 1850
They were passed to give peace to tluc country
We Republicans arc not proposing to disturb them
Why docs he not eland by those compromises
Hc says au- thority was given to the people of New Mexico, undet the compromise of 1850, to establish sla- very if they wanted to
Well, authority was given them to -repeal the law establishing it if they wanted to do so; was it not
Why does the Sen- ator from Kentucky want to take away from the people New Mexico the power to repeal the law establishillg slavery if they think proper to do so 
W hiy does he want to overturn the com- promise of 1850
The Republican party arc not proposing it
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator allow mo to ask onc question 
Mr
TRUMBULL
Yes, sir
Mr
GREEN
It is this: if the compromise of 1820 was designed to be fail' and equal; if it pro- hibited slavery on onc side of thc line, did it not recocnize it on the other; and if it did not, was it not unfair and unequal 
Mr
TRUMBULL
It did not say anything about it on the other
Mr
GREEN
Did it not rccognize it
Mr
TRUMBULL
It neither recognized prohibited it; and it was not unfair and unequal, for this reason: the State of Missouri at that time was knocking for admission into the Union, and a great controversy then existed as to whether Missouri should come into the Union as a slave State
That controversy was settled by allowing her to come in as a slave State, on condition that in the rest of the territory acquired from Louis
ianm lying north of 360 30' of north latitude, and not einbraced within the limits of Missouri, sla- very should never go
That was the contract, and that was the contract which was violated in 1854; which violation has occasioned a great deal of the diffculty N.ve have had in the country since that time
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator allow me
Up to 1854, I understand (I may bc mistaken; and if I am mistaken I am willing to be corrected) that the Senator coöperated with me and my party
If we restore that compromise in its original terms, will hc come back and be with us again
Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, Senators on the other side have a strange way of putting questions and stating positions
They talk about the United States making civil war on a State, when a State makes the war on the United States
Mr
GREEN
I am not talkingabout civil war
Mr
TRUMBULL
Tho Senator from Mis- souri wants to know if I will come back to the Democratic party
Why, sir, I will allow him to come back to the Democratic party
That is it
You may corne back, and I will recognize you in good fellowship with the old Democracy, if you will come back and stand on its old platform
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President— The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the sen- ator from Illinois give way to the Senator from Missouri 
Mr
TRUMBULL
Yes sir; 1 will hear the Senator
Mr
GREEN
If Senator exactly where he stood in 1854, according to his own words, and his own honor, I will meet him
Will you coune there
[Laughter.] Mr
TRUMBULL
1 will
1 am glad we are I will say to the Senator from gettina• togethcr
Missouri to-day, introduce your proposition to restore the Missouri compromise just as it stood in 1854, and I will stand by the ccnnproruises of Mr
GREEN
That will do
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 ask why are they dis- turbed, what is the occasion of all this uproar in thc country, and why is it laid at the door of the Republican party
Why is the Senator from Kentucky seeking to overturn thc compromises of 1850
Why may we not stand right by them 
Why any new legislation; why any proposition to amend thc Constitution; why not stand upon the groat settlement made in 1850, and not attempt to introduc.e a provision here to establish slavery south of a certain line, which that compromise did not do
When, at t.hat time, a proposition was in the Senate Chamber to extend sla- very, a distinguished Senator froin Kentucky, now deceased, uttered a sentiment which alone should make him immortal
I•le said that hc never ltvould, and no human power ever should compel him to votc to extend slaver v over one foot of I rem•ot
I have to say that territory thcn free
the distinguished Senator now representing Ken- tuck y proposes to do that very thing which the immortal Clay declared that no power under God could ever induce him to do
YKhyq may we not, then, settle this matter
Let yüyu• new legislation e-ro•, abandon your prop- I ositions of compromisc by amcndmel')ts to the Constitution, and your appeals to the Republican party to do something, as if they had power to do anything
They have not had control of this GovernmelÄt
The South have had the entire control of tho Government
They havo made all the laws, and madc them to suit themselves
i What are they complaining of
Why is it that the Government is to be dissolved, and civil war inaucruratcd
We will stand by the compromises as they were made
We are not proposing to change thern
Under the compromise of 1850,— I wish this to bc borne in nrilld—territorial legis- lation was left subject to the action of Congress; and if it bd true, as the Senator from Kentucky insists, that New Mexico was authorized by the orcanic act to establish slavery, it is also true that a!l laws passed by her Legislative Assembly were required to be submitted to Congress; and if disapproved, were null and of no effect
I did not propose, when I rose, to enter into a discussion of the amendmcn:s to the Constitution proposed by Ibe Senator from Kentucky
There are many objections to them, besides the fact that they establish slavery
The proposition is to amend the Constitution in an unconstitutional way—not to submit amendments to the Constitu- tion according to the terms of the instrument itself, which declares that "Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution." But the Senator from Kentucky seeks to propose amendments to the Constitution by a majority vote; and he says in his remarks that is not for- bidden by the Constitution
Sir, it is forbidden by the Constitution; for I take it that when the Constitution provides a particular way in which amendments may be proposed, that very fact pre- cludes the idea that you can propose them in any other way
There are two ways provided—one is by the action of two thirds of
both Houses of Congress, and the other is on the application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States," Congress is required to call u conven- tion for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by conventions in three fourths thereof,as one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress
" The Senator from Kentucky proposes to sub- mit amendments to the Constitution in a third way—by a majority vote—and he says that is not forbidden
Why, sir, I think thc potntin•y out of thes cific ways by which the Constitution may be ame ed, as effectually precludes the idea that you can amend it in any other way, as if it were so expressed in so many words
Now, sir, my idea of preserving the peace of this country, and of the duty which is devolved
upon us here, is not that we should yield, as thc Sen- ator from Mississippi sugg.csts, to the threats and demands ot• States which say that they want no compromise, and want no concessions
and are to set up for themselves, and expel the Federal Government from their borders; but
that, we should rally around the Constitution, and enforce the laws under it; and then, not when States coine here thrcatcning civil war, not when our vessels are fired into, not when our forts arc taken possession of, but whcn the States all ac- knowledge themselves within the Union, and under the Constitution, if there arc any griev ances, let them be removed
Then, if thcrc is any thing wrono• in the Constitution, let us amend it according td the mode provided in the instrument
I do not believe that we shall better the Constitu- tion by any amendment which may bc made to it
I do not believe there is any cause for thesc complaints in the South
I do not believe there is any intention on the part of the incoming Ad- ministration, or of its friends anywhere, to make slaves of the southern people, or to interfere in any manner with their rights
We have said this over and over tvain•, and yet the complaint is made that we arc for encroaching upon their ri=h ts , and they talk of defending themselves against en- croachments
Why, sir, we do not propose to make any encroachment
Some complain about the fugitive slave law
Let me say to southern Senators, that the fugitive slave lawr would prob- ably be enforced with greater certainty under the administration of Mr
Lincoln than under the ad- ministration of either Buchanan or Pierce; and why
Because that fugitive slave law is an obnox- ious law to the scntiment of the North, to begin with
Then, under the present Administration, it has been enforced in an obnoxious manner; omcers who were obnoxious to a great majority of the northern people, are charged with its en- forcement; and hence there is much greater diffi- culty in enforcing it than there would be under an Administration ofa different character
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator allow me to ask him one question
If, under the present law, the ctnnntissioners aopointed by law should call upon hiQ1, as a part of tho posse comitatus, to ar- rest a fu-gitive slave or deliver him to his owner, would hc yield obedicfiß,e to it
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 am glad that the Sen-  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
316 ator from Missouri has asked that question, as it will lead me to make a remark or two about that provision in the fugitive slave law
There is a provision in that act which has no practical im- portance; which I never could conceive of any reason for putting there, except it was to make It repulsive to northern senlirnent Mr
GREEN
1 want an answer
TRUMBULL
The Senator will get an I never dodge a question
He will get answer
an answer
Let him be patient
The fugittve slave law contains a clause declaring it to be the duty of all good citizens to aid in its execution
There is no penalty attached to a refusal to com- ply with this requirement
Why was it putthere
No citizen is bound to aid in the arrest of fugitive slaves under that law because of those words, any more than if they were not there
It is an offensive provision
Now, then, if the Senator from Missouri wants to know if I will voluntarily (for it amounts to that) make myself a catcher of runaway negroes, I tell him, no
I would not do it either in the North or the South
I would not do it if I lived in a slave State
Mr
GREEN
Under the command of a law- ful officer authorized to do it
Mr
TRUMBULL
No has anypowcr to cmnmand me to do it
Mr
GREEN
When resisted by a mob
Mr
TRUMBULL
Now, you are putting another question
Mr
GREEN
Then 1 ask you will you aid and assist in arresting a crirninal, a perjurer, a robber, a thief, and a knave
Will you do that
Mr
TRUMBULL
When, Mr
President, not at hand, 1 might, as a citizen, arrest the mur- It would depend on circumstances
deter
Mr
GREEN
Now, me ask him another question
Suppose the Senator was at his own home, and a fugitive slave went through his own town, and was arrested by his own marshal or commissioner under a lawful writ, under the fugi- tive slavc law, and a mob was raised to rescue him, and the public were called upon, including the Senator, would he obey that order
Mr
TRUMBULL
The Senator changes his issue, and asks another question
Mr
GREEN
1 do not change it
Mr
TRUMBULL
well, sir, 1 shall not, of course, suffer myself to be interrogated, and to answer every question which the Senator from Missouri may ask; but in regard to thatquestion, and then I am done with-this questioning: I think I have answcrcd him prctty fully already
I will state, and have already stated, that there is no penalty annexed to the refusal ofa citizen to join the posse comitatus under the fugitive slave act
Mr
MASON
Will the Senator allow me moment
I do not propose to interrogate him
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 give way
Mr
MASON
I understand the Senator to say that he never could understand certain provisions of the law for the reclatnation of fugitive slaves; and onc of them was, that it required the posse comitatus, or the power of tho county, to aid the ofiicm• in executing the writ, and yet imposed no r I'hat, I understood penalty for disobedience
to be tbc objection to the law
Mr
TRÜMBULL
1 say that is thö law
Mr
MASON, Very well; that is the objection the laws are disobeyed, and it becomes my duty I to the law
to aid in their execution, even if it bc in South Carolina, I am for discharging that duty; but be- cause I am for enforcing the laws, I am not, as a private citizen, for stepping out of the way to go hunting either horse thieves or neoroes, unless it suits 10 y convenience to do so
then am I to un- Mr
GREEN
very well; derstand the Senator 'Ehe PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from Illinois give way 
Mr
GREEN
he allow me
Mr
TRUMBULL
Yes, sir; 1 will allow Mr
GREEN
Am I to understand him to say that he will not assist, if called upon.by a legal offcerundcralawful writ, to an-esta fugitive slave or a criminal, unless he choose to do so, and that if the legal process is resisted, and the posse com- itat•us is called upon, he will not go unless hc chooses 
Mr
BAKER
1 suppose he will he chooses, anyhow
[Laugh ter.] Mr
GREEN
You süppose; but I want no I wrant his answer
That is much supposition
better
The PRESIDINGOFFICER
Gentlemen will preserve order
The Senator from Illinois is en- titled to t.he floor
Mr
TRUMBULL
Mr
President, when 1 become a police oßtccr, shall endeavor to dis- charge rny duties; but I shall not go about hunt- ing for fugitives, or hunting for negroes, unless it comes pait.iculal'ly in my way
I am not charged with these duties; and say to the Senator frorn Missouri now, if he wants to know, in regard to joining the posse conuitatus, there is no power to compel any man to join the posse comitatu.s against his will
Mr
GREEN
very well; 1 understand
Mr
TRUMBULL
The laws of the United States, including the fugitive slave law, do not I cornpel any man to ioin the posse coanitatus to catch a fugitive slave
There is no penalty attached to the refusal to comply with theprovision declarinff it to be the duty of all good citizens to aid in the execution of the fugitive slave law
Mr
GREEN
Do I understand you to say that you will not do it unlcss you choose
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President— Mr
MASON
Allow me to go That law is simply this—and if there be any defect in it, I probably am more responsible than others—the law authorizes the marshals and the deputy mar- shals to execute the process
Or,her laws of the United States authorize thc marshals and deputy marshals, in the execution of the process, if they arc resisted, or apprehend resistance, to summon the power of the county to cnable them to do it; and the fugitive slave law does this in addition: it appoints a ntunber of officers as commissioners to dctcrrnine upon the right of the claimant, and for con vcniencc authorizes those commissioners, if necessary, to depute special officers to execute their Inandates; and it gives to these special off- cers, what the marshals always had, the power to summon a posse if they q.vere resisted
Now the Senator says there is no penalty
Why, I take it for granted the Senator kno•.vs that at common-law the sheriff has the right to summon a posse; and if any disobey, does the Senator rnean If any disobey, they to say tllere is no penalty 
cornmit a misdemeanor, and are indictable for that misdemeanor in refusing to obey the order of thc executive offcer
The marshal has the same power; and those deputies appointed under t.he fugitive slave law have that power; and if any refuse to obey, they commit a misdemeanor, and are punishable for it
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President— Mr
TRUMBULL
Let mc answer the Sen- ator from Virginia now
I cannot be interrupted by two at once
Mr
GREEN
1 only desire to make a mark
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Illinois is on titled to the floor, unless be chooses to yield it
Mr
TRUMBULL
The Senator from Vir- ginia seems to suppose that it is a misdemeanor, at common-law, to refuse to join the posse comi- tatus when properly summoned
Be it so
W c have no common-law offenses in the United States It is no rnisdemeanor in this country, courts
except it be under a statute; and there is no gen- eral statute of the United States imposinø a pen- alty or making it an offense to refuse to join the Mr
TRUiMBULL
i do tell the Senator from posse convitatus
There are some specific lat.vs, Missouri that I will not, unless I choose, help to some, I think, in regard to revenue, where, if a catch a runaway negro
If he wants to know if person refuses to join the posse, he is subjected I will help to catch a murderer, I tell him that t to penalties; but {here is no general law of that • will depend on the circumstances of the case
If i kind, and a man is not subject to be indicted for a murder was committed last night in the city of a misdemeanor who refuses to join a posse, when New Ycn•k, I do not expect to take the cars to- commanded by a marshal, uhder this fugitive slave law
night to go there to help arrest the murderer; but, Mr
GREEN
'Will the Senator allow me once under different circumstances, when a murder was committed in in y presence, and the offccrs wore more, and Will ask him no further questions
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does ator from Illinois give way to thé Senator from Missouri 
Mr
TRUMBULL
Wiluhis be Mr
GREEN
This will be the last
Mr
TRUMBULL
Well
Mr
GREEN
Everybody knows thatit is the duty of the Senator, if calle.d upon to assist
in executing the law, to turn out and assist in doing it
He will not answer whether he- will do it Or not; but says he has a right to refuse because there is no penalty
I say this: that man who violates his duty because there is no penalty to coerce him, is as bad as the man who Incurs the penalty of death
Mr
TRUMBULL
That, then, 1 suppose, is the question which the Senator from Missouri wanted to ask me
j Mr
GREEN
That is the question; yes, sir
Mr
TRUMBULL
He has interpolated speech, instead of asking a question
Mr
GREEN
have asked-— Mr
TRUMBULL
The Senator has isqd, believe, to bc still
Now, sir, there being no obligation—and there has been a misapprehen- Sion in regard to that matter, I think, in the public mind—there being no legal oblioation upon the citizen to join tbc posse, I think It was a mistake of the Senator from Virginia to put such a clause in the law; a clause offensive to the public senti- ment of the North, and which did not strengthen tbe law at all
In regard to this thing of joining the posse comitatus, all good citizens, when the laws are resisted, should hold themselves ready upon proper occasions, and at proper times, to aid in their enforcement
Our institutions rest upon the 'respect of the people for the laws; but us to whethcr, in a particular instance, a man will join the posse comitatus or not, will depend on the cir- cumstances of the case
But, sir, I did not intend making any lcn&th- ened remarks, but only to reply in a fcw words to what 1 thought to be the false assumptions of Senators on the other side as to this whole con- trovct•sy
I shall not take up tho time ofthc Sen- ate by going into any lengthened argument, but will stale in a few words what I suppose to be our duty here; and that is, in the first place, to endeavor to maintain the Constitution and the laws as we them
When the attack is madc by the seceding States, or by mobs in the southern States, upon the constituted authorities, there can be no doubt as to our duty in such case
I X.vas saying, when interrupted, that the North was not disposed to make an•y encroachments upon the South
I was saying that even this fugitive slave law would most likely be better executed under Mr
Lincoln's administration than under Mr
Buchanan 's, and was giving some reasons for this opinion
We know that Mr
Lincoln, in his pub- lic speeches, has said that so long as this statute stands, objectionable as it may bc, he would con- sider it his duty to have it executed
He has said, further, that, in his opinion, the slave own- ers were entitled, under the Constitution, to a reasonable law to reclaim their runaway slaves; and he has said that he '.vould not objecb to any law for that purpose which was not more likely to enslave a free man than your common crimi- nal laws are to punish an innocent one
Now, does the Senator from Virginia want
more than that
Would he not be satisfied with a law which should give no more chance for a fugitive slave to escape than there is to convict an innocent man under our criminal laws 
Mr
MASON
If the Senator wants an an- swer, I will say to him that my experience of the execution of the fugitive slave law in most of the non-slaveholding States shows that the law is of no value to the South
Mr
TRUMBULL
Well, sir, if that bc so, I apprehend the fault is not W'ith the Federal Gov- , ernment; the fault is not with the Republican party; and it seems to me, if you have all you want, and all you ask, in regard to the fugitive slave law, and then, if we stand by the compro- mise measures of 1850, you ought to be satisfied
We only complicate things, we only increase the difficulties, when we come forward to overturn these settlements; and now I do appeal to my friend from Kentucky, and ask him Why he can- not join me, and stand right by the compromise measures of 1850
The Senator from Missouri, I I understand, is willing to do that
That needs  316 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 10, no mew legislation
You contend that, under the compromise of 1850, you havc the right to take slaves into the Territories
I deny it
I do not think so: We differ about that right; but let that difference exist
We can get along with that
We have got along with it for ten years
Why disturb these compromises
They gave peace to the country at a time of grcat disturbance
Mr
CRITTENDEN
suppose the Senator does not wish me to answer him now, but desires to conclude his argument
Mr
TRUMBULL
do not desire to engage •thqSenator from Kentucky in a discussion at this time, *but simply to call his attention to the com- prormse of 1850, and see if x.ve do not stand in a better position just as we are than by attempting to patch up some new compromise
For my -lifé, I cannot see the occasion for all this agita- tionin the country andtfor States threatening to go out of the Union, unless it be simply tho fact that tbc Republican party has, in the constitu- tional mode, elécted its candidate for thc Presi- dency
That is all I can sec
Inasmuch as we have not been in power, we certainly have done nothing; and although Senators who say they iove the Union will pick out an isolated passage from Mr
Lincoln 's speeches, or from the speeches of some extreme man, and reitcratc it over and over again , as if further to inflame thc public mind , still, when you come back and look at the public course of thc President elect, at his avowed opin- ivns•,_ at- the platform upon which he is elected, you will find nothing that interferes in the least with the rights of the South; nothing that dcnics the equality of the States; nothing that denies ihc cquahty of any individual from any of the States in the common Territories of' the United States
It is a mistaken notion to suppose that a person from any portion of the country can take to thc Territories the laws and the institutions which owe their existence to the local legislation in his own State
Then, it sccms to me, all we have to do is to rally around t11C Constitution, sustain the constituted authorities of thc country, and, In y word for it, if that is done, one vear will not clapse, after Mr
Lincoln shall be inaugurated as President, before his administration will have shown by its acts—and it seems that is the only way we can ever show it to the South—that no cncroachment is to be made upon the rights of the
South; we shall Itavc a better statc•of 'föel.jng in this country than we have had for many years
That; sir, I hope to see, and I believe that we shall see it
The misrepresentation has ,been so persistent, go often repeated as to the views of the Republican party, that it seems impossible to dis- abuse, the rmnds of' tliC people of the South, until by our acts we show that we intcn(l no encroach- ment u their rights

The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent, laid before the House orders of the Postmaster Gen- eral for deductions, fines, remissions, &c., on the pay of mail contractors, from July 2, 1859, to June 30, 1860; which was laid on t*he table, and ordered to be printed
SELECT COMMITTED
The SPEAKER appointed Mr

DAwns, of Massachusetts; Mr
JOHN COCHRANE, of New York; and Mr
HICKMAN, of Pennsylva- nia, as members of the select committee ordered by the House on the 9th instant, to whom the special message of the Prcsidcnt was referred, ewith certain instructions
PERSONAL L'XPLANATION
Mr
P,OTELER
I rcspcctfully ask the unan- ill)ous consent o
the House to unakc a personal explanation
The SPEAKER
If no objection ig made, the gentleman will proceed
The Chair hears no ob- jection
Mr
BOTELER
My attention was arrested this morning by a paracraph in a paper published in the district which i' have the honor to repre- sent, stating that the motion I submitted here on the second day of thc present session, calling for the appointment of a committee of one from each State of tho Union to take into consideration thc present perilous condit.ion of the country, was madc at the instance of a membct• of the Rcpub- lican party
Now, sir, I do not choose to have any such representation madc in reference to my action
I do not choose that it shall go forth to the public, and especially to the people who have intrusted mc with the carc of their interests, and the protection of their honor upon this floor, that I acted at the instance of a member of the Repub- lican party upon that occasion
My political carccr has bccn a brief and an humble one; but I am not willing, brief and hum- ble as it is, that it
shall be tainted, directly or indirectly, by any suspicion ofa want of loyalty on Iny part to the good old Commonwealth of which am a citizen
I made that motion, sir, upon my own responsibility as onc of thc Rep- resentatuvcs of Virginia
I made it after consulta- tion with prominent gentlemen upon the Demo- cratic side of the Housc, and with prominent gentlemen belonging to the party to which I have the honor to belong—the southern Opposition party
There •were other gentlemen who had similar propositions ready to submit at that time
T hc gentleman from North Carolina [Mr
WINS- LOW] and the gentleman before me from New York [Mr
J0HN COCHRANE] had similar prop- ositions; and the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee [Mr
MAYNARD] had a proposition of I conferred with them, and they the same sort
agreed with me in the propriety of my offerit•p that resolution
I claimed the privilego of sub- mitting that motion, because I came from the district which had suffered most wrong at the hands of those who belong to thc anti.slavery party of thc North
I made that motion in no craven spiritof submission
I madeit, holding out no white flag of truce in order that I might obtain for those I represent terms of surrender
I made it in order to afford those upon the other side of the House an opportunity to state to us and to the countzy whether they meant to tender to us the olive branch of peace or the sword
I madc it that they might state to us fully, fairly, and face to ace, through their representative men upon that mmitteej whether they meant to be what we ha declared to the world
they were, or whether they meant to be conservative, as some of them professed to be
I confess I am disappointed in the action of I ••,vas disappointed, sir, in the that committee
manner in which that committee was constituted, I am disappointed in the time which it has taken It has had every opportunity for con- to report
ference
One month has elapsed since the com- mittee was raised; and the country has been look- ing with anxious cxpectation to see what would be the result of their deliberations
The mem- bers of that committee have been excused from service upon this floor
Every facility has been afforded them, and yet they have not, up to this time, madc a rcport, or indicated their disposi- tion to do so
Now, they must know that this is trifling with the best interests of the country
I am not one of those who yet despair of the Re- public
I have bound to my heart of hearts the heroic maxim which gave Rome the empire of the world: " Nevcr despair of the Republic;" but I must confess that, during the last week, my hopes have been dying out
And if that commit- tee do not soon report solne measure of relief to the House, or if the House does not take some effective action, I believe, ere another week elapses, it will be too late for those who desircto preserve this Union to save it from destruction

NATIONAL CONVENTION
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
1 ask the unanimous consent of the House to present a me- morial of certain citizens of Philadelphia, request- ing Congress to call a national convention in In- dependence I-lall, on the 22d of February next, or at other day, to settle the difficulties of the country
No objection was made to its reception
Mr
NORRIS, of Pennsylvania
I move that it be laid on the table, and printed
Mr
BRANCH
With reference to the paper just presented, I desire to say that it is not cus- tomary to have such papers printed, unless there is some particular reason for it
Mr

The simple reason for printing it is the importance of the sub- Mr
QU ARLES
I believe the rules require that a motion to print must go to the Committee on Printing
Mr
JONES
I object to its being printed
Not one of these petitions proposes to givc us our I rights
They have a great deal to say about Union,  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, but they say nothing about gentlemen obeying their constitutional obligations
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
I know of nobody who is not willing to give the South their rights
There are points of variance between cren- tlemen as to what are and what are not their righ ts 
Mr
SICKLES
I understand that this paper is simply a memorial for Congress to call a con• vention of the States
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
That is all
Mr
HOUSTON
A convention can do no harm; and if a convention of States cannot agree upon some plan to remedy tho difficulties of the country, they may, at least, possibly secure a In no aspect peaceable separation of the States
ofthc case do I consider that a convention of States can do any harm
Mr
BRANCH
I will state to the gentleman frorn Pennsylvania, that my remarks were not dictated by any unfriendliness to the memorial
I believe it hag not been customary to print such papers, and I desired to call his attention to the question whether it would not be injudicious now to commence printing papers of that description, which are coming in upon us so rapidly at present, and which will continue to increase in number hereafter
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
well, 1 will withdraw the request to print, and let the memo- rial be referred
Mr
HOUSTON
If there is no objection, 1 prcfcr that it should be printed
Mr

object to the printing of any such papers

Mr
GROW
I rise to a point of order, which I think wc are falling applies to all memorials
It has been the practice to into a bad practice
receivc the memorials of State Legislatures, and have them printed
But if we fall into the prac- tice of reading memorials of mass meetings, all our tirne will be consumed, as it has been this morning, to the exclusion of business
All these memorials should bo referred under the rule
Mr
COX
Tho rnemorial was received by unanimous consent; and gentlemen ought to un- derstand that this memorial is signed by members of both parties, and that it comes froun that por- I tion of the United States in which Independence Hail is situated, wherein the Constitution was It is for a national convention; and there made
I hope the gentlenaan only, under that unanimous-consent, do that par, ticular t.hing
My colleague only asked that the memorial be laid upon the table, and printed; and nobody objected fo that
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
I stated the purport of the memorial before I presented itg and while asking the consent of the House that it be prin ted
Mr
GROW
Until the Speaker states what object a gentleman has in view, members are not in a condition to object, In this case, no such proposition was made to the House; but they acted on the statement of my colleague
If the Chair had stated that my colleague desired to pre- sent the memorial, and to leave it open for dis- cussion, objection would have been made, because it could have been referred under the rules
we depart from that practice, the whole time of the House may be taken up in the discussion of memorials
My point of order is, that the me- morial
was
received only upon the statement of my colleague that he desired it to be laid upon the table, and printed, and for no other purpose
Mr
MORRIS, of Pennsylvania
I withdraw the motion to print
Mr
BURNETT
1 have the floor, and the gentleman cannot take it from me for that pur- pose
Mr
HOUSTON
Then, as we have to vote on the question of printing, I ask for the reading of the memorial
Of course, I have a right to have the IY)crnoriaI read
Mr
BURNETT
The gentleman can have that done when I have concluded my remarks
cannot take the floor from me for that purpose
The SPEAKER
The Chai): knows of no reason why the gentleman from Pennsylvania may not withdraw the motion to print

Mr

This bill is reported by the Committee for the District of Columbia
It was upon the District calendar last year; ahd I be- lievc a bill of a similar character was considered and passed
Tl'here were several private bills reported by the committee that were considered at thc last session, on the day.appropriated for the business of the District of Columbia
We consider that it comes fairly within the allotment of business for to-day, The SPEAKER

when thc Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union rose on the 9111 of May last—busi- ness of the District of Columbia being then the special order—they had under cohsideration a bill reported by myself from a minority of the com- mittee, there being at the same time a substitute pending offered by the chairman of the commit- tee, which was also a minority report
This report, then, docs not come from the committee I sl'lall move that the House resolve it- proper
self into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, for the purpose of resuming the business where it was suspended on the 9th of May last, being the consideration ofa bill for the construction of city passenger railways in the city of Washington 
Mr
GROW
That would not be infinished business now
It is by special order that the busi- ness of the District of Columbia comes up now; and the regular order of business is the call of thc Committee fhz• the District of Columbia for reports
The SPEAKER
The regular order of ness is the consideration of the whole subject of the business for the District of Columbia
Mr

BURNETT
1 am opposed to authorizino city railway alono• Pennsylvania avenue, and I would vote, as an ori•rinai proposition, against any bill for that purpose, if I thought I could de- feat it
But being satisfied that there isa majority of Congress in favor of making a grant to parties for the purpose ofbnil(ling such a road, l, bet',veen i the different prqiccts that have been offered, have my choice, and in order that the House may un- derstand the position of the Committee for the District of Colt.xmbia in regard to the various bills that luave been offin•ed for charterin€r companies to build this road, I will state that no one measure I that has been offered here, according to my un- dcrstanding, has the approval of the committee as a committee
But by nn order of that committee, its mem bcrs were permitted to presen t to the House their respective bills for Riving these privileges to companies, so that the House might considerand determine between the different projects
With- out committing myself to the bill which I now hold in my hand—for I have not had an oppor- tunity to examine its details suffciently—rcan say that I prefer its general features and- its ob- jects to those of the bili now under consideration
1 propose to offer this bill, wiLh the amendments annexed to it, as a substitutefor the bill now under consideration
The SPEAKER protempore, (Mr
JOHN RANE in the chair.) The Chair will state to the gentleman from Kentucky that his motion is not in order pending a motion to commit
Mr
HOUSTON
With a view to bring the whole subject of these conflicting propositions for railways along the streets of this city before the House, I will, for the present, withdraw the mo- tion to commit, so that the substitute may be offered
Mr
BURNETT
1 now offer the bill which I send to the Clerk 's desk, with the amendments thereto attached, as a substitute for the bill now pending
This bill has been prepared by my colleague and friend, [Mr
HUGHES,] but as I have not had sumcient time to examine itin detail, I do not commit myself to support it in its details
The SPEAKER pro tanpore
The Chair dcrstands that the bill and amendments are offered as a single substitute for the bill reported by the chairman of' the Committee for the District of Columbia
Mr
BURNETT
Yes, sir
I am in favor of this projects because it is in connection with a company already chartered for the building of a road from this city through the Statc of Maryland 10 the Point of Rocks, some fifty miles from
here, by which western travel from this city Wila be shortened by six hours
'There are other guards around this bill which the original bili does not contain
T I'le original bill proposes to grant by to parties in this city the right of way alono• Pennsylvania avenue to build a city railway, granting to them all the profit that may accrue from the operation of this road
It authorizes them to regulate and control this close corporation, as it may be called, and that, too, without giving to the corporate authorities of Washington and Georgetown any control over the action of this irresponsible body of corpora- tors
Hence I am opposed to it
Now, I would vote cheerfully for any propo- sition which had for its object the lett.ing out of this franchise to those who would pay theymost for it
I believe that it would be right to give to the city authorities of •Washington and George- town the power to grant these privileges, with such restrictions as Congress may approve, to tho parties who will pay the most for the fran- It is eagerly sought for, and it is bclievcd by those who arc seeking to have the bill passed, that it will be profitable, and will pay large div- idcnds
Judging by the eagerness with which this Capitol is besieged by the friends of the dif- fcrent projects offered , I mustconfess that it seems to me that the wisest course would be to permit the authorities of Washington and Georgetown to receive bids, and to give the franchise to those who arc willing to pay the most for it, making it their duty to submit the matter for the approval of Congress
I do not desirc to detain the House by any lengthened debate on this bill
1 am satisfied that we cannot pass either one of those projccts with- out going into the Committee of the on the state of the Union, and there discussing the bill and amendments, so that the subject may be understood
In that behalf, I shall move to go into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
But first I move that this bifl and the substitute be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of tl')e Union
Mr
DE JARNETTE
This bill looks to a connection of a railroad in this District with some railroad in Virginia
Before it can be constructed Virginia will have ceased to be a member of this Confideracy; and it is to that point that I invite the attention of the House
On the 20th day of December, 18G9, the people of South Carolina— Mr
LOVEJOY
to a point of order
It  1861
is that the remarks of the gentleman from Vir- ginia are not germane to this bill
Mr
DE JARNETTE
myself to tho substitute offered by the gentleman from Kentucky , I may assign the reasons which induce me to oppose it
On the 20th day of December, 1860, the people of South Carolina, by a unani- mous vote, passed the following ordinance Mr
STANTON
1 understand that the mo- tion is pending to commit the bill to the Commit- tee of the W hoi-eon the state of the Union
Nothing is better settled than that the merits of the bill are notÄdebalable on a motion to cornmit
I there- fore make that point
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Then 1 hope the gen- tleman from Kentucky will withdraw his motion to commit
Mr
BURNETT
It seems to be the fixed pur- pose of gentlemen on the other side of the House to prevent anything like discussion of the ques- tions now affitating the country, so that the peo- pte might understand them and know the views of members of this House
I withdraw the mo- tion to commit
Mr
DE JARNETTE
begin amtin
Mr
STANTI'ON
What is the pending ques- tion now
The SPEAKER pro tempore
Tho question now is on the substitute offered to the bill by the gentletnan from Kentucky
This being a special order, the Chair will remind the gentleman from Virginia that remarks must be confined strictly to the question
Mr.DE JARNETTE
Mr.speaker,lpropose to assign the reasons why, as a member of this House from the- State of Virginia, I feel it incum- bent upon me to oppose the amendment of the gentlernan from Kentucky, [Mr
BURNE'rT.] It is proper, before slating In y particular objecüons, that I should assign some general reasons why the bill and arnendmcnt should not be passed
Mr
Speaker, on the 20th day of December, 1860, the people of South Carolina, by unani- mous vote, passed the followin" ordinance of secessLon•
an Ordinance to dissoh•e the Union between the State of South Carolina and the other States united with her, un- der the compact entitled The Constitution of thc United States Q/ Jlnzerica." We, the people of South Carolina, in convention as- sembled

Mr
CARTER
If 1 have the right, 1 call the gentleman from Virginia to order-
This is a it is 8 bill for the construction of specific matter; a passenger railway in this District; and I insist that, under the rules, the gentleman must confine his remarks to its provisions
The SPEAKER pro tempore
Does the gen- tleman from New York raise to a point of order
Mr
CARTER
1 certainlv do
1 deem it to be my duty to do so as the chairrnan of the Coln- mittee for the District of Columbia
The SPEAKER pro tempore
The gentleman will state his point of Order
Mr
CARTER
My point of order is this: that debate at this stage of the proceedings must be strictly confined to the bill, and not wander off into other and far different matters
The SPEAKER tempore
The gentleman from Virginia has not yet proceeded får enough to possess the Chair With the tenor and effect of his retnarks; and the Chair is not, therefore, now enabled to give an intelligent decision under the rules
The gentleman from Virginia will pro- CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
sion; and a majority, a large majority, of the peol)le of cach and all of those States entertain the opimon, with the utmost confidence, that they have the right so to do
It is probable that a ma- joritv of the people of the other, or non-slavehold- ihg States, deny that this right exists
Mr
CARTER
1 again raise the point of The SPEAKER The Chair is of the opinion that the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia are not in order, not being addressed to the merits of the bill under consideration
Mr
DE JARNETTE
It may be my mis- fortune not directly to come to the point at issue
If the gentleman from New York will bear with me a while, I am sure I can convince him that my remarks are not only applicable, but alto- gether pertinent to the pending measure
Mr
CARTER
1 should be happy to hear the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia at the proper time; but I cannot bring myself to yield up the time set apart for the business of the District of Colunhbia, to matters purely abstract, and not now before us
Mr
DE J ARNETT E
I very well understand that this day has been set apart for the consider- ation of the busineés of the District of Columbia; and I am addressing myself to the merits of the bill now pending before the House
I believe that remarks are in order, and I trust that the Chair will so rule
Mr
CARTER
I insist on my point of order
The SPEAKER tempore
As the Chair understands, the subject particularly under con- sideration at this tinne is a bill for the construction ofa passelper railway in the District of Colum- bia
The Chair is of the opinion that the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia are not addressed to the merits of that bill; but, on the contrary, to the right of one or more of the States of this Union to secede from the other States
The attention of the House, as well as that of the gentleman from Virginia, is directed to the con- cluding paragraph of House rule No
114: And all debate on special orders shall bc confined strictly to the measure undcr consideration." The Chair feels at a loss to make any connec- tion between tho remarks of the gentleman from Virginia and the measure under consideration
As the point is now made, undcr the rule, which the Chair has referred to, hc is obliged to decide that the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia are not in order
Mr
DE JARNETTE
As 1 understand the it proposes the construction of a amendment, railroad in the District of Colurnbia to connect with the system of railroads in the State of Virginia
Such being the case, I rise to a constitutional , question
Has this Congress the right to char- ter a company for the construction of a railroad within the limits and the jurisdiction of the State of Virginia
The consideration of that question at once brings up the discussion of the doctrine of State sovereignty, the very question which I 
have started out with
Now, sir, all the States in the southern portion of the Confederacy, fifteen in number, claim the riTht to secede from the Union whenever, m their judgment, secession is best calculated Mr•
CARTER
1 insist that the rules and the decision of the Chair shall bc cnforced
The SPEAKER tempore
The of the Chair was made upon the remarks of the gen- tleman from Virginia at the time he was inter- rupted a moment ago
Mr
SICKLES
If the gentleman from Vir- (Yinia be allowed to proceed, perhaps he may be enabled to show that his remarks are pertinent to thc subject under consideration, and therefore i strictly in order under the rules
The SPEAKER tempore
The Chair was about to say a word upon the statement of the ceed in order
The Chair will remind him, how- gentleman from Virginia that he designed pro- ever, that debate must, under the rules, be con- ceeding to show that the measure novv' pcnding fined to the provisions of the pending bill
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Now, IVIr
Speaker, was unconstitutional
Ifthegentlemancanestab- I will proceed, and the Chair will perceive that ! 1 1ish that point by the arryument he now proposes to submit, his remarks will be in order
He wilk my remarks are order
I Wii}, at the proper point, state the conclusion resulting from the therefore proceed
Mr
DE JARNETTE
All the, States in the premises which I will lay down
southern portion of the Confederacy—fifteen in Several of the other States in which the insti- number—claim the right to secede from the Union i tution of donwstic
slavery exists, and is recotr number—deny the existence:of any such right; It is a clear and distiM)t claim of right onth€orie• hand, and an equally eleai• and distinct denial' of tha& right on the other
It becomes, there-fore, question of immense and immediate importance to every one of the Statesp of the whether, in any case whatever, there exiStjsßtÅre right in any State peacefully to secedé fi•öhi! thiS Union
The -solution of flus question Mr
CARTER
1 call the gentleman from Virginia to order
Are the remarks he is sub- mitting in order at this time
They are, as I think, not germane to the pending bill
Mr
DE JARNETTE
1 will come -to that directly
I am now coming to that point, and -I trust that I will be allowed to proceed without further interruption
The SPEAKER pro tempore
The point of order having been made by
the chairman of the Committeé for the District of Columbia, that the remarks of the gentleman from Virginia are not germane to the pending bill, and therefore not in order, the Chair is compelled to decide that the remarks of the gentleman, so far as he has submiw ted them, are not in order
Mr
DE JARNETTE
1 will leave that point, then, and proceed to another
[Laughter.) peat, that It becomes a question of great Import- ance, at this time, to solve that question of the right of secession
Mr
STOKES
1 desire to put a question to the gentleman from Virginia
Is he authorized to rnake the statement, here in this House, that Tennessee concedes the right of a State to seccdg from this Union 
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Thc gentleman tainly does not mean to pat that question to me, for I have made no such statement
Mr
STOKES
I understood the gentleman to say that fifteen southern States c7aim the right peacefully to secede from this • Union
I make this statement in reference to Tennessee
The great men, the leading men, in that State have spoken out, unequivocally denying that right
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Let me ask the tlcman a question
Docs hc deny that right of peaceable secession 
Mr
STOKES
1 do deny, and emphatically, the right of a State to secede from the Union
The leading statesmen of my State, of all parties, have denied the right
The doctrine of Jackson 's proclamation of 1833, upon the subject, is the I fully indoi•se it
Se- doctrine of Tcilnessec
cession is revolution
The right of revolution is inherent in the people
It is a right to be exer- cised, however, only in extreme cases, when op- pression is intolerable, and all constitutional and lawful remedies have been tried, and failed

The SPEAKER pro tempore
The Chair has decided
the gentleman from Virginia out of order
Mr
GROW
Is not the rule of the House that tbe entieman must take his -seat 
'rid SPEAKER tempore
such is the -rule of order
The point of
order raised against the gentleman from Virginia has .been decided ad- versely to him; and the gentleman, as the Chair understands, propos•edlto proceed in order
The gentlema-n from Virginia now proceeds out of order
Mr
EDWARDS asked for the reading of the 61st rule
The rule was read, as follows: 61
If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgress the rules of the House, the Speaker shall, or any member •may; call to order; in which case the meniber so called to order shall immediately sit down, unless pertnitted to ex- plain; and the House shall, if appealed to, decide on the case, but without debate : if there be no appeal, the decis- ion of the Chair shall be submitted to
It' EIIC decision be in favor of the meniber called to order, he shall be at lib- erty to proceed ; if otherwise, he shall not be permitted to proceed, in case any member object, without leavc of the Mouse ; and if the case require it, he sbail be liable to the censure of the House." Mr
COX
I desire to make a suggestion, which I think will end this diffculty, and allow us to proceed to the business gentlemen desire
that the gentleman from Virginia have leave to print the remarks hc desires to make now
Mr
GROW
My point of order on that is not personal to anybody in the House, but I must object; for everybody knows that there are many gel)tlemen who desire to make speeches, and it one is allowed to print his remarks, all should be ailowed to do so
Unless all shall havc a like privilege, I must insist upon my point of order
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I desire to say that no such eneral privilege will be granted
Mr
CRRTER
1 have no objection to ing thc gentleman from Virginia to
print the re- marks he desires to make, nor have I any desire to stifle debate
I object to his proceeding, not from any disrespect to my southern brcthrcll, but because his remarks are not germane to the sub- ject before us
Mr
GROW
Unless the House inalccs u gen- cral order for every one, who desires, to print their speeches, I shall object
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I object to any such general order
Mr
COX
The gentleman has entered upon his Speech, and permission to print might prop- erly be given in this case
Mr
SICKLES
Does permission to print re- quire unanimous consent
l'he gentleman is upon the floor, and hus made a portion of his speech, and the question now is simply whether the re- mainder shall be printed or not
The SPEAKER pro tempore
Tho Chair thinks that unanimous consent is requircd
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Mr
Speaker, 1 only to say, that, if I had been allowed to pro- cecd, I would have gone on to justify and (leti'nd the ordinance of secession passed by South Caro- lina
As I am ruled out of order, I give notice that when an opportunity is afforded me, I will acain revert to this subject
Mr
CARTER
I now call for the reading of the substitute offered by the
gentleman from Ken- The substitute was read
CARTER, If it be in order, that all debate upon-this bill be limited to five minutes
Mr
Are we considering this bill in the House or in the Committee of the Whole
The SPEAKER 10 the Mr
SICKLES
Then the motion is not in order
The gentleman can limit debate only by calling the revious question
Mr
CARTER
I demand the previous ques- tion upon the bill before the House
The SPEAKER pro tempore
The gentleman from New York is upon the floor, and the motion is not in order
Mr
SICKLES
1 move to amend section eleven of this bill, by inserting in the tenth line, after the word " respectively," the words: And the assent of a majority of the owners of the land fronting on such streets aforesaid
The SPEAKER tempore
Does the man propose to amend the original bill or the substitute
Mr
SICKLES
I propose to amend the bill just read, which was offered as a substitute by the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr
BURNETT.] Sec- tion- eleven of this bill authorizes the directors of this company, whenever, in their judgment, the public convenience will be promoted, to lay down tracks upon any street in the city of Wash- incton or Georgetown
Now, sir, I consider that to be a very extensive power to confer upon any corporation with reference to the streets of the capital of the country
It is truc that the pro- viso requires that the assent of the corporation be also obtained; but the experience of every city with reference to grants of this description from municipal corporations, has proved the necessity of some other and higher safeguard than then• discretion or pleasure
I need only refer to the experience of cities adjacent to Washington, where tracks have been laid down; and to the experience of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, to show that some higher and legislative supervision, and some additional checks, are ne- cessary
Now, I do not propose to require these corporators to come to Congress to seek addi- tional franchises and assistance from time to time, because I am fully aware of the extreme diffculty of obtaining the attention of Congress to the wants and interests of the people of this District; but I do think that
the friends of the bill ought to agree to give to the residents and owners of lands fronting on those streets through which railroads are to pass at least some voice in the question as to whether their streets are to be occupied for these purposes
This has been found indispens- able in the city of New York; and it is the law of that city, and so declared by the Legislature, that even modifications of the omnibus routes are no longer permitted at the mere discretion of the cor- poration, but the assent of a majority of the own- the public convenience does demand the cxtension of this grant through one or more streets, this public utility and convenience will be at once perceived by those who own the lands frontinrr on the streets
Of course, if it be a public ai- vantage, they will be among the most prompt to facilitate the laying down of tracks
If, on the other hand, a corporation like this is to be
cre- aled, it will have it in its power to appropriate this or that street, at its pleasure, and through , whatever influence it may obtain in the rnunicipal Council
Mr
Speaker, I am just informed that my amendment is accepted by the honorable gentle- man from Maryland, [Mr
HUGHES,) and there- fore I will not enforce any further my amend- ment upon the judgment of the House
Mr
CARTER
I now call the previous ques- tion upon the bill and substitute
Mr
HUGHES
Upon what is the vote to be first taken 
The SPEAKER pro tonpore
First upon the substitute
Mr
CARTER
1 will withdraw the previous question, if the gentleman from Maryland desires to make any remarks
Mr
HUGHES
have only a few remarks to make
This is a very important measure, but I have no disposition to enter into discussion at I attempted to do so last session, any length
and I am inclined to think the House understands pretty well the difference between the two bills
The substitute offered by the ffentleman from Ken- tuck y [Mr
BURNETT] is a iill prepared by tne, and reported by the permission of the Committee for the District of Columbia
If the House has attended to the reading of the substitute, they will have discovered that whutcver advantage may be derived from the franchise shall be applied to a road from Georgetown to Point of Rocks
We desire to give to this District the greatest possible advantage and convenience, not only of transit over the long distances between Georgetown and the navy-yard, but the advantage of direct com- munication with the West; thereby saving time trouble, and expense in the transit of passeno•ers and of the products of the country to the District of Columbia
The •market of Washington is full fifty per cent
over that of the city of Balti- more, and this road opens up a fine region of country, and will benefit the city to a very great I '•.vill not again enter into the merits of extent
the road, unless it becomes necessary
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
1 to obtain information from the gentleman from Maryland, for I have not seen the bill
I desire to know whether this bill proposes to give to a particular corporation, or to particular individuals, by name, this franchise; or whether it proposes to give it to the District of Columbia, or to the cities of 'Wash- ington and Georgetown 
Mr
HUGHES
It is proposed to give it to the Metropolitan Railroad Company
If the gen- tleman had listened to the read mg of the bill, he would have discovered that it throm,vs open the subscription for the city passenger railway to anybody who chooses to subscribe
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
What is politan Railroad Company 
Mr
HUGHES
It is a regularly organized company, of which Benjamin Ogle Tayloe IS pres- ident
Its object is to connect the District of Co- lumbia with the Point of Rocks in the State of Maryland, on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
1 understand, then, that it is proposed by this legislation to give these muniments to a company which was organized for action outside of the District of Columbia
Mr
HUGHES
The company has been char- tercd by the Congress of the United States within the District
Mr
slMITH, of Virginia
1 know that; but we could not charter a company to go beyond the limits of the District
Mr
HUGHES
We do not ask you to that
You have chartered this company within the Dis- trict
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
Has Maryland granted it a charter
Mr
HUGHES
One of the tcrminio€theroad is in the District of Columbia, and the other at the Point of Rocks, on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
a charter from the State of Maryland 
Mr
HUGHES
It hasa from the state of Maryland, so far as Maryland is concerned; and a charter from Congress, so far as the Dis- trict of Columbia is concerned
Mr
McKNIGHT
lofferthefollowingamend- ment to the original bill: In section fourteen, after the word made," where it occurs in the eleventh line, insert in proportion to the length of said rnain line of railroad located and constructed within the limits of said cities respectively." Mr
CARTER
I now move the previous ques- tion on the bill

Mr
JONES
I move that when the House adjourns, it adjourn to meet on Monday next
I'he motion was disagreed to
The amendment proposed by Mr
MCKNIGHT to the original bill, and that proposed by Mr
SICKLES to the substitute, were severally agreed to
The question recurred upon Mr
BURNETT'S substitute for tne original bill
Mr
CARTER
1 trust that the substitute will not be agreed to, because it gives the control of the streets of this city to an outside, foreign cor- poration, and places them beyond the control of It gives it to a corporation that was Congress
incorporated by the State of Maryland in 1853, for a certain purpose which they have not ac- complished
They have done nothing, and now they come here and ask a monopoly of the streets of this District, for the purpose of raisinff money I think to build a road outside of the District
I ana not wed- the substitute ought not to pass
ded to any particular scheme for a railroad here
I have proposed the one that I have, because I regard it as a fair and honest provision för the I am opposed to giving people of this District
this franchise to any Maryland corporation
desire to keep the matter within the control of Congress, and of the citizens of the District
That is all have to say upon the subject
Mr
HUGHES
1 wish to reily, very briefly, to the remarks of the gentleman from New York
I simply wish to meet one point which he has made; and that is, that the bill which he has re- ported is for the benefit of the people of the Dis- trict of Columbia
In my estimation, the people wiil be more benefited by the substitute offered by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr
BURNETT] than by any other measure which can possibly be proposed
It is not for the purpose of benefit- a particular set of capitalists, but it is to con- fer on those who are not able to subscribe for stock the incidei)tal advantages t.o be derived from it by every person residing within the District of Columbia
The bill reported by the chairman of {he Committee for the District of Columbia is emphatically a bill to make the rich richer
The other bill is for the purposoof benefiting the most humble member of society in the District by facil- itatino• coxnrnunications, and thereby cheapenin(-y all the necessaries of life in the markets of the District
The one is a mere
local matter
The other extends far beyond that
The substitute does not, as the gentleman from New York asserts, confer privileges on a foreign corporation
It confers them on a corporation It contains an express chartered by Congress
provision, that the books shall be open for any one who may desire to subscribe in regard to the city railways alone
The benefits of the fran- chise, whatever they may be, whether more or less, inure to all the people of the District, by affording to them other means of communication It will re- than those which they now possess
dace the time for the transit of mails and passen- gers between the West and the Federal metrop- olis
It is in y firm conviction, after havinmgiven a good deal of time to the investigation of all the projects presented, that it cornbines morc advant- ao•es than any bill that has yet been concocted for a purpose of this kind
It is most carefully guarded in every respect
There not an indi- vid ual owner of property within the District whose interest is net guarded, either by the amendment of the gentleman from New York, [Mr
SICKLES,] or through the corporate authorities of Washing- SATURDAY, JANUARY 12, 1861
ton and Georgetown, who will have the power of regulating ali the operations of the company within their respective limits
I will not, how, ever, proceed any further in my remarks, as I have once before discussed the question fully; and I believe there is a disposition now on the part of the House to vote on the proposition
The question being on Mr
BURNETT'S sub- stitute, Mr
SHERMAN demanded the yeas and nays
The yeas and nays were ordered

Mr

well, a perpetual charter, without power to amend, is going rather further than I think we ought to go
Mr

very well; 1 will hear the tleman
Mr
SICKLES
I ask the gentleman whether there ever was a grant made in this country for any city railroad, ot• indeed for any railroad, with- out reserving the right in the grantors to alter, modify; or repeal at their pleasure
I know, where .sueh a provision has not been inserted, it has bccn repeatedly decided by our highest courts that the law confin•s absolute right, which no power on earth can disturb
Are gentlemen of this House prepared for that
Mr
CURTIS
I have some experience in rc- spect of charters for the construction of railroads
I certainly know of no instance where the right to alter and amend has been reserved to any legis- lative authority
Such a provision, in rny judg- ment,isincompatible with the successful construc- tioh of this road
Mr
STANTON
1 certainly object to the gentleman's makinc an hour speech
Mr

am exceedingly anxious- to havethis bill passed
This incumbrance put upon it would, I think, defeat it, or at least destroy its District from having a passenger railway if, be- aide that provision, we also inserted the provision suggested by the gentleman from New York, The

The first question is House bill No

Mr
CURTIS
1 would ask the gentleman from Kentucky if that is not going to delay the business of the District so far as to prevent our doing justice to the people of this city
Can he satisfy us that he can report the bill in a short time, and set apart a day for the purpose of com- pleting this business
Mr
BURNETT
In response -to the man, I say that, as the bill now stands upon the Calendar, it will be impossible for us to pass it now, and in its present condition
If it is recom- mitted, we certainly can perfect the bill; and we will have an opportunity to report it back and take action upon it when the Committee for the District of Columbia is next called, which will be before the session is over
Mr
CURTIS
I should have no objection to if the committee could report in a the motion, reasonable time
Suppose you fix a day certain for the report by the committee
Mr
BURNETT
Thatwould be a matter for tho determination of the House; and if they will  1861

It is irnportant that the % bill I will ask for a day, and I hope should have due consideration, which it cannot obliged to them

The bill was thcn recommitted to the Commit- tec for the District of Columbia
Mr

GUARDiAN SOCIETY—AGAIN
Mr

I now call up the bill reported from the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The bill was takcn up by unanimous consent
The question was put upon the amendment recommended by the committee; and the amend- ment was agreed to
The question then recurred upon the encross- ment and third reading of tfe bill
Mr
CARTER called the previous question
Mr
SIMMS
If the previous question is sus- tained, will it prevent me from offering an amend- ment to the bill
The SPEAKER
It will
Mr
SIMMS
I have no doubt that one or two points have escaped the attention of the commit- I think, if the Congress of the United States tee
passes this bill, it will commit an act of greater injustice and wrong than has ever been perpe- trated bv any act Congress has ever passed
A What is it
Mr
SIMMS
This bill, as 1 understand it, embraces three propositions: first, it proposes to create a society to be called the Guardian Society; second, this society has the power to erect a house of refuge; third, they have the right to admit into this house of refuge any person not over eighteen years of age, who has been convicted of any crime not punishable with death, or with confinement in the penitentiary for life; nnd then another sec- tion of the bill gives to these trustees thc right to takc the children of the poor, whose parents have failed to provide for them, or who have abandoned thetn, into this same institution; and these chil- (Iren, whose only offense or misfortune is that of being poor, and being abandoned by their parents, are to be raised up in association with convicts, vagabonds, and thieves
The gentleman from New York proposes to do this in the name of Christian charity
The fatherless child, by the provisions of this bill, from its very infancy, is to be associated with infamy; its first ideas arc thus to be formed; its first morals established
To be poor may be a misfortune; it is nota crime
Sir, I hope never to see the American Congress offer this insult, this wrong, to the honest poor
Give to them in kindness, but poison not the bread of charity with disgrace; let them not pay for it at so dear a price as an association with guilt and in fanny
Mr
McKNIGHT
Wherein are
they to be raised up in any better way, if they are not sent to this house of refuge
Do not *they associate with those abandoned individuals, and grow up to bc abandoned themselves
If they were sent to this house of reform and refuge, they would bo brought up in the ways of honesty and probity
Mr
GROW
1 would like to have the read, and then we can all understand it
Mr
SIMMS
Allow me to answer the gentle- man 's inqun•y, and then I will yield for that pur- pose
It the first place, I think, if this Government intends or desires to establish an institution for the benefit and protection of poor children, they can, certainly, in that act of generosity, avoid asso- ciating them with the criminals of the country
It is proper to place those young men in a place where they may be reformed; but it is not ncccs- sary, in doing that, to associate the children of the poor of this District with them
Mr
McKNlGHT
such is the custom in all houses of refuge of nearly all the States of this Union
Certainly it is in my own State
1 hap- pen to be a director in one of those institutions, and I know something about it
Mr
SICKLES
1 call for the reading of the Mr

The SPEAKER

Mr
JONES
I submit that motion
Mr
FLORENCE
1 trust this bill will not be have at this hour of the day; and therefore I movc that thc House adjourn
Mr
A DRAIN
I have a motion which will take precedence of that
I move tha't when the House adjourns to-day, it adjourn until Monday next
[Cries of .No " No ! ' ' all over the House
Mr
DRAIN
As 1 there is a general opposition to my motion, I withdraw it
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Before the motion to adjourn is put, I desire to make an appeal to the courtesy of the House
When i was interrupted this morning, and ruled outof order by thc Chair, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr
Cox] moved that I have leave to print the remainderof my speech
I did not then insist upon the motion, for the rea- son that I supposed I could withdraw that portion of my speech which I had delivered
I find now that it impossible to do that; and that those remarks will go, in their mutilated form, upon the therefore ask the offcial record of the House
permission of the House to print the remainder of the speech
Permission was granted
Mr
DE JARNETTE
Mr
Speaker, on the 20th day of December, 1860, the pcoplc of Sout.h Carolina, by unanimous consent, passed thc fol- lowing ordinance of secession: Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina and the othcr Statcs united with hcr, un- dcr thc compact entitled The Constitution of tbc United Stat.cs of Jlmcrica
We, tho people of South Carolina, in convention as- sembled, do dcelare and or(lain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the ordinance adopted in convention, on the 23d day of May, in the year of our Lord 1788, whereby the of the United States of Arnerica was rat- itied ; and also all acts and parts of acts of thc General As- senibly of this State ratit•ying mnendlnent of' the Constitution, are hereby repealc(l ; and that the Union subsisting between Sou{h Carolina and the other tate.s underthe n.une of United States of Alnerica,ix lereby dissolved
Several of the other States in which the Institu- tion of domestic slavery exists and is recognized by thic people, and protected by law, are already taking slcps tending inevitably towards the passage of similur ordinat')cos of cecession; and a majority, a large majority, of the people of each and all of those States entertain the opinion, with the utmost confidence, that they have the right so to do
It is probable that a majority of the people of the other or States All the States in the deny that this right exists
southern portion of the Confederacy—fifteen in number—claim the rioht to secede from the Union whenever, in their judgment, secession is best calculated to remedy any evil under which they may bc laboring
All the nort_hern States, eigh- teen in number, deny the existence of such a It is a clear and distinct claim of a right on the one hand, and an equally clear and dis- tinct denial of that right on the other hand
It becomes, therefore, a question of immense and immediate importance
Have the States of this Union, for any cause whatever, the right peacefully to secede from the Union
On the so- lution of this question may perhaps depend the future peace and prosperity of the people of this country, or the shedding of fratricidal blood in the fiercest civil war thatever cursed ourearth
Thosc who deny the right of secession say that seces- Sion is but another name for revolution; and that revolution is treason, depending on its success, or want of success, as to whether it will be justified or condmnned by the civilized world
If such sentiments as these prevail with the people of thc North, and the party which is about to grasp the reins of government attempts to act upon thorn, the practical results will be the same in secession as in revolut.ion
No matter how clear thc right to secede peaceably may be in itself, if that right is denied by those who control the affairs of the Federal Government, the attempt to secede on the one hand, however peacefUlly it may be made, and tion, then war ensues
Precisely so, if ghe right to secede is not Conceded by thosc'in authörity in the Government, and they attempt fofcil*y- to prevent a State from seceding, to coefée back Into the Union a State that has -exercised the right peacefully to dissolve her connectiöh therot, In the one case as in the other, .blöOdy •,vith
strife wilt ensue
The right to secede, thei•efore
to be of practical importance, must be recögni#éa and conceded by those who have control of the Federal Government
This right of secession häS long been an acknowledged article in the faith of one of the great political parties into which the peoplc of this country have been divided; •and it is passing strange that any man who ever called himself a Democrat should fora moment qtiestiön the existence of this right
The convention of the Democratic party, which met in 1856 in the city of Cincinngtl, and which put in nomination the present Chief Magistrate of our country, adopted the following among its res- olutions: 4
'I'hat the Democratic party will faithfully abide 'by and uphold the principles laid down in the Kentucky tind Virginia resolutions of 1798, and in the report of Mr.•-Mäd4
ison to the Virginia Legislature in 1799; that it adopts those principles as constituting onc of the znain foundations
of its political creed, and is resolved to carry thern out in gheir obvious xneaning and import." Upon a platform of which this was one of the main foundations, James Buchanan
was nomin- ated for President; and on that platform he was In accepting the nom- elected to that high office
ination, he emphatically indorsed the platform and thereby pledged himself to carry faithfully into execut.ion its principles, in the event of hie clection
The first resolution in t.he series passed by the Legislature of Kentucky, on the 10th day of November, 1798, so emphatically adopted by the Cincinnati convention, and so cordially in- dorsed by its candidate, reads as follows: l
Resolved, That the scveral States composing the United States of A:ncrica are not united on the principle of unlitnited sublllission to their General Government; but that
by cornpact under the style and title of a Constitution for [he United States and a:ncndments thereto, they con- stitute a General Government for special purpose, dele- gated to t.be Governtncnt certain dcfincd powers, reserving éach State to itself the residuary rnass of right to their own selfigovermnent; and that whencver thc General Govern- rnent assumcs undelcgated powers, its acts are unauthori- tative, void, and of no efiöct; that to tbi9 eompaet each State acceded as a State, and is an integral party ; that this Governn•jent created by this eoznpact was not made the exclusivc or final judge of the extent of the powers dclc- and 110t the Constitution, the Inoasure of its powers; but that., as in all other cases of compact between parties hav- ing no emnraon judue, dac•l' party has an equal right to judgc for itself as well of infractions as of the mode and tnanner of redress." Now, this is the doctrine adopted by the Dem- ocratie party in 1856 as constituting one of tho main foundations of its political creed
This is the doctrine which that party resolved to carry out in its obvious meaning and import
To carry out this doctrine, that party nominated and elected James Buchanan; and he pledged himself to carry out tbc doctrine of thc party
That this resolu- tion contains a clear and distinct enunciation of the right of secession scarcely admits ofa doubt; for it unequivocally recognizes the principle that the Constitution is a compact between the States, and that each, as a party to that compact, has an equal right with each other State, the •same as in any other case of compact between parties, to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of 'the mode and Incasure of redress
And it is a well es- tablished principlc of common law that where one of several parties to a compact infracts or violates tho stipulations of that compact, all the other partieg are, relieved from obligation to it, and may, if they choose, treat it as null and void
The several coequal State sovereignties of North America enter into a compact with each other— a compact that is equally binding upon all
In process of time some of the clearly-expressed provisions of that compact are set at naught, dis- regarded, and trampled under foot by some of the the attempt on the other hand by forcible rncans contracting parties
The States who are injured to prevent the secession, wilk Inake war the inevit- by this violation of the compact (cach for itself) It is agreed on all hands that I have the right to judge as well of infractions (of able consequence, ! the southern States, if their grievances are suff- the fact that there have been infractions, and Of the nature and extent of those infractions) as ciently great to justify it, have the right, like the of the mode and measure of redress
If one State fathers of our kepublic, to revolution
Revolu- tion does not necessarily imply war; there might judges that the compact has been materially and be a peaceable revolution
But, if an attempt is grievously infracted, and that her mode and meas- made by coercive measures to suppress a revolu- ure of redress shall be to treat the whole compact  324 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

'I'hat thc present Union is the result ofa con- stitutional compact, to which each State; as an independent sovereignty, acceded
3
And that, as a consequence legitimately de- ducible from these premises, each State may, in the exercise of the same independent sovereignty, secede from the Union
Hence, the convention of South Carolina, in 1852, by a vote of 136 to 19, passed the following ordinance: That South Carolina, in the exercise of her sovereign will as an independent State, acceded to the Federal Union, known as the United States of America, and that, in the exercise of her sovereign will, it is her right, without let hindrance or molestation from any power whatever, to secede from the said Federal Union ; aud Cor the suffciency of the causes which may ilnpei her to such separation, she is responsible alone, under God, to the tribunal ot' public opinion among the nations of the earth." Mr
Calhoun holds the following language in relation to this subject: That a State, as a party to the constitutional compact, has t.hc right to secede, acting in the same capacity in which ratified the Constitution as a cognpact
li' a power radically change the character of the Constitution or the nature ot' the system, or if the former should fail to fulfill the ends of which it was established
'l'his results neces- sariiy fronl the nature of a compact, when the partics to it are sovereign, and, of course, have no higher authority to which they Inay appeal
That the effect of secession would be to place her in the relation of a foreiøn State to the others, is equally clear
Nor is it less RO that it would Inal.re (not her citizens individually) responsible to them in that character
All this results necessarily from the nature of a compact between sovereign parties." Is not this correct reasoning
If the premises are true, how can the conclusions bc avoided
The Federal party in the United States Senate in 1833, under the leadership of Daniel Webster, con- ceded the correctness of this reasoning and the legitimacy of these conclusions, and joined issue upon the matters of fact involved
Mr
Webster says: It; in adopting the Constitution, nothing was done but acceding to a cmnpact, nothing would seen) necessary in order to break it up but to seeede (i•om the satne compact." The whole subject of the of secession, therefore, turns n pon the questions: Is the Gov- ernn')cnt a confederation of coequal, sovereicrn Sta tes
Is the Constitution a c.ompact to which lhc several States in their sovereicrn capacity have acceded 
It is exceedingly difiiéult to get at the one time they will admit the independence and colonies of Great _Britain, some had been settled in order; and upon the correct understanding of , sovcreignty of the States, and at another time at one time and some at another; some were this instrument, guarded by the antecederlt light pr0vinces of another Government, brougllt under to which reference has been already made, must British dominat.ion by conquest

Judge Story, one of the ablest and most dis- tinguished of the Federal writers, in his elaborate work on the Constitution, though he strives to write with great caution and wariness, is not free from such contradictions and incongruities
In a note to 362, he quotes solne very disin- genuous remarks from the opinion of the Su preme Court in the casc of McCullock vs
Maryland, in relation to the fact that the Constitution was finally ratified by con ven tions of the several States

VVeb*ter, 'The Constitution itself, in its very  1861

So fat from saying that it was established by the governmcnts of tbc several States, it does not even say that it was established by the people of the several States
But it pronounces that, it is established by the people of the United States, in the aggregate." Now, is not this, so' far as cvcry practical pur- pose is involved, literally compounding the American people into one common mass." Does not Judge Story show himself and Mr
S'Vebster to be "political dreamers of the wildestcharacter: But, in very truth, are not these distinguished gentlemen entirely mistaken
The Constitution does not say " in its very front," or anywhere else, that it was ordained and established by the people of the United States in the aggiegatc, any more than it says it
was done by the people of the several States act.int-y severally
The Constitu- ti01'i itself, m its very front, pronounces neither way, but simply that it was ordained and estab- lished by the people of the United States." The in its very front," truth of history, however, pronounces that it was done by the people of the States severally, and not in the aggregate
The doctrine that the States are parties, is what Judge Story here pronounces to be a gratuitous assump- tion; yet, in page 360, he thus introduces u quo- tation from the Fedcratist: Tt was truly reinarked by the Federalist, that the Con- stitution was the result, neither from a desire of a majority of the people of the United States, nor from that ot• a Ina- It resulted froin thc unanirnous assent jority 01' the States

Webster, in emphatic and almost indignant terms, repudiates the phrase, " constitutional compact, " which Mr
Calhoun had employed in his resolu- tions, declaring that " the word compact was not a constitutional mode of expression." Yet, in his great speech in reply to Hayne, delivercd in the United States Senate on tho 20th day of June, 1830—1ess than a vear previous to this debate— in allusion to the basis of repre- Mr

'Tbc Union itself is too full of ben"efits to be hazarded in propositions I go ror the Constitution as for changinø its original basis
it is; and thc Union as it is; but I arn resolved not to submit in silence to accusations cither against myselt• in- dividually or against the North—wholly untöunded and un- just ; accusations which impute to us disposition to evade the constitutional cotnpacts, an(l to extend the, powers of the Govermnent over the internal laws and dotnestic con- dition of the States." It is here apparent that Mr
Webster himself, when not displaying the wariness of the skillful debater, could talk as freely of the " constitutional cornpact " as any one else
And if Mr
Webster and Judge Story, thc two greatest lights of the Federal school, are thus inconm•uous and contra- dictory in their staternents and reasonings, 'vvhat must be thought of the causc which leads them into such confusion 
In the late message of the President of the Uni- ted States, addressed to the two Houses of Con- gress, in speaking of the right of secession, the President says: Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with the his- tory as wcll as the character of' the Federal Constitution
After it was t'ramed, with thc greatest deliberation and care, it was to conventions of the people of the sev- its provisions were discussed era} States {'or ratification
at length in these bodies, c.mnposed of thc first men of the country
its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the Federal Govcrntnent dangerous to the rights of the States ; while its advocates niaintained that under a fair construction of the instrument thcre was no founda- In that Inighty strug«le be- tion such apprehensiorns
tween the first intellects 01' this or any other country, It never occurred to ariY individual, either mnong its oppo- nents or advocates, to assert, or even to intimate, that their efforts were alt vain labor, because the rnoment that auy• State tölt herself aggrieved she might secede frotn the Union ! Whata etushing armument would this have proved against those who dreaded that the rights or the States would be endangered by the Constitution! The truth is, that it was not until years arter the ori"in of the Federal Governknent that such a proposition was first advanced." This is going back to the proper source of in- forn-uation on the subject
But is the P resident Is it true, that the States, in establish- correct 
ing a General Government, with specific powers accuratelv defined in the constitutional compact, really understood at the time, that they never could revoke the act by which they ratified the Constitution, nor resume the powers which by that instrument they had detegated to the Gene- ral Government, no matter how much those del- egatcd posvers might be perverted to their injury, nor to what extent some ot the members of the Confederacy might violate the clearly expressed provisions of the compact
If such was the un- derstanding, it can doubtless be determined by reference to the history of the times
The States of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in the acts by which they ratified the Constitution, used the following language: G' Acknowledging with grateful hearts the goodness of the Supreme RuleÖof the Universe, in affording the people of the United States, in the course of providencc an opportu- nity, deliberately and peacefully, without l'raud or surprise, of entering into an explicit and solemn cotnpact with each other, by assentinw to und ratifying a new Constitution," And then proceeds, on behalf of those States, to assent to and ratify the Constitution
This clearly establishes the fact, that these two States regarded the Constitution as a compact, acccded to, or assented to, by the States as sov- creieyn contracting parties
Virginia, in ratifying, said: Do, in the name and in behalf of the poopie of Virginia, declare and tnake known, that the powers granted under the Constitution, being derived from the people or the Uni- ted States, be resuuned by thetn whcncvcr the same, shall be perverted to their injury or oppression; and that
every power, not granted thereby, reinains with them at their New York said: 'Ebat the powers of the General Government may be assurncd by the people whenever it shall becmne nece•ary to their happiness ; that every power, jurisdiction, and right ".'ålich is not, by the said Constitution, clearly delegated to the
Congress or the Unit.cd States, or ta the departments of thc Governntent thereof, ronlains to tho people n
the several States, or to their respective State goverrunents, to whorn they may have granted the sanne." Rhode Island also declared: That tbe posvers of the Government may be resumed by the people when necessary to their happiness; and that ali rights not delegated to Congress by this instrument (t.he II Constitution of the Unitcd States) reinain to the people of the several States, or their State
aovennnents." It must bc entirely apparent now
that the Pres- ident is laborin«y under a mistake as to thc facts It is not true that it was many years of the case
after the oricrin of the Federal Government, be- forc such a proposition was advanced as that
The people of the several States who had dele- gated thcse powers to the Gcnet•ai Government might, for good cause, resume them an•zun
Two of the States, in adopting the Constitution, em- ploy languaue which clearly implies this right; and three other States distinctly afiirm the right
In the convention of New York a proposition was submitted, that they ratify the Constitution for a peri040f ten years, at which time they might revoke their ratification of it if they chose
This proposition was voted down, and the one just quoted was adopted, by which that Stutc claimed the right to do so " whenever it shall become ne- cessary for their happiness," wit.hout any limita- tion of time
Surely these are facts which ought for ever to Settle this question
In view of them, who can doubt, at least that those who framed this Government, believed that the people of the several States might resume the powers which they had confided- to the Federal Governn)ent., whenever it would be LO their interest to do so, at least, whenever—to use the languacre of' I the States o
the North
Should it be, Patues, ion essential to the dvnnestic security-anci liapbihässöf' khe remainder
In that event, the injured-States,) after-havifig first used peaceful and constitutional means -to obttkin redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistauee to the Governrhent of the Union." Now, with all due deferenpe €0 the submit that this is bad logic; that the conclusion is not as broad as the premises demand
This languace seems to concede.that the Coistitution is a compact t.o which the sevefal States are
par- ties
If onc portion of the parties to -that c6mpact willfully vjolatc one of its essential provisions',' is there no redress
but revolutionary resist- ance." Since all the powers possessed by the General Government have been delegated to it by the people of -the respective States, when those powers are perverted to the injury and oppression of those people, or some of the parties to the-com- pact by which those powers are delegatcd,
arex " willfully violated in some of its most essential provisions," and such violation persisted in, why may not the injured parties peacefully recall •the powers which they have so delecated, and sepa- rate themselves from that General Government
Is it true that we have no peaceful remedy; that forcible revolutionary resistance" is the only alternative left
There is one more paragraph in this remarkable document demanding a moment's attention at this It is this: point
in order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it znust be the principle that the Federal Governtnent is a mere voluntary association of States, to be dissolved it If this be pleasure by any one of the contracting parties
so, the Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave ot• public opinion in any h) this njanner our thirty-three States may ot• the States
resolve themselves into as :nany petty, jarrina, anti hostile republics, eaeh one retiring fro:u the Union,' withöüt re- sponsihiiity, whenever any sudden excitmnentanight impel thenl to such a course
By this process, a Union mightbc entirely broken into fragments in n fcW weeks, whiCh cost our foretäthers tnany years ot• toil, privation,- and blood, to establish." There is a transparent sophism in this very ph rase, " secession as a constitutional remedy;" and in secession, as a -constitutional right
No one pretends that the Constitution itself provides such a rcrnedy, or gives origin to such a right
T hc righ t is one ofthe prerogativcs of sovereignty
The same sovereiøn power by which the States severally acceded to the compact will enab\e them to secede from it
This right is an original ele- mcnt of state sovereignty, a power which was not delegated to the General Government; and could not be surrendered by the States, without an ab- rogation of the States themselves
But " if it be so, the confederacy is a rope of sand." Truly the framers of this Government never intended {t to be held togcthcr by force; nor can it, so far ag it is a confiedet•ation between States, be preserved by force
Self-interest, and the existence of equal com- mon righ ts , impelled the States to form this Union, intending that the general interest of all, •and an orgat') ized system of mutual good offces, recipro- cal affection and regard, would impel each party to the compact to a faithful observance o
its stip- If self-interest, kindly feeling, noble Illations
sense of justice, recipwcally felt and manifested, do not constitute a ligament strong enough to hold the States togcthcr, tl,ey will inevitably separate
T hc noble mcn who formed this Government had felt the galling yoke of British power too keenly Virginia—those powers shall be pcrvcrtöd to their injury oroppression." This is all that to forge with their ox•tvn hands chains of tyranny still more oppressive
Those
who had just freed Carolir;a now contends for
It is on this principle she is acting, believing that the powers she has themselves by " revolutionary resistance," and at delegated to the Federal Government are being pcrvertcd to her injury and oppression, she has revoked tbc act by •which she ratified the Consti- tution, and resumed the delegated powers
I Other southern States pursue the satne course
but you right to do so if you will; Deny their cannot, must not, deny that precisely this right was claimed, distinctly and definitely, by at least three of the original Statos at the time of their enteringil'lto the compact; nor thatthcy would not have been entered intö with other understanding
The President thinks the Legislatures of those States which have passed personal liberty bills in direct contravention of the Constitution and laws Of Congre.ss, ought irnmediately to repeal those offensive bills, and says: The southci-n Statcs, standing on the basis of the Con- stnution, have a Bgnt to demand this act of justice from thc cost of great labor sacrifice of human lite, from the heavy band of sovereign tyranny, were not the men to surrendcr their own State sover- eignty into the bands of a central Power, armed with the right, by force, to hold the confederated members in their places, no matter how oppres- sivc that Power might be
to the States, leav:ng no redress to the oppressed and injured States but to wade through another scene of revolutionary strife
This Union has now been in existence fora]most a century; our people have been accustomed to this peculiar form of Government, and, were all the States faithful to its provisions, none would desire to leave it
All experience has shown," so savs our Declaration of Independence, that mank*ind are more disposed to Suffer, while evi.ls are sufferable, than to right themselves by abol-  326 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBb
4 January 11, ishing, the forms to which they are accustomed." This-inherent conservatism of man, added to the community of right and interest of all the States, which it was the purpose of this Government to preserve and protect, ought to:make it perpetual
The belief on the part of the northern people that the southern States will not, and have not the right and power to secede under any circum- stances of oppression and injury,-isdou btless onc prominent cause of their continued aggressions upon the Constitu tionål rights of the Sou th
Had they believed that the southern States could and would' secede if those aggressions were not dis- continued, they would have ceased long ago
The recognition of that right on thc part of the northern people would, in all probability, have Prevented the necessity of its exercise
But, with reckless fanaticism—lcd on and blinded by the conviction that the South had no way of escape or effective redress cxccpt by revolutionary re- sistancc—has brought the country to its present perilous position
The advantages and blessings of thisGovernme11t have been manifold and great
It is the most perfect system that the wisdom of man has ever devised
Under
its blessings and benign influence our country has enlargéd hcr borders, strengthened her stakes, and made rapid Btrides in all that gives domestic peace and pros- perity at home, and insures for us respect and power abroad
And the South has shown her appreciation
of all this, by enduring, from year to year, ills and evils to which She would not have submitted for a day, under other circum- *Stances
She has borne and forborne, until for- bearance has ceased to be a virtuc•, and now, when the long-continued aggressions upon her sacred riohts have culminated in surrendering the reins of&ovcrnment into the hands of onc plcüged to cxert his entire -ofliciul influence to place their cherished domestic institutions in the course of ultimate extinction, who can blarnc those States for resuming the powers they have heretofore delegated to tho General Govern Illent
The Union is already dissolvcd
One of its brightest stars has disa )pearcd from that re- splendent galaxy which las so long lighted up the western heavens, and to which the oppressed of all nations looked with hope of deliverance." Others will inevitably follow, one by one, Lut in rapid succe8gion; and the luster of those that main will be paled and dimmed, if, indeed, the blackness of darkness" does not spread itself over the entire scene
Where and how stands Virginia
I answer, with the South
Interest, honor, and inclination, unite her fate with that of' South Carolina and her sister southern States
,lmmediatc secession ig the duty and interest of Virginia
She can do nothing towards savi ng Ibe present Confed.eracy; its fate is sealed
The sooner the people of Virginia know and rcco"t'lizc this fact the better
In the wreck of the present ship of State, all is not lost; the broken frag- ments, some of them, at least, may be reunited in the formation of n new Confederacy, after the fashion of the old one
'I'irne precious
Every southern State should promptly take up her line of rnarch, and, with equal promptness, look out fora Ilew alliance
Prompt and decisive action on thc part of all the southcrn States is the only step that promises to avert the shedding of riversd blood in civil strife
Nothing short of I an absolute dismemberment of this Union will bring to their senses {hc dominant, fanatical party at the North; and tho sooner that fact is under- i stood, admitted, and acted upon, thc better for all like the motherofthe Gracchi, when asked for hcr jewels, could point to her sons
There they stood, Jefferson, Henry, Madison, Monroe; and the im- mortal Washington
Those sons of hers, when they had spent their lives ill achieving, and then defending, her liberties, asked no higher honor than that she would give them a tomb
She, too, in this agc, has been proud of another son, whom she gave to the nation as the commander-in-chief of its armies
That son I, together with her rep- resentativcs in the Legislature, in her name, have honored with a sword for his brilliant achicvc- mente in •arms
Little did I think, little did Vir- ginia think, that that sword was so soon to be drawn against hcr who gave him birth.
I-lcre, sir, in sight of her own blue hills, in sight of the tomb of Washington, is this ungrateful son planning his campaign, and planting his batteries ltn• her subjugation
And though she must weep over the inoratitudc of her parricidal son, tbc more because of her pride in the glory of his past renown, vot, emulating thc firmness of the old Roman fathers, she will discard him forever from her bosom, and vindicate in his sacrifice the majesty of hcr supreme law—the law of State soverexgnty and State allegiance

The ofthe Senator from Pennsylvania is in order if he insists upon it
Mr
BIGLER
1 do
Mr
GREEN
Irise to a point of order
Tfie VICE PRESIDENT
The from Missouri rises to a point of order
He will state it
Mr
GREEN
The point of order is, that the very questi0!1 the Senator now proposes to take up, was made a special order for one o'clock to-day, and it was done by tho order of the Senate, so as to give us the morning hour for ordinary business
Now, that being a standing rule of the Senate, he cannot-move to change
it; or if he does move it, one single objection prevents the Chair from putting the qu-esiion to the Senate
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair cannot takc that view of it
Mr
GREEN
I appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr
B [GLER
It is certainly competent for the majority of the Senate to control the order of business
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senator from Pennsylvania moves to take up the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky
The Scnbtm• from Missouri supposes it cannot be done, as those resolutions have been• made the special order for another time
The Chair decides that the motion of 'he Senator from Pennsylvania is in order
From that decision the Senator from Missouri appeals
The question is, Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Senate." Mr
GREEN
On that point 1 desire to ex- plain myself a little
I do not say that the motion out of order; but I say one objection stops it
With unanimous consent, I know it can be done; and hence the motion itself is not out of order; but a majority of the Senatc cannot so order against a standing rule of the Senatc
That is the point I make
The morning hour must be devoted to morning business
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair still overrules the point of order
Mr
BIGLER
I intended to meet that case by moving to postpone all prior orders
The prior orders are: the presentation of petitions, making reports, and offering original resolutions
willing to yield for reports and peli- tions
Mr
GREEN
That is no prior ordcr
That is a standing rule
The Senator confounds a rule of the Senate with tho orders of the Senate
The VICE PRESIDENT
The question is upon the appeal of the Senator from Missouri
" Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judg- ment of thc Senate
Tho question l)eing put, there were, on a divis- im—ayes fourteen

stated that we need(d the morning hour for ordi- nary business; and was extended, by the order I of the Senate, onc half-hour on y own motion; and now the proposition is to cut off, not only half an hour, but ten minutes more
Mr
BIGLER
1 have no recollection of any understanding such as is suggestcd by the Sen- ator from Missouri
Certaihly I was nota party to any such understanding; and must declme to withdraw the motion
The sense of the Senate can be readily ascertained
I Mr
KING
1 will say to the Senator from Missouri that
I think the motion of the Senator , from Pennsylvania is in accordance with the usvc—what has been customary here in the Sen- ate
I do not see anything in the rule read by the Chair which would prohibit such a motion being put
Mr
GREEN
Yesterday the Senator from Massachusetts moved to postpone this question until twelve and a half o'clock to-day
I sug- gested publicly to the Senate, that it ought to be changed to one o'clock, for the reason that we needed the morning hour for other business
At my suggestion it was changed, and put at one o'clock; and now this morning to reverse that, and take away the opportunity of doing other business, is not fair either to the Senator or to the Senate
The VICE PRESIDENT
It wili be for the Senate itself to determine whether it be fair or it is certainly in the power of the Senate to Mr
GREEN
They may do it by force
Mr
CRI'I'TENDEN
The decision of the Chair sccins to me obviously correct, and it is not only for that reason (.hat I vote to sustain the decision, but it seems to me that it is quite ne- cessary to the business of the Senate, that the rule should bc so construed
Arc gentlemen will- ing to decide that, under no circumstances, upon no occasion, can a subject arise which, by the almost unanimous voice of the Senate, may be taken up as soon as the Senate meets, and to the exclusion of the business which you, sir, are di- rectcd to call, in case no direction is given hy the Senate—that is, petitions, and reports, and reso- lutions
Can wre not, at any time of our session, if anything of suflicicnt importance occurs to jus- lify it, order any particular subject to be taken up in exclusion of everything else
The Senate scems likely to (lecidc according to the vote, so so far taken, that this business of presenting peti- tions and memorials, and reports from commit- of the court in favor the claim, reported,lthe bill (S

FORTS AND ARSENALS IN STATES
Mr

I now move to take up the res- olution which was made the special order for one o'clock
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senator from Oregon moves to take up the resolution offered by the Senator from Virginia, [Mr
HUNTER,] in relation to the retrocession of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, &c., to certain of the States
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate pro- cecded to consider the following resolution, sub- mitted- by Mr.: HÜNTER on the 2d instant: Whereas certain forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings, have been placed under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States by a cession to One or•more, df those States to resume the jUrisdiction thus ceded : Now
therefore, Be That the President of the IJnit.cd States ought to bc authorized by law, upon the application of tho Legislature, or ora regular couveution of the people of any such States, to retrocede this jurisdiction to such States, upon taking proper security tör the keeping and return of all the property of the United States, or paying fur the value of the san:e iC destroyed or injured by the act of any ot•thc States Inaking such application

Mr
HUNTER
Mr
President, 1 have not sought to speak hitherto on the rnornentous ques- tion of the day, because I did not believe that any good would be accomplished by speaking
The disease seemed to me to be so deeply seated that, none but the most radical remedies would sl-iffe.c•, and I had •no hope that the public rnind of the .North wasin a condition to receive
any such prop- osition
I do not know that it is even now pre- in the instincts of empire, which have heretofore characterized the American people, to accomplish that great xvork
if we would do it, we must not sit idly, bewailing the condition of public- affairs; but in the heroic spirit of the mariner who is cast away on a distant shorc,- see if we cannot find materials to build another ship, in which we may once more take the sea, and rejoin our kindred and friends
But, Mr
President, 10 do this, swe must face and acknowlédge the true evil of the day
To-day we mustdeal wisely with the mighty present, that we may be ready for perhaps the still more eventful future which will be on us to- morrow
New ideas, like new forces, have entered into our system; they are demanding the legiti- rnatc expression of their power, or they threaten to rend and destroy it in their wild and irregular play
There are now portions of this Union in svluch population already begins to press on the means of subsistence
In all of the States there is a desire—in some of them a necessity—for fur- ther expansion
It is that which has led to the warfare between the two social systems which have been brought together in our Constitution; a war vvaged with a bitterness and asperity that has reduced us to the sad pass in which we now find ourselves
This Constitution was designed to unite two social systetns, upon t.erms of equality and fair- ness, different in thcir character, but not neces- sarily hostile
Indeed, the very differences in these systems, it would seem, ought to have formed causes of union and mutual attraction, instead of giving rise to the "irrepressible conflict " which, it is said, sorne lawr of nature has declared thein
What the one wanted, the other could supply
If the carrying States did not make thcir provisions, tbc provision-growing States, on the other hand, had not the ships in which to trans- port their surplus productions
If the manufac- turing States did not raise thc raw material, the planting States, on the other hand, did not have the manufactories to con vert t.bat material into useful and necessary fabrics
'I'hus, what the onc wanted, Lbc other coald supply
only (lilFet•- ence of products would seem to have aflü)rded tl'1C means föl• forming a perfect
systctn of industry, which should have been strontyer by the mutual dependence and support of t.he parts
Unfortu- natcly, however, as those who represented the non-slaveholding system of society grow into power, tl'ley commenced a warfare upon thc other system which was associated with it under the Constitution
It
was commenced in 1820, when it was declared that the social system of the South was founded upon sin, was anti-repubiican in its character, and deserved to be repressed and sup- pressed by the General Govcrnment wherever it had exclusive jurisdiction
The claim was made, that so fhr as the Tl'm•ritorirs of the United States were concerned, they were to be given up to the exclusive expansion of one of thesc systems at tho expense of 1110 other
Urjhappily, in that first contest, the wealccr systcm 'vvent by the board; a law was passed which did put it under the ban of the Empire; which did exclude the South from a large portion of [hc domain of the United States
After that sprang up a party, at first not so large as it now is, x,vhich commenced a regular warfare upon the system of slavery in the South ; upon the social system of the Sla.tes which toler- atcd the institution of' slavery
They commenced a system of agitation through tho press, thc pul- pared to weigh carefully such a suggestion; but pit, and the common hails of legislation, whose surely none can longer doubt the ilnminencc or i the extremity of the danger
All must sce that the bonds which have hitherto bound together the members of this Confü'deracy arc parting like flax before the fire of popular passion
Our political fabric is reeling and tottering in the storm ; so that, if it were not based on the solid foundations of State orøanization, there would be every reason to expect its entire destruction
Before the end of this month, it is almost certain that six or seven of the States will havc seceded from this Union
it is Eherefore now no more a question of saviw or of preserving the old Union
We cannot recall the past; we cannot restore the dead ; object it x.vas to woun(t the self-respect of the slaveholder, and to make him odious in the cycs of the rest of the world
They denied that there could be any property in slaves—the very foun- dation of the social system of the South—and, as a consequence, they maintained that this Gov- ernment was bound to prevent its extension, and to abolish and suppress it wherever it had exclu- Sive jurisdiction
They sought, by petition, to put an end to the slave trade betwccn the States, that the institution might be pent up, and made dangerous and unprofitable
In process of time, they either evaded or they denied the constitutional obligation to rc.turn fu- but the hope and the trust of those who desire a gitive slaves; and at last it was proclaimed here Union, are tl'K1t we may be able to reconstruct a in tl'iese Halls that there was a law higher than new Government and a new Union, which per- I the Constitution, which nullifieditsobligationsand haps may be more permanent and efficient than its provisions
Practicing upon this preaching, the old
I know, sir, that there are difficulties in •the majority of the non.slaveholding States, as the way; but I put my trustin the good sense and was shown by my friend from Georgia [Mr
T 00MBs] in his able argument on this subject, passed personal liberty bills, the practical eirect of which was -to nullify the fugitive slave law, which was passed in pursuance of the Constitu- tion of the United States
It is but a year since there was an armed inva- Sion of my State for the purpose of creating ser- vile insurrection; and yet not a State—and it is with the States alone that effectual remedies can be-applied—has interfered, to make any such com- bination penal in time to come
We have heard it pronounced, sir, by a distinguished leader of that party, that there was to be an "irrepressible conflict' between the two social systems, until one or the other •was destroyed
A President has been nominated and elected by a sectional major- ity, who was known to have avowed and to enter- tain such opinions; and a party has come into power, with full possession of this Government, which has elected a President and a standard- bearer who has made such declarations in regard to the rights of the South
Is it surprising, then, that the soutl)ern States should say: " It is not safe for us to remain longer in a Government which may be directed as an in- strument of hostility against us; it is not safe for us to remain longer under the rule of a Govern- mcnt whose President may misuse his patronage for the very purpose of stirring up civil strife among us, and also for the purpose of creating civil -war in our midst." For it is known that a large portion—and that was but a year ago—of the Republican leaders and members in the House of Representatives indorsed and recommended a book which proposed the extinction of slavery by such means
Under such circumstances, I ask, is it surprising that the southern States should It is unsafe for us to remain under n Gov- say: crnmcnt which, instead of protecting us, may be directed against us, as an instrument of attack, unless we can be protected by some new consti- tutional guarantees, which will save our social sy.stcrn from such a warfare as this." Mr
President, the southern people number thirteen million, and cover between now sorne cight hundred thousand and nine hundred thou- I sand square miles of territory
They I-lave, *lithin themsetves all the capacities of empn•e
Is it to be supposed that, when they are threatened in the common Government with an attack upon their social system, upon which their very being dc- pends, they will not withdraw from that Govern- men—unless they can be secured within the Union—for the purpose of establishing another, which they know can and will protect them 
Why, sir, what people is it that can stand a constant warfare upon their social system, waged for the purpose of d warfing and su ppressing and destroy- ing it
The social system of a people is its moral being; and the Government which would dwarf or suppress it is like the parent who' would con- sign his child to vice and ignorance
I know of instances in which nations have thriven under had laws; I know of instances in which nations have thriven when their allegiance was transferred by force from one country to another; I know Of none which survived the sudden and total pros- tration of its social system
To reduce them to that is to reduce them to anarchy, which is the death of a nation or a people
I say, therefore, sir, that the South is bound to take this course unless it can get some guarantees which will protect it in the IJnion, some constitu- tional guarantees which will serve that end; and I now ask, what should be the nature of the guar antees that would effectually prevent the social system from such assaults as these
I say, they must be guarantees ofa kind that will stop up all the avenues through which they have threatened to assail the social system of the South
There must be constitutional amendments which shall provide: first, that Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in the States, in the District of Columbia, in the dock-yards, forts, and arsenals of the United States; second, that it shall not abol- ish, tax, or obstruct the slave trade between the States; third, that it shall be the duty of each of the States to suppress combinations within their jurisdiction forarmed invasions ofanother; fourth , that States shall be admitted with or without sla- very, according to the election of the people; fifth, that it shall be the duty of the States to restore fugitive slaves when within their borders, or to pay the value of the same; sixth, that fugitives from  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
329 justice shall be deemed all those who have of- fended against the laws of a State within its juris- diction , and who have escaped therefrom ; seventh , that Congress shall recognize and protect as prop- erty whatever is held to be such by the laws or prescriptions of any State within the Territories, dock-yards, forts, and arsenals of the United States, and wherever the United States has exclu- Sive jurisdiction; with the following exceptions: First, it may leave the subject of slavcry or invol- untary servitude to the people of the Territories when a law shall be passed to that effect with the usual sanction, and also with the assent ofa ma- jority of the Senators from the slaveholding States, and a majority of the Senators from the non- slaveholdihg States
That exception is designed to provide for the case where we might annex a Territory almost fully peopled, and whose people ought to have the right of self-government, and yet might not be ready to be admitted as a State Into thc Union
The next exception is, that Congress may divide the rrerritories, to the effect that slavery or involuntary servitude shall be prohibited in one portion of the territory, and recognized and pro- tected in another; provided the law has the sanc- tion of a majority from each of the sections as aforesaid," and that exception is designed to pro- vide for the case where an unpeopled Territory is annexed and it is a fair subject of division be- tween the two sections
Such , Mr
President, are the guarantees of prin- ciple, which, it seems to me, ought to be estab- lished by amendments to the Constitution; but I do not believe that these guarantees alone would protect the social system of the South against at- tack, and perhaps overthrow, from the superior power of the North
I believe that, in addition to these guarantees of principle, therc ought to be guarantees of power; because, if you do not adopt these, the South would still be subjected to the danger of an improper use of the patronage of the Executive, who might apply it for the purpose of stirring up civil strife and dissension amono them
The southern States might, too, notwith- standing these provisions, find themselves in a position in which the stronger party had construed them away, and asserted, perhaps, that there was some higher law, which nullified and destroyed them
To make the South secure, then, some power ought to be given it to protect its rights in the Union—somc veto power in the system, which would enable it to prevent it from ever being per- verted to its attack and destruction
And here, Mr
President, if the Senate will bear with me, I will procecd to sucgest such remedies in this regard as I think ought-to be applied, pre- mising that 1 do not mean, by anv means, to gay tl)at I suppose I arn suggesting {he only means I knox.,v on which a settlement may be rnade
there ure others—others on which I would agree but I am suffgesting the means on to settle It— which I think the best and the most permanent settlement can be made; and I do not think that any permanent peace an be secured, unless we provide some guara ces of power, as well as of principle
In regard to thi guarantee of power, in the first place, I would resort to the dual executive, as proposed by Mr
Calhoun, not in the shape in 
which he recommended it, but in another forrn, which, I think, is not obnoxious to the objection that may be fairly taken against his plan
would provide that each section should elect a President, to be called a first and a second President; the first to serve for four years as President, the next to succeed him at the end of four years, and to govern for four other years, and afterwards to be I would provide that, during the term Feéligible
of service of the first President, the second should be President of the Senate, with a casting vote in case of a tie; and that no treaty should be valid which did not have the signature of both Pres- idents, and the assent of two thirds of the Senate; that no law should be valid which did not have the assent of both Presidents, or in the event of a veto by one of them, the assent of a majority of the Senators of the section from which he came; that no person should be appointed to a local office in the section from which the second Pres- ident was elected, unless the appointment had the assent of that President, or in the event of his veto, the assent of a majority of the Senators from the section from which he came
And, sir, if I had the power, I would c%ange the mode of electing these Presidents; I would provide that each State should be divided into presidential electoral districts; that each district should elect one man, and that these representa- tives from the whole United States should meet in onc chamber, and that the two men who, after a certain number of ballots, received the highest number of votes should be submitted as the can- didates to the people, and he should be declared as President who received a majority of the dis- tricts—the districts each voting singly
I would do this to destroy the opportunities which are given under our present system of nomination to the formation of corrupt combinations for pur- poses of plunder and of patronage
I would sub- stitute this, instead of the national conventions, which have already done so much harm in our system
I
would also diminish the temptation to such corrupt combinations for spoils and patronage, by the fact that the President, after the first election, would be elected four years before he commenced his service as President, and in the mean time he would be training as a second President at the head of the Senate, and exercising the veto power
The fact that he was elected four years before- hand would do much to prevent such combina- tions; but, further than this, the effect of such a division of the Executive power would be to de- stroy, to a creat extent, the miserable system of rotation in oflice, which exists at present, and to make merit the test of the fitness for office and a guarantee for his permanence in place; for, as the second President would probably keep those in offce during his term of President whom he had protected by his veto power before, if they were worthy of the place, the effect would be, at least if this system were introduced, that the rotation principle would be applied, if' at all, not once in four years, but once eight years
But this plan would have another good effect
It would save us from most of those agitations attending a presidential election which now dis- turb the country, which unsettle public affairs, and which are doing so much to demoralize and corrupt the people
The election would take place in one section at a time; it would take place each section but once in eight years; and in this way we should cscape, those disturbances which are now dividing and destroying us
Mr
President, I do not believe that under this system the objection would apply which has been urged against the ccnnmon dual executive
I have no idea that it would get up two parties, each con- centrated around the different Presidents; because the second President '„vould exercise his veto power only for the protection of his section, and would not wish to offend the other section, whose good will would bc valuable to him hereafter; nor would hc wish to impair and injure the influence of the office to which he was to succeed after his prede- cessor had passed through his term of service
The rule between them would be the rule of jus- tice; and the probability is, that whenever
there was a dispute, it would be apt to end in adopting that course wh ich either was just, or which seemed to be just, to both sections
Neither, sir, would it opcrate to retard or delay the operations of the Government to too great an In timc of war, the operation would be extent
In time of peace, the delay would quick enough
only occur where there was a dispute between the sections; and there the movements of Govern- ments ought to be slow until some means are found for conciliating and adjusting the diffculty
But, Mr
President, I will go further
I believe, putting out of consideration these sectional ques- tions, that the working of' the present executive system of our Governrnent will destroy it in the end, and lead either to disunion or despotism, if which made -the'contributions to
the Governme»t by which it was supported' in return but the general benefits of its progec!ion and legislation; and he said, and said in my opinion, that whenevei• this tax-Consuming party, as he called it, got possession pf the.u •ov- ernment, the people must *decay,
and the ernmen t must either go _to pieces or assumeanother and different form
Now, sir, I say that the working of our prese ent executive system is such as to produce cparty of that description in the country,' and give it the power of ruling its affairs
- Place the predomi- nant power in this Government in such hands, and I say one of -two things must certainly hap- pen: -the Union will go to pieces in the collision which such a state of things would occasion, or else the Government would eventuate in a despot- ism
The check which I propose would not, only remedy this evil, by giving a sectional check where a sectional check xsnecessary., but it would do more; it would do much to purify the general legislation of the country, and do much to elevate the tone of public morals and manners through- out the land
I believe that this single change would do more to give us a permanent Union, a just and effcient Government, than any other that could bc made
But, Mr
President, that is not the only check which, in a reconstruction of this Government and Union, ought, in my opinion, to be intro- duced
lb is well known that some of tße• most important objects of this Constitution and Union are left simply to the discretion of the States; that there is a large class of rights, and important rights, for which there are no remedies, or next to no remedies
Those provisions which are de- signed to secure free trade and free intercourse between the citizens of the States can all of them be nullified or set aside by State legislation
The States can pass laws so to obstruct this free inter- course that the consti tu tional privilege may amount to nothing; and if this Union had endured, and these contests had continued , we should have seen laws passed in a spirit of retaliation by the States which would have broken up free trade between them
They could have taxed the commodities of the obnoxious States after the package was broken, under the decision of the Supreme Court itself
They could make it penal in their citizens to use the ships of another State, if it was obnox- ious to them; and in many other ways they could, by their legislation, destroy some of the most important objects of the Constitution
I believe, myself, that it was intended, by the framers of that inslrumcnt, that the States should have been mainly instrumental in restoring fugi- tives from labor, or, to speak more plainly, fugi- tive slaves
We know that it is in their power, not only to refrain from discharging this dutyt but actually to obstruct and impede the Govern- ment of the United Slates in its effort to execute the law
There are certain rights for which there It is provided, for instance, that are no remedies
no State shall maintain an army; and yet, if it does so, there is no remedy to prcvent it
Now, sir, I propose, in order to secure the proper enforcement of these rights for which, as 
I say, there are no adequate remedies, that the Supreme Court should also be adjusted
It should consist of ten judges—five from cach section—the I would al- Chief Justice to be one of thc five
low any State to cite another State before this tribunal to charge it with having failed to perform its constitutional obligations; and if the court de- cidcd a State thus cited to be in default, thon I would provide, if it did not repair the wrong it had done, that any State might deny to its citizens within its jurisdiction the privileges of citizens in all the States; that it might tax its commerce and I believe it svill the property of its people until it ceased to be in some amendment be not made
default
Thus, I would provide a remedy without do so because the working of our executive sys- tem is now such as to beget and bring up a party bringing the General Government into collision whose existence and foundation depend upon with the States; and without bringing the Supreme I have often heard Mr
Cal- Court into collision with them
Whenever inter- spoils and plunder
national stipulations in regard to the
duties im- houn say that most of the conflicts in every Gov- st to result in the posed on the States, as laid down in the Consti- ernmcnt would be found at la tution, are violated, I would remedy the wrong contests between two parties, which he denom- I would give a State inated the tax-consuming and the tax-paying par- by international remedies
ties
Ell he tax-consuming party, he said, was that the right, in such cases, after the adjudication Of II the court, to deny to the offending State the per
which fed upon the revenues of the Government, the spoils of offce, the benefits of unequal and formance of the mutual obligations which had elass legislation; the tax-paying party was that been created for its benefit
In this way, I believe  330 t•h'åtthésewrOngs might be remedied •without pro- diicing.collisioh in the system
A self-executing process Would thus provide a remedy for the wrong; •without a jar
to the machinery of Gov- erhment
In order to make this check effcient, it should be provided that the judgesof the Supreme Court in section' should be.appointed by the Pres• ident from that section, and this is the orily -ori- ginal appointing power which I would give to thc "Cond President
I- have'
présented this scheme, Mr
President, as which, in my opinion,would adjust the difféi•éiiccs between the two social systems, and whiOh would- protect each from the assault of thö other: 'If%this were done, so that we were made mutually safe, I, for one, would be willing to regulate 'the right of secession, which I hold to be a right not given in the Constitution, but re- stilt-in" from the naturc of the compact
I would proviäe, that bcfore a State seceded it should Summon a convention of the States in the section to which it belonged, and submit to them a state- ment of its grievances and wrongs
Should a majority of the States in such a convention decide the complaint to be well founded, then the State ought to be permitted to secede in peace
For, whenever a majority of States in an entire section shall declare that good cause for secession exists, then who can dispute that it ought to take place 
Should they say, however, that no good cause existed, then the moral -force of such a decision , on the' part of confederates ofthose who are bound to the complaining State by identical and homo- geneous interests, would prevent it from prosecut- ung the- claim any furthcr
believc that the system thus adjusted would give us a permanent Union, an efficient, a useful , and just Government
I think our Government would then rank amonr» the most permanent of human institutions
my honest opinion that, with a Government thus balanced, and with such capacities for empire as our people possess, we should build up a politi- cal system whose power and stability and benefi- Cial Influences would be unparalleled in alf the histoéy of the past
I know, Mr
President, it may be said that such a distribution of power does not accord with the principle of distributing according to numbers; but I say if that be thc true principle at all, it-applies only to States which have a single government; -it does not apply to confederacies; and if it were left to me to amend this Constitu- (ion, would stamp upon this Government a character still more distinctly federative than that which it now bears
I suy, then, that the distri- bation of power which propose would bc on- tirely just upon the federative principle
Nor would my proposition be at all more inconsiBtcut with -the principle of distributing power according Jo numbers than the arrangements of the present Federal Constitution
Nothing in my scheme is more unequal than the provision which gives the six New England States twelve Senators while New York has only two, although the popula- Lion of that State is as great, and I bclicvegrcnter, than that of all the New Encrland States together
There is nothing in the scileme now proposed, iFIconsi•stent with the federativc principle; and if the slaveholding and the non-slaveholding States had been apart for a dozen years in dif- ferent confederacies, and there was a proposition to unite those confederacies in one, no tnan would think it extreme, or be surprised if each of the confederaciesinsisted upon such powers and such guarantees as would enable it to defend its own social system and to secure equality, together with the opportunity for expansion according to the peculiar law of its development
But, Mr
Prcsidcnt, as I said before, I do not mean to declare that this is the only 6chcme upon which I will settle
I say I believe it to afford the best basis of settlement which has yet been devised
There
are other schemes upon which would settle
I would settle uponsometliing which would give only a truce, providcd it promised to be a long truce, and then trust to public opinion and the progress of truth to rt•medy future evils when they Inig}lt arise
But I would prefer, when we do settle, after all this turmoil and confusion, that we should do so upon some principle which promises us a pertuanent adjustment, constant and continuinæ peace, a safe, an effcient, and a stable Government
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 11, Mr
*resident, I have founded my suggestions upon the faet„ which I take to be an accomplished fact, that some of the States of this Union have already withdrawn, and that the old Union has been dissolved, and has gone
I believe there is no way of obtaining a Union except through a reconstruction, because I utterly repudiate and deny that it can be done through the system of coercion, which some have proposed
Sir, I say, if you were to atternpt coercion, and by conquest to restore the Union, it would not be the Union of ourfathers; butavery different one, I say it would be a Union constructed in entire opposition to the true American spirit and American principles; a Union ofa number of subjugated provinces with others who governed them and wielded thc whole power of the Confederacy
But, sir, I maintain that coercion, if it were pos- sible, is not right; and that if it were right, it is not possible
I think it can bc shown that it is neither right nor possible
I believe that it can be proved that the only effect of an attempt at coercion would be to destroy the chances ofa reconstruction of the Union, or, in other words, to defeat all the hopes that are left to the friends of a Union in the coun- try
I say that if it were possible, it is not right
I believe It is not right, because I believe in the right of secession in the States
It is not my pur- pose to repeat the argument which has bcen so much better madc by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, [Mr
BENJAMIN.] I do not mean to argue that question; I merely say that, to my mind, it lies in a nutshell
truc that our Constitution isa compact, as history demonstrates, bctwcen the States as parties; and if it be true, as Mr
Madison has demonstrated, that there is no common arbiter in disputes be- tween these parties; and if it be true, as Mr
Web- ster has said, that a bargain broken on one side is broken on all sides, then it rcsnlts inevitably that it is for the State to say whether the bargain has been broken, and to act accordingly
I do not say that this right o
secession is laid down in the Constitution
It results from the nature of the compact
When two nations enter into a treaty of mutual obligations, and one fails to fulfill its part, the other may cancel it; not from any stip- ulat.ion in the treaty, but from th nat.urc of the It is the very rerne ..for the very compact
wrong; and, indccd, it is the only remedy for the wrong
But, sir, I care not what you call it; call it rev- olution, if you choose; let this bo the name t.hat you give it; I still say I think I can show you from the Constitution that you have no right to interfere with it
If it bc revolution, it is organ- ized revolution; it is a revolution conducted by an organized body, and so acknowledged to be in the Constitution itself
If it be revolution, it is a rev- olution managed by the government which the Constitution acknowledges to bc a legal govern- —I mean the government of the State
How, ment then, could this Government pretend to treat as a rebel him who oboysagovcrnmcnt that itacknowl- cdges• to be legitimate
Especially, how can it intcrfcre to treat him as such when he has acted under a warrant from the very power from which this Government derives its authority
How does this Government derive its authority to administer • its functions within the State of Virginia
It derives it from the assent of the people of thc State of Virginia, given in the convention which repro- sent.od them in their sovoreicn capacity
How does the State govcrnrnent derivc its authority 
From the very same source; and in any dispute between the two, as to authority, it is for the source of authority to both to say whom the cit- izen shall obey
This Government rests and bas its being in the assent of the pcoplc of the differ- ent States; and without it the Constitution has clearly created a Govct•nmcnt which cannot exist or be administered within a Stato
Thcn, if it be true that this Constitution created a Federal Gov- ernment which cannot be administered within its limits without the assent of the people of the State, it would follow that the Constitution has declared, by implication, that the only authorit.y of that Government rests upon the assent of the people of the State; and that when this is withdrawn, it has no longer any ricrht.ful jurisdiction within it
Is it, then, ti•uc that this Governnlcnt is so con- structcd by the Constitution that it cannot execute its functions within the State without the assent so, then the Constitution clearly implies that the authority of the General Government is gone within the limits of a State when the people of that State have ',vithdrawn their assent to its ju- risdiction—a conclusion which is in entire accord- ance with the principles of free government as laid down by the fathers of the Constitution
I proceed then, Mr
President, to make good my proposition, that this Federal Government cannot be carried on within thc limits and juris- diction of a State, without the assent, the aid, and the sympathy of its people
In the first place, it depends on the Legislatures of the different States to elect members of this body
If a m4jority of the States, although they might represent a small minority of the people, were to refuse to send Senators here, your Government is gone; you have lost one of the most important arms of the system; you have no longer u Senate
But, sir, in order to carry out
the functions of this Government you must administer its judicial powers
Can you administer the judicial powers of this Government within a State if that State withdraws its assent and is determined to resist that administration
Can you do it by any means given you under the Constitution
Suppose a State repeals the penalties for murder as against the offcers of the General Government; suppose , it repeals tho penalties for false imprisonment as acainst those omcers; suppose it should say it had reason to fear that the @ffcers of the General Government would be appointed under influences which would be utterly destructive to its domestic peace and social system, and that they must give bonds for good behavior, with sureties to be found in the State itself: if a State were to undertake to obstruct the course of Federal justice in that way, where would thc remedy be' found within the constitutional power of this Government
Would it undertake to pass a code of municipal legislation in order to protect the persons, and property, and effects of its offcers
Could it say that its offerers should not be answerable to the jurisdiction of the Statc for offenses agailjst the laws of the State when they were within its jurisdiction
Certainly they could not do that, consistently with the Constitution
When it came to such a pass as that, they would have the same right to enact and execute a municipal code for all the people of the States, that they would havc to makc one for that portion of the pcoplc who constituted the mass of the Federal officers
But, sir, that is not all
To obtain the right of exclusive legislation within dock-yards, fbrts, arsenals, and other needful buildings, Congress must have, first, the consent of the States
That must be given under the Constitution
Supposen State refuses its consent
Where would be your court-houses, your forts, your custom-houses 
Where would you have the locus in quo, from which to administer the functions and the power of this General Government
Everywhere, if they were to refuse to give you this assent, you would be under State jurisdiction; and thus it would be in the power of thc State constantly to thwart, obstruct, and prevent the administration of Federal justice, or the admi*tration of Federal power, within her limits and Jurisdiction
So, too, it is in the power of the States, if they choose, if they undertake to withdraw their as- sent from this Constitution, to defeat these great ends of the Union, which I have before de- scribed as designed to insurc free intercourse and • free trade betwoen the citizens of the several States
Thus it will be found, when you come to cxaminc the matter, that thi.s Federal Govern- I ment cannot exercisc its most important and its essential functions within the limits of a State if thc people of that State refuse to assent to its power, and choose to obstruct it by means which they have under the Constitution of the United States
If this bc so, what is the result to bc derived from that fact
The result is, that the framers of the Constitution supposed that this Federal Govern- ment would only be an authorizcd Government within a State so long as it had the assent of the people of that State; and that when the people of that State witbdrew their assent, it was not the authorized Government; and therefore they pro- vided no means for enforcing its powers a.nd for exercising its jurisdiction
Is not that the inevi- table conclusion, from thc facte to which I have just alluded
Sir, the only mode in which you of the State, OF aryainst its will and authority
If could protect the administration of the Federal  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
affairs and the Federal jurisdiction within the State, would be to set aside the State government by force, and to reduce it to a territorial condition ; and then what would be the result
You first coerce a State because it secedes from thirty-two other members of this Confederacy; and you turn around and secede yourselves from it by reducing it from the condition of a S te to the position of a Territory ! But, Mr
President, I s that if coercion were right, it is impossible
I say that no man can doubt that if it be attempted against one of the seceding States, all the slaveholding States will rally to the aid of their sister; and the idea that you can coerce eight, or ten, or fourteen, or fif- teen of the States of this Confederacy when stand- in" in a solid body, is preposterous
I acknowl- edge that you may make a civil war which will produce immense disasters in both sections of the country; I •acknowledge that you can inflict im- measurable evils and great calamities upon both the contending sections; but as to supposing that either one could subdue the other so as to place it under its yoke, and impose its laws upon it, do not entertain the idea for an instant
Why, sir, how would this Nar of coercion be waged
It would take yearly, for you cannot wage it with less than a hundred thot.t- sand men; and where would you get this sum 
Not from imports; for what would the imports of the northern portion of the Confederacy be when you took from them all that comes in return for the exports of the South
You would have to sustain the war by loans and direct taxation; and is it to be supposed that the people would bear such burdens In such a cause as that
i belicve they might submit to any just and necessary tax- ation in the defense of their own legal and neces- sary rights; but would they submit to such a scheme of taxation for the purpose of enforcin& their yoke upon other people—for thc purpose of depriving those other people of the right of self- government
Whose would bc the comme.rce that would be preyed upon
Not the southern commerce
That would go in foreign bottoms
would be the commerce of the other section of the Confederacy
If it came to a question of plunder, which of the sections would afford the greatest temptation to plunder
Where are the cities, villages, the concentrated wealth of a com- munity to be found in the greatest number and quantity 
Those are the objects which tempt the cupidity ofa soldiery
You could not steal our negroes
Your own people would not allow you to talr.c them and set them frcc among them, to enter into competition with them for labor and for wages
HOW' would you carry on such a war, sir
Where would you find the means
You would not continue the attempt for more than six months before you would find it impossible, and say, therefore, that it is not possible, by any such means, to coerce the southern people into I know there is a talk of attaining submission 
all the valuable purposes ofa Union, by a simple blockade of the coast; that is, by a blockade which Where would the ships come from to blockade the whole southern coast
And how could they effect their purpose under this Constitution, un- less, indeed, they intend to violate it
Where praiscrs, their collectors
Where would they exercise their functions
On shipboard
That would be impossible
Would you transfer the cargo of the ship to another port of a collection district in another State, which had not seceded 
Why, sir, the cartro would not bc wanted there
How in regard to thc commcrce of the South dur- ing that period
You can lay no duty upon ex- ports
They would forbid their people, under penalties, to send their commodities by any but foreign bottoms; they might forbid the people, by penalties, from consumino• any goods which they did not •manufacture themselves, or import from have to be a blockade of war, in which you pre- vented vessels from going either out or in; and is it to be supposed that foreign nations would allow this
Is it to be presumed that Great Britain, which has millions of human beings whose very existence depends upon cotton, that the great in- terests of civilization, would allow this grand ma- terial of human industry to be thus shut up and denied to them
Why, sir, it is not to be supposed for a moment
There are other Powers which would prevent such a blockade, in addition to the resistance which might be expected from the section that it was attempted thus to coerce
I say, then, Mr
President, that it is idle to think of coercion
You may, if you choose, if such be your feeling, inflict evils by waging civil war; but will you inflict more on others than you will receive in return
Will you be benefited by the operation when you come to sum up its re- sults and effects
I think not
But supposc you could succeed—I put the question to you now— suppose you had succeeded according to your utmost wishes; suppose you had conquered the South; that you had subjugated the entire section; that you had reduced thosc States to the condition of dependent provinces: how then would you ex- crcise your power
Would you apply your doc- trine, that there can bc no property in slaves
In that community of eight 01' nine million white men and four milliön slaves, would you turn them loose together, and set the slaves frec
Would you repeat the experiment of the British West Indies—of the Island of Jamaica
Would your people stand by and see the cultivated fields rc- turn to the bush, the white man being gradually rcduced to the level of the nco•ro, and the necro remitted and restored to his primitive condition of barbarism
Would the great interests of civ- ilization and humanity permit such a result
Would your own interests, your manufacturers, your shipowners, agree to it
Sir, it is not to be supposed that a thing would be permitted; and what then would be the result
You would havc to maintain the social system; you would have to recocrnize property in slaves; and what would follow from that
If you recognize prop- erty in slaves, you must causc fugitive slaves to If you recognize a property that is be restored
under the jurisdiction of your Government, you must protect if you do protect it, you must punish pcrsons who attempt to make raids upon it, and to incite servile insurrections
And, sirs, if you oncc commit yourselves to the, duty of protecting it throughout all these conqucrcd States, you would find that it followed, as a ne- ccssary consequence, that you must protect it whercvcr you had the exclusive jurisdiction
What, then, would become of your dogma of ex- cluding it from the Territories
What would be the effect of such an experiment
You pen them up until there comes to bca surplus population in the old States; you pcn up the negroes, and say the negro shall not move, but the white man may
What is the effect of that
The white man does move when the wacres of labor arc low; the negro remains and gains the preponderance in popula- tion until you give him the best part of the conti- ncnt, and remove the white man •to the worst
Could such an absurdity as this be tolerated, Mr
President
No, sir; not for a moment
Then, if you would be forced to accede to all these things, if you succeeded according to your wishcs, and conquered and subdued us, after a bloody and harassing civil war, why not do it beforehand, when it would save thc Union 
Why notdo it now, W' hen it would avert all these calam- ities 
Why notavailyourselfofthe present oppor- tunity, when you may do so without the dreadful inconsistency which will be charged upon you, when you may be forced to do these very things after you have carried on this cruel and harass- ing and distressing system of civil war 
I say, then, Mr
President, that it is impossible I to coerce the southern States, if you were to at- tempt to do so
If you had the
constitutional coerce South Carolina; they are of no üse•tö if you do mean-to coerce 'her; yout Ought
not tb have them
The whole thing lies -in a -riütéhö-l-li because, if you do-mean -to 'use them for the pup pose of coercion, you light up the flames df civil war, and there is no telling when: those *Harneå will be extinguished; if you do attempt' Ito use thcm for the purpose of coercion, you destroythé chances of the construction of another Union; which I still hope and trust may taketplace, and which may prove to us a more permanent bond of alliance and fraternity than that one which is passing away from us
I say, too, sir, that you have no right, When you come to '.veigh the question of right, to 'hold on to these forts
You could not have obtained them without the consent of the Legislature of the State; that is, the provision of
the Constitu- tion
-Upon what consideration was that consent given
Not for pecuniary considerations
It Was given upon the consideration that they were to bc used for the defense of the State
Now, sit;you keep them when they can no longér be used for thc defense of thc State, but are proposed to be used for offensive purposes agamst her
The consideration , therefore , in my opinioh , has failed ; and in justice and equity, you ought to •restore them
But, Mr
President, if there were no moral-ob- ligation upon you to do so, I maintain that con- siderations of policy ought to prompt you to do In no other way can you prevent the com- it
mencement of civil war
They say they have seceded; they say they are out of t.his Ünion
I believe
myself that they are
You maintain a diffe2•cnt opinion; but certain it is, that while you might give them up without inconsistency, so far as your opinions arc concerned, they' could not yield them without absolute inconsistency, so far as their pretensions arc to be considered
If they are an independent people, they havc a right to If they arc an independent people, they are bound to take them, if they have the power to do so, when they bclieve they are in the possession of a foreign Power
But how is it with you
What inconsistency do you mani- fest, provided it be policy to do so, when you withdraw from them
You do not admit the In the form in' which the doctrine of secession
resolution is proposed, you are not called upon upon the ground of policy; for, under -the resolu- tion, a State which did not intend to secede might apply for a retrocession of the forts, and the retro- tives of policy, and without the least violation the Constitution
Suppose the city of New York had said to us, at a time when the public defenses were going up at a rate which did not satisfy her, because they were too slow, " retrocede to us the jurisdiction; it is essential to us to have tho forts; we will construct them rapidly; pass a law al- lowing us to maintain troops, and we will man might be circumstances under which it wotfl8 be politic for New York to make such a demand, and there might be circumstances under which it would be just and proper to grant it
theretöre, you do nothing inconsistent with your return these forts; and there is nothing impolitic in such a concession, unless you desire to use them for purposes of coercion
Mr
President, I maintain that every considcr- ation of policy should induce us o emovc that us; and I am especially anxious for it, becausc I believe that if we have civi war, we loseall hopes of reconstructing this Urnon
I desn•e myself to see it reconstructed on principles of fairness, 1 equality, and justice, between the sections
believc that if a drop of blood is once shed, if you do not destroy the chances of it, you postpone it to a very distant day; and for one, I do not desirc I presume that we shall soon see to see this
nearly all the southern States out of the Union
abroad; and thus you would lose your most val- uable customers in the carrying trade, and the most profitable consmncrs of your manufactures
And what would you get in return
Would right to do so, it would bc impossible
Why creatc a civil war wantonly, without purpose, I thi15k it probable that they will unite first and form a union of the South for the sake of the i without use or benefit to any one
If this be so, why not adopt the proposition in my resolution South; and having done so, I hope and trust and bc•liove that thev will call a southern convention —why not cede back the forts to those States that for the purpose of proposilv a reaccommodation claiån to have scceded, and to have withdrawn and readjustment on proper terms; and if the non- the customs that you thus collected pay the cx- penses of the blockade
-Would they pay half from this Confederacy
What do you want with slaveholding States at the samc time shall assem„ the expenses of the blockade
It is manifest they I them
What do you want with thc forts in the would not
The blockade, to bc effectual, would harbor of Charleston
If you do not mean to i ble in convention and exchange propositions, 1  332 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 11, hope and trust that some settlement may be-had, gome reconstruction to make this Umon more permanent and this Government more valuable than éver it has been to us in the past
Secession does not necessarily destroy the Union, or rather the hopes of reunion; it may turn out to be the necessary _path to reconstruction
The secession of the Roman people tothe Sacred
Mount did not destroy Ronie
On the Contrary, it led to a recon- struction of the constitution, to the tribunitian veto, to new securities for the equality and libeity of the people
The Roman Government became more permanent and powerful than before, and the Roman people benefited by the change
But if it should- turn out that in this exchange of prop- ogitione it was- impossible to accommodate the difference, still it might result in the establish- ment of some league, not merely commercial, but political,' holdink us together by a looser bond than any which has bound us heretofore, and we might- thus still secure many of the benefits of this Government and this Union, while we left each section free to follow the law of its own genius, and to develop itself according to the promptings of its own nature
I say, therefore, that, so far as I can weigh the question, it is no more a question of Union, but one of reunion
To produce reunion, it is es- sential that the southern States should be allowed to take that position which it is obvious they are going to take, in peace
You must give, too, all the Ome- you can, and offer all the opportunities you may, to those who desire to make an effort for the reconstruction of this Confederacy
Sir, I say 1 am one of those; for while I believe that the South owes it to itself first to secure its own position, to provide for its own protection, to unite in such strength as will enable it to defend itself against all goers and comers, I also be- lieve that the interests of mankind, our own inter- ests, and the interests of our confederates, would then require that we shoul(l reconstruct the old Union it we can, or rather constructa new IJnion on terms of equality and of justice
But, Mr
.President, will this he possible if we enter into a course of civil war
If brother be- gins to shed the- blood of brother, and people become irritated and excited at the sight of blood, will it bc possible to reunite us again 
And, sir, I ask if the Republicans are willißg, if they mean to insist, to add civil war to the long catalogue of enormities for which they are to be held responsible hereafter
Is it not enough that they have marched into power over the ruins of the Constitution, and that they have seized this Government at thc cxpense of the Union
Will they be contented with nothing loss now than civil war, and such a strife, oceording to their own account of it, as is unparalleled in the his- tory Of modern and civilized warfare
It is said that this fratricidal contest is to bc attended with horrors and atrocities at which even the men of Wallenstein, her whiskered pandours and fierce hussars," would stand aghast and pale
I would ask if they are, indeed, willing •to Ict loose the dogs of war, hot from hcll, to raven through this land; if they desire that " one spirit of the first-born Cain " shall reign in every Atner- I ican bosom, to prepare the hearts and minds of men for blood, and to stir up fratricidal strife throughout this once happy country
What ex- cuse, when they have returned from such a war of devastation and ruin, will thoy bc able to give to their own consciences
How will they account with humanity for its best hopes, which they have destroyed; for having crushed out and ex- tinguished the highest capacities for usefulness, progress, and development, which were ever be- stowed on man
Sir, what judgment will pos- terity pronounce upon them when it comes to sit in judgment on the deeds occasioned by such un- hallowed ambition 
Will it not say, " You found peace, and you established war; you found an empire of the United States, and you have rent and scattered it into separate and hostile frag- And, more awful still, what account will they render at the bar of Heaven, when, from many a bu rning homestead and many a bloody battle-field , spectra-I hosts shall appear to accuse them there; when the last wail of suffering childl'1Q0d shall rise from tlle very depths of the grave to make its feeble plaint against them, and the tears of woman, helpless woman, shall plead against them for her wounded honor in the voiceless woe of hér ineffa- ble despaif_
How will they account for it before man and God, before earth and Heaven, if they close with blood this great American experiment which was inaugurated by Providence in the wil- derness to insure peace on earth and good will to man; an experiment which was maintained and conducted by our fathers, not only by their blood, but with their most pious care
How will they hide themselves from the accusation, when one universal voice of misery and despair shall be heard throughout the land 
1 say to them, sir, that it will be no compensa- tion or excuse for such sins that they have suc- ceeded in enabling themselves to wave a barren scepter over a mutilated empire, an exhausted arid a suffering land! Why is it that these threats are made
Is it done for the purpose of prevent- ing the southern States from seceditp
Never have been taken more ill-judged steps to secure an end
They but precipitate and hasten what they wish to prevent
Such th rcats of coercion as these only serve to make the southern States precipitate themselves into the arms of each other, that they may stand together in a common cause, and unite their strength to make a common de- fi2nse
I say, for my own State, that she has not yet commissioned me to speak; she is taking counsel at home as to her future action; but this I do feel aulhorized to declare: she loves peace, and she desires to avoid war; but she will not be deterred from asserting her rights by threats of coercion or from any fear of consequences
Sir, once before in her past history, in the sacred name of honor, liberty, and equality, she staked her destiny on the war of the Revolution, when " the cause of Boston wras the cause of all;" and for the same high considerations, I know that she will imperil all again, if she bclievcs it to be her duty to do so
Al'bd if the day shall over come when she can neither defend her honor nor assert her rights because thc hand of power wields its bloody sword before her, she will feel that it would be better for hor natnc and farne to perish with them
Republican Senators, why those threats of coercion scnt to the southern States, who are seek- ing to do no evil to others, but merely to protect arid defend themselves
Do they go out with any purpose of attacking your rights
Do they secede with the wish to injure disturb you in any manner
Are they not going out simply for thc purpose of exercising that first law of nature and of nations, the right of self-government, be- cause they believe they are not safe under your rule
A ro they not willii')g to meet all the respons- ibilities which they may have incurred while thicy were carrying on a joint government with you
Why, then, sirs, do you claim to pursue them with fire and with sword; and why do you deny to them that right which belongs to every organ- ized people
When we were asserting that right against thc Government of Great Britain, we claimed, and wc received, the sympathies of the whole civilized world
When the Spanish prov inccs rebelled against tl'he mother country, we wrere quick to express our sympathy and regard for their cause
When Greece, distant Greece, asserted her independence, we were m-nong the first to express our sympathy for her
Now, sir, tl'1C right which we are frec to offer, and the sym- path y which wc gladly extend, to foreicyners and to aliens, are refused to our own brethren; and you say that, if they attcmpt to exercise them, you will pursue them to the death
Mr
President, is it to be supposed that any Anglo-Saxon people, people of our own blood and race, would submit to such demands
Is there any free people who are worthy of liberty, who would not say that sooner than yield to such dc- mands as these we bid you to wrap in flames our dwellings, und float our land in blood
I believe if they attempt to coerce the southern people in this regard, they will meet not only with the general detestation of mankind, but with such re- sistunce as has never been shown before in the world, except, perliaps, ill the history of Holland, i whose people fought behind the dykes and flooded their land with the waves of the sea, preferrit)ff death in any and every form rather than submis- Sion to such oppression and tyranny
But, Mr
President, I do not wish to pursue this line of argument
I do 110t desire to engage in any discussion which so much stirs the blood as the supposition that such rights as these are to be denied to any portion of my countrymen
I choose rather to stand in the character in which I appear this day
I stand here to plead for peace; not that my State, in my opinion, has any reason to fear "var more that another, but because it is the interest of all to preserve the peace, sacred names of humanity and of Christian civ- ilization; In the names of thirty miliion human souls, men, women, d children, whose lives, whose honor, and wh e happiness, depend upon the events of such a civil war as that with which we are threatened; in the name of the great Ame- ican experiment, which, as I said before, was founded by Providence in the wilderness, and which, I insist, has not yet failed; I appeal to the American people to prevent the effusion of blood
It is said that the very scent of blood stirs up the animal passions of man
Give us time for the play of reason
Let us see, after the southern States have secured themselves by some united action, if wc cannot brine together once more our scattered divisions; if we cannot close up our broken ranks; if we cannot find some place of conciliation, some common ground upon which we all may rally once more; and when the col- umns come mustering in from the distant North and the furthest South, from the rising and from the setting sun, to take their part in that grand review, the shout of their war-cry shall shake the air until it brings down the very birds in their flight as it ascends to the heavens to proclaim to the world that we are united once more, brothers in war, and brothers in peace, ready to tüke our wontéd place in the front line of thé mighty march of human progress, and able and willing to play for the mastery in that game of nations where the prizes are power and empire, and where victory may crown our name vvith eternal fame and deathless renown
Mr
HARLAN

President— Mr
BAKER
By the leave of the Senator from Iowa, I desire to ask the gentleman from Virginia, if hc will allow me, and consider it re- spectful, one question
Mr
HUNTER
What is the question
Mr
BAK E R
It is this: if a rnajority of this branch of Congress, the constit.utional majority, and a majority of the other branch, also the constitutio•nal majority, shall pass constitutional amendments, to be submitted according to the forms of the Constitution, for the consent and ap- probation of the people; in that event, if they be such as substantially meet the views of gentle- men on the other side, will the Senator from Vir- ginia, so far as he can, throw the weight of Vir- ginia, and especially the weight of his own indi- vidual character, to maintain the Constitution as it is, the Government as it is, the laws as they now are, with the power of the Government, until the people, or the States, shall have decided upon those amendments 
Mr
HUNTER
The Senator has asked me some questions which I cannot answer
I cannot answer for Virginia; I am not authorized to do so
I can only say this: that I will vote for the propositions of the Senator from Kentucky which were presented in committee; and other gentlemen declared that they belicvcd they would be satis- factory; but whether the people, who are now seceding and getting in Imc together for pur- poses of common defense, would wait to ascer- tain whether the States would adopt them, I am not authorized to say

The law simply applies to the District of Columbia, and no further; and the Constitution did not authorize it
He now applies to Congress simply to be released from that bond
An exe- cution has been levied upon all his property, and he wili be beggared unless hc is released
The boy, as I havc stated, was over sixteen years of age
His neighbors have applied with great unan- imity; t.he Governor of Kentucky has applied; every Representative in Congress from Kentucky has applied; and all the good people in the neigh- borhood look upon it as a case in which relief should be given
It is simply a release of the principal and security of the bond
Every dollar of the costs has been paid, and is certified here upon the papers on record
I trust that no gen- tlcman will object to the bill

Nye, assignee of Peter Bargy, jr., and I-Iuoh Stewart, for losses sustained by them in their contract for måcadamizing Pennsyß vania avenue, which loss was not occasioned by the fault or negligence of said contractors, but from their beinÉ compelled to prosecute it during the prevalence of the cholera, and by the inter- ference of officers of the Government
Mr
BRANCH
would like to ask the chair- man of the Committee for the District of Colum- bia what is the amount of this claim, if he have any information in regard to it
Mr
CARTER
It is not ascertained what the amount may be; something like three or four thousand dollars
Mr
BRANCH
Can the gentleman inform me how many claims this party has had passed through Congress for the last ten or twelve years 
Mr
CARTER
1 cannot
This bill has been favorably reported some fifteen times by commit- tees of the House and Senate, and sometimes passed by either one body or the other
This is a Senate bill, which was passed last session
Mr
BRANCH
If 1 am not mistaken, there have been several bills passcd for the relief of this party since I have been a member of this House
Mr
BURNETT
f will say to the gentleman from North Carolina that I think he is mistaken in stating that there have been several bills passed for the relief of this claimant
There has been but one bill passed by Congress for his benefit; but that was not for or on account of the claim now presented
This claim has been before Con- gress for several years, and passed the Senate last session
From the examination which I have given to it, I think the bill ought to pass
Mr
BRANCH
I do not mean to be under- stood as inaimating that we have already passed a bill including the particular claim embraced in the bill now pendimr
This party, however, is a very constant claimant on the Government for 
extra services and for extra compensation
Such, at least, is my understanding
And since hé has been so successful in getting his claimS allowed by Congress heretofore, it does seem to me alittle strange that this claim, if it were a meritorious  334 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 11, oneb should not have as well' as the others
'I do not profess to
be acquainted
with the merits of this claim at all
But II am very apt to 'think, Mr
Speaker, when I find a party so con- stan•tly before Congress, and getting large num- ber pf.- claims allowed, that when he has still a claim, which has- been- all the time rejected, that claim has not much merit in it
I may be in error as to the fact, I may bein error as to 'this party havinöhad• so many claims passed in, his favor
If so,fi desire to be corrected by the chairman of the- Committee for -the District of Columbia
I know, moreover, that when this claim was before the House on former occasions, one or two gen- tlemen who had investigated it opposed it very decidedly
They were gentlemen who were well acquainted with the merits of the case—who had studied the case, and who could not be induced to withdraw their opposition to it
Under these circumstances, I think that this bill ought to be referred to a Committee of the Whole House
We will go into committee directly, and can discuss it there
Let it take the course which other private bills take
Mr
BURNETT
1 desire to put my friend from North Carolina right in reference to one of his statements
He says that this claimant has had sevefal bills passed for his relief by Congress
In that he is mistaken.
But one bill for his relief has passed this House silice my service here com- menced
This claim was not embraced in it
I think- this-bill has been Vending for some seven years, and has been favorably reported by the Committee for the District of Columbia every time that it was referred to it
That is my recollection of- the fact
Mr
CARTER
The gentleman from North Carolina labors under a mistake about this claim having already been allowed
It has been before Congress fbl' a- long time; and, as I understand, it has passed the House and the Senat.e, but not at the same session, so that it might become a law of the land, and that this man should be con)pen- sated
Mr
BRANCH
1 submit to the House, I'V1r
Speaker, whether the fact that this bill has been so often before the House, and has still failed, is not a very strong aro•umcnt why it should not be passed now, without beirp considered in Com- mittee of the Whole House
*Mr
CARTER
it has passed one House; but at too period of the session to be acted on in -the other
MH
HUGHES
It seems to me that the longm• justice has been delayed, the greater the reason why it should be done now
Mr
CARTER
The claim has been favorably reported by fifteen separate committees; and no committec has reported against it
Mr
CRAWFORD
to ask the man of the Committee for the District of Colum- bia how rnuch tnonev this bill appropriates
Mr
CARTER
lit does not appropriate any II refers the claim to the proper l)epart- amount
ment, that it may be adjudicated and ascertained what is actually due to the claimant
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 desire to ask uny gen- tleman in tbc House to tell me what this bill does appropriate
I am very well satisficd that thc bill ought not to pass, I gave it some investirration last session
Mr
CARTER
The claim, if 1 it aright, is between three and four thousand dollars
It is a merc matter of equity between the Gov- ernment and himself
And yet this House is called upon to pass a bill without knovv'ing how much it appropriates, or whether there is an ything at all due to the claimant
It is notafixed amount; and I suggest to the chairman of the Committee for the District of Columbia, that he should let this bili take the regular course, and go, as other private bills go, to a Committee of the Whole House, where it can be discussed and the facts ascertained
Mr
CARTER
This is a Senate bill, and it has been scrutinized in that body
Mr
CRAWFORD
Exactly
Now, if the gentleman will show me a private bill that has ever been closely scrutinized by the Senate, he will show me something which I have never seen
Talk of u private bill being scrutinized by the Senate ! Mr
CARTER
well, if it was not, it ought to have been
Mr
CRAWFORD
It to hear a gentleman talk about the Senate scru- tinizing a private claim
And yet neither the Senate 1101' the House, nor the committee that re- ported the bill, nor the mcrnbcr from Now York, nor my friend from Kentucky, nor anybody e}se, can tell how much is to be paid from the Treas- ury under this bill
Let it, I repeat, take the usual course of private bills, and if the claim be a just one, it
Will be allowed
The party can- not complain of that course being taken
Mv
CARTER
If 1 understand it, the bill will' not appropriate more than four thousand dollars
Mr
CRAWFORD
But you say you do not understand how much
Mr
CARTER
we refer it to the Depart- ment to sec whether this party is entitled to the claim he makes
Mr
CRAWFORD
You refer It to the De- partment for them to inquire into the amount due to this party
Mr
CARTER
Yes, sir
Mr
CRAWFORD
The gentleman and the House know very well how these
bill* are usually drawn
They are drawl) with language such as the House of' Representatives frequently does not notice; and under peculiar words, we have actu- ally authorized thc payment of an amount of money, which we have ourselves been greatly astomshed at when wc found out what it was
Mr
CARTER
I have no doubt that we have honest men at the heads of the various Depart- ments of the Government, who will thoroughly investigate this claim
Ti'hey will deduct from the claim all that ought to be deducted, and they will not pay any more than is due
Mr
CRAWFORD
The such bills as this as instructions to them to pay this money
I move that the bill be laid upon the table
Mr
CARTER
I hope that that motion will not n•evail
Mr
BRANCH

If this man has a In reference to the amount of this claim, I wish just clann aøainst the Government, it is an equi„ i to read a passage from the report of the comrnit- table claim
He has no legal demand against the tee which accompanies the bill
The report is Government, "I'here may possifiy be some equity not very distinct as to the amour)t.•, but when tho in the claim; but if there be, there should be some, member who would be able to state what the ! amount would be
If there be a member who knows anything about it, I should like to know
I have had a conversation myself with a He sought mc yesterday, and spoke to me In He did not know, himself, how respect to it
much the amount was that was due to him, or whether there was anything at all due to him, I extract is read, the House will see that the amount of this claim, which we are called upon to pass, is much larger than two or three thousand dollars
The extract is as follows; The amount of work done by Stewart during the inqu- ence of the cholera, at his contract price, was 910,924 60
The amount done by Bargv during the same time, at his contract price, was 40, amounting in all to $18,796, to whieh amount, according to the principles adopted by former committees, one hundred per cent
ought to be added for the diminished amount of labor performed by the men, the contractors being compelled to employ two hundred to perform what one hundred would have done in the same length of time, had the contractors been allowed to suspend their work during the influence of the cholera ; and to this amount add fifty per cent
for the increased price paid the laborers to induce them to stay on the work, and from this amount dedict the amounts paid the original contractors, and their assignee or attorney, and .should there retnain a balance, thus -found, still unpaid, that the proper account- ing otficerg of the Treasury pay the same to J
VV
Nye, the assignee of said contractors; and in accordance with the foregoing principle the committee report a bill and earnestly recommcnd its passage." So, sir, it seems that the original contract was for$18,796
To thatamount the committee propose to add one hundred per cent
, which is to double that amount
and make it some thirty-seven thou- sand dollars
Mr
CARTER
One hundred per cent
upon the labor actually done
Mr
BRANCH
And then it is proposed to add fifty per cent
, which is some nine thousand dollars, making in all between forty-five and fifty thousand dollars
From that amount is to be deducted the amounts heretofore paid to Nye
What those amounts are we cannot tell; we have no tneans of knowing; but, ås the orio•inal contract was only for $18,000, it is quitc evident that what the comrnittee allows under this bill must at least be thc difference betwccn $18,000 and $47,000
'l'he report may mislead me
The chairman of the committee may be able to make it clear, not- withstRnding what I have
.read from the re bort— that the bitl appropriates only a very sma I surn of money, not to exceed two or three thousand dollars
1 would like to have the matter discussed in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
This name of Nye is familiar to those of ns who have been here for five or six years
1 have not served in a session of Congress since I have been here when this party was not beftjre Con- gress, in some shape or other, tryincr to have one claim or another passed by the Government
I will now read the last clause of the report; which, perhaps, will indicate to the House one of the reasons why the passage of this bill is urged
The committee gives it as one of the reasons; and perha it is one of the most influ- ential reasons whic operated upon them: In justice to
the clairnant and his lililily, and in con- sideration of the great length ot• time rnost Faithfully de- voted by bitn to the prosecution of this clai:n, and to relieve Congress frorn arry further importunity and expense, the connnittee reeo:nmend its innuediate settlenuent." In consideration of the great length of time most faithfully devoted by him to the prosecution of this claim! Not to the prosecution of the work, but in consideration of the great length of time devoted by him to the prosecution of this claim; and to relieve Congress from any further impor- tunity and expense, the committee recommends its immediate settlement
I submit to the House if that is a
suffcient reason for a committee of this House to pass a bill in this hot haste
not in consideration of the services rendered, but in consideration of the great length of the time devoted by this party to prosecuting this claim; and in order to relieve Congress from any furiher importunity, the committee recommend that the claim should now be settled
If I am correct, Mr
Speaker, in the ilnpression on my mind, that this is an old clailnant, one who has had many claims before Congress, then, so far froin gettillg rid of his importunity by passing the bill, I would not be surprised if we only in- sured a continuance of it
i think the way to get rid of importunity in such cases, where claixns have been deliberately examined and passed upon and rejected by Congress, is not to pass the claims, but to reject them decisively, and for the commit- tees of this House to refuse ever afterwards to consider them, unless new evidence be brought forward with them
I am not willing to get rid of the importunity of this party in any such way
I am not willing to try the experiment of getting rid of it in that way
So far from getting rid of it, I think we will (inly insure that he will be here at the next session of Congress with an- other and perhaps a larger claim
I insist on my motion to refer the bill to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the U Ilion
If we find that it is a just claim, as possibly we may, I will be as ready as any member upon this floor to do justice to this party; but where the circumstances are suspicious, as they are in this  1861, THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

me who are so confident of its justice—gentle- men upon whose judgment I have great reliance— I will, say, go into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union with them, and intö the investigation of the case, fully and fairly
If it is a just claim, I will go with them for paying it; and if it is not a just claim, I am satisfied that they will not ask Congress to pass it
I demand If, the previous question on the motion to refer

Mr
CARTER
I want to say a word
Mr
BRANCI-I
I withdraw thc demand for the previous question
Mr
CAR'I'ER
I hope that the motion to refer will be defeated
This claim has bccn re- ported upon favorably by fifteen committees

I am willing that the claim shall be limited to that I apprehend that there is no claim for amount
any large amount

STANTON

Mr
CARTER
The bill refers the settlement It authorizes of the claim to the Department
them to settle the amount found due

The question would be on the third reading and engrossment of the bill
Mr
BRANCH
1 ask that so much of the bill be read as is necessary to enable us to ascor- tain whether it contains an appropriation or not
The SPEAKER
The Chair thinks it is too late now to raise that question
The question is upon seconding the demand for the previous qucs- tion
Mr
BRANCH
I would like to get that inform- ation, because if the bill does appropriate money it must go, under the rules, to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
CARTER
It is too late to raise the point, because the bill is already before the House
Mr
BRANCH
It is -not too late, because the rules require that the bilk shall go there if it ap- propriates money, as I understand t.he Chair to I make that point of order
admit that it does
The SPEAKER
The Chair has looked into the bill in reference to that point, and he doubts whether it comes under that rule
He therefore overrules the point of order
The question is now upon seconding the demand for the previous question
The previous question was seconded, and the main question was ordered to be put; and, under the operation thereof, the bill was referred to a Committee of the Whole on the Private Calendar

The previous question was seconded, and the main question ordered to be put; arid under the operation thereof the resolution was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time; and being enffrosscd, it was accordingly read the third time, and passed

Mr
BINGHAM, from the Committee on the Judiciary, made an adverse report upon the peti- ti0i1 of the supervisors of the count.y of Ontario, New York, asking for an appropriation for a Gov- ernment court-house; which was laid on the table, avid the committee discharged from the further consideration thereof, TAXES IN KANSAS
Mr
BINGHAM also, from the same commit- tee, reported adversely upon the several petitions of S
S
Pronty, John Chew, and others, citizens of Kansas, prayinR Congress to remit taxes paid in support of the Government; which was laid on the table, and the committee discharged from the further consideration thereof
FERRY OVER LAKE CIIAMPLAIN
Mr
BINGHAM also, from the same commit- tee, asked that the committee be discharged from the further consideration of the petition of Charles Sowles, praying for a grant of land for a ferry over Lake Champlain, from Alburgh, in the State of Vermont, to Rouse's Point, in the State of New York, adjacent to the same; and that thc same be referred to the Committee on Commerce
It was so ordered
DAVID C
BRODERICK
Mr
BINGHAM also, from the same commit- tee, reported a bill for the relief of the assignees of David C
Broderick, deceased; which was read a first and second time
The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Senate to pay to the assignees of David C
Broderick, out of the contingent fund of the Senate, the amount of compensation and salary due to the deceased at the time of his death; and it repeais so much of any act as may conflict with this act
Mr
NIBLACK
1 would suggest to the gene tleman from Ohio that the last clause is too broad ill its application
The effect of it will be to repeal all acts inconsistent with the bill
The repeal ought not to act beyond the provisions of the bill
Mr
BINGHAM
The •repeal is limited in its operation to -this particular Case
Mr
NOELL
What -prevents.their receiving this money now 
Mr
BINGHAM
1 suppose the of the law would be that the x.vise bc paid to the personal representatives of thes deceased
This bill provides that-the money shall be paid to his assignee
I will state alsO;for .thc information of the gentleman, that the Senate:ofi the United States was so entirely satisfied that some such legislation as this- should be had, that they unanimously passed a resolution ofasimilar: nature; but the Attorney General said it must be, authorized by a joint resolution or a bill before' the money could be paid
I will amend the second section of, the resolu- tion, so that it shall read: So much of any act as may conflict herewith is hereby repealed in so far as it may interfere with the payment au- thorized bythe first section of
this act
The resolution was then ordered to be en- grossed and read a third time
Mr
NIBLACK
I would suggest to -the gen- tleman from Ohio, whether it would not be better, by unanimous consent, to strike out the whole of the repealing clause, and say simply that the-pay- ment shall be made , notwithstanding the provz& of any law to the contrary
Mr
BINGHAM
The is limited to the provisions of this bill, and there is no necessity för anyt.hing else
Mr
MAYNARD
Will the gentleman from Ohio inform me whether the bill gives any pay after the death of Mr
Broderick
Mr
BINGHAM
No, sir

Mr
PORTER, from the Committee on the Ju- diciary, made an adverse report upon the petition of Ferdinand W
Clark, of Roxbury, Massachu- setts, respecting proceedings in his claim against Mexico; which was laid on the table, and ordered to be printed
LAND TITLE IN SAN FRANCISCO
Mr
PORTER also,
from the same committee, reported back, with an amendment, and with a recommendation that it do pass, a bill (S
No
97) to authorize the institution of a suit against the United States, to test the title to lots Nos
6 and 7, in Hospital square, in San Francisco
The amendment of the committee was to amend section four of the act, so that it shall read as fol- lows: Be it further enacted, That no suit shall
be brought by virtue of the provisions of this act, unless the same be in- stituted within two years from the passage thereof
'Ilhe amendment was agreed to
The bill was then ordered to be read a third time
Mr
SMITH, of North Carolina
1 would be glad to inquire of the chairman of the committee whether the*e is any precedent for the proceed- ings contemplated by this bill; whether there is any instance where a suit has been authorized to be brought against the United States in a court of the United States
I think this would be the es- tablishmen t of an important precedent to the coun- try
Mr
HICKMAN
1 am not able, at this mo- ment, to indicate any case; butl think there will be no diffculty in finding a precedent
Mr
BINGHAM
There was such a case last session
Mr
HICKMAN
That is by no means an unusual thing
Ghe United States can undoubt- edly suffer no injustice from this course
The opinion of the Attorney General was asked
re- specting the title of the Government to these lots, and he referred it to the district attorney of Cal- ifornia, and he expressed the opinion that the title of the United States was defective
This bill is merely to enable that question of title to be tested

Mr
PORTER
It seems to me that, after a very brief statement the facts of this case, there will- be no objection to the passage of tlie billie The city of San FrancisdO was the original owner:öf• this property, and sold it to the United States -for- the purposes of a hospital
com- prises six lots
- Before the Federal Government purchased the property, a judgment had been re- covered* against- the city of San Francisco by one Morrison, and' the property sold under an execu- tion 'to the persons mentioned in the bill
It is strongly intimated, in a letter of the Attorney Genera-I to the Vice President, that the title of the urchasers, under thc execution, is a good one
['hey were forcibly turned out of possession of the property by Federal offcers, and merely wish tohave a right to try their claim in the courts of the United States
Mr
JONES
I object to that bill, if it is in order to obiect to it

Then 1 move that we proceed to the consideration of the private business on the Speaker's table
Mr

Pending that motion, I move that the House resolve itself into the Com- mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, with a view to take up the public business
'I'his not being " objection day," it is scarcely worth while to go into a Committee of the Whole on pri- vate claims
Mr

There are several bills which have been objected to that ought to have a hearing
Mr
SHERMAN
the motion to go into the Committee of the Whole on the state of tho Union
Mr
COBB, I appeal to the gentleman from Ohio to permit me ask thc House to pass a bill to provide a pension of cight dollars month for an old soldier who servcd five years
It has been reported unanimously by the Committee on ln- vaÄid Pensions
I expect this will be the last application' that I shall ever make to the House
Mr
SHERMAN
There are many such cases; and if I gavc way f6r them all, I might yield the whole day
If the gentleman is not going to stay here, he not entitled to have his bill passed
Mr
STEVENS, of Pennsylvania
would inquire if the new kingdom will not provide for these old soldiers
[Laughter.] Mr
COBB
-I am ready to answer any ques- tions put to me in a proper manner; but I am not disposed this time to answer that question
CIVIL BILL
The question was taken on Mr
SHERMAN'S motion; and it was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
BURNETT in the chair,) and resumed the consideration of House bili No
895, making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the year ending the 30th of June, 1862
The Clerk resumed the reading of the bill at the point where it
was left off when the bill was under consideration on Wednesday last
Mr.- QU ARLES
I move to strike out the following clause: For maintenance Of the vessel provided for by the act of 18th August, 1856, for inspection and transportation purposes, $30,000." And to insert in lieu thereof, the followirp: For inspection and transportation purposes, $5,000
Mr
Chairman, this appropriation seems to have been predicated upon a law which was en- acted at the first session of the 'Thirty-Fourth Congress, which is in these words: For providing a suitable vessel, and for maintaining the
same för one year in visiting the
lights and other aid* ; for inspections and delivery of supplies ; for placing and re- moving buoys ; and for the transportation of materials, sup- plies, and laborers; for constructing and repairing Ii"ht- houses on the Pacific coast, $60,000." That law, which has been reönacted every year since, with one exception, merely provides for the support of a vessel for one year
It was omitted entirely at the second session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress
It was renewed at the last session; but there is no earthly necessity for it now
At the time the law was first enacted, we were constructi1V lioht-houses at numerous points on the coast of California, and it was ne- cessary to have materials carried to them by this vessel
Now, I state here that the cost of the whole light-house system on the coast of California, Oi•egon, and Washington, amounts to $62,070; and we are asked to pay $30,000 a year to carry oil to the fifteen light-houses on that coast, and an inspector to thern once or twice a year ! in the natne of common sense, are we thus to squander the people's money
The law of 1856 is not obligatory upon us now
It merely pro- vided that this vessel should be supported for one year, and contemplated its discharge from the public service at the end of that time
At the session of the ThirlrFourth Congress and at the first session of the ' Thirty-Fiftb Con- gross, thc same provision was passed, reducing the amount appropriated to $30,000 from $60,00Ö, the origina'l an-rount
At the short session the Tbirty-Fift.h Congress it was entirely ornit.ted, but nt last session it was renewed
The Con•)- mittee of Ways and Means geom to have acted upon the mistaken idea that there was an exist- ing law which required this appropriation
I ask if the professions of economy of these gentlemen, who are nowt about corning into power, were mere canvass economy
Will they sanction this squan- dering of the public money with the cry of econ- omy on their lips
I do trust that the comrnittce, in justicc to the Trcasury, and in justice to the country, will strike out the appropriation
The amonnt which I I think, ample for the Mr
Committee of ways and Means, at the last session of Congress, omit- ted this item; but the Senate inserted ii, and when it carne here, the House agreed to the mnend- ment of the Senate on a vote by the yeas and nays
I arn perfectly willing that the an-lendment of the shall be adopted ; but I have no doubt that t.hQ item will be put in by the Senate as an amendment to the bill, and that the House will agree to it
Mr
QU ARLES
Let us do our duty, and let the Senate attend to theirs
The amendment was agreed to
The Clerk read the following clause: For lighting the Capitol and President's house, the public grounds around theun, and around the executive offices, Pennsylvania avenue, Bridge and High streets, in Georgetown, Four-arid-a-half, Seventh, and Twelt'th streets, across the Inall, $42,000." Mr
QUARLES
1 move to amend that clause by striking out after the word " avenue," down to and including the word " mall," and by re- ducing the amount of the appropriation to $30,000
I objected to this appropriation at the last session of Congress; and the House then reduced it, or struck it out, I think, on the motion of the gen- tleman from Georgia, [Mr
CRAWFORD.] Mr
SHERMAN
rl'hc gentleman will per- ceive that tbc amount is now reduced
IS'1r
QUARLES
II is true that it is reduced to $42,000; but I do not think it incumbent upon the Federal Government to light up the streets of Washington and Georgetown
I do not think it incumbent upon us to assume the entire expendi- tures of the District of Columbia
I am
perfectly willing that Pennsylvania avenue, which leads- to the public buildings, should bc lighted by the Government; but do not see that it is incumbent upon us to light the streets of, Georgetown, and Four-and-a-half and Twelfth streets, in Wash- ington, any more than it is to light all the other streets of the two cities
As to Seventh street, it is suggested to me that that runs by two of the departments, and I am perfectly willing that it should be lio•hted, so that there may be access to the post omce at all times
But we ought to stop this system of lighting streets upon which there are no public buildings, and which do not adjoin the public grounds, or the entire District of Co- lumbia will be pensioned upon the Federal Treas- ury
It is fust getting to be so now
I can see no reason for it
None of our States pay for the lighting of their capital
ask the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means whether the State of Ohio pays for lighting the streets of Columbus 
Mr
SHERMAN
Perhaps my friend from Tennessee is not aware that this is simply for liohting the public grounds
These streets pass through certain malls or reservations, and this appropriation is only to pay for the cost of keep- ing up the licbts through these grounds
Mr
QUAiU,ES
I ask the gentleman from Ohio whether High street, in Georgetown, passes through any of the public grounds 
Mr
SHERMAN
No; but Pennsylvania av- enue and High street have always been lighted at theexpense of the Governmcnt
The othcrstrccts of which the gentleman complains, arc streets that cross the mall
I do not care whether the item be stricken out or not
We debated this same matter at the last session, and reduced the price of gas to a reasonable sum
Mr
QUARLES
Yes; butthe Senate restored the item which the House had stricken out
1 insist on my amendment that this sum shall be reduced from $42,000 to $30,000
Mr
HUGHES
hope the committee will not adopt the amendment
The chairman of the Commit.tee of and Means has already stated all that perhaps ought to be stated to sat- isfy tl'kC committee that this amendment should not be adopted
He has stated that Four-arid-a- half street, Seventh street, and Twelfth street, across the mall, should be iiffhted at the expense of the Govern Inent
It is important that conunu nication between different parts of this city at night should be safe, It is not for the city to light these streets at their expense; be- cause they run through public grounds, and if they were not lighted by the Government, they would be left utterly in the dark
At this time when there are so many incendiaries about, it would be very unsafe for residents to cross the mall at night unless the streets were licrhted, as the havc been, and they are now
'I he question was taken on Mr
QUARLES 's amendment; and it was not agreed to

We arc dependent on for- eign countries for our seeds; and we have the advantage, through the General Government, of having information through our consuls and poses of general cultivation and the encouragement of the acents abroad as to the effect on seeds of varieties agricultural and rural interests of all parts of the United States: .Rnd provided further, Mr
SHERMAN
I ask whether this amend- ment is in order
It changes the existing law
The CHAIRMAN
'The Chair would inquire of the gentleman from Ohio, whether, by existing laws, the cuttings and shrubs are required to be kept in this particular place, or whether that gar- den exists in consequence of law 
Mr
SHERMAN
I have no objection myself to the amendment if the gentleman from Indiana reports it from a committee, or if he has examined the subject
Mr
HOLMAN
I report it from no committee
I offer tbe amendment on my own responsibility
Mr
SHERMAN
1 withdrawmypointoforder
Mr
HOLMAN
1 do not to discuss this proposition
I understand that a portion ofthc appropriation made last year, and former years, has been expended in the erection of green-houses on the public pröperty within the limits of this city; and i also understand that the results of the experiments thus far made have not been very beneficial to the country
I believe that any gen- tleman who has given attention to this matter will be satisfied that so much of {he appropriat.ion as is withdrawn from the general purposes of agricul- ture, and devoted to agricultural science, is very badly a propriated indeed
Mr
8AREY
Mr
make I have paid some a few remarks on this subject
little attention to these matters since I have been have been a member a member of this House
of the Agricultural Committee, and have had frc- qucnt intercourse with the department on the sub- I am satisfied that many things have Iqcen attempted to be effected in these gardens that have been perfectly useless; but, at the same time, I think that this amendment goes entirely too fhr
The position which' the Government of thc Uni- ted States can occupy in regard to agricultural science is a very important one, if its power be properly directed
' it is well known that tried here last year to have an alteration effected in the present organization of that department
But if you forbid the, making of any experiments in re- gard to agricultural science, you thereby defeat the whole policy of the Government in that re- spect
These amricultural statistics, and the aid of the Government heretofore given, may be of great vaiue to the country; for there are many questions of abstruse science relating to agricul- ture which can be better solved by the Govern- ment, through its ministers and consuls abroad, than in any other way
I know that agricultural science has been too much neglected by the Gov- ernment, and attention has been turned to mere ornamental horticulture
Still, I think that this amendment ought not to be passed without some further reflection; for, if it be adopted, 1 do not know to what practical use the appropriation will is well known by every practical bc appiied
farmer in the country that we have no varieties of wheat calculated to last in any particular latitude for more than five, six, cight, or ten years
Mr
HOLMAN
Will the gentleman me by stating as to what use he understands this propagating garden to be now applied
It is cer- tainly not applied to the purpose of testing the various qua}ities of vv'heat and grain, but to en- tire* y different objects
Mr
CA REY
That is not the point I am dis- cussing; but think the amendment goes too far when it the making of experiments
Mr
AOLMAN
The object of my amend- ment is that no part of the $GO,OOO appropriated shall be applied to erecting green-houses or making experiments
22 of soil and climate
There are some philosoph- ical principles connected with the culture of wheat which can bc better discovered in tl)is tl'lan in any other way
And if you prohibit the !nalcing of experiments, you might as well cease altogether to make appropriations for the benefit of azricul- tural science
The Government of the United States can, through its organization abroad, ob- tain advantages with a great deal less expense than any of the States could; and the information thus attained is more easily spread over the whole country
For these reasons I am opposed to the amendment
Mr
HOLMAN
1 trust 1 will be indulged with a sincrle remark, so that there may be no I understand Inisapprehension on this question
that the botanic garden is the one west of this Capitol, under the superintendence of Mr
Smith, a very intelligent gentleman; and it is said to be admirably conducted
it is not proposed to in- terfere
with that at all
T hc object is only to prevent the establishment of another institution for the propagation of plants; onc under a differ- enu superintendent and different management, and for which no specific appropriation is or has been made
I want to prevent the establishment of' any such institution under the Department of the In- terior without action on the subject by Congress
The last appropriation for agricultural purposes was $60,000, and tor the preceding year $40,000, portions of which, I understand, have been ap- plied of latc years to the purposes of this prop- I understand that an agating establishment
actual inspection of that establishment will show that the only plants propagated are varieties of cacti, varieties of Syrian locust, and others of a I think I can say to gentlemen like character
with great confidence that not one plant is being propagatcd in tho cstablishment it is proposed to abolish which is of any use to any considerable portion of the American people
The design is to make it a fancy establishment, and not that it shall be devoted to any substantial good for the I am satisfied, if crontlc- interests of agriculture
men thought, proper to investigate the subject, that they would not, after such investigation, agree that any portiQn of the appropriation should I be diverted from its legitimate object to keeping up this propagating garden
Mr
MAYNARD
I Inove to insert in place of the words " botanical garden," the words " the President's grounds
" Mr
Chainman, for a period now of the largest part of twenty y cars, ever since Mr
Ellsworth had the charge of tho Patent Office, the operat.ions of that department of the Government have, I think, been of essential service in advancing the agricultural interests of the country}
My atten- tion was called to the operations of that depal•t- mcnt by the reports made by Mr remember the first one I saw was when I hap- pened to bc in the State of Iowa, rnanv years ago
I have paid sotne attention to the subjcct from that timc until now

I understand that the ofiice has appropriated a piece of ground, to be used for the purpose of prac- tical experiments
I have been in those crounds If there were any cacti on several occasions
there, or
indeed, a single cactus, I do not remem- ber it
Still, sir, there raay have been many there
I am unwilling to inter[öre with the operations of NEW SERIEs....•.No-•: 92
they may not have always

But, sir, I am willing to trust- the incoming Administrution, coming, as it does, from an eminently rural -por- tion of the country , to place the Patent Offce-under the chargetmd control of the men who will- pro- mote the real agricultural interest of the Union
I am therefore unwilling that a radical change shall be introduced, like that which
is proposed by my friend from Indiana
I think we had bet- ter try the operations of this garden for one year longer
Then, if, on investigation by the Com- mittec on Agriculture, it turns out to be injudicious and improper, the gentleman will find no more zealous advocate of his reform thari he will find in me if I should happen to be here to coöperat'e with him
For these reasons I oppose thc ment of the gentleman from Indiana; and having said what I wish to say, I withdraw the amend- merit have oiTered
The question was taken on Mr

For surveying the public lands and private land claims in New Mexico, $10,000
Mr
OTERO
1 move to increase the appro- priation to $15,000
Mr
Chairman, #15,000, and not $10,000, is the estimatc of thc proper Department f(jr this service
There is grcat probability that a great deal of surveying will have to be done on the Tcrritory of New Mexico during the coming spring and summcr
A large emigration has gone into that Territory, and that emi«rration promises to con- tinue and to increase
Thore is a large emigra- tion from tbc Pike's Peal' region
They wöuld like to have the public lands surveyed, In order that they may takc it up and enter upon its culti- vation
For that purpose, I think that $15,000 is a sum not too large
On the contrary, i think it is hardly enough
During the last Congrcss, something like forty private land claims were confirmed
Of that number, under the appropri- ation madc at the last session, of $10,000, only three or four of them have been surveyed
The amount was not suffcient to provide for survey- ing all of them
I ask, now, that $15,000, and not $10,000, be appropria9d for the next fiscal year
The estimate is $15,000; but the Commit- tec of Ways and Means have reduced it to $10,000
1 hope that m amendment to increase the amount will bc agt•ce to
Mr
QUARLES
lhopc, Mr
Chairman, that the amendment will not be adopted
The Com- mittce of Ways and Means have not made a rc- duction in the estimates for New Mexico and left the others untouched, They have also reduced the estimated amount for California f'rom $30,000 to $20,000
The appropriation last year for New Mexico was only do not see any reason why we should increase the amount recommended by the Committee of Ways and Means
'There sccms to have becna pro rata reduction on all these estimates
Mr
OTERO
I move, proforma, to strike out the words " public lands," and to insert, in lieu thereof, the words, " private land claims." Mr
Chairman, last veal* the estimat.ed amount was but the-Committee of Ways and Means reduced it to $10,000, on account of the financial diffculLies of the country
The surveyor general of New' Mexico, in order to carry out his surveys, has submitted an estimate for $60,000
The Department reduced that estimate to $15,000; and now the Committee of Ways and Means have furthör reduced it to $10,000

I do not really see what reason there partment
can be to reduce the estirnate for New Mexico, and not reduce that for Kansas and Nebraska
There is more land surveyed in these Territories than there is in New Mexico; and the emigration to New Mexico is double that to Kansas and Ne- braska
The settlers in the northern part of New Mexico are from the western States, and they demand that the lands shall be surveyed, so that they may locate them
I hope my amendment will be agreed to
Mr
QUARLES
The
gentleman is mistaken in one respect
There has been a pro rata reduc- tion on the estimates for California
Thirty thousand dollars was the estimate, and only $20,000 is provided for in t.he bill
The estimatc for New Mexico was $15,000, and that is reduced to $10,000
It seems, however, that there is no reduction in thc case of Kansas and Nebraska
When that appropriation is reached, any gentlc- man can move to reduce it
Mr
SHERMAN
The Committee of Ways and Means have appropriated the same sum for New Mexico that was appropriated last year
No more was nskcd for Knnsas and Nebraska than wns appropriated in the previous bill
Mr
OTERO withdrew the amendment to the amendment
The question was taken upon Mr
OTERO'S amendment; and it was not ugn•ced to
The following clause being under consideration , For surveying the public lands in Washington Territory, at the rates now authorized by law, $15,000, Mr
STEVENS, of Washington, said: 1 move to
antend that clause by striking out $15,000," and insertin«r s' $20,000
" I move this amend- ment because $20,000 is the estimate of the De- partment, and I would ask the committec to rc- store that estimate
It is much less than the sum recommended by the surveyor general of that Territory
I x.vil\ not enlarge upon this matter; but inasmuch as the estimates of the Department are a very great reduction of the estimates of the surveyor general, arul inasmuch as the appro- priation has l)ecn very small fora period of years; and indeed, inas:nuch as for several years there were no appropriations, I hope my amendment will bc adopted
The Amendment was not agrccd to
The following clause being under consideration, For preparing the unfin ished rccords of' pu blic and pri vatc gutveyg, to be transferred to the Stat.e authorities, under the provisiona of the act of 12th of' June, 1840, in those dis- tricts where the-surveys are about being completed, per act of 2d of January, 1855, $8,800, Mr
QUARLES said: I rise merely for thc purpose of asking a question of the chairman of the- Committee of Ways and Means, for informa- tion
This clause is rather indefillite, and the amount appropriated seems to be very large
1 desire to know what the records are which are required to be kept and preserved at an expense of $8,800 
Mr
SHERMAN
Under the law referred to in the bill, copies of ceruiin records of surveys are required to be transferred to the State author- ities of certain States
Mr
QU ARLES
Is this item estimated for by the Department, and was it supposed by the Committee of Ways and Means to have been properly estimated
Did the Committee suppose that the preparing and filing of these papers'would cost $8,000 a year 
Mr
SHERMAN
The estimate Depart- ment was $8,800, and the committee could not see that it was 100 much
The amendment was not agreed to

Mr
MAYNARD
As this is an old acquaint- ance, I raise a point of order upon it
Mr
ENGLISH
I submit that the amend- ment is strictly in order under the rule
It is to provide for a continuation of a public work, and for furnishing a Government building in Indian- apolis
The CHAIRMAN
The must overrule the point of order raised by the gentleman from Tennessee, as the amendment is for the contin- uation of an improvement already authorized by law
Mr
MAYNARD
we have a precedent to the contrary upon this vcr oint, and I believe the present Chairman decide/ it
Mr
PORTER
Mr
Chairman, 1 desire to say n few words in support of the amendment which I have offered
The Government has about com- pleted, at Indianapolis, at a cost of near one hun- dred and twenty-five thousand dollars, a building for the accommodation of the Federal courts which hold their sessions there, the post office, and the land offces
No provision has been made for supplying the building with the furniture need- ful to fit It for occupancy
'The Secretary of the Treasury, in a Icttcr which I hold in my hand, states that 9.7ill be required to provide the necessary furniture
"I'he carcuit and district courts of the United Statcs, for t hc district of Indiana
hold their ses- sions at Indianopolis only; the only distributin& post ofiice of the State is there; and the land ofhcos of the State have bccn consolidated into tw•o, and are located there
I mention this to show the amount of furniture required , properly to supply thc building
The Government is now paying, in the way of rents, $900 per annum for a building for the post office, $200 for the marshal's and clerk's offices, and $500 for the land offices
T hc State is also setting up a claim for rent for apartments fur- nished for tho use of the Federal courts
'I'hese expenses will be saved hereafter, by tho passace of the pending amendment
The amendment wus agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN moved that the committee rise, and report the bill to the House
The motion was agreed to
So thc conunittcc rose; and the Speaker hav- incr resumed tl'ie chair, M r

Mr
SHERMAN
The gentleman from con- necticut, [Nlr
L00MIs,] 1 bélieve, desires to offer his amendmml ill reference to marine hosnitals
With the understanding that that amendment is cull ti'le previous question upon the pending, bill and amendments
The several amendments recommended by the committec were agreed to in gross, with the ex- ccption of the followinff', upon which separate votes were asked: First amendment: raze l, line eleven, strike out $100,000," and insert $250,000 so that the clause will read : For continuing the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coast survey ot' United States, (including compensation ot• civilians engaged in the work, and excluding pay aud emol- tnncnts of oflieera of the Anny and Navy, and petty officers and rneu or the Navy eluployed on the work.) $230,000

Mr

1 will say this, that after the Army and Navy appropria- tion bills have passed the House, I shall have nothing further to present to the House, and shall be disposed, so far as I am concerned, to allow general debate

" Order!" ] and in fulfilling order
Mr
GARNETT
I risc to oppose the motion of the gentleman from Ohio
I do not mean to debate It, but merely to ask a question in regard to it
Every appropriation bill' thus far has been made a special order, and noopportunity has been given Cor general debate in the I-louse
I saw it, announced in the papers, the other day, that it is the determination of the party of which the gen- tieman is the leader that there shall be no general debate in this House
I shall be glad to know, if he feels himself at liberty to state it, whether that course is to be pursued in regard to all the bilks, or whether the minority upon this side of the House•are to be allowed an opportunity of presenting their views on the present state of-the country 
Mr
SHERMAN
1 answered that question the other day
I believe nobody in this House has ever resolved to cut off general debate; but I believe I can say that it is the general desire upon this side of the House to pass the ordinary appro- priation bills as speedily as possible, and send them to the Senate, and then to allow debate upon the reportofthe committee of thirty-three, upon I hope the Army and any subject whatever
Navy bilis will be sent to thc Senate before we comrnence general debate
That is all I desire
Mr
GARNETT
If will allow me, I will ask him whether, if the appropriation bills are passed, he will press no other bills for action without general debate
whether, for in- stance, the force bill, as I believe it is generally 11) y duty to them to-day, I present this paper
[Renewed cries of Order ! ' ' The SPEAKER

NAVAL APPROPRIATION BILL—AGAIN
The question recurred on Mr
SHERMAN'S mo- tion to make the naval appropriation bill a special order in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
CRAWFORD demanded nays
Mr
BURNETT
1 think it m•ust be obvious to the gentleman from Ohio that the course which he proposes, of making all the appropriation bills special orders, will postpone general debate for two or three weeks
I hope, therefore, the .Hpüse will refuse to make this a special Order
Mr
SHERMAN
We cun pass these two appropriation bills—the Army and, Navy—to-day and to-morrow; and next we can have general debate
Mr
GARNETT
The gentleman from Ohio is very much mistaken, if he supposes we can get through them in that time

Then it is the more ant that we should go on to-day and get through all the work we can

It would have been convenient to the crowd, perhaps, to do this before; but it has never been asked, I think, and I am sure would never have been granted by the Senate; object

Yet, for President's recent messaøe
all this, I do not twree with those who, with a The motion was agreed to; and the Senate re- sumed the consideration of the special message of the President of the United States, communicated on the 9th of January, in reference to the state of the Union, the pending question being on Mr
BIGLER's motion that it be printed
Mr
SEWARD
Mr
President, Congress ad- journed last summer amid auspices of national abundance, cententment, tranquillity, and happi- It was reassembled this winter in the ness
presence of derangement of business and disturb- ance of public as well as private credit, and in the face of seditious combinations to overthrow the Union
The alarm is appalling; for Union is not more the body than liberty is the soul of the na- tion
The American citizen has been accustomed to believe the Republic immortal
He shrinks from the sight of convulsions indicative of its sudden death
The report of our condition has gone over the seas; and we who have so long and with much complacency studied the endless agi- tations of society in the Old World, believino• our- selves exempt from such dislurbuuccs, now, in our turn, secm to be fallin« into a momentous and disastrous revolution
I know how difficult it is to dccidc, amid so many and so various counsels, what ought to be and even what can bc done
Certainly, however, 1 it is time for every Senator to declare himself
therefore, following the example ofthc noble Sen- ator from Tennessee, [Mr
J OilNsoN,J avow' my adherence to the Union in its intecyrity and with all its parts, with my friends, with y party, with rny State, with my country, or without eit,bcr, as they nuay deternune, in every event, whether Of pcacc or of war, with every consequence of honor or dishonor, of life or death
Although I lament the occasion, I hail with cheerfulness tho duty of lifting up my voice among distracted debates, for my whole country and its inestimable Union
Hitherto the exhibitions of spirit and rcsohl- tion here, as clscwherc, have been chiefly made on the Sidc of disunion
I do not regret this
Dis- union is so unexpected and unnatural that it mast plainly reveal itself before its presence can I like best, also, the courage that rises realized
slowly under the pressure of severe provocation
If it be a Christian duty to forgive to the stranger even seventy times seven offenses, it is the highest patriotism to endure without complaint the pas- sionatc waywardness of political brcthren so ion'F as there is• hope that they may come to a better mind
I think it is easy to pronounce what measures I agree with or conduct wilt not save the Union
the honorable Senator from North Carolina [Mr
CLINGMAN] that mere eulogiums will not save it
Yet [ think that as prayer brings us nearer to God, though it cannot move Him toward us, so there is healing and saving virtue in cvery word of dc- votion to the Union that is spoken, and in every I know, at sigh that its danger draws forth
least, that, like virtue, it derives strength from every irreverent act that is conunitted and every blasphemous phrase that is uttered against it
The Union cannot be saved by mutual crimi- nations our respective share of re- sponsibility for the present evils
He whose con- science acquits him will naturally be slow to accuse others whose coöperation he needs
His- tory only can adjust thc great account
A continuance of the debate on the constitu- tional power of Congress over the suuject of sla- very in the Territories will not save the Union
The opinions of parties and sections on that ques- tion have become dogmatical, and it is this cir- cumstance that has produced the existing alien- ation
A truce, at least during the debate on the Union, is essential to reconciliation
The Union cannot be saved by proving that secession is illegal or unconstitutional
Persons benton that fearful step will not stand long enough on forms of law to be dislodcred; and loyal men do not need such narrow ground to stand upon
I fear that little more •will bc gained from dis- cussing the right of the Federal Government to if dis- coerce seceding States into obedience
the Executive, the
responsibili!y.of, spving
tho Union belongs to the people, and they are abdn• dantly competent to discharge it
I propose, therefore, with great deference» to address myself to the country upon the moment-: ous subject, asking hearing, not less from
-the people within what are called" the seceding; than, from those who rcsidc within the adhering States
Union is an old, fixed , settled habit of the Amer- desire to avert that great calamity, advise a con- ican people, resulting from convictions --of its ventional or unopposed eparation, with a view necessity, and therefore not likely to be hastily to what they call a reconstruction
It is enough discarded
The early States, while existing as colo- for me, first, that in this plan, destruction goes nies, were combined, though imperfectly th rough before reconstruction; and secondly, that the a common allegiance to the British Crown
When strength of the vase in which the hopes of the that allegiance ceased, no one was so presumptu- nation are held consists chiefly in its remaining ous as to suppose political existence compatible un broken
with disunion; and, thereforc, on the same day Congressional compromises are not likely to that they declared themselves independent, they I know, indeed, that tradition save the Union
proclaimed themselves also confederated States
favors this form of remedy
But it is essential Experience in war and in peace, from 1776 until to its success, in any case, that there be found a •1787 , only convinced them of the necessity of con- preponderating mass of citizens, so far neutral on verting that loose Confederacy into a more perfect the issue which separates parties, that they can and a perpetual Union
They acted with a gool- intervene, strike down clashing weapons, and ness very different from the intemperate conduct compelanaccommodation
Moderate concessions of those who now on onc side threaten, and those are not customarily asked by a force with its guns who on the other rashly defy disunion
They con- in battery; nor åre liberal concessions apt to be sidercd the continuance of the Union as a subject given by an opposing force not less confident of comprehending nothing less than the safety •and its own right and its own strenqrth
I think, also, welfare of all the parts of which the country was that there is a prevailing conviction that legislative composed, and the fate of an empire in many re- cmnpromrscs which sacrifice honestly cherished spects the most interesting in the world
I enter principles, while they anticipate Cuture, exigencies, upon the subject of Oontinuing the Union now, even if they do not assume extra-constitutional deeply impressed with the same generous and powers, are less surc to avert imminent evils than loyal conviction
How could it be otherwise, thöy are certain to produce ultimately even greater when, instead of only thirteen, the country is now dangers
composed of thirty-three varts; and thc empire Indeed, Mr
President, I think it will be wise embraces, instead of only four million, no 'less to discard two prevalent ideas or prejudices, than thirty million inhabitants
namely: first, that the Union is to be savcd by The founders of the Constitution moreover somebody in particular; and secondly, that it is rcgarded the IJnion as no mere national 01' Amer- to be saved by somc cunnino• and insincere com- ican interest
On the; contrary, they confessed pact of pacification

Foreign wars come from either violations of tteaties or domestic violence
The- Union has, thus far, proved: itself an almost perfect shield acrainst such wars
The United StateS, continu- ally enlarging their diplomatic acquaintance, have now treaties with Ffance, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Sweden, Prussia,' Spain, Russia, Den- mark, Mexico, Brazil, Austria, Turkey, Chili, Siam, - Muscat, Venezuela, Peru, GreeCe, Sar- dinim Ecuador, Hanover, Portugal, New Gran- add, Hesse Cassel, Wti•temburg, China, Bava- ria, Saxony, Nassau , Switzerland, Mecklcn burg- Schwérin, Gliåtemala, the Hawaian Islands, San Salvador, Borneo, Costa Rica, Peru, Bremen, the Argentine' Confederation, Loo Choo, Japan, Brmiswick, Persia, Baden, Belgium, and Para- guay
Nevertheless, the Unite-d States, within their entire existence under the Federal Constitu- tion, have had flagrant wars with only four States, two of which were insignificant Powers, on the coast of Barbary, and have had direct hostilities, amounting to reprisals, acrainst only two 01' three more; and they are now at peace with the wholc world
Ifthe Union should be divided into only two Confederacies, each of them would need to make as many treaties as we have now; and, of course, would be liable-to as many causes of waf as _we now do
But we know, from the sad experience of other natipns, that disinterra- tionj once begun, inevitably continues until even the greatest empire crumbles into many parts
Each Confederation that shall ultimately arise out of the min of the Union will have necessity for as many treaties as we now have, and will Incur liabilitiés for war as often as we now do, by breaking them
It is the multiplication of treaties, and the want of confederation, that makes wrar the normal condition of society in Western Etu•opc and in Spanish America
It is union that, notwithstand ing oar world -wide i n tercou tse makcs peace the habit of the American people
I will not descend so low as to ask whcthcr new confederacies would be able or willing to bear the grievous expense of maintaining the diplo- matic relations which cannot be dispensed with except by withdrawing from foreign commerce
Our Federal Government is better able to avoid givine.r just causes of '*ar than scvcral confedera- cics, because it can conform the action of ali the Statos to compacts
It can have only one con- struction, and only one tribunal to pronounce that construction, of every treaty
Local and tempo- rar',r interests and passions, or personal cupidity and ambition, can drive small confederacies States more casily than a great Republic into in- discreet violations of treaties
The United States bcingagreatand formidable Power, can illways secure favorable and satisfac- Indeed, every treaty we have was tory treaties
voluntarily made
Small confedcracies or States must take such treaties as they can get, and give whatever treaties arc exacted
A humiliating, or even an unsatisfactory treaty, is a chronic cause of foreign war
Thc chapter of wars resulting froin unjustifi- ablc causes would, in case of division, amplify itself in proportion to the ntuubcr of new con- fcderacies and their irritability
Our disputes with Great Britain about Oregon, thc boundary of MaiNe, the patriot insurrection in Canada, and the Island Of San Juan; tho border strifes be- tween Texas and :Mexico, the incursions of the late William Walker into Mexico and Central America; all these were cases in which war was prevented only by the imperturbability of the Federal Government
' r his Government not only gives fewer causes of war, whether just or unjust, than smaller con- federacies would; but it always has a greatcr ability to accommodate them by the exercise of more coolness and courage, the use of more vari- ous and morc liberal means, and the display, if need bc, of greatcr force
Every one knows how placable we ourselves arc in controversies with Great Britain, France, and Spain; and yet how wre have been in our intercourse with New Granada, Paraguay, and San Juan de Nic- aracrua
all the materials and all the forces (if •the several States; organizes their defenses on one general principle;-harmonizcs and assimilates them with onc system; watches for them with a single eye, which it turns in all directions, and moves all agents under the control of one executive heäd
A nation so constituted is safe against assault or even insult
War produces always a speedy exhaustion of money and a severe strain upon credit
The treasuries and credits of small confederacies would often prove inadequate
Those of the Union are always ample
I have thus far kept out of view the relations which must arise between the confederacies them- selves
They would be small and inconsiderable nations bordering on each other, and therefore, according to all political philosophy, natural ene- mies
In addition to the many treaties which each must make with foreign Powers, and the causes of war which they would give by violating them, each of the confederacies must also maintain treaties with all the others, a•nd so be liablc to give them frequent offense
They would necessarily have different interests resulting from their cstab- lishment of different policies of revenue, of min- in«r, Inanufactures, and navigation, of immim•a- tion, and perhaps the slave trade
Each would stipulate with foreign nations for advantages peculiar to itself and injurious to its rivals
If, indeed, it were necessary that the Union should be •broken up, it would be in the last de- gree important that the new confederacies to be formed should be as nearly as possible equal in strength and power, that mutual fear and mutual respect might inspire them with caution acainst mutual offense
But such equality could not long be maintained; onc confederacy would rise in the scale of political importance, and lhc othcrs woul(l view it thenceforward with envy and ap- prehension
Jealousies would bring 01) frequent and retaliatory wars, and all these wars, from the peculiar of the confederacies, would have thc nature and character of civil war
Dissolution, therefore, is, for the people of this country, perpetuat civil war
To niitigatc it, and obtain occasional rest, what else could they acccpt but the system of adjusting the balance df power which has obtained in Europe, in which the few strong nations dictate the very terms on which all the others shall bc content to live
When this hateful system should fail at last, for- ei•n nations would intervene, now in favor of one and then in aid of another; and thus our country, having cxpelled all European Powcrs from the continent, would relapse into an aggregated form of its colonial cxperience , and , like Italy, Turkey, India, and China, become the theater of transat- lantic intervention and rapacity
I r, however, wc grant to the now confederacies an exemption from cornplications amon-«y cach other and with foreign States, still there is too much reason to believe that not one of them could lone maintain a republican form of government
Universal suffrage and the absence of a st.and- ing aril) y are essential to the republican system
T hc world has yet to sec a singlc self-sustaining State of that kind, or even any confederation of such States, except our own
Canada leans on Great Britain not unwillingly, and Switzerland is guarantied by interested Inonarchical States
Our I own experiment has thus fat' becn successful; bo- cause, by the continual addition of new States, the influencc of cach of the nM2mbers of the Union is constantly rcstraincd and reduced
No one, of i course, can foretell the way and manner of travel ; but history indicates with unerring certainty the I end which thc several confederacies would Secondly
The disunion movementarises partly qut ofa dispute over the common domain of the United States
Hitherto the Union has confined this controversy within the bounds of political debate by referring it, with alt other national ones, to the arbitrament of the ballot-box
Does any one suppose that disunion would transfer the whole domain to either party, or that any other umpire than war would, after dissolution, be invoked 
Thirdly
This movement arises, in another view, out bf the relation of African slaves to the domestic population of the coun try
Freedom is to them, as to all mankind, the chief object of desire
Hitherto, under the operation of the Union, they have practically remaSned ignorant of the controversy, especially of its bearing on themsel ves
Can we hope that flagrant civil war shall rage among ourselves in their very presence, and yet that they will remain stupid and idle spec- tators
Does history furnish us any satisfactory instruction upon the horrors of civil war
among a people so brave, so skilled in arms, so earnest in conviction, and so intent in purpose, as we are 
Is it a mere chimera whibh suggests an aggrava- tion of those horrors beyond endurance when, on cither side, there shall occur the intervention 01 an uprising ferocious African slave population 01 four, or six, perhaps twenty million
T hc opinions of mankind change, and with them the policies of nations
One hundred years all the commercial European States were encaged in transferring negro slaves from Africa to this hemisphere
To-day all those States are firtnly set in hostility to the extension and even to the practice of slavery
Opposition to it takes two forms: one European, which is simple, direct ab- olition, effected, if need bc, by compulsion; the other A Inerican, which seeks toarrest the African slave trade
and resist the entrance of domestic slavery into Territories where it is yet unknown, while it leaves the disposition of existing slavery to the considerate actton of the States by which it is retained
It is the Union that restricts the opposition to slavery in this country within thcse limits
Ifdissolution prevail, what guarantee shall there be against the full development here of the fearful and uncompromising hostility to slavery w hich elsewhere pervades the world, and of which tbc recent invasion of Virginia was an illustra- lion 
Mr
President, I have designedly dwelt so long on tl'le probable effects of disunion upon the safety of the American people as to leave me little time to consider the other evils which must follow i)
its train
But practically, the loss of safety in volvcsevery otherform of public calamity
When once the guardian angel has taken flight, every thing is lost
Dissolution would not only arrest, but extin- guish the greatness of our country
Even if sep- urate confederacies could exist and endure, they could severally preserve no share of the common prestige of the Union
If the constellation is to be broken up, the stars, whether scattered widely apart or grouped in smaller clusters, will thcnce- forth shed forth feeble, glimmering, and lurid lights
Nor will great achievemel')ts be possible for the new confederacies
Dissolution would signalize its triumph by acts of wan tonness which would shock and astound the world
It would provincialize Mount Vernon and give this Capi- tol over to desolation at the very moment when thc dome is rising over our heads that was to be crowned with the statuc of Liberty
• After this there would remain for disunion no act of stupen- dous infamy to be committed
No petty confed- eracy that shall follow the United States can pro- Licentiousness would render life intolerable; and long,orevenrcncw, the majesticdrama of national they would sooner or later purchase tranquillity progress

No; election by universal suffrage, as modified by the Consti- tutioh, is the one crowning franchise of the Amcri- can people
To savcitthey would defy the world
Is it apprehendcd thatthc new President will usurp despotic powers.' No; while he is of all men the most unambitious, hc is, by the partial success of those who opposed his election, subjected to such rcstraints that he cannot, without their consent, appoint a minister or even a policc agent, ncoo• tiate a treaty, or procure the passage of a law, and can hardly draw a musket from the public arse- nals to defend his owrn person
What, then, is the ground of discontent
It is that the disunionists did not accept as conclusive the arguments whicl'i were urged in behalf of the successful candidate in the canvass
This is all
W cre their own arguments against him more sut- isfactory to his supporters
Of course they were not; they could not be
Does the Constitution, in letter or spirit, require or imply that the argu- ments of onc party• shall be satisfactory to the other
No; that is impossible
What is the con- stitutional remedy for this inevitable dissatisfac- tion
Renewed debate and ultimate rehearing in a subsequent election

No; they havc never before held power

Men ask, Who is the stranger that thus steals into Our waters." The answer contemptously given is, She comes from one of the obscure republics of North America
Let her pass on." Lastly, '_)ublic liberty, our own peculiar libcrty, , and then ceasc to live
And such a liberty! free movement cvorywhere through our own land und throughout the world; free speech, free press, free suffrage; the freedom of' every subiect
to on every law, and for or twainst every acrent who expounds, administers, or executes
Unstable and jealous confederacies, constantly apprehending assaults without and treason within, formidable only to each other and contemptible to ail beside: how long will it be be- fore, on the plea of public safety, they will sur- render all this inestimable and unequaled liberty, and accept the hateful and intolerable espionage and blessings
How gladly, how proudly, would the people of any na!ion in Europe accept, on such terms as we enjoy it, the boon of electing a Chief Magistrate every four years by free, equal, and univcrsal suffrage! How thankfully would they cast aside all their own systems of govern- ment, and accept this Republic of ours, with all its shortcomin as and its disappoin tmen ts, maintain il with their arms, and cherish it in their hearts
Is it not the very boon for which tl'ley supplicate God without ceasinc, and even wa(re war, with intermissions only resulting from exhaustion
How stran«re are the times in which we live! The coming spring season, on one side of the Atlantic, will open on a general conflict, waged to obtain, through whatever indirection, just such a system as ours; alid on this side of the Atlantic, within the same paraklels of latitude, it will open on fraternal war, waged in a moment of frenzied discontent to overthrow and annihilate the same institutions
Do men, indeed, live only for them- selves, to revenge their own wron«s, or to gratify their own ambition
Rather do not men live least of all for themselves, and chiefly for pos- terity and for their fellow-men 
Have the Amer- ican people, then, become all o

and will they disinherit their children of the precious estate held only in And now, Mr

No; the Federal Union is less conducive to the welfare and great- ness of those States than a smaller confederacy, Government smiles more benignantly, and works embracing only slave States, would be, This to day more beneficently than ever
The Consti- class has availed itself of the discontents result- tution is even the chosen model for the I ing from the election to put into operation the tion of the newly rising confederacies
machinery of dissolution long a-oo prepared- and waiting only fi)r occasion
In otter States there is a soreness because of the want of sympathy in the free States with the efforts of slaveholders for the recapture of fugitives from servicm -'In -all the slave States there is a restiveness.resulting from the resistance which has been so determ- inedly made within the lust few years, in thefree States, to the extension of slavery in the common Territories of the
United States
The Republiéan party, which cast its votes for the successful pres- Idential candidate on the ground of that policy, has been allowed, practically, no representation, no utterance by speech or through the press, in the slave States; while its policy, principles, und sentiments, and even its temper, have been so misrepresented as to excite apprehensions that it denies important constitutional obligations, and ai ms even at interference with slavery and its over- throw' by State authorities or intervention of the Federal Government
Considerable masses oven in the free States, interested in the success of these misrepresentations as a means of partisan-strat- egy, have lent their sympathy to th&party claim- ing to be aggrieved
While the result of the election brings the Republican party necessarily into thc foregroundin resisti ng disunion , the preju- dices against them which I have described have deprived them of the coöperation of many good and patriotic citizens
On a complex issue be- tween the Republican party and the disunionists, although it involves the direst national calamities, the result might be doubtful: for the Republican party is weak in a large part of the Union
But on a direct issue, with all who cherish the Union on one side, and all who desire its dissolution by force on the other, the verdict would be prompt and almost unanimous
I desire thus to simplify the issue, and for that purpose to separate from it all collateral qucstions, and relieve itofall par- tisan passions and prejudices
I consider the idea of the withdrawal of the Gulf States, and their permanent reorganization with or without others in a distinct Confederacy as a means o
advantage to themselves, so cer- tainly unwise and so obviously imposiiblc of ex- ccution, when the purpose is understood, that I dismiss it with the discussion I have already incidentally bestowed upon it
The case is different, however, in regard to the other subjects which I have brought in this con- nection before the Senate
Beyond a doubt, Union is vitally important to
the Republican citizens of the United States; but it is just as important to the whole people
Re- publicanism and Union are, therefore, not con- vertible terms
Republicanism is subordinate to Union, as everything else is and ought to be— Republicanism, Deniocracy, every other politi- cal name and thing; all are subordinate—and they ought to disappear in the presence of the great question of Union
So far as 1 am con- cerned, it shall be so; it should be so if the question were sure to be tried as it ought only to be determined, by the peaceful ordeal of the It shall bc so all the more since there ballot
is on one side preparedness to refin• it to the arbi- tramcnt of civil war
I have such fait.h in this republican system ot• ours, that there is no polit- icai good which I desire that i am not content to seek through its peaceful forms of administration without invoking revolutionary action
If others shall invoke that form of action to oppose and overthrow Government, they shall not, SD far as it depends on me, have the excuse that obsti- natcly left myself to be misunderstood
In such a case I can affotd to meet prejudice with concil- iation, exaction with conccssjon which surren- ders no principle, and violence with the right hand of peace
Thereforevsir, so far as the abstract question whether, by the Constitution of the Uni• ted States, the bondsman, who is made such by the laws of a State, is still a man or only prop- erty,i answer that, within that State, its laws on that subject are supreme; that when he has es- caped from that State into another, the Constitu- tion regards him asa bondsman who may not, by any law' ot• regulation of that State, be discharged from his service, but.shali be delivered up,on claim, to the party to whom his service is due
While prudence and justice would combine in persuad- ing you to modify tbe acts of Congress on that subject, so as not to oblige private persons to as
sist•iu their execution, and to protect freemen from
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January '12; INDIAN DEPREDATIONS IN OREGON
being; by abuse of-the laws, carried into slavery, I agree •that all laws of OheStates, whether freé States or'slave States, which - relate to this class of persons, or any Others recently •coming from or reSident
in other States, and xvhich
laws con- travene the Constitution of the United, States, or any law of Congress passed in conform ity thereto , ought to be repealed
Secondly
Experience in publicäffairs has con- firmed my opinion, that domestic slavery, exist- ing in any State, is wisely left by the Constitu- tiOn of the United States exclusively to the care, management, and disposition of that State; and if itzwere in-my power, i would not alter the Con- stitution in that respect
if misapprehension of mysposition needs so stronø a remedy, I am x.vill- ing to vote for an amendment of the Constitution, declaring that it shall not, by any future amend
ment,- be so altered as to confer on Congress a power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any State
Thirdly
While I think that Congress has exclusive and sovereign authority to legislate on all subjects whatever, in the common Territories of the United States; and while I certainly shall never, directly or indirectly, give my vote to es- tablish or sanction slavery ill such Territories, or anywhere else in the world, yet the ques- tion what constitutional laws shall at any time be passed:in regard to the Territories, is, like every other
question, to be determined on practical grounds
I Voted for enabling acts in the cases of Oregon, Minnesota, and Kansas, without being able to secure in them such provisions as I would have preferred; and yet I voted wisely
So now, I am well satisfied that, under existing circumstances, a happy and satisfactory solu- tion of the diffculties in the remaining Territo- ries
would be obtained by similar laws, pro- viding {Or their orcanization, if such orgal)fza- tion werc otherwise practicable
If, therefore, Kansas were admitted as a State, under the Wy- andotte constitution, as I think she ought to be, and if the organic laws of all the other "Ilerrito- ries could be repealed, could vote to authorize the organizalion and admission of' two new States Which shotid include them, reserving the right to effect subdivisions of them whcnever necessary into several convcnicnt States; but I do not find that such reservations could be constitutionally made
Without them, the ulterior embarrass- ments 'Which would result from the hasty incor- porution of States of such vast extent and various nnterests and character would outweigh all the im-mediate advantages of such a measure
But if the measure were practicable, I should prefer a different course, namely: when the eccentric movements of secession and disunion shall have ended, in whatever form that end may come, and the angry excitements of the hour shali have sub- Bided, and calmness once more shali have resumcd its accustomed-sway over thc public mind, then, and not until then—one, two, or three years hence —l should cheerfully advise a convention of the people, to be assemKled in pursuance of the COn• stitution, to consider and decide whether any and what amendments of the ot•cranic national law ought to be made
A Republican now—as I have heretofore been a member of other parties exist- ing in my day—I nevertheless hold aud cherish, as -I have always done, the principle that this Government exists in its present iOrtn only by the consent, of the governed, and that it is as ne- cessary as it is wise, to resort to the people for re- visions of the organic law when the troubles and dangers of the State certainly tran*cend the pow- ers äelegated by it to the public authorities
Nor ought the sucrgcst.ion to excite surprise
Govern- ment in any foi•m is a machine; this is the most complex one that the mind of man has evcr in- vented, or the hand of man has ever framed
Per- fect as it is, it ought to be expected that it will, at least as often as once' in a century, require some modification to adapt it to the changes of society and alternations of empire
Fourthly
I hold myself ready now, as always heretofore, to vote for any properly-guarded laws which shall be deemed necessary to prevent mu- tual in vasions of States by citizens of other States, and punish those who Shail aid and abet them
Fifthly
Notwithstanding the arguments of the gallant Senator from Oregon, [General LANE,] 1 remain of the opiniov_
that physical bonds, such as highways, railroads, rivers, and canals, are 5 vastly more- powerful for hoiding civil commu- nities- together than any mere covenants, though written on parchment or evraved upon iron
remain,'therefore, constant to my purpose to se- cure, if possible, the construction of tw.o Pacific railways, one of which shall connect thé ports around the mouths of the Mississippi, and the other the towns on the Missouri and the Lakes, with the harbors on our western coast
If, in the expression of these views, I have not proposed what is desired or expected by many others, they will do me the justice to believe that I am as far from having suggested what in many respects would have been in harmony with cher- fished convictions of my own
I learned early from Jefferson, that in political affairs x.ve cannot always do what seems to us absolutely best
Those '.vith whom we must necessarily act, enter- taining different views, have the power and the right of carrying them into practice
We must be content to lead when we can, and to follow when we cannot lead; and if we cannot at any time do for our country all the good that we would wish, wc must be satisfied with doing for her all the good that we can
Having submitted my own opinions on this great crisis, it remains only to say that I shall cheerfully lend to the Government my best sup port in whatever prudent yet energetic efforts it shall make to preserve the public peace, and to maintain and preserve the Union; advising, only, that it practice as far as possible the utmost mod- eration, forbearance, and conciliation
And now, Mr
President, what are the auspices of the country
I know that we are in the midst of alarms, and somewhat exposed to accidents unavoidal)le in seasons of tempestuous passions
We already have disorder; and violence has begun
I know not to what extent it may co
Still my faith in the Constitution and in the Union abides, because my faith in the wisdom and virtue of the American people remains unshaken
Coolness, calmness, and resolution, are elements of their character
They have been temporarily displaced; but they arc reappearincr
Soon enough, I trust, for satiety, it will be seen that sedition and vio- lence are only local and temporary, and that loy- ally and affection to the Union are the natural scnliunents of the whole country
Whatever dan- gcrs there shall be, there will be the determina- tion to meet them; whatever sacrifices, private or public, shall be needful for the Union, they will be made
I feel sure that the hour has not come for this great nation to fall
This people, which has been studying to become wiser and better as it has grown older, is not perverse or wicked enough to deserve so dreadful and severe a punishment as dissolution
This Union has not yet accom- plished •what good for mankind x,vas manifestly (lesigned by Him who appoints the seasons and prescribes the duties of States and empires
No, sir; if it werc cast down by faction to-day, it would rise a(yain and reappear in all its majestic proportions to-morrow
It is the only Government that can stand hcre
Woe! Woe! to the man that madly lifts his hand against it
It shall continue and endure; and men, in after times, shall declare that this generation, which saved the Union from such sudden and unlooked-for dangers, surpassed in magnanimity even that one which laid its foundations in the eternal principles of liberty, justice, and humanity

I want 10 make an ex- planation to the House, in order that this intelli- gence may not work mischief to the country
It may not be generally known that the post offce, sub-treasury, and custom-house in St

T hc people of Missouri have been, so far, quiet and loyal to the Union
Her Legislature is now in session, and is engaged in taking steps to redress the grievances under which we labor, and to present to the American peoplc, and to the authorities of the several States, what we regard as necessary for the perpetuity of the Union

Secretary of the Interior to make such allowance for offce rent during the temporary continuance of the land office at Vincennes, Indiana, as rnay, in his opinion, be just and proper; and that fur- ther, he be authorized to adiust thc account of CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
345 the same were in his custody, under instructions from the General Land Offce of September 3, 1858, the allowance to be paid out of the appro- priations for incidental expenses of the district land offce
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I ask the Clerk to read the letter I send up
It will fully explain the case
The Clerk read, as follows: GENERAL LAND OFFICE, March 15, 1860
SIR : I have the honor to return herewith the letter from Hon
W
E
Niblack to the chairman of the Committee of Public Lands, House of Representatives, by you for report, recornmending that an allowance be made the revister at Vincennes, Indiana, for office, rent; and also that an allowance be Inade John Moore, Esq., of Vincennes, for safe keeping the books, papers, &e., of that land district, in the interval between the closing of the land office, under the sixth section of the act of August 18, 1S56, and its re- opening under the act of December 21, 1858, (laws 11, pages 140 and 373,) and to state that, inasmuch as the continu- ancc of this office is a mere temporary matter, and the duties of both a register and receiver devolve upon the present incumbent, whose salary is fixed at $500 per annum, with certain fees, believed to amount to an inconsiderable an- nual sum, a reasonable amount for rent may properly be made
In reference to the other allowance, I have to state that the practice of this offcc, in c.ases of this kind, is to adn:it a claim tor sat-c keeping boolß and papers of district laud offces, not to exceed, at the ratc of the offeer's salary, far the timc the archives remain in possession of the person having them •in charge
Such allowance could properly have been nnade Mr
Moore ; but tor the reason that he was at the tilne postmaster at Vincennes, and in the opiu- ion of the Departrnent, as cxpressed in your letter of June 25, 1859, was not con)petent, undcr the laws, to receive compensation {Or this service
Had these books, &e., been in tl)öhands of one not holding a public office under the Governrncnt, there would have been no objection to the allmvance
Under the circumstances, am of opinion that the usual compensation should be made Mr
Moore, and sublilit herewith the draft of a bill to meet the case
VVith great respect, your obedtcnt servant, JOSEPH S
WILSON, Commissioner

 346 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 12, SHERMAN
Now 1 call for the question on
my motion that the House resolvc itself into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The question was put; and the motion was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of t.he Whole on the state of the Union, (MreCOLFRX in the chair,) and resumed thec n- sideration of the NAVY APPROP!UA'TION BILL
The- Clerk read- the first clause of the bill
Mr
COX obtained the floor, and indicated a purposcvto make a- speech
Mr
BURNETT
Before the gentleman from Ohio procecds, I think it wise to submit a ques- tion to the Chair
Mr
SHERMAN
This bill is aspecial order, and debate must be confined to the Incrits of thc Mr
BURNETT
1 want to make an inquiry .of the Chair
A gentleman on the floor attempted to make a spcech a day or two acro, and was cut off almost as soon as he commenced
Now, I want Mr
SHERMAN
Unless my colleague speaks to thc merits of thc bill, I must object
He can- not indulge in general debate
Mr
BURNETT
1 desire to ask the Chair whethe.c,
in this hour's debate, it would be in for•me, or any other gentleman upon this flböi•, to make a speech upon the present aspect of the political questions of this country, all of which would go to show that thcre ought not to bc any appropriation made for naval purposes by this Contrress 
ThcCfiAIRMAN, The Chairthinksnot
The rule adopted last session in reference to makincr special orders of appropriation bills reads as fol- lows: " In the Comtnittcc of tbc Whole on the state of the Union debate upon special orders shall bc confined strictly to the :neasure under consideration," That was intended to change the old rule, which allowed unlimited dcbate; and therefore, the Chair thinks no 'debate will be in ordcr, unless it is di- rectcd to the particular merits of the appropria- tions contained in this bill
Debatc as to whether there should be any appropriations ut all in thc Navy bill would not be in order
Mr
SHERMAN
I suppose it is understood that, after the appropriation bills arc passed, the widest latitude of' debate will be permitted
That will probably be after Monday next
Mr
COX
I will very frankly stato to the Chair that my object was to indulge in general debate
I did not intend to speak to thc specific matter of the bill now under consideration
not want to enter upon and leave any portion of it not delivered, and therefore I would like the scnsc of thc House upon this question before I coli) mence
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair would like to gratify the gentleman from Ohio; but tbc word strictly" being used in this rule for tho pur- pose of changing the old practice of allowing the widest latitude of debate, the rule must be tt(hnin- istere(i strictly
The only way the Chair can sub- mit the question to the House, is l)Ythe gentleman from Ohio appealing from the decision of the Chair, Mr
COX
I will not take an appeal in my own case, though in another case I would
-I therefore yield the floor, and will avail rnysclf of I another opportunity when this discussion will be in order
Mr
BURNETT
Now, 1 will say to the Chair that I desire to rnakc a speech, addressing itself to the aspect of the political affairs and condition of the country generally; and I desire, before I commence, to ask the Chair whether I shall bc permitted to do so
And I want to state to thc .House that my argument will go to the whole merits of this *bill
My object will be to show that the Army and Navy are, as I believe from present movements, to bc used for the purpose of i coercion against a portion of the States which have recently been in this Confederacy , but which , by their action, have placed themselves out of it; and believing that to be case, want to make an arcrument to show that no appropriation ought to i be made, either for the Army or the Navy, for I such a purpose
Mr
SHERMAN
1 make the point of order, that such- a speech would not be in order, because it is not-germane to this bill
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state to the gentlemen from Ohio and Kentucky, that he sustains the point of order made by the gentleman from Ohio, and for this reason: that were the construction to be placed upon the rule which the gentleman from Kentucky desires, the rule would be mere surplusage
That was the old •rule, which this rule was intended to change
Therefore the Chair decides that general debate is not in order
Mr
BURNETT
I appeal from the decision of the Chair
T hc question was put, Shall the decision of the Chan• stand as the judgment of the commit- And it was decided in the affrmative
So thc decision of the Chair •wras sustained
The Clerk read the next clause of the bill, as follows: For pay of commission, warrant, and petty odiccrs and scalncn, including the engineer corps of the Navy, $4,438,577." Mr
PRYOR
1 move to strike out the lines seven, eight, nine, and ten, including the chief appropriation to the naval service
Mr
Chairman, so long as the American Navy was engaged in the lawful and beneficent enter- prise of p-rotecting tbc interests of commerce, cn- larging the boundaries of discovery, and main- taininx the honor of our flag against foreign at- tack, I voted toaccord it a generous support
But now, sir, when it is to bc employed for the inhu- man purpose of subjugrating sovereign States, and imposing the yoke of miliiary despotism upon a people who arc guilty of no other crime than a gallant resistance to wrong and oppression, I would sink it in the abyss of ocean before I I would erant ita farthing
A bulwark of national defense, it invokes the nation's gratitude; the dread instru)nent of death and desolation in fratri- cidal strife, it deserves the nation 's execration
'l'o In y Illind, the n•ost disastrous portent •of these unhappy times is the obvious and absolute, prevalence of the military temper in the councils of the Administration
An imbecile Executive has fallen under the ascendency of an aspirino• soldier, and the country is ruled •by a " Mayor of the Palace.' The arts of statesmanship are no longer applied in the solution of political diflicul- ties; but the sword is cast into the balance of sec- tional controversy
Instead of messengers of con- g.iliation to a malcontent people, the Government dispatches men and munitions of '.var to constrain obedience to an obnoxious sway
Though no foreign fool treads the soil of America witli hos- tile •purpose, troops are distributed and concen- trated as if to repel imminent invasion
Mr
SHERMAN
Irise to point of order
I have listened to the remarks of the gentleman fron) Virginia, and I cannot see that they are in order
Mr
PRYOR
If gentleman will allow mc I will conclude in a inotnent
Mr
SHERMAN
1 hope the gentleman will I confine his remarks to what is apt-n•opriate to his amendtnentr, and not
press them beyond that
[Mr
DAVIDSON, from Committee on Ern-ollcd Bills, here reported as truly enrolled an act the relief of Hockaday & Liggit; when the Speaker sixned the s:une.] The CHAIRMAN
Docs from Ohio ill.sist upon his point of order
Mr
SHERMAN
1 waive it in hope that the gentlemaii fl•mn Virginia will confine his re- Inarks within what was understood to be the dc- cision of t.he Chair awhile ago
Mr
PRYOR
If the gentleman from Ohio v.'ill I allow me, I will confine myself rigorously and logically to tbe question raised by my amend- I was saying, Mr
Chairtnan, that al- though no foreign foot treads the soil of America wit.h unfriendly purpose, yet troops are distrib- u ted and concentrated as if to resist imminent in- vasion
Forts arc ryarrisoned with the avowed purpose of overawinc sovereign States; and, even In this District, masses of mercenaries are ac- • cumulating to inaugurate the President of the people in blood
A salutary principle of an- tique liberty forbade the presence of a commis- sioned general within the walls of Rome; but this, along Witt) all other maxims of republican free- dom, is banished from the councils of this most detestable Administration
Sir, as I am restricted within the limits of de- bate pertinent to the amendment 1 have proposed, I will conclude by availing myself of the occasion to cive warning to the people of Virginia that a plan is maturing, and preparations are making, to subject them to- Federal tyranny by the compul- Sion of force, and to implore them, by every con- sideration of safety and oi' honor to concert prompt and adequate measm•es of resistance
For myself, I will discharge my duty herb by opposing every appropriation for the support of an Army and Navy that are to be employed in this unhallowed enterprise
Mr
CLEMENS
Mr
Chairman, 1 should be unjust to myself; I believe I should be unjust to the people of Virginia, if the Inflammatory re- marks of my colleague passed this House unre- buked; and standing here, as I do, on terms of equality with him, representing a district which, in case of a conflict of arms, is thrown upon a defenseless border, I appeal to him to know whether— Mr
GARNETT
Mr
Chairman, I call upon you to enforce thc rulcs of order upon that mem- ber from Virginia
You ruled my colleague [Mr
PRYOR and myself out of order
Mr
cKNIGHT
Turn about is fair play
I hope the gentleman from Virginia wili be allowed to proceed
Mr
GARNETT
Iknow thathe will receive aid from the Black Republicans; but I call him to order
Mr
PRYOR
My colleague will allow me a moment to make a sug«ycstion
If the House will do my colleague [Mr
the courtesy to let Iliin speak, and me the courtesy to allow me to reply to him, I shall be content
Mr
GARNETT
I will waive the point of order on that condition
Mr
HIN DMAN
Let that be the understand- WII•
SHERMAN
1 will not make myself a party to any understanding which will tie my hands in enförcing the rules of the I-louse
1 hope gentletncn will confine themselves within the rules of the House in thc discussion of this bifl, and next week we shall have a general field of debate, and' I hopc we shall all have a chance to partici- pate in it
Mr
PRYOR
I trust my colleague near me will withdraw his objection
Mr
GARNETT
1 withdraw it
Mr
HINDMAN
1 renew the objection
Mr
HILL
The Chairman— The CHAIRMAN
The from ansas raised a point of order
Does he insist Mr
HINDMAN
1 do; but with the under- standing that the gentleman from Virginia, who first spoke, shall have an opportunity to respond to his colleague, I will not Insist upon the point of order
If that be denied, I will insist upon it
Mr
HILL
I object to any such understand- ing being made
The kind perspnal feeling which I entertain toward thc member from Virginia, who was first up, [Mr
PRYOR,] induced me to refrain fron-l during his remarks
can perceive that membct•s upon the other Sidc of the House are quite as ready for this kind of de- batc as the gentlernan from Virginia or any other man the South, however ardent he may be
It lids been nay policy from first to last to interpose obieccioh to- inflammatory debate
There is spirit enough on my right, (the Reoublican side of the House,) and feeling enough to accept thc gage thrown down here
I stand here for the conserv- ative country, and against extremes anywhere
Mr
HINDIVIAN
1 the gentleman from Georgia to order
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from Georgia is not in order in debating the point of order
Mr
LEACH, of North Carolina
He is talk- inm very wcll
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair thc point of order; and any gentleman who is dissat- isfied with the decision can take an appeal
Mr
HILL
I was merely interposing my ob- jection, sir, to any such understanding as that proposed by the gentleman from Arkansas
The CHAIRMAN
The first gentleman from Virginia who spoke, evidently went beyond the decision of tho Chair, which was sustained by i the committee
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr
 1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
SHERMAN] raised that question of order; butas the point of order was not pressed, the Chair allowed the gentleman to proceed—it being evidently by unanimouscönsent
Very certainly the language of the gentleman from Virginia in regard to the Ad- ministration and thc Navy was not legitimate to the Army appropriation bill; but as the point of order was not pressed, the Chair allowed the gentleman to proceed
But the point of order being now made upon the other gentleman from Virginia, [Mr
CLEMENS,] the Chair is compelled to sustain it, and decides that the gentleman 's re- marks are not in order, and that he cannot be allowed to proceed
Mr
GARNETT
Permit me to remind the Chair and the committee, that my colleague [Mr
PRYOR] desisted the moment the point of order was made and decided against him
Mr
HILL
Let me remark, in justice to my- self, that I should not object if the colloquy was to be confined to the t.wo gentlemen from Virginia, and not to take the wide latitude which I believe it would take
Mr
HINDMAN
1 again call the gentleman to ordér
Mr
HILL
That is all I wished to say
The CHAIRMAN
Debate is not in order
The question was taken on Mr
PRYOR's amend- ment; and it was not agreed to
Mr
PHELPS
I offer thc following amend- mcnt to come in at the end of the tenth line: Provided, That if tho monthly pay due any of the war- rant and petty offcers and seamen of the Navy shall remain unpaid for more than three months at any time after tbc date, of the approval of this act, said oflicers and scanæn shall be entitled, on demand, to receive their discharge
Mr
SHERMAN
I raise a point of order on It is legislation, and is there- that amendment
fore not in order
Mr
PHELPS
I have a word to say in re- spect to the point of order
The clause under con- sideration appropriates the pay for the offccrs of the Navy, and also for the warrant and petty offcers and seamen of the Navy
At the present time the warrant and petty offcers and seamen of the Navy are enlisted for a term of three years, and are not entitled to their discharge till they have served that period of time
The Treasury I expectit will of the United States is bankrupt
continue bankrupt for some time to come
And I am unwilling that these men, who are thus en- listed into the service, and who have families at home, shall not be continued in service if the pay duo them by the Government of the United States is not paid them at least every three months
My amendment, therefore, proposes, that if the monthly pay due the seamen of your Navy Shall not be paid to them every three months, they shall, if they desire it, receive their discharge
Such a provision is properand right, and isa lim- itation on the appropriation contained in the clause
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order of the gentleman from Ohio
T hc proposition of the gcntleman from Missouri may bc a very judicious one; but as there is no pro- vision of law authorizing it, and as the enlistment is for a term of years, this would be a change of the existing law, and thereforc cannot be received as an amendment to an appropriation bill
Mr
PHELPS
I must submit to the decision of the Chair
Mr
MORSE
I move to amend by striking out the following proviso: Provided, That not more than $5,000 shall hereafter be expended in any navy-yard in the
repair of any vessel until the necessity of such repair, and the probable cost thereof, is ascertained by the report of a board of not less than three officers of the Navy, with such one of tho naval construc- tors as the Department may designate ; and that it shali be the duty of the Secretary to cause a €urvey to be made by a board of naval officers, in connection with a naval con- structor, of the sailing vessels of the Navy, to ascertain which of thern can profitably be fitted up with auxiliary steam power ; and that, in the expenditure ot' the money hereby appropriated, he shall, so far as the same may be applied to sailing vessels, empioy the same, as far as prac- ticable, in supplying such vessels with auxiliary steam are necessary, and estimate the cost thereof.- The law, as it now stands, puts the business into the right hands—into the hands of men who under- stand it
But this proviso proposes to change that practice, and to put the survey into the hands of a board of naval officers, to consist of three offcers and one constructor
Now, what would be the effect of that
There may bc in the board one commander who has had some experience, one lieutenant, and perhaps a midshipman
They go on and examine the hull of the vessel, the plank- ing, the deck, the frame work, to see how much is in a state of decay, and what repairs will be necessary
These are not the right kind of men to make such a survey
You have in each of your navy-yards a constructor, to whom you pay $2,600 a year, and master-workmen at a salary of $1 ,200 each ; responsible men, and best qualified to perform such a task
The repairing ofa ship is a mechanical business
It is the duty of offcers of the Navy to sail and take care ofa vessel, and to fight her; but not to repair her
This proviso takes the work out of the hands of practical work- men, and puts it into the hands of omcers who know nothingaboutit
I want to continueit where it is
The present practice works well
I am informed at the Department that it works admi- rably—much better than the old practice did
If it be necessary to repair an engine, and to spend five or ten thousand dollars upon it, would you send to examine it a young lieutenant
He may understand the duties of his rank very well, and know nothing about machinery
A commander may understaßd his business perfectly, and yet not be competent to judge of an encine

Would you not ratherscnd yourchicfcngineer, yourmas- ter-workmen in the machine shop, to examine and I see what repairs are necessnry
Why, certainly, I trust, therefore, that there will be no diff- sn•
culty in striking out t.his proviso; because Icon- sider it as degrading to the mechanics in your navy-yards, inasmuch as it takes from them the control of the business which they understand, and gives it to those who, of necessity, know nothing about it
Mr
SHERMAN
1 trust the amendment of my friend from Maine will not be adopted, for this reason: formerly, there wcrc large amounts cxpendcd on old hulks in the Navy, without any previous examination, or the report of any board
In one case there was from fifty to onc hundrcd thousand dollars spent on the repairs of a vessel which, after the repairs, was not worth as much
as they cost
A similer proviso to that now pro- posed was adopted two years acro; and I was in- formed the other day by the head of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, that it operated well, and saved a large sum by preventing expenditures on vesscls that were not worth repairs
therefore, the proviso will not be stricken out
I wish toesay one word in reply Mr
MORSE
to my friend from Ohio
If this proviso be struck out, it will leave in operation the proviso which my friend says has been found to work so well
I agree with him that it is desirable to prevent the useless expenditure of money which took place under the old system
Mr
SHERMAN
The proviso by my friend from Maine last year, expired with the year; and therefore the phraseology in this one If this pro- i differs, so as to make it
continuous
viso be not similar to that one, I am perfectly willing to make it similar, only to extend its op- cration generally
Mr
MORSE
1 was informed at the Depart- ment that if this proviso svcre not inserted, the present practice, under the proviso offered by mc 1 therefore, in last session, would be continued
accordance with my friend 's suo•ffcstion, proposc to substitute the proviso of last ycat• for this one
i I therefore withdraw my amendment; and I now move to amend by striking out the proviso, and inserting the followinrr: Prouidcd, That not more than $3,000 shali hereafter bc expended at any navy-yard in repairing the hull and spars of any vessel, until the necessity and expediency of such power
This proviso proposes a change in the mode of repair, and the probable cost thereot•, be ascertained and re- surveying a vessel for repairs after her return from ported to the Navy Department by an examining board, to sea
'I'hepresentpractice, undcra proviso adopted be appointed by the Secretary of the Navy, the naval con- last sessnon, is, that when a ship returns from a structor of the yard where any vessel may be ordered fbr voyage and needs repairs tl"iatwill cost repairs, and two master workmen of such yard, or one ter-workman and an engineer or the Navy, according to tuc she is examined by a surveying party, consisting of one offcer of the Navy, one constructor, and engineer to be designated by the head of the Bureau of Con- two master-workmen, who are to sec what repairs II struction and Repairs; and not more than $1,000 be i expended in repairs on- the sails i.ai)d rigging of
any vessel until the expediency and neceSsityogsugh estimated cost thereof, have -been asbeitåined and reported to the Navy Department, by an examining board, to be composed of one naval officer, to be appointed-by tbd See- retary of the Navy, and the master-rigger aqd master-gau- maker of the yard where such vessel may be, ordered
The question was taken; and the amendment was agi•eed to
Mr
FLORENCE
1 move the following amendment: -and provided further, That the ealary of clerks of yards •and clerks to commandants at the navy-yards at Pen- saeola, Norfolk, Philadelphia, New York, Kittery, and Boston, shall be the same as is paid to persons holding the same positions and performing the same duties at the Washington navy-yard; to take effect on- and after -Juiy I, in tbc year 1856
Mr
Chairman, I sincerely trust my amend- ment will be adopted
It is a just one
Mr
SHERMAN
Is that amendment recom- mended by the Committee on Naval Affairs
If it is, will not make a point of order on it
Mr
FLORENCE
it on my own mo- tion
Mr
SHERMAN
Then 1 object to it
lun- derstand that the Committee on Naval Affairs have considered this matter, and are prepared to subrnit an amendment
To that amendment I will not object
Mr
FLÖRENCE
I do not desire to press any mnendment before the committee when it is out of order
But I appeal to the gentleman not to make a point of order on my amendment
If he will look into the subject, he will be safisfied that it is manifestly just
If I had the opportu- nity now, I could convince the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, as Well as the members of the committee, that we
owe it to justice at once to adopt the amendment I have su bmifted
The CHAIRMAN
Debate is in order on the section
Mr
FLORENCE
very well, then, 1 will say a word
In 1856 the Navy appropriation bill passed with a provision fixing tbc compensation of thc clerks at the different navy-yards at $1,200 per annum
Under that provision those clerks were paid that salary for two years and more
The Fourth Auditor of the Treasury, bccause, in his judgment, tbcrc was not in the Navy appro- priation bill ('f 1856 any clause specially repeal- mg the preceding law fixing the salary of those clerks, refused to check off $1,200 a year to each onc of them
For the years that they were paid that amount, all over what the preccding law al- lowed has been put down against them as duc to I propose that they shall be the United States
relieved from the payment of that money
They performed their services under the belief that $1,200 a year ••.vas their salary, and, indeed, as I have stated, they received it for several years
My amendment, beside doing that act of jus- tice, goes still further, and treats ali these navy- yard clerks alike, by equalizing the salary of all do not desire to debate those of equal grade
It is a meritorious -amend* the question in full
ment, and I sinccroly trust that it will be agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
1 am perfectly willing, as the Committee on Naval Affairs have acted on this subject, to waivc objection to the amcndment I make the point of order, that they wiii report
the amendment of tbc gentleman from Pennsyl- vania changes the existing law, and is therefore not in order, undcr the rules, to one of the general appropriation bills
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order, and the amendment cannot there- Mr
FLORENCE
It does not change any existing law
There is no law in reference to the salary of these clerks that I propose to change by my amendment
Mr
SHERMAN
The is mistaken
The existing law does fix the salary of these clerks at the navy-yards
I think that it fixes them too low
At the same time, I will say, that I understand the Committee on Naval Affairs have had that matter under consideration, and have matured an amendment which they will offer at the proper time
Mr
FLORENCE
That will suit me
1 am satisfied to get all the justice for these men that I can
I know when I was ou the Cömmitteö on Naval Affairs, I often tried tox have the Inatter  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 12, matured, and- finally acted- on
At' all events, Whenever I did 'present the amendment, it Was by the Same objection now interpOsed by the gentleman from Oh10
But, in apswer to the gentleman from Ohio, I must say, that I think my amendment is not open to the charge that it changes the existing law
There is no existing law, as understand It, fix- salary of, these clerks
It is fixed by an arbitrary decision of the Department
The Fourth .Auditor did not, under the law of 1856, check OIT ihe salary that is duc them; and my amendment, is for the better execution of that law, and not to ehänge it
TheCHA IRMAN
The Chairrules the amend- ment out of order
Mr
MORSE
I will state that the amendment I shall propose will legalize the paymcnts which were made to these clerks, and prevent deductions from being made from their present salary of $900 per annum
Ido not propose to raise their salary .to- what is allowed at the navy-yard in Washing- ton—some $1,400 per annum—but only to legalize what was paid to them in fbrmer years under the instructions of the Navy Department
Mr
FLORENCE
1 am willing to take that, and then get as much morc as I can
Mr
MORSE
If the gentleman pleases, whcn my amendment is before the committee, he can move his as an amendment to it
We have agreed to report all that we thought we could (Yet through
, Mr FLORENCE
I will pursue that course
Mr
COX
I move the followino• amendment: For the purchase of tbe right to use in the United States Navy, on stcaniships and propeilors, a governor to a marine steam engine, subject to thc selection of the Secretary of tho Navy, $25,000
Mr
Chairman, I speak to this amendment under some disadvnntnge
Perhapsthe House will remember that a few days axo I offered a rcso\u- tion calling for information from the Secretary of the Navy, with reference to any experiments tried in his Department concernincagovcrnor for st.ean) The report, -l know, has been marine encrines
preparcd in the Department, but whet-her it has been sent here, and is on thc Speaker's table or not, I cannot say
It ought to have been hcrc at this time
In that report, when it comes before us, it Will bc seen that, two years ago, the Navy Department tried an experiment with reference to this grcat desideratum upon our steamships and pnpcllops
Some three or four years ago the Secretary of the Navy advertised for governor to a steam murine engine, for the purpose of protecting our steam engmcs on shipboard from damage and loss in storms and shipwrecks
Undcr that advct•- tisement various experiments were tried
Among others, a young mechanic from my own district invented governor, and took out a patent for it in France and England, as well as in this country
At the request of the Secretary of the Navy, he brought it to this city and fixed it up in the navy- yard *here , IL was therc tried and found to be so valuable that ofiiccrs in charge of the navy-yard would not Ict it go
They kept it, paying the Fle had it inventor only thc price of making it
placed upon some of our steamships
It was placed upon the Pocahontas at Norfolk , and the Inventor Went with it to Cuba, to see whether it would opcratc properly
It operated well, and answered perfectly the purpose for V.,'hich it Ivas designed
It operated so handsomely as to save all •risk and danger of breakagc upon the steam- ship; and the chief engineer of the Navy wrote a rcÉort sanctionino• it as the very desideratum called for by the Secretary of tho Navy
My object in calling the attention of the conunittee to this invention is, that just remuneration may be made to the inventor
In the opinion of thc Sec- retary of the Navy it will save to thc Government the expenses incident to the use of steam cngincs in our Navy
Mr
SHERMAN
1 suggcst to my colleague to strikc out the words that the Secretary of the Navy be instructed, and provide that hc shall authorize the use of this governor, i
he deem it best and expedient to do so
Mr
COX
accept the amendment; and I hope the amendment, as modified, will be adopted
The questiori was taken; and -the amendment was agreed to
Marine Corps.—For pay of oilicers, non-e.otntnissioned ofticérs, tnusician*
privates, clerks, inesse.ngers, stewards, and servants; for rations and clothing for servants, addi- tional rations for five years' scrvice ; for undrawn clothing and rations, bounties fbr reönlistments, $425,278 80
Mr
GARNETT, 1 move reduce that ap- propriation $100,000; and I call for a division of the committee on the amendment
Mr
There is obviously no quorum present; and many of those who are here would like, I have no doubt, to go over to the Senate
I znove that the committee rise
Mr
SHERMAN
Let us first get through with this bill
However, I would not object to taking a recess for an hour
Mr
BRANCH
I insist on my motion that the committee rise
The committee divided; and there were ayes 7, noes 44; no quorum
Mr
SHERMAN
Let us go on and finish this bill; and then wre can risc and adjourn
Mr
GARNETT
1 have an speech to make on the bill; which the Chair, I know, will decidc to be pertinent; and I have also solne two or three thousand amendments to offer

CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state to the committee that he is powerless to enforce the rule requiring members to vote, unless they see fit to obey it; but the Chair would submit to the committee, and to the gentleman from Arkansas, whether he should be permitted to avail- himself of the privileges of the rules by offerincr amend- ments, when he refuses to obey the rules by vot- ing; and whether the Chair ought to receive his amendment under those circumstances
Mr
BURNETT
This committee fer upon the Chairman the power to refuse an amendment
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair has repeat- edly appealed to gentlemen to vote; but they have refused
Mr
BURNETT
But that would author- ize the Chair to exercise the power of refusing to I move that the commit- receive an amendment
tee do now rise
The motion was not agreed to
Mr
GARNETT
Bcfore the motion on the amendment is putto the committee, I am disposed to state to the committec the object of my course
I shall be brief as possible, if • Ehe committee will give me their attention
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman can pro- ceed under the five minutes rule
Mr
GARNETT
we believe that one of the oldest privileges of any parlianoentary body, es- pecially of the popular branch, according tö all the traditions of our race, both in the mother coun- try and in this, is to cut off the supplies when we believe that the Government is obnoxious to the people we represent
-w c have allowed all the other appropriation bills, as gentlemen upon the other side know, to pass through without debate and without the slightest diflic.u-lty
I venture to say that the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means will acknowledge that never in his ex- perience have the appropriation bills passed the a military despotism, and that the Army and Navy are now being used in a manner not authorized by law and not consistent with the principles even of gentlemen upon the other side of the House; and I ask the House to allow ine to show that in I a speech of the proper length
Now, if the gentleman from Ohio will say that he will open debate upon su•ch an amendment as I have indicated when the Army bill comes up, I, for one, will writhdraw all present opposition It is obvious that we of the minority to this bill
have it in our power, by offering amendments, to delay the passage of this bill, and it must become a merc question of physical endurance
I ac- knowledge that the majority, being larger, may have greater power of endurance than we have; but it must be obvious that we can worry thcm at least as much as they can worry us, and we may thus be engaged in a protracted and a useless expenditurc of time
submit to gentle- men upon the other side of the House if it would not be reasonable to allow us to debate the bill in a manner which I contend, and which I think candid minds on the other side will admit, is strictly in order, or, if not strictly in order, so nearly so as to make it perfectly fair and legitilnate
Mr
SHERMAN
Mr
Chairman, in reply to the gentleman from Virginia, I will again repeat that I do not desirc to stifle debate
When the first appropriation biil of the session was calked up, I proposed then that a reasonable time for debate should be allowed; but both sides of the House, by a decisive majority, insisted that that I have re- bill shoukd be made a special order
gtü•ded that as the will of the majority of the House, and have so acted
I have no disposition to cut off debate by the gentleman from Virginia, 01' any other mcn-lbcr of the House
Whenever the House indicates a desire to debate any bill, they can do so; but yesterday a majority, on the gentleman 's ox,vn side of the I-louse, voted to make this bill a {special order
Thc majority, not only on this side of the House, but on the other side, decided then that it was better to postpone the I debate upon the condition of thc country to a proper time—when the committee of thirty-three shall report, or when the bill* of n') y colleague, [Mr
BINGHAM,] commonly called a force bill," shall be under consideration
These appropriation bills contain no new items
They ernbrace only the ordinary appropriations for thc support of the Army and Navy; and it would have hcen necessary to pass them if no • State had attempted to secede, and there had Ijeen no disturbance in the country
They are House with so little difiiculty and with so little i trouble to the gentlemen havmg them in charge, the ordinary appropriation bills; and it seenns to or with so little
factious opposition of any kind
I that they ought not to be met with what I We come now 'to the bills for the Army and Navy
I cannot but regard as factious opposition; because, if gentlenoen will siinply perform their duty under The House •knows—everybody throughout thc country knows—that the present Administration the rules, and vote on one side or the other, we could pass this bill without difficulty, and send it proposes, and the future Administration will prob- ably propose, to use that
Army and that Navy for I to the Senate
I repeat, again, Mr
Chairman, that after this the purpose of civil war, as we call it; for the pur- pose of enforcing the laws, as they cali it; and we • bill'ahd the Ah•my bill shall have passed the House know that there will be resistance on the part of and been dent to the Senate—to the political friends certain States
And I submit to the Chair and to of the gentleman frolü Virginia—then I have no doubt there will be no objection to the widest lat- the gentleman, if it is -not really a pertinent in- itude of debate; indeed, if a majority of the House quiry—whether strictly in order on this bill or not—whether it is expedient to appropriate money are willine to allow debate on the Army bill, I to sustain an Army and Navy which will be used shall have no objection, and 1 will not move to make it a special' order unless J find that it is the for such purposes
Now, it would be perfectly m order for me—I desire of a large majority ofthe I-louse to limit the presume the Chair wiil not deny that—to movea debate to the terms of the bill
I hope
, therefore, concluding clause tb the bill, that no Fortion of the gentlornan.will withdraw his opposition to this the money hereby appropriated shall beexpended bill, or at least vote on one side or the other upon upon ships of the Navy employed for a particular amendinents
Mr
GA R NET T
acknowledge that the ma- purpose; and that would obviously open up the whole question
Gentlemen upon the other side of the Housc tell us that they are willing, during the course of the session, to have creneral debate
We, on this side of the House, tell them that we desire to have debate now
We have•reached the middle of the session, and we think it not an unreasonable priv i!ege that the minority—small though that minor- ity may be—should be permitted by the maiority to express the sentiments of our constituents, especially upon a matter which, I submit to the candor of the other side of the I louse, is so per- tinent to these bills as the question whether We will appropriate money for the Army and Navy jority of the House, which the gentiemcn oppo- site constitute, do not want debate; but I ask that majority if it is not fair that the minorit.y of the House, small though it may be, should now, in the middle of the session, be allowed an oppor- tunity to present our views on the condition of the country 
Mr
SHERLMAN
'Ehe only question is as to the point of time—whether we shall delay the ordinary business of the session for the purpose I of engæring in general debate
I Mr
GARNETT
Ifthc gentleman from Ohio will say, in behalf of his party—and everybody knows that
he is able to phylgo thorn—that on the Army appropriation bill general debate shall be or not
I arn not going into the argument now
Icon- allowed, I shall be content to withdraw all oppo- tend that this Government is being converted into sition to the bill now under consideration
Mr
SHERMAN
1 cannot promise- that Gn reference to these regular appropriation bills; but have said over and ov•er again that upon any bill of a general character which fairly presents -this question of the Condition of the country; I' have no objection to the widest latitude of-debate; in- deed, think it right that we should dB-bate, that question, and gentlemen will find that we -upon this side of the House will meet it frankly, fairly, and without equivocation
We know the duty imposed upon us by the people of the United States, and we intend to perform it in debate or elsewhere
I think we shall •have omple time for debate; the gentleman from
Virginia will, have opportunity enough to say all he desires to say in regard to the pending disputes in the country; and trust that every member of the House will have the same opportunity
If I desire to exer- cise the right of expressing my opinions, I •will exercise it
I know they will differ from those of the gentleman from Virginia; but he will find no disposition on this side of the House to avoid dé- bate or any other issue that may be presented to us by our duty, our sworn duty, here or else- where
But I trust he will allow the ordinary apprvriation bills to go through in the ordinary way, and then whenever any measure comes up which properly presents all these- disputed ques tions,'the gentleman can have debate to hisheart's content
Mr
GARNETT
1 ask the gentleman from Ohio whether it has ever been usual for this House to refuse to permit general debate on the appropriation bills 
Mr
SHERMAN
I will answer the gentle- man 's question Mr
HINDMAN
Let the gentleman from Ohio take his own course, and we will take ours
So far as I am concerned, I häve no favor to ask from him or the other side of the House, either here or—to use the gentleman's own phrase—else- where
ME
SHERMAN
1 suppose there is no sitv for any undue excitement about this matter
Mr
HINDMAN
1 say to the gentleman from Ohio that am not under the slightest excitement; and it is notin his power to create any excitement Mr
SHERMAN
1 have no desire to do any such thing
Will the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
GARNETT] be kind enough to re- peat his suggestion
Mr
GAikLNETT
I suggested to the gentleman from Ohio that it certainly is not in the ordinary course of legislation to prevent general debate on I am aware that any of the appropriation bills
we arc acting under a new- rule, and the gentle• man from Ohio avails himself of that rule to cut off debate on every appropriation bill
mit to him this: let him just piace himself in our position, and look at the matter from our point of view
Let him suppose that the Army was to be used for purposes which he regarded as unconstitutional and improper
Would not that be a fair Inotive for his refusing all appro- priations for the Army
In fact; did not the gen- tleman himself lead a movement of this very kind not six years ago 
Mr
SHERMAN
1 thank the gentleman for his suggestion
I did make such a movement; but— Mr
GARNETT
The gentleman pursued perfectly proper course, in his point of view; and now' I only ask hill) to allow us that same privi}effc of debate and of voting which he took for himself
I'vlr
SHERMAN
1 will freely acknowledge that if I believed the Arm v was to be used for unconstitutional purposes, would oppose it; but in opposing it, I would at the same time observe all tbc rules of order which govern the actidn of the House and govern the members of the House
I On the occasion when I myself offered a proviso limiting the application of the Army bill, while I earnestly advocated that proviso, and was opposed to grantino• supplies to the Army, to be used, as I believed, in an unconstitutional way, I I never, so far as I can recollect, violated the rules which require me to vote on one side or the other
Mr
GARNETT
I wish to come
to some understanding W'ith the (Tentleman from Ohio
Suppose that we, on this side, offer to the Army appropriation bill an amendment prccisely the  350 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 12, same character to that which the gentleman offered to that bill: wilt he.then refuse us the priv- ikege of showing that the purposefor which the Army is to be used is unconstitutional
Wili he, then, under a decision of the Chair, rule out all those speeches, unless they go to the particular question •of economy, or the mode of expending the money appropriated
Does he not see that such an amendment as that would, even accord- ing to his own construction, open up general de- bate 
Mr
SHERMAN
I shall onb7 state, in respect to that,- that
when I offered the amendment re- ferred to, I had no opportunity of debating it because the bill was not then in a position where it could be debated
I did not offer it until after debate had been closed on the bill; although I admit that the general subject was debated during the whole session
Mr
GARNETT
the bill had been open to debate, the gentleman would have felt himself at liberty, in offering that amendment, to go into general argument to show that the purpose for which the Army was to be used in Kansas was unconstitu tiona)
Mr
QU ARLES
I rise to a point of Order
A1} this discussion is out of order
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order, and must arrest this debate, which certainly irregular
Mr, SICKLES
Is it in order to move to amend the ponding amendment
If so, I move to amend by striking out the next word after the word " iin•ries," the word tolls." 'l'he CHAIRMAN
That amendment is in order
Mr
SICKLES
i concur entirely with what was said by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
GARNETT] as to the propriety of taking this occa- sion, or seeking it, nt all events, for the purpose of considering and discussing the Btatc of the Union
I am rec with him, that all precedents in the constitutional history of the country, and of Great Britain, from which we derive our author- ity and precedents, show the propriety of allow- in" discussion 
I think the refusal of it on an appropriation bill is quite without precedent
But, there was another remark -made by the gen- tleman from Virginia, in which I do not concur, and to which I cannot allow my assent to be even implied by my silence; and that is his inference or statement—I do not know which—that the Army and the Navy are to be employed, and are employed, by this Administration, for coercivc a sovereign State
, the President has solemnly de- clured to Congress twice, in two messages, that hc does not possess the power to employ the Army and Navy for such purpose
And, sir, I cannot agree in the statement that the President has done any act since the announcement of those proposi- t.ions to Conkrress in those two messzvres that is inconsistent with that policy or with that declara- tion
Hc is only dischargtng his sworn duty to preservc in tact, he can , the possessions of' the United States, its public buildings, its public works
It is as Inuch his duty to preserve Fort Sumter against attack from all corners, as it would be to defend this Capitol where we are deliberating patiently and assiduously on Incasures by whiclf, If' possible, we can adjust the unhappy differences between North and South— The CHAIRMAN
The Chair must this course of remark, as the gentleman has only five minutes to explain his amendment
Mr
SICKLES
1 ask to withdraw it
Mr
STANTON
1 object, as 1 desire to say a word in re 'I'hc CEIAhl(iåAN
I would state to the gen- tleman from Ohio that this dcbate cannot be con- tinued
It is not in accordance with the rule of the House, which allows a men'ibet• ofFerintr an amendiilent five minutes to explain it, and allox,vs five minutcs to any other member to oppose it
Mr
STANTON
I will only occupy a few I rccoo•nize the right ofa minority to rnomcn ts
claim a reasonable time for debate
I have been generally in a minority myself; and I find no fault with gentlemen on thc other side for settincr up 1 desire to make this suggestion to that claim
gentlemen on the other side
If they say that, havino• an ample reasonable time allowed for de- bate on the Army appropriation bill, no factious opposition shall then bc interposed, I think it I entirely proper that that time should be granted
But if, after fair time for debate has been allowed, factious opposition is still to be made, then cer- tainly the majority should not be expected to con- cede anything
Mr
SHERMAN
On consulting with some of my political friends, I am willing to say thus much for myself: that will not submit the mo- tion to make the Army appropriation bill a special order until after two or three days' debate; so that gentlemen on both sides can have full oppor- tunity to debate it
I think that, by running into night sessions, two or three days will be sum- cient to allow every gentleman who desires to speak to do so
Mr
SICKLES
say three days
Mr
SHERMAN
very well
Let it be three days
It is understood that after these three days of debate, the Army appropriation bill shall be taken up, and disposed of without any, what has been called, filibustering opposition
The question was taken on the amendment of Mr
SICKLES to the amendment; and it was not agreed to
The question recurred on Mr
HINDMAN'S amendment; and it was not agreed to
repairs of all kinds, $12,043
Mr
FLORENCE
That is the appropriation for the Philadelphia navy-yard
Fifteen thousand dollars was the amount estimated for that yard, and the Committee of Ways and Means have re- duced it to $12,043
I move that that appropria- Lion be increased to $15,000, Twelve thousand and forty-three dollars is rather a strange surrr— it is so very exact, ! Mr
HOUSTON
rlthat shows it was arrived at by close calculation
[Laughter.] Mr
FLORENCE
1 want the amount appro- priated under this item to equal that which was estirnated for this yard by the proper Departrnent
I am told that the Committee of Ways and Means have agreed to reduce the expenses of the Gov- ernment in all of its Departments
i know that
The officers who have this yard under their man- acrement, also know it; and they have coascd to make application for any repairs that are not ab- solutely needed
'I'he $12,043 here must be for some special purpose; and I would like to have that purpose named
It is so exact that it cannot be an arbitrary sum
I know, sir, that with reference to the Phila- dclphia navy-yard there are many improvcments that could be introduced in it with great benefit to the Government
•There could, fi_n• instance, be modern inachineu•y introduced; but such things are not applied for because of the system of econ- omy that has been determined upon by the Gov- I hope the appropriation will be in- ern•ment
creased to $15,000
Mr
MAYNARD
The gentleman from sylvania understands this subject better than any- body else; and I would ask him to tell us why it is necessary to I'lave the additional sum of $2,967 which he prol.)oses to udd to the tunount in the bill
Mr
FLORENCE
1 move to add it upon the cycneral principle of rio•bt— —upon the principle, sir, that would accord to the necessities of the public service what is absolutely required
I think if •wre had four times $15,000 at the Phil- adelphia navy-yard, it would all be economically and usefully expended
We would devote it to the manufacture of n')aterial necessary for naval a footin<r in respect of repairs and ilnproverncnts in machinery such as ought to be desired by the representatives ofa great and progressive nation hike this
Mr
MAYNARD
for economy; and if the gentleman will make it appear economical, I will go with him 10 increase this appropriation to #60,000
But he must first fully satisfy me of that fact
Mr
FLORENCE
Time and again 1 have put out my cfiörts to have fall justice done to the Phil- I have raised my voice for ndelphia navy-yard
economy in that yard, and for the promotion, by amendment—as little, to be sure, as I could well ask
The question was taken; and the amendment was disagreed to
Mr
FLORENCE
very well, then, let it go; but, as they said in olden times, we will look to the Senate
That body, I trust, will increase the appropriation
The Clerk read, as follows: Mare Island.—For completing machine shop, $50,000
For completing smithery, $15,000
For completing coopers' shop, $10,000
For repairs of all kinds, $20,000
Mr
BURCH
would ask the chairman ofthe Committee of Ways and Means, whether there has been any reduction by his committee from the cstimates for the navy-yard at Mare Island 
Mr
SHERMAN
1 think we "did not make any reduction upon the estimates for the Mare Island navy-yard
We allowed, if I recollect aright, one or two items not contained in the estimates on the recommendation of Commodore Smith
Mr
BURCH
1 put the question to the tleman from Ohio, because yesterday, in the bill making appropriations for the survey of the put5- lie, lands, noticed that while a reduction was made in the cases of California, Oregon, and Washington, there was no reduction made in the estimates of the Department for Kansas, Nebras- ka, and Iowa
Mr
SHERMAN
we allowed the States and Territory on the Pacific coast, more than we did for the other States and Territories
For Kansas and Nebraska together, we allowed only $20,000, while we allowed $15,000 each for Cal- lfornia, Oregon, and Washington
If there be ground forcomplaiit, it is not with the gentleman , but rather with the Delegates from Kansas and Nebraska
Mr
BURCH
There was a reduction upon the estimates in my State and for Oregon and Wash ing- ton, while there was none upon the estimates for Kansas and Nebraska
Mr
SHERMAN
If the gentleman had been present yesterday, he would have heard my ex- planation on that point
Mr
BURCH
I am sorry that I was not here
If I had been would have opposed the reduction in the egtimates for California
I was out upon the select committee of thirty-three
tried to be pres- ent when the civil bill was up, but failed to do so
I ask the gentleman whether there has been any decrease in the estimates for this Mare Island navy-yard 
Mr
SHERMAN
we have allowed more than was in the condensed estimates , and not so much as was in thc detailed estimates
For the purchase of nautical instruments for thc use of the Navy; for the repairs of' the satne, and also of astron- omical instruments ; and for the purchase ot•nautical books and niaps
Mr
FLORENCE
1 move to amend that par- agraph by adding the followinff* Pro eided, 'Phat so far as it preventB the discretion of these officers in the purchase and use of any article re- quired tör the purposes and use of the Army and Navy which Illay have been patented, the Seerctary of War and the Secretary of the Navy arc fully authorized and per- 'Nitted to make any purchases and to secure the use of any article in their judgment absolutely needed or required for the public service now ltn•bidden by the provisions of the second seetion of the
aet rnaking appropriations for sundry eivil expenses of the Government," approved June 23, 1860
Mr
SHERMAN
make a point of order on thc amend tnent
It repeals the law enacted on this subject at the last session of Congress
Mr
F'LORENCE
It merely authorizes the Secretary of tbc Navy to purcl)ase such patented articles for thc service of the Navy as may be needed
Nåutical instruments rnay he patented, and yet they are needed in the service
I think my amcndment is a proper one, and in order i attached to that paragraph
i feared that a point of order would be made on the amendment; and if the chairman of the Committee of YVays and Means, as well as the Chairman of this committee—you, Mr
Chair- i man—will look at the language of my amend- the introduction of nsefuk improvements, of the ment, they will see that it is a most ingenious way best interests Of the naval service of the United of getting around a repealing clause
[Laughter.] I deem it an amendment„which will benöfit the I have for years raised my voice in this States
House for right and truth and justice, without service"
The law of the last session, in many effect
I am not sure that I will succeed better instances, sadly interferes with the naval service
now; and I thercfore choose to adhere to Iny So the Secretary reports

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
351 The CHAIRMAN
The Chair is of the opin- ion the amendment is not in order
For preparing for publication the American Nautical Almanac, $25,880
Mr
QUARLES
1 move to reduce that ap- prc,priation to $10,000
Mr
Chairman, in looking over the estimates for getting up this American Nautical Almanac, I find, among various items, one for discover- I am per- ing new planets since 1849, $3,000." tl')at this Government should fecLly willing, sir, appropriate money for its owrn uses, but am not • willing that it should take under its protecting wing the entire universe
The book does not state which planet, or how many planets, we must pay $3,000 for
A MEMBEn
All of them
[Laughter.] Mr
QU ARLES
I think we have just enough to do to take care of not only this planet, but even of our own part of it from flying to pieces
Yet here, sir, we are asked to pay $3,000 for the dis- covery of one or more planets, and that, too, when the Government is nearly bankrupted, Nhen it has to pay twelve percent
for money
In all, the items amount to $25,000
Twenty-five thousand dollars for getting up the American Nauticål Ai- I think that is too much money; and I manac 
therefore move to reduce It to $10,000
Mr
MAYNARD
r with my colleague The CHAIRMAN
Then the gentleman can- not proceed, debate only being allowed in oppo- sition to the amendment
[Laughter.] Mr
MAYNARD
The Chafrman will recol- lect the Qld adage we used to hear when we were boys, (l do not profess to give *nore than the sub- stance of it,) never to forestall a slow speaker
1 was about to remark that I concurred with my colleague in having the American Nauticai Alma- nac published on terms as moderate and reason- able as it could be done; and whatever reduction can be made in the estimates for that iteni, I shall certainly concur in
But, sir, the gentlemen hav- ing this work in charge have reported to us that it is necessary to appropriate this sum of $25,880
If my colleague could give us some idea of the operations of preparing a Nautical Almanac, and could show us how it could be us well prepared for $10,000, I would concur with him in his amendrnent
He has spoken of the planets discovered since 1849
If he will give us a list of them, and tell us which are without use or benefit for the purpose of promoting the general nautical int.ercsts of the country, we would deduct to that extent
Until we can have that information from my colleaoue, I confess we must be permitted to rely upon the estimates made by the gentlemen who have the work in charge as primo facie correct
Mr
QU ARLES
I cannot do all my colleague If I am allowed asks me to do in five minutes
proper time I will do it
Mr
MAYNARD
For the reasons have stated, I oppose the aniendment offered by my collca«ue
The question was taken; and the amendment was disagreed to
Mr
MORSE
I am instructed by the Com- mittce on Naval Affairs to offer the followincr as an additional section: SEC
2
and be it further enacted, That the payments heretofore inade to the clerks of yards, and to the com- mandant's clerks, at the Navy Yards of Kittery and Phil- ndelphia, under appropriations *nade bv Congress ihr that purpose, at tlye rate ot• $1,200 per annum, are hereby al- lowed and confinned
I will say, in respect to this amendment, that when the pay of several clerks in different yards was arranged many years ago, the pay of all the clerks of the class mentioned in the amendment was fixed at $1,200 pct• annum, except those in the Washington yard, and those in the yards at Kittery and Philadelphia
Those in the Wash- old law fixed their pay at $900, notwithstanding the estimates were sent in at41,200; and instruc- tions were sent by the head of the Bureau of Yards" and Docks to the pursers of those yards to pay those clerks $1,200
Now the Fourth Auditor has cut down the supply, and the paymasters at those yards are deducting from the $900, the amount of $300 a year, leaving them only #600
I This amendment is simply intended to legalize the pay which Congress intended to givc to that class of clerks
My opinion is that we ought not only to legalize that payment, but to fix the pay at $1,200 a year
But I do not propose to do that, for fear that some one may say that it is It certainly ought to be done
not in order
If we cannot do that, we can do this much: we can legalize the payments which have already been made to them, and not permit the offcers to de- duct $300 from their $900, thus leaving them with only $600 to live upon
I hope the amendment will be •adopted
Mr
FLORENCE
I will move to amend by providing that the salary of those clerks shall be $1,200
Mr
SHERMAN
Thatcertainly isnotin order
Mr
FLORENCE
1 desire that full and exact justice should be done to those clerks; but as I am not disposed to embarrass thc proposition of tbc chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, I will withdraw my amendment; though contend that those clerks are entitled to #1,200, and ought to have it upon principles of right and justice
The amendment was agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
i move thatthc committee use and report the bill to the House
The motion was agreed to
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having resumed the chair, Mr
COLFAX reported that the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union had, according to order, had under consideration thc naval appropriation bill, and had directed him to report it to the Housé, with sundry amend- ments, with a recommendation that they do pass
No objection being madc, the several amend- ment were agreed to in gross
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed and read a third time; and being engrossed, it was accordinglv read the third time
Mr
THOMAS demanded the yeas and nays upon the passage of the bill
The yeas and nays were not ordered
'Ehe bill was then passed
Mr
SHERMAN moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed; and also moved to i lay the motion to reconsider npon the table
II The latter motion was agréed to
And then, on motion of Mr

The Dc- partment, under the supposition that those two yards Were included in the bill, made out their estimates at and Congress made an ap- propriation accordingly for three or four years, and paid the clerks in those yards $1,200, their accounts wcrc settled at the Department for that amount
But in the year 18.58, when their accounts came in, the Fourth Auditor declined to allow them $1,200, upon the ground that some I concurrence of the Senate was requested

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
Mr
BIGLER
I ask the unanimous consent of the Senate to introduce a bill, of which pre- vious notice has not been given
It is a bill to provide for taking the sense of the people of the several States on certain proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States
As the bill relates toa subject of great importance, I- ask that it be printed, and that 'it be read at this -time at length
The bill (S
No
537) to provide for taking the sense of the people •of the several States on certain proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States was read by its title and ordered to a second reading
The VICE PRESIDENT
The
second read- ing of the bill will be at len;th
YThe Secretary read the b Lll , The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senatorfi•om Pennsylvania moves that the bill be printed
Mr
BIGLER
I wish to make a single re- mark on the subject of this bill
It will be per- ceived by the Senate that it is the mere machinery to carry out the plan presented by the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr
CRITTENDEN.) The prop- ositions submitted as amendments to the Con- stitution are somewhat .different, but the main I features are the same; and I beg to say, as that honorable Senator is absent this morning, that be informs me that, so far as he undesstands
these propositions, he concurs in them, and thinks they will answer the purpose he has in view
I further give notice that, at the earliest hour the business of the Senate will allow, I will call up the reso- lutions of the Senator from Kentucky, for the purpose of considering them in connection with the bill which i have just offered
The VICE PRESIDENT
The question the motion to print the bill
• The motion was agreed to
Mr
WILSON
1 move that the bill intro- duced by the Senator from Pennsylvania be ra- ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary
Mr
BIGLER
the Senator from Mas- sachusetts will not insist upon that motion at If, when we take the bill up regularly present
for consideration, that is thought to be a proper I shall have no objection; but at disposition, present, I hope the Senator will withdraw that motion* until the bill is printed
Mr
SVILSON
I think the proper way is, to send a bill to the appropriate committee
This is a bill of a very impörtant nature, and I think it should go to the Committee on the Judiciary; and therefore I have made that motion, and must ad herc to it
The question being put, •on a division there were—ayes twenty-two
Mr.POWELL
1 desire to ask what the bill is
The VICE PRESIDENT
The bill just read by the Secretary
Mr
BIGLER
The proposition is, to refer my bill to the Committee on the Judiciary
The VICE PRESIDENT having put the neg- ative, there were twenty-two opposed to the motion
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senate being equally divided— Mr
TRUMBULL
1 ask for the yeas and nays on the motion
'The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
TRUMBULL
Before the question taken, I desire to say a single word
Here is a I bilk introduced, as I understand from imperfectly I hearing it read, to change the Constitution of the United-States, and, as I understand it, it proposes to change that Constitution in an unconstitutional way
It has never been before any committee, and a proposition is made to refer to the Com- mittee on the Judiciary
I would like to know what the Judiciary Committee is for, if so import- ant a bill as one
changing the fundamental law of the country is to be considered and passed without reference to a committee at all
It scems II to me surprising that aoy one should suppose that The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the sen- ate a report of the Secretary of the Trcasury, a bill of that character can pass without due con- i trust that the motion will, prevail
transmitting, in compliance with a resolution of II sideration
