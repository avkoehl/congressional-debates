 I ask the indulgence of
 the Sen ate for about
 two rninutes to mul e
 an explana tion not for
 my own benefit but for
 the benefit remarks which submitted
 to the Senate a few
 days ago on the resolution
 in relation to the Sen
 ate s order in favor
 of Mrs Linn I styled
 the letter of Mr Medill
 in regard to it as
 imperti nent I rise to
 sav what I would have
 said then but the Senator
 from Ohio Mr PUGH took
 me up a little sharp
 about it that I used
 that term in its literal
 and legal sense the very
 one that is given in
 the dictionary impertinent in that
 itdid I did not mean
 not pertain to the subject
 matter it to be personally
 dffensive to Mr Medill 1
 meant it In the same
 way that it is used
 in an swers to bills
 in equity The first meaning
 given in the dictionary is
 that it is not pertinent
 and does not belong to
 the subject matter in hand
 That is what I meant
 to say of his letter
 that it I did not
 mean to did not belong
 to the subject make any
 personal application of it to
 him Mr PUGH The Senator
 from New I lamp shire
 was kind enough to make
 that explanation to me on
 Saturday after the adjournment and
 I told him then that
 I was very sorry to
 have given him any pain
 by what I then thought
 was an ap propriatc response
 to the word used by
 him m Its usual acceptation
 I beg his pardon for
 hav ing misunderstood him PETITIONS

 have brought about such an
 issue and with out going

 causes which have irupélled sister
 States to this act they
 pray your honorable body at

 as will restore t he
 Union and give peace to
 the country And in this
