 resolution that ig designed to

 Mr HALE i rise toa
 question of order The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Secretary will suspend
 the reading of the paper
 Mr HALE I want to
 know if that is a
 peti tion or a memorial
 addressed to the Senate Mr
 CRITTENDEN Yes CONGRESSIO AL GLOBE
 587 Mr CRITTENDEN stated exactly
 what it was that they
 had passed the resolutions ex
 pressive of their views and
 by an additional res olution
 declared that they should be
 presented to the Senate and
 that I should present them
 I take that to be
 in substance an address to
 the Senate Mr HALE I
 object to its reception Mr
 CRITTENDEN well The VICE PRESIDENT
 The question is Shall the
 naper be read Mr HAL
 E I do not object
 to its reading but to
 its reception Mr CRITTENDEN 1
 suppose that is a question
 of order to be decided
 by the Presiding ffcer The
 VICE PRESIDENT Then the Presid
 ing Offccr upon the statement
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and upon the action of
 the Sen ate on tW
 0 occasions within the last
 week must decide that not
 being a memorial it cannot
 be received Mr HALE very
 well sir The VICE PRESIDENT
 rhe Senate so decided Mr
 CRITTENDEN Cannot a citizen ap
 peal to Congröss in the
 language of resolution ns well
 as any other förm of
 petition There is no form
 of petition given The Constitution
 only guaranties to citizens the
 right of petitioning Con do
 not see the distinction rress
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Chair
 would call the attention of
 the Senator from Kentucky to
 the fact that his colleague
 the other day pre sented
 resolutions passed by a convention
 in the State of Kentucky
 which were sent to him
 with the request that they
 should be laid before the
 and on the vote of
 the Senate the paper was
 not received because it was
 not a memorial The other
 day afterwards a similar resolution
 was presented by some other
 Senator and by a vote
 of the Senate not received
 upon the same ground The
 Senator from Missouri think offered
 resolutions adopted at a great
 meeting at St Louis Mr
 POLK Yes sir Tho VICE
 PRESIDENT This seems to be
 of the same character and
 the Chair feels himself bound
 by the action of the
 Senate on those oc casions
 Mr CRITTENDEN Mr President Mr
 MASON Will the Senator allow
 me to say a word
 I was asvare of that
 action of the Senate on
 the cases alluded to by
 the Chair and thcrefore declined
 the request of a public
 meeting in my State to
 present their proceedings to the
 Senate and informed them that
 the Senate had I declined
 to receive papers of that
 character conformed my action to
 it I do not know
 any thing about this paper
 Mr CRITTENDEN Will the Secretary
 be pleased to read for
 my information the last reso
 lution informally or if he
 will hand it to me
 I Will read it myself
 The Sccretary read as follows
 Resolved That the chairman bc
 requested to commu nicate the
 action or this neeting to
 I Ion J0i 1N J
 CRIT TENDEN of the Senate
 and Hon ITHOh1AS CORWIN Rep
 resentative in Congress iör the
 purpose of presentation to the
 Senate and the House of
 Representatives Mr POWELL If my
 colleague will me 1 will
 state that the resolutions which
 I pre sented from Kentucky
 were different from these now
 before the Senate in this
 The mass meeting in Kentucky
 did not adopt any resolution
 request Ing their proceedings to
 bc presented to the The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair under
 stood the Senator from Kentucky
 to say that it Senate
 I was requested by a
 letter from the off cers
 of the meeting to present
 them The reso was Mr
 HALE If it is what
 I saw in the news
 lutions presen ted a moment
 since byrny colleague the same
 result Theeque tiosn is whether
 thé paper shall be received
 Mr CRITTENDEN Certainly Mr GRIMES
 I think case precisely sima
 ilar to this occurred in
 the Senate at its last
 SCS sion A meeting wak
 held somewhere in the State
 of New York if I
 remember rightly and rewhi tions
 were submitted to that meeting
 and adoptéd requesting the Senator
 from Oregon Mr LANE to
 present the proceedings Of that
 meeting to the Senate When
 they were presented here the
 Senator from Mississippi the chairman
 of the Committee on Military
 Affairs and Militia Mr DAY1s
 objected to their consideration and
 they were not received at
 that time ånd that action
 of the Senate was universally
 concurred in by all the
 members of this body I
 think the case is exactly
 similar Mr HALE As I
 raised this question wish simply
 to state in a very
 few words the reason I
 of course have no want
 of respect to of it
 the gentlemen composing the meeting
 nor to the Senator who
 presents these proceedings but my
 recellection after a somewhat protracted
 service in the Senate is
 that the Senate have uniformly
 whenever the question has been
 raised refused to receive the
 proceedings of meetings on various
 subjects unless they ended with
 a prayer or a memorial
 to the Senate This was
 a meeting of gentlemen whom
 I understand to be superintend
 ents and presidents of railroads
 a very import ant class
 of people held at Willard
 s hotel and I think
 the proper course would have
 been for them to request
 some gentleman that boards at
 Willard s to hand them
 to Willard and ask him
 to keep them there as
 a record of what was
 done at his house but
 they are certainly not a
 record of the Senate not
 proceedings for its considera tion
 That is my view Mr
 POLK 1 do not know
 what haB been the course
 of the Senate on this
 subject but on a se
 rics of resolutions presented by
 myself afew Idys since from
 the city of St Louis
 the Senate voted to rejcct
 them I thought at the
 time it was not I
 suppose that any singlc citizen
 exactly right of the United
 Statss has a right to
 petition Con gress for a
 redress of grievances or for
 any meas ur e that
 he deems proper for the
 action of that body if
 indeed the action be such
 as the body should take
 Now sir here is a
 series of reso lution passed
 by gentlemen all admitted to
 be respectable and in the
 resolutions themselves there is a
 request that they be presented
 to Con gress Each onc
 of these gentlemen might have
 presented these resolutions as an
 individual citi zen If he
 had presented them in the
 shape ofa petition to Congress
 as an individual citizen this
 body would undoubtedly receive them
 Here are a number of
 gentlemen that unite in the
 paper a request that it
 shall be presented to Congress
 it seems to me that
 it is a petition of
 a much stronger character than
 the sort to which I
 have just re ferred I
 admit that in the case
 which was re ferred to
 by the Presiding Offcer from
 Missouri the action of the
 Senate was adverse to the
 recep tion of the resolutions
 passed by the meeting I
 thought myself at the time
 that it was a bad
 pre ccdent and if wc
 follow that precedent it will
 be following a bad line
 of precedents i shall my
 self vote for the reception
 of the resolutions pre sentcd
 by the Senator from Kentucky
 Mr LANE In the case
 alluded to by the Senator
 from Iowa Mr GRIMES which
 I rec ollcct very well
 the proceedings there I lad
 were at one of the
 largest meetings perhaps ever held
 in t he State of
 New York At that meeting
 res olutions werc adopted and
 the proceedings were forwarded to
 me with a request in
 the last reso I lution
 that I would present them
 to the Senate I papers
 purporting to be the proceedings
 of that distinctly declare that
 they desire them to be
 pre did it and recollect
 very well that the course
 pur I tl ink there
 is a very sued by
 the Senatc was just as
 stated by the Sen meeting
 it is not of that
 kind Of course I do
 sented to the Senate ator
 from Iowa With the proceedings
 of the marked difference between
 the cases rot want to
 question the Senator s word
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Chair
 will Mr CRITTENDEN 1 think
 so Mr Presi Senate then
 1 felt satisfied I heard
 the statc ask the Senator
 from Kentucky whether it is
 a dent and witli all
 proper regard Lo the dccision
 mcntof the Senator from Mississippi
 who recol i I of
 the Chair which seenls to
 conforrn to similar lected well
 the course of the Senate
 upon such memorial addressed to
 the Senate Mr CRITTENDEN I
 stated exactly what t cases
 as it is supposed I
 desire from a clear con
 mat t ers and was
 satisfied that the proper action
 was had then I shall
 treat all other proceedings it
 was The gentleman need not
 question my i viction that
 this does come within the
 privilegc i ii secured by
 the Constitution of petitioning Con
 of any meeting in the
 same manner that they were
 word treated gress to take
 an appeal from the decision
 of the Mr HALE 1
 did not Mr CRITTENDEN Mr
 President in the Mr CRI
 TTENDEN He may make a
 ques Chair and do so
 in order that the question
 may days when the Constitution
 was made the right be
 settled bv the Senate as
 to the propriety of receiving
 the paper The VICE PRESIDENT
 If agreeable to the of
 petition which is nothing more
 than the right Mr HALE
 beg the Senator s pardon
 I should bc the last
 man entirely to question his
 Senator from Kentucky the Chair
 wilk subxnit of a popular
 appeal to the representative body
 of the quesaon to the
 Senate which will bring about
 thc Government wag thought to
 be of some value word
 588 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 28 Perhaps it was in
 that day of some value
 In the days of our
 ancestors before the Parliament of
 Great Britain it had occasiu
 ially exercised a great influence
 I believe that it has
 very much h St that
 power now but still it
 is a privilege and a
 right secured by the Constitution
 The people have a right
 to petition Congress according to
 the Constitution What is the
 meaning of that Mr President
 Was this right deerhed a
 matter of substance or was
 it intended as a mere
 formula to be exercised in
 a particular mode or in
 a par ticular phraseology T
 pray the honorable Sen ate
 i l beg the honorable
 Senate I desire to make
 known to the honorable Senate
 Will aTl these forms be
 embraced by the general lan
 guage of the Constitution under
 the right of peti tion
 We knovvr that this right
 of petition is frequently exercised
 in the most positive and
 man datory language that is
 consistent with respect to the
 body and it may well
 be so It is the
 lan guage not of supplicants
 The Constituti01 1 never Intended
 that our people should becomc
 suppli cants before they could
 have the privilege of ex
 pressing their opinion to their
 representatives It intended that the
 doors should be kept open
 by which the people might
 speak in what languacye they
 pleased provided it was respectful
 to their representatives to Ict
 them know what the pub
 lic voice was This is
 the substance of the right
 of petition It is tho
 right of freemen to be
 ex ercnsed like freemen and
 not the language of mere
 supplicants who come with formal
 prayers in their mouths Welt
 sir if this is the
 true sense and understanding of
 the constitutional right of peti
 tion an appeal to their
 representatives in Con gress l
 ask what more effective what
 more brief mode can be
 adopted than that which these
 pcr sons have adopted T
 herc is a great measure
 depending before Congress They express
 their opinions upon that grent
 subject and they ask that
 that expression of their opinion
 may be prc sentcd to
 the Senate of their country
 and to the House of
 Representatives Now sir is not
 that a petition in the
 sense of the Constitution Elow
 are you to distinguish between
 this and any other mode
 or appeal to the Senate
 in writing by the citizen
 i hey ask Inc to
 present it to thc Senate
 They ask in ciTcc t
 and impliedly if the Senate
 will receive this expression of
 their opinion You can make
 nothing more of it sir
 and unless wc intend by
 technical constructions and rigorous prescriptions
 of the rules to confinc
 the people to as precise
 a mode of coming before
 the Senate as possible to
 make it a narrow and
 a difficult road we shall
 never be vcry careful about
 the form or luntruage in
 which the people express themselves
 r hey Lave a right
 to be heard when they
 express a de sirc to
 be heard I lave they
 not here cxpressed a desire
 to bc heard Unquestionably they
 have It is said that
 t here has been a
 cusc like this which has
 been decided otherwise Perhaps that
 I recollect nothing of the
 case may havc been I
 take it for granted that
 it is just exactly as
 gen tlcmcn have stated That
 is one casc Another case
 vas supposed to exist of
 resolutions of a convention in
 Kentucky r l heirresolutiorns how
 ever did not express any
 wish that they should be
 presented to the Senate of
 the United States had not
 that in contemplation Certainly that
 is no expression of any
 wish or of any petit
 ion could not therefore be
 heard by the Senate under
 I thc right of petition
 or prescntcd to the Senate
 But here is the contrary
 here is the cxprcss wish
 and opinion that it Shail
 be presented and I I
 icavc it to the Senate
 now that it is brought
 up again and perhaps has
 received solnewhat more consideration from
 Senators than it did on
 a former occasion to say
 whether the right of the
 people shall be constrained and
 diminished and cut down of
 it and if it does
 Mamount to that it is
 the poor miserable pitiful right
 of supplicants to come with
 folded arms and bowed heads
 and bated breath before Congress
 and beg and sup plicate
 I hope no such doctrine
 will prevail here and if
 ever such a decision has
 been given as has bcen
 alluded to that it will
 never be repeated in the
 Senate Sir do not wish
 to occupy the timc of
 the Senate longer The VICE
 PRESIDENT The question to be
 determined is Will the Senate
 receive the paper and shall
 it be read Mr HALE
 called for the yeas and
 nays and they were ordered
 Mr MASON I agree with
 the honorable Sen ator from
 Kentucky as far as I
 have had thc good fortune
 to hear him that the
 right of the citizen to
 petition Congress for a redress
 of grievances taken from the
 old laws securing civil liberty
 in England is one that
 is to be jealously guarded
 and preserved yet i do
 not see the propriety but
 I see great impropriety in
 setting a precedent by which
 any citizens of any of
 the United Stales expre ing
 their opinions as opinions either
 by a separate meetino as
 Was done by these gentle
 men or otherwise may send
 communications to the Senatc or
 to the House of Representatives
 as expressive of the individual
 opinions of the If that
 course were citizens who express
 them pursued it seems to
 me that it would lead
 and invite into a degeneration
 of this sacred right of
 petition which is secured by
 our Constitution and which we
 should ever cherish It seems
 from the paper as far
 as I heard it read
 and from the newspapers out
 of doors that these gen
 tlemen who are certai nly
 very respectable gentlemen assembled at
 Washington to det erm ine
 upon matters pertaining to the
 trusts com mitted to them
 respectively by these railroad cotn
 panics They came here on
 no public errand to receige
 the proceedings not from any
 want of respectto the gentlemen
 that express the opinions or
 hold the meeting and certainly
 the honorable Senator from Kentucky
 does not want me to
 dis claim that it is
 from no want of respect
 to him for if I
 have any error towards him
 it is that I re
 spect him too much and
 have so profound a rev
 erence for his character that
 sometimes the win ning tones
 of his vo_ice make me
 vote as he would contrary
 to the convictions of my
 own under standing That is
 the danger But sir Ido
 want while the Senate lasts
 that it shall conduct its
 business upon the principle that
 it always has pur sued
 and that is to receive
 petitions memorials addresses or anything
 of that sort respectfully addressed
 to it but if you
 are going to go further
 than that and let every
 meeting that is got up
 anywhere pass a resolution requesting
 its pro ceedings to bc
 laid before the Senate and
 receive them you will have
 to make new accommo dations
 to pile away your papers
 Every titne you go into
 the Secretary s oflice you
 sec a pretty lurge spacc
 that is reserved for the
 files takcn up by a
 mammoth petition of three thousand
 clergy men remonstratino acrainst the
 passage of the Ne braska
 bill Adopt his principle and
 you will have the proceedings
 of every little caucus from
 one end af the Union
 to the other sent here
 and the Senate in short
 will be made a sort
 of pile of the records
 of ihe caucuses of different
 parties holden from one end
 of the Union to t
 he other It seems to
 me the only rule of
 safety is for the Senate
 of the Unitcd States to
 persevere in thc course it
 has heretofore adopted without any
 regard to the parties or
 sections or whether the meeting
 bc composed of railroad presidents
 or superintendents or any other
 class You will get yoursclves
 into difficulty by receiving them
 The netxt thing will be
 that the railroad conductors will
 come on here and they
 will have a meeting r
 I hey camc here to
 consid thcir and they will
 ask that their proceedings Inn
 y be whatever In uti
 tal interests In reference to
 the railroad trusts put on
 your files and if you
 have taken the pres that
 had been committed to their
 charge and Idents and superintendents
 you must take the roceedings
 of the conductors and next
 of the being here departing
 from the purpose of their
 How often is it in
 every presiden they organized them
 niission to Washington asscngers tial
 contest that a car full
 of take a selves into
 a rneetine in onc of
 the parlors of one vote
 and ex press their opinions
 on the Presidency of thc
 hotels and expressed their individual
 opin that théy will pass
 a res undoubtedly entitled to
 weight and consid The next
 thing will bc oration by
 those who know the gcnllemen
 and olution that that vote
 bc sent to the Senai
 c and placed on its
 files Now let me assure
 thc hon know the valuc
 of their opinions I do
 not know orablc Senator from
 Kentucky that the zeal of
 his any of them except
 one I think I know
 one personally I doubt not
 their opinions are enti tled
 to respect but as the
 opinions of individual men I
 might as well as a
 citizen of Virginia address u
 notc to a member of
 Congress and say Such arc
 my opinions v ill you
 bc good enough to lay
 them before the House of
 Representatives I think it is
 a departure from or the
 Senate tho rule which protects
 the right of petition The
 Senate has acted on this
 view The other day patriotisn
 has outrun his judgment on
 this ques tion in my
 humble opinion and that the
 course for us to pursue
 is to keep on as
 we have always done Mr
 SEWARD 1 understand the yeas
 and nays have been called
 for on this question The
 VICE PRESIDENT They have been
 orderc l Mr SEWARD 1
 will barely state that on
 this occasion as on every
 other since I have been
 as I said just now
 I received from onc of
 the counties State information that
 a meeting in legislative life
 I think I shall vote
 for the re It is
 maxim with me had been
 held there that the opinions
 of the ception of this
 paper i think meeting had
 been cx Dressed on rnatters
 of great derived from an
 old song public interest Whet
 cra resolution wasadopted asking that
 they should bc presented to
 thc Sen ate or not
 I do not know but
 I received a letter vom
 a member of that meeting
 I think the chair A
 health to hilli that would
 read A health to hilu
 that would vrite Nono ever
 fears that the truth be
 told But hill that the
 truth would indict I do
 not care in what way
 they come whether man asking
 me to present them to
 the Senate 1 replicd to
 him that I should do
 so with pleasure they come
 as pctitioners 01 w hcbhcn
 they come but that the
 Senate at this session had
 declined in public asscn lblages
 I do not remcnnber exactly
 the language of thc Constitution
 but I believe the receiving
 papers of that kind I
 should not feel at liberty
 therefore to vote for this
 having my Constitution guaranties the
 right of the people to
 self declined to run counter
 to the action of the
 assembleandcousiderpublicaffairs and if that isa
 right valuable for anything to
 be used for an ything
 Senate Mr I I ALE
 Mr Prcsident I look upon
 this it is to enable
 them to present their as
 a question of sorne importance
 Sanction this their delegates their
 agents their reflections upon receive
 these proceedings and my precedent
 word for it your files
 will be encumbered with the
 proceedings of every little caucus
 that is holden from one
 end of this Union to
 the other They to a
 particular form or mode of
 expression before they can be
 allowed to be heard by
 their own I think Senators
 or their own Representatives instead
 of contracting we should enlarge
 and keep open all sorts
 of communication with tho people
 and that the Constitution of
 the United Statos so intended
 when it regarded this as
 a matter of con sequence
 enough to bc madc a
 constitutional pro vision that tho
 people should be heard upon
 their petitions The right of
 petition is but parliamentary langua
 re It is the right
 of the people to appeal
 to and make known their
 opinions to their rep resentalives
 in writing That is the
 whole amount will come here
 by the dozen from iNew
 England and from the great
 West and everywhere else This
 is n ot the place
 for them Our rules are
 ex I thillk I will
 go as far as tbc
 Senator from Kentucky in favor
 of the right of pcti
 ion or the right of
 instruction or any other right
 but as a matter of
 public convenience to the body
 I ask that the Senate
 adhere to the rule it
 has always I think I
 can say without fear of
 acted upon contradiction that this
 question has been raised every
 year that I havo been
 a member of the Sen
 ate and that whenever the
 attention of the Senate has
 been called to it they
 have uniformly refused I should
 perhaps feel some deli public
 affairs cacy about this Inatter
 if it were not that
 I have always acted upon
 the same principle and on
 both the occasions referred to
 within the present session I
 was in favor of receiving
 the papers presented It does
 not make any difference to
 me whether they corne from
 presidents of rail road s
 II or directors of railroads
 conductors of railroads or passenæcrs
 of railroads or workmen of
 rail roads I tliink that
 it is respectful it is
 consistent with the genius of
 our Government and it will
 tend to public harmony and
 to the best results to
 allow the people always to
 address thetwo Houses of Congress
 Iwvhenever they do so in
 lancruage of respect and consideration

 for fear may be i
 pendence An clection for delegates
 toa conven misconstrued Ido not
 know that it is of
 any very great consequence but
 I cannot agree with the
 Senator from New York in
 relation to this matter that
 because this is a representation
 to Congress we are thereforc
 to pay no sort of
 attention to our own rules
 and our own convenience If
 there was any sort of
 reason fop this thing if
 a refusal to receive this
 paper could be construed in
 any shape or form into
 rejecting or even disrezarding in
 the slightest degree the right
 of petition sacred as it
 is and as we all
 admit it to be i
 should have no hesitation on
 the subject nor should I
 be partic it is perfectly
 ob ular aböut the form

 will be formed by them
 with ample powers for their
 own defense with power to
 enter into neao tiations with
 other nations to make war
 conclude peace form treaties and
 generally to do all other
 things which independent nations may
 of right do Provision will
 be made for the admission
 of other States into the

 confi dently believed that Within
 a few months all the
 slaveholding States of the late
 Confederacy of the United States
 will be united toø ether
 in a bond of union
 far more homogeneous and therefore
 more stable than the one
 now being dissolved I content
 myself Mr President with a

 and these ccjnclusions without making
 an argument to justify or
 defind them I have only
 to say that this action
 of my own State and
 of her itnmediate southern neighbors
 and sisters meets the approval
 of my well con sidered

 The first aet Federal le

 make them and we will
 consider them The southern people
 I have heretofore cherished a
 warm and sincere attachment and
 reverence for the Union and
 noth ing but a stern
 conviction of the necessity and
 propriety of leaving it and
 forming a safer and more
 perfect Union would have driven
 them to the alternative of
 separation from it When they
 see if it shall not
 be too long deferred a
 return ing sense of justice
 and fraternal feelings in the
 northern mind and heart and
 can find sufficient and reliable
 guarantees för the protection and
 per mancnt enjoyment of their
 equality and rights in the
 Union they may perhaps reconsider
 their present action and rejoin
 their former confeder ates For
 myself sir I am free
 to declare that unless my
 opinions shall be greatly changed
 I shall never agree to
 thc reconstruction of the Federal
 Union i hc Rubicon is
 passed and it shall never
 with no y consent be
 recrossed But in this sen
 t iment I may be
 overruled by the people of
 my I may State and
 of the other southern States
 safely say however that nothing
 will satisfy them or bring
 them back short ofa full
 and explicit rec ognition and
 guarantee of the safety of
 their in stitution of domestic
 slavery and the protection of
 the constitutional rights for which
 in thc Uninn they have
 been so long contending and
 a denial of which by
 their northern confederates has forced
 them into their present attitude
 of separate independence And now
 Mr President it remains for
 me only to express my
 grateful acknowledgments and thanks for
 the uniform com tesy afi

 would cheerfully yield but suppose
 there arc many other petitions

 that the message together with
 the accompanying docu rnents be

 in order to enable me
 with the permission of the
 Senate to say a few
 words upon the message I
 shall subsequently ask that they
 bc laid upon the table
 as well as printed The
 message of the President communicat
 es to the Senate certain
 resoluE ions adopted by the
 Gen eral Assembly of Virginia
 now in session ex pressive
 of the sense and earnest
 desire of that State so
 far as that sense can
 be expressed by the legislative
 body in regard to the
 great move mcnt which has
 already separåted thc States of
 this Union They were not
 communicated to thc Senate by
 the General Assembly of Virginia
 but as shown by one
 of the resolutions they were
 communicated officially and formally to
 the Pres ident of the
 United States by t he
 General Assem conceives to be
 the magnitudc aud importance of
 the occasion as well expressed
 by the President in his
 tues sage Virginia thought it
 an occasion to bring from
 a dignified and honored retirement
 one of her sons who
 had cnjoye l not the
 confi dence of Virginia alone
 by being elevated to the
 hi hcst posts in the
 jublic service of that State
 throuto h t hc vote
 but who subsequent y becan
 e of all the Statcs
 the President States an houornblc
 mission confidcd to honora hands
 The purpose of tho resolutions
 Mr President is twofold first
 to initn rn the President
 that Vir giniil has undertaken
 the office of mediating be
 tt veen the two reat
 scctions of the country in
 the hopc that rneasures bc
 devised WII ic h if
 they could not avert that
 which had already hap pened
 lbe dissolu lion of the
 Union of the Stales might
 be the means of healing
 that rupture of restoring the
 Union under guarantees and pro
 visions that might be satisfactory
 to both sections The next
 object of the resolutions was
 to induce the Prcsiden t
 of the United States as
 the execu tive department of
 this Government so far ns
 Iny with Inm to refrain
 froin any act which n
 ight briner int collision the
 public power of the United
 States with the public power
 of the States that have
 soccded from a knowledge that
 if such col lision once
 ensued it would bc beyond
 the of any man to
 avert that greatest of ail
 t llis country and to
 mankind catastrophes to civil war
 between the Stn tes of
 this Union a I ld
 the people of thosc other
 States It was n rreat
 tikis Sion wh ich Virginia
 has thus instituted in Ilie
 hope expressed by thc resolutions
 that this existin M rul
 ture of tho States rnigl
 ht be healed and that
 every effort should be rnade
 in t he mean time
 to avoid that æreatest catastrophe
 civil war The Preside lt
 in comtnunicat ing those resolutions
 to Congress has responded to
 the spirit of the Gen
 erul Assembly and has expressed
 the earnest hope that the
 ol jccts of the Gencrai
 Assembly may be attained Congress
 refraining from any act which
 would tend to lead to
 that collision Mr President it
 is known that Virginia has
 participated in this movement as
 one of the States affected
 I ler General Assem bly
 w ns called into special
 session immediately after Congress l
 let and the first act
 of that General Assembly vas
 to summon the people of
 the State in convention That
 convention is to meet within
 three weeks frorn time I
 think the day is the
 13th of Feb ruary and
 the great purpose of Virginia
 in lhc mission tl iat
 she has instituted now to
 Washing ton is to induce
 the Federal authorities to refrain
 ft mn ari y act
 which shall complicate and irretrieva
 bly complicate the existing issues
 between the How is that
 to be done North and
 the South The President has
 said in his message that
 very little power rests with
 him that he considers it
 his duty a duty incumbent
 upon his offce to pro
 vide for the security of
 the public property so far
 as it may be within
 his power he has no
 author ity to initiate any
 act of hostility and disclaims
 any pu rpose of doing
 so if it were within
 h is power I trust
 sir that this great object
 of Virginia in i preserving
 the public peace between the
 opposing sections for the time
 being at least may be
 suc cessful We know the
 Senate has been officially informed
 that of the thirty three
 States that con slituted this
 Union six have separated themselves
 from it by formal acts
 of the political community I
 in each State transacted as
 a political commu I think
 Mr President we all see
 evidences from that quarter of
 tho country that there is
 no purpose on their part
 to break the peace I
 think it is very natural
 in such a state of
 things as ex ists in
 the disordered condition of the
 times there that the public
 mind should be very much
 inflamed and aroused almost from
 its foundations There may be
 a diffculty in regulatino or
 moderating public sentiment but I
 think we have seen evi
 dences that the authorities there
 have done it and we
 havc seen at least I
 have seen nothing but an
 earnest desire on their part
 to be allowed to keep
 the public peace Nor Mr
 President have they been actuated
 nity That is_a fact accomplished
 Those States in this by
 anything like fear They would
 meet declare that they are
 now no longer members of
 a like disposition on tbc
 part of the Federal Gov
 this Confederacy None can doubt
 I presume i ernment with
 joy but in the language
 of the old I Indian
 chief which has been immortalized
 by thc from the evidences
 before our senses almost thal
 other States are to f0110
 v T lie great object
 of pen of one of
 Virginia s statesmen Do not
 har Virginia in the mission
 instituted by these reso bor
 a thought that that would
 be the joy of fear
 lutions to Congress or to
 the President more prop I
 say sir I believe those
 States are actuated at erly
 for they wore addressed only
 to him is to this
 moment by an earnest desire
 to refrain from every act
 which would break the public
 peace preserve the l ublic
 peace in the hope as
 ex pressed in the resolutions
 that if it bc the
 pleas The State of Virginia
 has invoked a like dispo
 sition on the part of
 this Government ure of the
 other Statcs to send comrnissioners
 It is the only mode
 now here to nu iet
 those delegated by Virginia they
 it will be successful unay
 devise some additional amendment to
 the left under the direction
 of thc Supreme Being Constitution
 in some fornu that will
 guaranty the by which the
 pcoplc of this country can
 bc saved riglits of the
 rninorily section which will be

 war and restored to Government
 re lations in some form
 under auspices that Inav aeccptuble

 not an I act which
 leads to war and to
 war alone never was I
 such a Senator or such
 a ciliz cn inore deluded
 havc had occasion to say
 heretofore I speak it now
 sir cert ainly not in
 anoer but I should speak
 it in if I could
 be brought to con template
 such an cvcnt think too
 Mr President that wc have
 evi denccs daily evidences from
 that section of the coun
 try which has separated itselffrom
 this Un ion that while
 the authorities there have thought
 it necessary as measures of
 precaution to possess thernselvc s
 in the several States of
 the forts ar senals navy
 yards and iiiilitarv Inateu ials
 found within their limits acknowledging
 them to bc a portion
 of tho public property n
 ll the time they have
 done so with no Intent
 on part to make thcy
 have done so as they
 conceived only war as measures
 of necessary prudent precaution in
 the event that any war
 should unlittppilybe waged on thenl
 And I think honorable Senators
 on the other side will
 respond to the leclaration w
 hon I say that t
 llere is not one of
 those States w hern they
 shall bc restored to the
 Union if they shall be
 restored or when the Governrnent
 shall be rc constructed if
 it shall be reconstructed or
 when peace shall be concluded
 if war shall now follow
 who will not account for
 every dollar of the pub
 lic propcrt y that they
 have taken of prosperity and
 strength and honor from which
 th py have been diverted
 from the present as I
 cohsi er it necessary movement
 on the part of tho
 States I have deemed it
 incumbent upon me Mr President
 as t his mediation originated
 with rny State to respond
 to the sentiments expressed in
 the message in an earnest
 desire that the public peace
 may be preserved until events
 work out in their own
 way the great revolution which
 is im pcilding or rather
 which is perfected in six
 of the I move that
 the papers be States of
 this Union printed and laid
 on the table Mr HALE
 listened to the Senator frcnn
 Virginia and to the message
 of the Presi dent transmitting
 the resolt_ttions of t hc
 State of Virginia I trust
 with all the respect and
 solici Rude which they demand
 ofa man occupying tho place
 which I do but want
 to ask the Seriator fron
 l Virginia a single question
 and I can assure him
 do il in no captious
 spirit but with a sin
 cerc desire that the country
 may know everything It is
 this whether the State of
 that is going on Virginia
 in the solemn and deliberate
 action she has taken in
 her appeal to the Federal
 Govern ment not to make
 war she not having as
 yet fired a single gun
 also at the sa me
 time thought it necessary to
 appeal to any Statc of
 the Union that has put
 herself in a warlike attitude
 to re frain and keep
 hands off until thc question
 is set tled I ask
 for information Mr MASON The
 object of Virginia wrould have
 been very imperfectly attempted had
 Vir frinia not dono exactly
 what the honorable Sen at
 or has inquired Virginia sent
 a commissioner here one of
 her rnost distinguished and honored
 citizens to bear the connnunication
 to the Pres idcnt asking
 forbearance of thc Federal Govern
 ment and the resolutions show
 that at the same tinu2
 she sent John Ro jertson
 a o entlenoan who also
 shares the unbounded confidence of
 the State as he has
 shared its honors as a
 commissioner to ail the States
 that have yet separatcd or
 that may separate upon the
 same mission entreatincr them to
 forbear froin any hostile act
 Mr CLINGMAN wish to offer
 a few 0b servations upon
 this subject but I understand
 thc honorable Senator from Califörnia
 desires to have the Pacific
 railroad bill taken up I
 do not wish to interfere
 with that or other special
 orders Go on I do
 not desire to do so
 at this time I shall
 not occupy rnore than half
 an hour of the time
 of the Senate possibly but
 if it is agreeable to
 the Senator from California as
 I understand it is for
 this subject to go over
 until to morrow or thc
 next day I an I
 perfectly satisfied and if it
 does not interfere with any
 other Senator I ask him
 to designate any later day
 than to mor row when
 I pnight occupy the floor
 for a short time on
 this subject Mr GWYN say
 one o clock on Wednesday
 that it Mr CLINGMAN 1
 assent to that be postponed
 until one o clock on
 Wednesday 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 59i and then if agreeable
 to the Senate I desire
 to the people as a
 mass of individuals but as
 po litical body or community
 and the issue is does
 offer a few observations on
 this subject The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr F00T in it reside
 in the whole people of
 the United States the chair
 The Senator from North Carolina
 as a political community or
 does it remain in the
 moves that the further consideration
 of this subject people of
 the several States forming distinct
 sep be postponed until Wednesday
 next and made arate communities
 though united for special pur
 the special order for that
 day at one o clock
 Mr MASON That order does
 not include the motion to
 print I suppose Mr CLINGMAN
 My object is merely to
 discuss the suuject briefly not
 to makc an elab orate
 s eech Mr BESSENDEN Let
 it pass over then Mr
 CLINGMAN 1 prefer its going
 over That will not interfere
 with tho motion to print
 Mr MASON we can settle
 it in this way let
 the motion to print be
 put and I hope carried
 and then move to print
 an additional number and let
 that go over Mr CLINGMAN
 well sir 1 am willing
 it should take that course
 and will make the motion
 in that form The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The first ques tion
 is on the motion to
 print the usual number The
 motion was agreed to The
 PRESIDING OFFICER It is further
 moved to print an extra
 number of this cömmu nication
 Mr CLINGMAN 1 move that
 that be post poned until
 Wednesday next Mr HEMPHILL 1
 wish to address the Sen
 ate and have desired to
 do so for some days
 i do not know that
 a better opportunity will offer
 than the present and particularly
 as my time will be
 short here Mr CLINGMAN Then
 1 will give way 1
 made that tnotion on conferencc
 with the Senator from California
 but I yield to tho
 Senator be cause I am
 well aware of tho condition
 of things hope that after
 he existinr r ill his
 own State has concluded the
 subject may be disposed of
 in the wav I indicated
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Does the
 sen ator from North Carolina
 withdraw the motion to postpone
 Mr CLINGMAN Yes sir The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The motion is
 withdrawn Mr CLINGMAN 1 ask
 the Senator when he concludes
 to move to postpone it
 in the man ner I
 have indicated Mr HEMPHILL Yes
 sir The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question now is on ordering
 an extra number of copies
 of the communication to be
 printed Mr HEMPHILL Mr President
 the right of a State
 to withdraw from the Union
 is the transcendent issue beCore
 the country and I pro
 pose to give it a
 brief discussion If it be
 legal it should be pcaceful
 if not if but a
 right of rebel lion it
 involves war and subjugation unless
 the rebellion becomes successful revolution
 Whether the secession of a
 State be the exer cise
 of a legal or revolutionary
 right must depend ultimately upon
 the question of sovereignty W
 herc is that paramount power
 vested It must exist in
 every natiorz and as perfectly
 in one form of govern
 Ylent as another 171 1
 Blackstone s Commentaries pp 48
 49 it is said that
 However the severai formsof government
 we now see in the
 world at first actually began
 is matter of great un
 It is not certainty and
 has occasioned infinitc disputes now
 my business or intention to
 enter into any of them
 ever they began or by
 what right soeverthey stibsist there
 is and nust be in
 all of them a supreme
 irresistible abso lute and uncontrolled
 authority in which jura summi
 im perii or the rights
 of sovereignty reside In a
 despotism the monarch is sovereign
 In Great Britain the sovereignty
 is lodged in the King
 Lords and Commons These are
 the sov creigns because the
 acts of tho despot and
 of the legislative authority of
 Great Britain control all individuals
 and ail other powers of
 the State and In Amer
 are subject to no revision
 or reversal ica it is
 an undisputed political axiom that
 sov ereignty resides in the
 people Governments in this country
 are not sovereigns t hcy
 arc re strained by constitutions
 which arc mere charts or
 grants of power from the
 people who can ab roffat
 e these charts their cn
 ants institute new governments and
 in whom only can reside
 the rights of sovereignty that
 sum of all civil and
 political power which controls all
 authorities and is controlled by
 none Sovereignty is not in
 poses in a Federal Union
 This is a practical Issue
 and depends on historical facts
 That the colonies werö distinct
 and separate from each other
 having the same executive head
 but no political connection is
 as indubitable as any fact
 upon the records of history
 That the delegates in the
 Continental Congress did not rep
 resent the whole people of
 the colonies as one political
 body but th t each
 delegation was Chosen and appointed
 severally by each several colony
 to attend the Congress of
 delegates from the I other
 colonies and assist in devisino
 means for the perpetuation of
 their liberties is a fact
 attested by the Journals of
 the Congress Each delegation presented
 its credentials from the respective
 col ony 01 province from
 which it had been deputed
 he vote was by colonies
 each colony having but one
 vote No question could be
 determined on the day of
 its debate if any colony
 desired Journals of Congress vol
 its postponement ume 1 pago
 7 Their first declaration was
 in the name ofthe ood
 people of the several colo
 nies of New Hampshire Massachusetts
 Bay c enumerating the thirteen
 who had in the language
 I of the declaration severally
 elected constitutea and appointed deputies
 to meet and sit in
 General Congress c and who
 in vindication of their rights
 and liberties resolved f That
 the foundation of Enalish liberty
 and or all free government
 is a right in the
 pcoplc to participate in their
 legislative council and as the
 English colonists are not rep
 resented and from their local
 and other circumstances cannot properly
 bc represented ill the British
 Parliakllent they are entitled to
 a free and exclusive power
 of legisla tion in tueir
 several procincial Legislatures where their
 right of representation can atone
 preserved in alf cases of
 E taxation and internal polity
 subject only to the negative
 of the sovereign in such
 rnanner as has been heretofore
 used and accustomed But from
 the necessity of the case
 and a regard to the
 Inutual interests of both countries
 we cheerfully consent to toe
 operation of such act of
 the British Parliament as are
 bona jidc restrained to the
 reau lation of our external
 conunerce tbc purpose of secur
 ing the commercial advantages of
 the whole ernpire to the
 mother couritry and the commercial
 benefits of its respect ive
 members excluding cvery idea of
 taxation internal or external for
 raising a revenue on the
 subjects in Alner ica without
 their consent Here is an
 unequivocal declaration that the col
 onists were entitled to a
 free and exclusive power of
 legislation not in any general
 Congress or Legislature of the
 colonies for there had been
 no such Legislature but in
 their several provincial Legislatures showing
 that the provinces were from
 the beginning totally distinct and
 separate I he style of
 the proceedings from cach other
 in Congress was in some
 instances by the title I
 of the United Colonies jn
 others by that of the
 Uniled Colonies of New Hampshire
 Massachu setts Bay c en
 umerating thc whole these titles
 being the equivalents of each
 other The United Colonies dissolving
 all political connection between themselves
 and Great Britain declared themselves
 to be free and independent
 States and not a single
 free and independent State or
 nation This act though done
 by the colonies united in
 Congress was m fact the
 act of each one of
 the colonies Each of the
 colonies had instructed expressly or
 virtually their respcctivc It was
 delegates to unite in such
 declaration upon the instructions from
 Virginia that the mo tion
 was offered in convention and
 those instruc ions expressly reserved
 the right of self govern
 ment to the States The
 several colonies were and had
 been for some period in
 a defacto state of independence
 Hostilities commencing at Lex inaton
 in April 1775 had been
 vigorously pros ecuted Massachusetts in
 the same month voted to
 raise thirteen thousand six hundred
 mcn Rhode Island fifteen hundred
 Connecticut six regi ments New
 I Imnpshire in May three
 regiment_s In March 1776 South
 Carolina established a constitution Virginia
 had her bill of rights
 and frame of government the
 allegiance of the citi zens
 of tho different colonies was
 claimed as due to each
 colony and not to Great
 Britain Such was the opinion
 and declaration of Congress on
 the 24th June 1776 to
 the effect that All persons
 members of or owing allegiance
 to any of the United
 Colonics who shall levy war
 against any of the said
 colonies within the same or
 be adherent to the King
 of Great Britain or other
 enmities of the said colonies
 or any of them within
 them aid and comfort are
 guilty or tredsonk agdinst such
 colony These facts and others
 of like to the Declaration
 of Independence pro é that
 the colonies while exerting efforts
 for the common defensé had
 each aSsumed the rights and
 powers ofsovereignty withih théiiöwii limits
 They were substantially independent and
 whether each declared such fact
 sefiaråtel y Or whether all
 united in the declaration under
 the authority given by each
 to its agents for that
 purpose cannot affect the great
 truth that the United were
 independent for the reason and
 upon the sole ground that
 each State was absolved from
 its allegiance to the British
 Crowh and was an independent
 State The States subsequently adopted
 written ar ticles of confederacy
 which were entitled Articles of
 Confederation and Perpetual Union between
 the States of New Hampshire
 Massachusetts Bay Rhode Island and
 Providence Plantations Connecticut New York
 New Jersey Pennsyl vania Delaware
 Maryland Virginia North Car olina
 SoÜth Carolina and Georgta The
 style Of the Confederacy was
 the United States Of Amer
 ica and by the stipulation
 of the sec ond article
 each State expressly retained its
 sovereignty free dom and independence
 and every power juris diction
 and right which is not
 bv this Confider ation expressly
 delegated to the United States
 in Congress assembled In the
 treaty of peace the thirteen
 United States by their respective
 titles were aclfiowledged by Great
 Britain to be free and
 independent States These facts are
 conclusive that the colonies were
 separate and distinct from each
 other that they were represented
 as distinct bodies in Congress
 voted as such that as
 States they remained separate and
 distinct that there was rio
 such com munity known or
 rec ognized as the people
 of the United Colonies or
 the people of the U
 nited States but the political
 Communities were the people of
 the several colonies afterwards the
 people of the several States
 it being expressly declared in
 their compact that each State
 rctaincd its sovereignty and every
 power not granted to the
 Confederacy The several States being
 sovereign members of this the
 first Confederacy did they cease
 to be sovereign by their
 act in the adoption of
 the Fed eral Constitution Did
 they bccome a single na
 tion ora consolidated political unity
 or did they remain a
 Confederacy of States That they
 acted as States as separate
 sovereign communities in the framing
 and ratification of the Constitution
 is un deniable The vote
 in convention was by States
 each State by its delegates
 having but one vote The
 Constitution was transmitted tln ough
 the Congress of the Confederation
 to the Legislatures of the
 several States and was by
 them respect ively submitted to
 State conventions elected and assembled
 under the law of each
 State It was ratified by
 conventions severally of each State
 acting for itself and became
 obligatory by the the ratificatiöns
 of the con article declaring
 that ventions of nine Statcs
 shall be suffcient for the
 establishment of this Constitution between
 the States so ratifying the
 same The first State in
 the process of ratification was
 Delaware on the 12th December
 1787 the ninth New Hampshire
 on the 21st June 1788
 The Constitution was then established
 as a chart of Government
 be tween the nine ratifying
 States and had it gone
 into immediate operation Virginia New
 York North Carolina and Rhode
 Island would have been foreign
 States separate arid independent of
 the Confederacy and of each
 other And when the new
 Government went into operation in
 March 1789 North Carolina and
 Rhode Island having declined to
 ratify wcre foreign States and
 were treated as such In
 the act of July 31
 1789 The ratifications of the
 eleven States could not impose
 the Constitution on North Carolina
 and Rhode Island and the
 ratifications of twelve could not
 im poscit on Rhode Island
 and had sheneveracceded to the
 Constitution she would have remained
 to this day as separate
 and independent as France Eng
 l land or any other
 foreign Power Each State acted
 for itself and was bound
 by its own act and
 that alone in the adoption
 of the Constitution But tho
 States though sovereign had it
 may be said the power
 to abandon their sovereignty to
 annihilate themselves and createaneW nation
 and it is insistdd that
 this has been effected and
 that the grants and prohibitions
 of the Constitu 592 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 28 tion
 extinguish at least pro tanto
 the sovereignty itself of the
 States But this proposition is
 amis conception confounding the distinction
 between sovereignty and the functions
 and powers of sov ereignty
 The latter in representative Govern
 ments must be exercised by
 agents but the sov ereignty
 itself remains in the principal
 namely the people from whom
 the powers are derived and
 by whom they may be
 recalléd It generally conceded that
 the grants of powers in
 the constitution of a State
 do not affect the sovereignty
 which remains in the p_olitical
 body namely the people who
 can alter modify and revoke
 such constitution This being admitted
 can it be contended that
 the delegation by several States
 of certain powers of sovereignty
 to be ex ercised conjointly
 by a Federal Government or
 common agency instituted by them
 for that pur pose impairs
 the sovereignty of each of
 the States These powers being
 delegated remain the powers of
 the principal By the delegation
 of a portion of its
 powers the State is not
 anni hilated She still retains
 her separate organization her existence
 as a distinct political community
 her independent Legislature her con
 trol over the property social
 and domestic relations and crim
 maljunsdiction of the country every
 right and power not delegated
 and in fact her body
 politic in every respect and
 has not lost that sovereignty
 residing as an active regulated
 recognized and all controlling power
 in the people of the
 State And such is theauthoritative
 opinion of most dis tinguished
 publicists on the sovereignty of
 States in confederation Vattel Book
 1 chap 184 says Every
 nation that governs itself under
 what form so ever without
 dependence on any itreign Power
 is a sov ereign State

 and independent States may unite

 Such were t hc cities
 of Greece such are at
 present the seven United Provinces
 of the Netherlands and sucb
 the members o tltc Helvetic
 body Judge Tucker the distinguished
 commentator on Blackstone treats this
 subject in a verylucid manner
 as follows This independemey of
 States and their being distinct
 political bodies frotn each other
 is not obstructed by any
 alliancc Q confederacies whatsoever nbout
 exercisin jointly any parts of
 the suprelne power such as
 those of peace and war
 in leagues offensive and defensive
 States notwithstanding such treaties are
 separatc bodies and indcbendcnt They
 are then only deemed politically
 united when some one person
 or council Is constituted with
 a right to exercise sonle
 essential powers jör both and
 to hinder cither from exercising
 thetn separately If any person
 or council is empowered to
 exercise all these cssential pow
 ers for both they arc
 then one State such is
 the state of England and
 Scotland since the net of
 union at the beginning of
 the eighteenth century whereby the
 two king dotns were inéorporated
 into one all parts of
 the suprennc power of kingdozns
 be ing tl enceförward united
 and vested in the threc
 estates of the realrn of
 Great Britain by which entire
 coalition though both retain their
 ancient laws aucl usaues in
 many respects they are as
 effectually united and incorporated as
 tlle several petty kingdoms which
 cornposed the Heptarchy were betöre
 that period But when only
 a portion of the suprelne
 civil power is vested in
 one person or council for
 both sucli as that of
 peace and war or of
 deciding controversies between dif terent
 States or their subjects whilst
 each State within itself exercises
 other parts of the supreme
 power independ ently of ali
 the thers in this case
 they are called systems of
 States which Burlamaqui defines to
 be an assemblage if perfect
 governments strictly united by some
 connnon bond so that they
 seem to make but a
 single body with re spect
 to those affairs which interest
 them in enrnmon though eacii
 preserves its sovereignty full and
 entire inde pendentiy of all
 the others in this case
 he adds the confederate States
 engage to each other only
 to exercise with common consent
 certain parts of the sovereignty
 especially those which relate to
 their Inutual defense against foreign
 enemies But each of the
 confederates retains an entire liberty
 of exercising as it thinks
 proper those parts of the
 sovereicnty which arc not nentioned
 in the treaty of union
 as parts that ought to
 be exercised in coznmon And
 of this nature is the
 American Confödcracy in which each
 State has resigned the exer
 cise of certain part of
 the suprerne civil power which
 they possessed before except in
 conunon with the other States
 included in the Confederacy reserving
 to themselves all their Ormer
 povvcrs which are not delegated
 to the United States by
 the eonnnon bond of Union
 A visible distinction and not
 less important than ob vious
 occurs to our observation in
 comparing these differ ent kinds
 of union I he kingdoms
 of England and Scot laud
 are united into one kingdom
 and the t wocontracting States
 by such an incorporate union
 are in the opinion of
 Judge Blackstone totally annihilated without
 any power of revival and
 a third arises from their
 conjunction in whiéh all the
 rights of sovereignty and particularly
 that of legislation are vested
 From whence he ex presses
 a doubt whether any infringements
 of the fundamental and essen
 tial conditions of the union
 would of itself dissolve the
 union of those kingdorns though
 he readily adnlits that in
 the case of a federate
 alliance such an infringernent would
 certainly rescind the eotnpact between
 tbe confederate In the United
 States Ameriea on the contrary
 States each State retains its
 own antecedent form of government
 its own laws subject to
 the alteration and control of
 its own Legislature only its
 own exccutive offcers and coun
 cil of State its own
 courts of judicature its own
 judges its own magistrates civil
 officers and omcers of the
 nril itia and in short
 its own civil State or
 body politic in every respect
 whatsoever And by the express
 declaration of the twelfth article
 to the amendments to the
 Constitu tion the powers not
 delegated toqlne United States by
 the Constitution nor prohibited by
 it to the States are
 reserved to the States respectively
 or to the people In
 Great Britain a new civil
 State is created by the
 annihilation of two an tecedent
 clvll States jn the American
 States a general federal council
 and administrative is provided tar
 the joint exercise of such
 of their several powers as
 can be morc conveniently exercised
 in that modc than any
 other leav ing thcir civil
 State unaltered and all the
 other powers which the States
 antecedently possessed to be exercised
 by them respectively as if
 no Union or connection were
 estab between thenn Some of
 the higher powers of sovereignty
 arc delegated to the General
 Government but this has no
 greater efficiency in transferrino sovereignty
 itself than the grant of
 its most insignificant func tion
 or attribute When Texas was
 a separate Republic she exercised
 all those grand powers of
 peace and war of alliances
 and the regulation of foreign
 commerce which throw such dazzling
 luster over the Government of
 the United States She had
 intrusted these and other powers
 under her constitution to a
 single agent namely thc Government
 of the Republic By virtue
 of her sovereignty which she
 had not relinquished or impaired
 she at the period of
 annexation dis tributed these powers
 between two agents one the
 Federal and the other her
 present State Gov ernment Is
 she not as soverei n
 now as She m vas
 before this distribution Is not
 the General Gov ernment to
 which she has delegated some
 of her powers just as
 much her trustee as was
 the Gov ernment of Ehe
 Republic to which she had
 formerly intrusted them And has
 she not the samo right
 and power to resume them
 now that she had to
 recall them from her former
 trustee and vest them in
 her present agent attorney She
 has not abandoned the powers
 ceded to the Federal Gov
 crnment she has only delegated
 them She is still a
 State a political body with
 control over the lives the
 liberties and property of her
 people She entered the Confederacy
 by compact and the cession
 of some of her powers
 does not detract from her
 sovereignty The deliberations in com
 mon says Vattei offer no
 violence to the sov ereignty
 of each member of a
 confederacy The power of the
 General Government to pun ish
 individuals for crimes to collect
 taxes and im posts from
 individuals the direct consent of
 the State is relied on
 as an aroument that the
 Union is not a Confederacy
 of States but is a
 consolidated Governrnent over the people
 of the It is generally
 conceded that the United States
 States were parties to the
 old Confederacy that they were
 sovereicn and yet postage under
 that Confederacy was collected from
 individuals mili tary and naval
 officers were appointed with juris
 diction over life and men
 were executed under that jurisdiction
 and courts of admiralty had
 ju risdiction over persons and
 property Jurisdic tion over individuals
 then does not destroy the
 In the forty federative character
 of the Union fifth number
 of the Federalist Mr Madison
 says that the new Constitution
 Consists much less in the
 addition of new powers to
 the Union than in the
 invigoration of its original powers
 regulation of emnmerce it is
 true is a new power
 powers relatill to war and
 peace armies and fleets treat
 ies and finance with t
 he other nore considerable powers
 are ali vested i n
 the existing Congress by the
 Articles of Contöderation INhe proposed
 change does not enlarge these
 powers it only substitutes a
 more effective method of ad
 ministering l he change relating
 to taxation Inay be regarded
 as thc most important and
 yét the present Con gress
 have as cornplcte authority to
 require of the St ateg
 indefinite supplies of Inoney tlie
 common defense and general weltäre
 as the future Congress will
 have to re quire them
 of individual citizens and the
 latter will be no n
 noro bound than thc States
 thmnselves have been to pay
 the quotas respectively taxed on
 them I have shown that
 in certain particulars there was
 under the confederation a direct
 connection between the Government and
 individuals and the only effect
 of extending this direct action
 to the operations of the
 Government generally was to impart
 energy and vigor but not
 to change tbe federative character
 of the Union Had the
 States paid their quotas or
 could the payment have been
 enforced by the like peaceable
 processes which are successful against
 single persons there would have
 been little or no necessity
 for the adoption of a
 new Constitution But the action
 of the Federal Government whether
 upon the State gov ernments
 or on single persons has
 force in a State by
 its assent only and whether
 the State collects the taxes
 and pays them over to
 the General Gov ernment or
 whether by her concurrence the
 func tionaries of that Government
 collect them from individuals can
 be of no importance nor
 can it detract from the
 sovereignty of the State or
 con vert a confederacy of
 States into a consolida tion
 The phraseology of the preamble
 We the people of the
 United States is often relied
 upon In support of the
 position that the Constitution was
 framed by the whole people
 of the United States and
 not by the people of
 the several States as distinct
 communities The preamble as reported
 by the cornmittce of details
 was We the people of
 the States of New Hampshire
 Mas sachusetts Rhode Island e
 through the thirteen This was
 altered by the committee of
 style and arrangement to yve
 the people of the without
 assigning any reason for United
 States the change But the
 phrases are the equivalents of
 each other The States were
 thefe in confed eracy The
 Articles of Confederation were in
 terms between New Hampshire Massachusetts
 c and the style of
 the Confederation was the United
 States of America and the
 terms t people of New
 specifying the whole of them
 and the people of the
 United States were identically the
 same thing in mean ing
 and substance There was however
 a sub stantial reason for
 the change in this instance
 The Constitution was to be
 binding between those Slates only
 that ratified the same and
 the States which would accede
 to this new Union could
 not be known or enumerated
 until after the acts of
 If thc old Union was
 but a Confed ratification eracy
 and that is admitted the
 new cannot be a consolidation
 from the use of the
 phrase Uni ted States which
 was in fact the s
 tyle and title of the
 old Confederacy and which was
 expressly between the thirteen States
 by specification and title or
 between the people of those
 States for the pcoplo of
 a State as a politicai
 body is the State itself
 The sixth article of the
 Constitution declarincr the Constitution and
 lax vs made in pursuance
 there of and treaties to
 be the supremo law of
 the land is supposed to
 give the General Government spe
 Cial supremacy beyond the control
 of the States and in
 fact subject to no control
 except the will of a
 majority of the people of
 the United States This is
 not so much a new
 power as a more spe
 cific expression of the intent
 of the stipulation in the
 Articles of Confederation that Every

 stitution and laws of the

 constant collision with those of
 the States The constitution and
 laws of one State vary
 from those of other States

 United States were paramount they
 might bc valid in some

 of all the States should

 would have been almost nugatory

 O THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 20
 SESSION that had delegated the
 powers to both of these
 governments Another against the sovereignty
 of the States is that
 treason may be committed against
 the United States that treason
 is a breach of allegiance
 that allegiance is due to
 a sovereign and that therefore
 the United States are sover
 eign It is certainly competent
 for a number of sovereigns
 to stipulate that war levied
 against them in their united
 capacity should be defined and
 punished as treason Would the
 United States have had the
 power to define and punish
 the crime of treason without
 express grant in the Constitution
 Certainly not In 1892 a
 ques tion was raised whether
 the German confedera tion was
 a State ana consequently the
 object of treason The Diet
 for future cases decreed to
 the effect that since every
 State was part and par
 cel of the confederation crime
 s committed against the Confederation
 should be punished as treason
 against every particular State Westminster
 Review July 1860 Legislation was
 required in Germany before the
 crime against the confedera tion
 could be punished and had
 it been determined that the
 crime should be punished as
 treason against the State where
 committed its soundness could not
 have been disputed But if
 the Constitution had not defined
 the crime of levying x
 var as treason against the
 Uni ted States would not
 the offense have been trea
 son against the State where
 committed The Con stitution and
 laws of the United States
 are in fact the laws
 and constitution of the State
 and the crime might have
 been regarded as a breach
 of allegiance to the State
 But nothing can be inferred
 against the federa tive character
 of the Union from the
 fact that a crime amainst
 the common Government is defined
 and is to be punished
 as treason This is the
 stipulation and agreement of the
 several sovereign parties They were
 under no compulsion to adhere
 strictly to the technicality that
 treason was the breach of
 allegiance They had the power
 to define any crime against
 them jointly to be treason
 If waracyainst the old Con
 federacy had been defined treason
 a rainst the Uni ted
 States this would not have
 impugned its Character as a
 federation nor the sovereignty of
 the constituent States nor can
 it derogate from the sovereignty
 of these parties that in
 the new compact they defined
 the crime of levying war
 against them jointly to be
 treason and provided for its
 punishment From the facts and
 considerations detailed the conc usion
 is irresistible that the States
 were each one of them
 sovereign prior to the adoption
 of the Federal Constitution that
 the Constitution is a compact
 between these sovereign States by
 which they delegated a portion
 of the powers of sovereignty
 to be exercised conjointly by
 a Gen era Government that
 they reserved to themselves all
 the powers not delegated that
 they still con tinued as
 States that they ratified the
 Constitu tion each State for
 itself in its highest sovereign
 capacity in convention asscmbled in
 each State under the law
 thereof that it became binding
 on the people of each
 St ate by the act
 of the Slate and not
 by the ratification of any
 or of all the other
 States that the people of
 the several States acting as
 distinct political communities were the
 parties to the compact that
 no such political body has
 existed as the people of
 the United States nor were
 they a party to the
 compact in a politi cal
 capacity or otherwise except as
 the people of thirteen separate
 and distinct States that though
 high and important powers of
 sovereignty were delegated yet itself
 remained in the people severally
 of the States that they
 have only delegated powers not
 sovereignty Each State or the
 people of each State as
 a WEDNESDAY JANUARY 90 1861
 cise is prescribed Its acts
 are paramount and all authorities
 and citizens must submit to
 its de cision But the
 State is in every respect
 as much a sovereign with
 regard to the powers it
 has del egatcd to the
 general agency or Government as
 to those which it delegated
 to its State govern It
 has control over all those
 powers be ment cause they
 are only delegated not surrendered
 or abandoned to either of
 these governments If they were
 relinquished the State would no
 longer exist as a body
 politic the sovereignty would be
 in the Government to which
 it was transferred and to
 the people would be left
 not thatregulated right acknowled ed
 and recognized by Ameluan theory
 and practice but that imaginary
 sover eighty which is supposed
 to exist even under a
 despotic moßarchy The States and
 they alone being parties to
 the Constitution it is as
 between them a compact or
 league although it is a
 frame of Government for those
 upon whom it operates and
 the States being sovereign members
 of this league or confeder
 acy have a right as
 stable as the foundations of
 international law to renounce the
 league at any time and
 wit hdraw from the federation
 They are bound to their
 confederates by the ties of
 good I faith The tranquillity
 and security of mankind depend
 upon a due regard to
 the rights of others But
 each State can with or
 without cause sepa rate from
 the others being answerable as
 one nation is to another
 If a treaty has been
 already violated by the other
 part ies her separation is
 no just cause of war
 Each party or nation must
 judge for itself and if
 her confederates will make war
 upon a seceding State with
 or without cause she must
 abide the issue The right
 of secession depends on international
 law It is above and
 independent of the Constitution If
 however sovereignty itself was but
 a right then it exists
 in the State among the
 reserved rights under the Constitution
 Such right has not been
 prohibited to the States But
 sovereignty is the creator not
 the creature of constitutions The
 Const itu tion docs not
 deal with sovereignly in any
 other manner except as receiving
 all its grants and au
 thority from that source Ifthe
 States be sovereign the act
 of withdrawal cannot without an
 utter misconception and con fusion
 of terms be pronounced rebellion
 This is the open renunciation
 of the authority of the
 Government to which one owes
 allegiance The distinction between a
 rebel and an enemy is
 that the former owes allegiance
 to the Governrnent he attacks
 Now a sovereign State owes
 no alle fts citizen owes
 obedience gtance to any power
 to the Government of the
 United States as long as
 the State remains a member
 of the Union ao knowledging
 its jurisdiction and claiming the
 benefit of its protection He
 owes this obedience solely from
 the act and consent of
 his State to the Constitution
 When this consent is recalled
 by a State when in
 the like sovereign capacity in
 which she gave her assent
 it is revoked she dissevers
 the ties between her citizens
 and the General Government and
 expunges their obliga tion to
 obey the Constitution or laws
 of the United Statés The
 act of a sovereign declarinff
 a compact league or treaty
 no longer binding on him
 has ncverbccn defined or treated
 as rebellion Whether there be
 or not just cause for
 such declaration it is no
 violation of his allegiance for
 he owes none to the
 cosovereign parties in the league
 and the act of the
 sovereign binds the citizen and
 absol ves him from obcdience
 to the compact T hc
 citizen is not individually responsible
 for the acts of the
 State to which his allegiance
 is due The Statc is
 responsible The citizen owes his
 allegiance to the State and
 is bound to obey her
 acts and these are a
 justification in law of his
 refusal to obey the NEW

 But if no coercion be

 by the denunciations of the
 Federal authorities that secession is
 unlawful seditious and rebellious they

 be ihduoed to oppose this
 denounced rebellion by force of

 no support from the Government

 tended that the power to
 enforce tho laws against individuals
 through peaceable processes before the
 ordinary magistracy should be so
 perverted as to authorize the
 use of force against States
 thus effecting by fraud and
 stratagem that which they openly
 denounced and solemnly refused The
 very statement of the case
 confutes the sup position Every
 arøument which had been urged

 under the new Union as
 the old Confeder at ion
 The change from the action

 aid of civil tribunals resort
 to force to suppress insurrections
 of disorderly and refractory individuals

 may bc wide spread embracmg
 vast masses of individuals but
 if the resistance be not
 organized under the authority of
 a State it is but
 an insurrection or rebellion and
 may be suppressed by the
 whole force of the Umted
 States But this power against
 insurgents was never to be
 used against States Our fåtbers
 suffered the Confederåcy to fall
 into total impotency rather than
 allow military force aoainst States

 not be enacted in your
 opulent and magnificent cities your
 great towns and beautiful hanilets
 If war should come its
 calamities will be inflicted on
 the whole country and blood
 will redden the streams of
 the North and the South
 Let no countenance be given
 the delusion that slavery is
 an element of weakness or
 that the South would be
 endangered from slave insurrec nons
 The heroes and conquerincr nations
 of antiquity were slaveholders I
 was born in the South
 have lived long upon the
 eartn and have never witnessed
 even an attempt at an
 insurrec tion Of the rumors
 ofthis character but very few
 have any foundation other than
 the causeless States of the
 Nordi and the United States
 of tho I South If
 the United States of Mexico
 and the States of America
 now live in peace to
 the mutual advantage of both
 countries why should not the
 confederacies that arc now springing
 into life be at peace
 The dissolution of this Union
 is not an end of
 free government Its power gives
 security and repose to the
 people and this is the
 cause of their rapid advancement
 in all the ele mcnts
 of prosperityand greatness But this
 devel opment and prosperity will
 flow on in increased volume
 and grandeur under any free
 Govern ments strong enough to
 repel foreign aggressiön and repress
 domestic dissension The two con
 federacies would in a few
 years bc cach of them
 more powerful than the existing
 Government and if there be
 amity between them there being
 no internal elements of discord
 in either confed eracy the
 progress and improvement of each
 would attain a height and
 greatness of which history furnishes
 no example I will notice
 but very briefly the chaige
 of in gratitude against the
 State of Texas should she
 attempt a separation from the
 United States It must be
 remembered that the United States
 did not by the annexation
 of Texas propose exclu sively
 or mainly the benefit of
 the latter The official records
 show that the honor peace
 and safety of the United
 States were the principal considerations
 Among other proofs of this
 i refer to the inaugural
 message of President Polk He
 said None can fäil to
 see the danger to our
 safety and future peace if
 Texas rcmains an independent State
 or becomes an ally or
 dependency of some foreign nation
 Inore pow erful than herself
 Is there one among our
 citizens who wou d not
 prefer perpetual peace with L
 exas to occasional wars which
 so often occur between bordering
 independent nations Is there one
 who would not prefer free
 intercourse with her to bigh
 duties on all our products
 and manufac turcs w llich
 enter her ports or cross
 her frontiers Is tliere one
 would not prefin an unrestricted
 communication with citizens to the
 frontier obstructions which must occur
 if sne remains out of
 the Union I will recur
 very briefly to the conditions
 of annexation The United States
 demanded the unconditional surrender of
 the arms and forts of
 Texas and all the mcans
 of public defense al though
 now when their own armg
 and forts are in question
 the savage cry of tho
 swarming mil lions of the
 North is we will have
 the forts or we will
 have blood i will not
 comment on the terms in
 relation to slavery The Statement
 of them would be their
 condemnati01 l This vast acces
 Sion to the United States
 of fertile territory in a
 delightful climate was characterized in
 the Pres ident s message
 01 Deccrnber 2 1840 as
 a blood less achievement I
 l e sword had no
 part nor did the purse
 havo any in the victory
 True Texas retained her public
 lands but those after the
 surrender of t he revenue
 from cus toms x vcre
 her principal resource for the
 extin in favor Of annexatioh
 a vioiation of good Texas

 there With a view to
 obt aiti dt honorablepeaee and
 t étébj to secure an
 ample bidetnnity for the as
 well as to our much
 injured citizens Who hold pecuniary
 demands against Mex co Ibis
 apparent from the message that
 the in vasion by Mexico
 of the territory of Texas
 was occasioned by the acceptance
 of the terms of an
 nexation by the latter that
 though Mexico struck the first
 blow yet the United States
 immediately assumed the aggressiVe extended
 her eon quests not for
 the defense of Texas butto
 secure indem nity for the
 expenses Of the the and
 wrongs of the injured citizens
 These griev ances had been
 set forth in the previous
 message of the President of
 May 11 1846 and Cobgress
 responded by the act of
 May 13 1846 adthöYiü ing
 fifty thousand volunteers and teh
 million ap propriat ion The
 proclamation from the War Department
 issued by General Taylor of
 June 4 1846 shows that
 the United States were QroS
 ecut ing the war for
 causes other than the defense
 alarm or though rarely a
 spirit of mischief I guishment
 of the sacred debt of
 the war of inde The
 phantasm that there is no
 sense of security pendence and
 for the support of the
 government in the South is
 utterly groundless and superla and
 the existence of the Republic
 But Texas is tively absurd
 Many of the slaves raised
 with charged at least indirectly
 with being the cause their
 masters joining with them in
 all the sports I of
 the war with Mexico with
 its enormous ex of boyhood
 the constant recipients of their
 kind ness in sickness and
 heatth would eagerly sacri fice
 their lives in their defense
 And all of them regarding
 their masters very justly as
 their guard ians and protectors
 would most willingly en counter
 dangcr and render service to
 secure their triumph But this
 would not be necessary the
 slaves would continue their agricultural
 labors while the war would
 rage in a sphere above
 them The food and supplies
 of the country would thus
 be constantly produced while these
 would be very much endangered
 in the free laborsections where
 every inhabitqnt may be dragged
 from his field to the
 camp Such very few insurrections
 as have occurred and the
 plans of risings that have
 been detected have invariably been
 partial limited to a neigh
 borhood county or small district
 The alarms have been partial
 and very quickly subside and
 the idea that the South
 would be required to em
 ploy part of its forces
 to prevent insurrection could have
 originated only in the disordered
 brain I of a fanatic
 and 1 dismiss it as
 unworthy of con sideration Bad
 men may attempt excitement and
 may create irritation but they
 will have no more success
 in disturbing the loyalty of
 the slave population than did
 John Brown in his raid
 at Harner s Ferry Why
 should there be war between
 the United i penditures of
 money and of the blood
 and lives of thousands who
 feli upon the battle field
 covered with imperishable honors Can
 it be possible that all
 these vast expenditures were incurred
 that State after State of
 Mexico was overrun that its
 proud Capital was occupied by
 our victorious arnües and all
 this for the defense of
 Texas and the integrity of
 her soil Let us examine
 the facts Mr Polk in
 his rnessagc of December 1846
 declares that the war with
 Mexico was not pro voked
 by the United States that
 After years of endurance ofaørrravated
 and unredressed wrongs on our
 part Mexico in violation of
 solen l treaty stipulations and
 of every principle of justice
 recognized by civilized nations cDffnncnced
 hostitities and thus by her
 own act föreed the war
 ltpon us Lon before the
 advance ot our Army to
 the Ict t bank of
 the Rio Grande we had
 ample cause of war against
 Mexico He presents a gloomy
 list of the insults and
 spoliations the wrongs and outrages
 committed by Mexico aoainst the
 citizens of the United States
 for a period of more
 than twenty years that if
 these had been resented the
 war would have becn avoided
 that the annexation of Texas
 wag no of Texas Here
 is the proclamation of General
 Taylor To the people of
 Meæico After many years of
 patient endurance tbc United States
 are at length constrained to
 acknowledge that a war now
 exists between our Govern ment
 and the Govcrntncnt of Mexico
 For many years our citizens
 have been subjected to repeated
 insults and inju ries our
 vessels and cargoes have been
 seized and corifie cated our
 nnerchants have been plundered inaimed
 im prisoned without cause and
 without reparation At length your
 Govermnent acknowledged the justice of
 our Claimi and agreed by
 treaty to make satisfaction by
 paymeritof several million dollars but
 this treaty has been Violated
 by your rulers and the
 stipulated payments have boen with
 held Our late efbrt to
 terminate all dlfieulties by peace
 Cul negotiation has been rejected
 by the Dictator Paredes and
 our minister of peace whOm
 your rulers had agreed tb
 receive has beeri retüsed hearing
 He has Lieen treated with
 indignity and insult and Paredes
 has announced that war exists
 between us And here are
 the purposes for which the
 war is waged We come
 to obtain reparation för repeated
 wrongs and injuries we come
 to obtain indemnity for the
 past and se curity för
 the future The only indemnity
 for the long deferred claims
 of our citizens and the
 reimbursementof the ex penses of
 the war vas stated in
 the message of December 1847
 to be a cession of
 a portion of the territory
 of Mexico to the United
 States that the doctrine of
 no territory was no indem
 nity and if sanctioned would
 be a public ac knowledgmcnt
 that our country was wrong
 that the war declared by
 Congress with extraordinäry unanimity was
 unjust and should be abandoned
 an admission unfounded in fact
 and degrading to thé national
 character This isan unequivoe cal
 acknowledgment that no matter with
 what in tent Me xicö
 may have stricken the first
 blow or in Other words
 shed American blood on Amefi
 can soil yet the United
 States prosecuted the war I
 to obtain indemnity for the
 grievous and aceumu lated wrongs
 of their citizens Texas is
 surely not responsible morally or
 otherwise or at least to
 but a limited extent for
 the vast expenditures of money
 or for the lives of
 i so many valiant and
 heroic men sacrificed in the
 prosecution of this war of
 conquest to indemnify citizens of
 the United States and secure
 them against future wrongs One
 effect of the war was
 tö secure Texas against foreign
 aggression and for that she
 has not been wanting in
 gratitude Another result was the
 cession of New Mexico and
 California to the United States
 or five hun dred and
 twenty six thousand and seventy
 eight i square miles west
 of the Rio Grande The
 latter namely California has supplied
 the xvorld with 500 000
 000 of its circulation all
 drawn from the rich mineral
 lands of the United States
 k If the gold be
 extracted by squatters without right
 or title it is the
 misfortune of the Government but
 does not impair the value
 of the acquisition The fortifications
 and the arms and military
 stores of the United States
 in Texas are 7too ut
 just cause of offense to
 Mexico that Texas bad teriy
 insignificant to deserve notice Of
 the more been an independent
 State for more than ten
 than thirty million dollars expended
 for fortifica years that the
 threats of Mexico to invade
 the tions in the United
 States but 500 have been
 territory of Tl exas became
 more imposing as it laid
 out in Texas There is
 but a beggarly dc became
 more apparent that Texas would
 decide count of small arms
 in the United States arsenals
 596 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 28 few more perhaps than
 five thou sand including the
 serviceable and unserviceable The sale
 four years after annexation of
 a large portion of the
 territory of Texas to the
 United States has frequently been
 made the subject of reproach
 The cry that our title
 was not good inéulting and
 groun dléss as it is
 has become stale from repetition
 The boundary of Texas from
 the mouth of the Rio
 Gi ande to its source
 was proclaimed by Texas from
 the commencement of hef revolution
 and was recognized in the
 first law on her statute
 book in 1836 That this
 was the boundary öf Texas
 fixed by legislation was known
 to Mexico it was known
 to the United States and
 to the great Powers of
 Europe among whomuwe took rank
 as a nation The war
 be tween Texas and Mexico
 was not about bound Mexico
 claimed the whole country and
 so did Texas though during
 the progress of annex aLiön
 Mexico proposed to acknowledge the
 in dependence of rcxäs leaving
 the boundary to future negotiations
 By the articles of annexation
 Texas author ized the United
 States to adjust all questions
 of boundary that might arise
 with Mexico The title of
 Texas to the whole of
 her territory was founded upon
 the sword She was under
 no moral legal or international
 obligation to restrict the limits
 Of the Republic to the
 lines of the old prov
 ince of Texas not did
 the validity of her title
 at with respect to the
 United States depend upon the
 actüalpossession and jurisdiction over every
 foot of her territory And
 such was the opinion öf
 the United States in sending
 troops to the lower Rio
 Grande The country in the
 im mediate vicinity of that
 river had been and was
 then in the occupation of
 the Mexican authorities and all
 the acts of that de
 facto Government rela tive to
 private rights up to possession
 by the American troops have
 been recognized by the jtidieial
 tribunals ns valid and binding
 But yet the United States
 asserted the right of Texas
 and declared that t bc
 blood of her soldiers poured
 out on the battle fields
 of Palo Alto and Resaca
 le la Palma was American
 blood shed upon Ameri can
 soil The United States from
 annexation in 1846 to 1850
 recognized the validity of our
 title to the country cast
 of the upper Rio Grande
 General Kearny in taking possession
 of New Mexico in August
 1846 speaking in tho name
 of his Gov ernment declared
 to the people that he
 considered and had for sorne
 time considered the country as
 a part of thc territory
 of the United States rill
 is It could was an
 assertion of the title of
 Ei exas not possibly have
 becn a part of the
 United Slates unless by being
 a part of Texas The
 President in February 1847 admitted
 that the possession of the
 country by the United States
 was held in subserviency to
 the title of Texas This
 will be seen by refirence
 to his special message of
 July 24 1848 I Jere
 is the message of Mr
 Polk Under the circutnstnnces existing
 during the pendency the whole
 or New Mexico as of
 the war and while claimed
 by our cne n y
 was in our njilitary occupation
 I wag not u ilEnindf1il
 o the rights of Texas
 to that portion of it
 which she claimed to be
 within her Iirrtüs In answer
 to a letter ftorn the
 Governor of l e xas
 dated on the lth of
 January 1847 the Secretary ot
 St ate by nny direction
 införmed hill in a letter
 of the 12th of February
 1847 that in the President
 s annuak message o December
 1846 you have already perceived
 that Now Mexico is at
 present in the temporary occupation
 troops of the Un it
 ed States and the government
 over it is military in
 its character is Inerely such
 a government as Inust exist
 under the laws Of nations
 and of war to preserve
 order and pt o cct
 the rights of the inhabitants
 and will cease on the
 conclusion of a treaty of
 peace with Mexico Nothing therefore
 can be Inore certain than
 that this trexuporary government re
 stilting from necessity can never
 in juriously aft ect the
 right Which the Ptesident believes
 to be justly asserted by
 Texas to the whole territory
 on this side of the
 Ri0 Grande when ever the
 Mexican clairn to it shall
 have becn extinguished to it
 by treaty But this is
 a subject which more properly
 belongs to the legislative than
 the executive branch of the
 Governrncnt The resu t of
 the whole is that Texas
 had asserted a right to
 that part of New Mexico
 east of the Rio Grande
 which is beiievcd under the
 acts ot Conqress för the
 an noxation and admission of
 Texas into the Union as
 a State and under the
 constitution and laws ot Texas
 to be well töundcd Pellditv
 the negotiations Mr Trist our
 com missioner asserted the obligation
 of the United States to
 delénd thc title of Texas
 He said that Until ascertained
 by a cornpact or atrru
 nnent between the United States
 and Mexico the boundary between
 the two Republics when considered
 with reference t o the
 na ional obligation to protect
 their territory frorn invasion could
 be none other than that
 very boundary which had been
 asserted by Texas herself On
 the 12th of October 1848
 the Secretary of War Governor
 Marcy in his instructions to
 the commanding officer at Santa
 Fé declared that In regard
 to that part of what
 the Mexicans call Nes v
 Mexico lying east of the
 Rio Grande the civil authority
 Which Texas has established or
 Inay establish there is to
 be respected and in mo
 manner to be interfered with
 by the military force in
 that department otherwise than to
 lend aid on proper oocasions
 in enforcing it These extracts
 are evidence of the opinions
 of the Administration at the
 time of the annexation of
 Texas thatprosecuted the war against
 Mexico ne gotiated the treaty
 and had a thorough knowledge
 of all questions growing out
 of the annexation pol icy
 and the war with Mexico
 But the impregna ble basis
 of the title of Texas
 was thatshe was ad mitted
 as a State with boundaries
 N vhich were not changed
 modified or restricted by the
 treaty with Mexico that the
 boundary of the Uhited States
 was so extended as to
 embrace the utmost limits of
 Texas On these facts the
 United States became utterly powerless
 with regard to the title
 of Texas The boun dary
 of Texas could n o
 more be disturbed by the
 United States than could the
 boundary of anv other State
 or of even any foreign
 nation It Ihas been settled
 since thoufoundation of the Government
 that Congress hus no power
 over the boundaries of a
 State and the United States
 ad mittcd the doctrinc for
 years after the annexation of
 Texas The United States was
 the trustee of Texas in
 settling the boundary question and
 could not have acquired the
 subject matter in op position
 to the right of the
 principal Ilhe act would be
 a fraud of ineffable baseness
 void in all courts and
 countries where right and equity
 are recognized She was in
 one sense the umpire and
 could she end the controversy
 by tortiously converting the property
 to her own use But
 notwithstanding the acts and admissions
 through the four years of
 Mr Polk s adminis tration
 und the indisputable validity of
 the title of Texas the
 succeeding Administration evinced hostility which
 culminated in the message of
 August 6 185 menacing punishment
 againét all altetnpts to enforce
 the laws of Texas that
 the troops under the cornmand
 of the State of Texas
 should be treated as intruders
 and trespassers and that the
 forces of the United States
 would be employed to coercc
 a sovereio n State punish
 her citizens acting in obedience
 to her command as criminals
 and eject her authorities and
 laws from a largo portion
 of her prescribed and defined
 lim its Under such circumstances
 with the uplifted sword in
 the one hand and the
 purse in the other the
 United States proposed a purchase
 of thc Ter ritory Texas
 was in no condition to
 accept hostilities She had prior
 to annexation been exhausted by
 the troubles with Mexico and
 the savage She was hourly
 acquiring strength by repose and
 tran quillity She chose the
 alternative that true policy dictated
 Pence was everything to her
 War would have blasted her
 prosperity She determ ined to
 disregard the offensive circumstances of
 the proposal to purchase and
 accept it as most conducive
 to her highest interest and
 solid and permanent advantage The
 alternative was pain fu The
 dismemberment of u nution s
 territory pierces the heart of
 every citizen It is never
 sub mitted to unless to
 avoid still greater evil And
 shall the United States who
 extorted this terri tory from
 Texas at almost literally the
 point of bayonet in order
 to conceal the odium of
 tbc out rage be suffered
 to pervert the whole transaction
 and even invoke sympathy as
 a purchaser of a defective
 title Will the despoiler fill
 the air With his cries
 and complaints as if he
 himself had been I have
 said enough the vrctin But
 I forbear to vindicate the
 title of Texas And whether
 her title were good or
 bad the United States ought
 to bc forever silent orif
 she spoke to pray that
 the angel of mercy might
 ox punge the whole act
 from the pages of history
 have spoken to repel assault
 but in no cap tious
 or querulous spirit On the
 behalf of Texas I disdain
 the language of complaint I
 vindicate the truth of history
 nothing more Freely without price
 Texas brought an em Pire
 to the United Slates Her
 admission was arsenals nocustom houses
 and stored but a very
 limited supply of arms Thirty
 million people cannot be drawn
 into war for the defense
 of any miserable forts on
 the coast of Texas We
 have none The United States
 have expended large amounts annually
 in maintaining the troops in
 Texas Troops in well organized
 military arrangements are stationed on
 the frontiers of a country
 these frontiers have been desolated
 by the savage One hundred
 lives wére sacrificed last year
 and within a montb or
 two thirty were massacred with
 the most shocking barba ities
 The troops must be supported
 let them be stationed where
 they will Texas will never
 forget the benefits she has
 de rived from the Union
 She has received none from
 direct legislation But she has
 had peace and tranquillity She
 has had a sense of
 security and she has increased
 from one hundred thousand to
 six hundred thousand persons and
 advanced rapidly in all the
 elements of wealth and power
 Texas appreciated the advantages she
 derived from Mexico the immcnse
 grants of land exemption from
 taxation the mild ad ministration
 of her laws But for
 causes justified by the s
 vorld Texas was impelled to
 a separation and now on
 grounds deemed essential to her
 security and happiness she will
 feel herself constrained to dissolve
 con nection with this Confederacy
 fling again her glorious and
 triumphant banner to the breeze
 and establish on a secure
 basis the rights the lib
 erties and the happiness of
 her people MI CLINGMAN I

 To the Senate and Ilouse
 of Representatives of t he
 United States I deem itmydutyto
 submit to Congrcss a series
 of resolutions adopted by the
 Legislature of Vir crinia on
 t he 19t h instant
 having in view a peace
 ful settlcment of the exciting
 questions which now threaten the
 Union They wvere delivered to
 me on Thursday the 24th
 instant by ox President Tyler
 who has left his dignified
 and honored re tirernent in
 the hope that he may
 render service to his country
 in this its hour of
 peril These res olutions il
 will be perceived extend an
 invitation to all such States
 whether slaveholding or non slaveholding
 as are willing to unite
 with Virginia in an earnest
 effort to adjust the present
 unhappy controversies in the spirit
 in which the Constitu tion
 was originally formed and consistently
 with its principles so as
 to afford to the people
 of the slaveholding States adequate
 guarantees for the security of
 their rights to appoint commission
 ers to meet on the
 4th day of February next
 in the city of Washington
 similar commissioners appointed by Virginia
 to consider and if prac
 ticablc agree upon some suitable
 adjustment I confess I hail
 this movement on thc part
 of Virginia with great satisfaction
 From the past history of
 this ancient and renowned Common
 wealth we have the fullest
 assurance that what she has
 undertaken she will accomplish if
 it can bc done by
 able enlightened and perseverinT efforts
 It is highly gratifying to
 know that other patriotic States
 have appointed and are appoint
 ing commissioners to mect those
 of Virginia in council When
 assembled they will constitute a
 body entitled in an eminent
 degree to the confi dence
 of the country The General
 Assembly of Virginia have also
 resolved thatex PresidentJohn Tyler is
 hereby appointed by the concurrent
 vote of each branch of
 the General Assembly a commissioner
 to the President of the
 United States and Judge John
 Robertson is hereby appointed by
 a like vote a commissioner
 to the State of South
 Carolina and the other States
 that have seceded or shah
 secede with instructions respectfully to
 request the Pres ident of
 the United States and the
 authorities of such States to
 affl ee to abstain pending
 the pro ceedings cont emplatcd
 by the action of this
 Gen era Assembly from any
 and all acts calculated to
 produce a collision of arms
 between the States and the
 Government of the United States
 However strong may be my
 desire to enter into such
 an agreement I am convinced
 that I do not 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE possess the
 power Congress and Congress alone
 under the war making power
 can exercise the discretion of
 agreeing to abstain from any
 and all acts calculated to
 produce a collision of arms
 between this and any other
 Government would therefore be a
 usurpation for the Execu tive
 to attempt to restrain their
 hands by an agree ment
 in regard to matters over
 which he has 110 constitutional
 control If he were thus
 to act they might pass
 laws which hc should be
 bound to obey though in
 conflict with his acreement Under
 existing circumstances my present ac
 tual power is confined within
 narrow limits It is my
 duty at all times to
 defend and protect the public
 property within the seceding States
 so far as this may
 be practicable and especially to
 em ploy all constitutional means
 to protect the prop erty
 of the United States and
 to preserve the public peace
 at this the seat of
 the Federal Govt If the
 seceding States abstain from ernment
 any and all acts calculated
 to produce a collision of
 arms then the danger so
 much to be depre cated
 will no longer exist Defense
 and not aggression _has been
 the policy of the Adminis
 tration from the beginning But
 whilst I can enter into
 no engagement such as that
 proposed I cordially commend to
 Con gross with much confidence
 that it wvill meet their
 approbation to abstain from passing
 any law cal culated to
 produce a collision of arms
 pending the proceedings contemplated by
 the action of the Genaral
 Assembly of Virginia I am
 one of those who will
 never despair of the Republic
 I yet cherish the belief
 that the American people will
 perpetuate the Union of the
 States on some terms just
 and honorable for all sections
 of the country trust that
 the mediation of Virginia may
 bc tho destined means under
 Providence of accomplish ing this
 inestimable benefit Glorious as are
 the memories of her past
 history such an achieve ment
 both in relation to her
 own fame and the svelfare
 of the whole country would
 surpass them JAMES BUCHANAN all

 the Governor GEORGE W MUNFORD
 Secretary of the Commonwealth Mr
 STANTON 1 move that that
 message be printed and referred
 to the standing Committee on
 Military Affairs Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 move as an amendment
 to that motion that it
 he referred to the special
 committee of five Mr HOWARD
 of Michigan I would sug
 gest that whatever committee the
 message is re ferred to
 ought to have power to
 report it back at any
 time otherwise it will be
 locked up where the House
 cannot control it Mr BURCH
 The gentleman from Virginia only
 yielded the floor for the
 reading of the mes sago
 and is now entitled to
 the floor The SPEAKER It
 is proper that the mes
 sage should be disposed of
 in some way Mr STANTON
 If the House will allow
 me I will move that
 the message be referred to
 the standing Committee on Military
 Affairs with power to report
 on it at any time
 The SPEAKER That motion is
 not in order A motion
 has been made to refer
 the message to the Committee
 on Military Affairs and the
 gen tlcman from New York
 moves as an amendment that
 it be referred to the
 special committee of five Mr
 BOCOCK If there is to
 be any debate on this
 motion it should be allowed
 to go over until my
 colleague Mr PRYOR makes his
 speech Mr STANTON I move
 the previous question Mr CURTIS
 The question should first be
 taken on the motion to
 refer to the Committee on
 Military Affairs The SPEAKER That
 statement is correct The question
 is on refcrring the message
 to the Militar Committee Mr
 BOCOCK I am bound to
 interpose on behalf of my
 colleague who says he only
 yielded to have the message
 read Mr STANTON The previous
 question is demanded and that
 will put an end to
 the matter at once Mr
 MILLSON 1 think the question
 deserves some little consideration I
 thercfore move to postpone the
 further consideration of thc Presi
 dent s messao e till
 to morrow Mr STANTON very
 well let that course be
 taken The motion was agreed
 to STATE OF UNION The
 House resumed the consideration of
 the special order being the
 report of the special com
 mittee of thirty three on
 which Mr PRY0R was in
 no spirit of vindictive accusation
 Indeed entitled to the floor
 PRYOR Speaker before the House
 invitediscussion ofüll ihe issues involvcd
 in the present unhappy contrdversyi
 The rapid march of events
 outstrzppi nk thee dila tory
 movements of procrastinating leaves us
 no question to consider but
 tive of peace or war
 While yourtcommittee of compromise have
 been painfWly elaborating plans of
 f mean reparations üpon mighty
 ruins the dispute has becometipcapa
 ble of accommodation and the
 results their wis dom was
 to intercept are now accomplished
 and irrevocable facts Of the
 thirty threeStates which composed the
 Confederacy at the beginning Of
 this session six are no
 longer members of the Union
 Not many days will elapse
 before others will follow their
 example Sir It is an
 idle and unmeaning mockery x
 to _talk of preserving the
 Union and they Who indulge
 in this strtiin_of declamation betray
 little of tbe Candor demanded
 by the urgency of the
 occasions In thé preserice of
 so tremendo_us a catastrophe as
 that which now oppresses us
 the overthrow of partition of
 a great empire and the
 imminent hazard of civil war
 we owe it to ourselves
 and to the country tö
 be done with the expedients
 ofa timid and temporizing policy
 and to adAress ourselves to
 the emergenoy widhout reserve and
 without equivocation The issue before
 the country I repeat sir
 is the simple quest ion
 of peace or wai Acting
 as they conceive from the
 impulse of abundant prov ocation
 and exerting a power which
 they derive from the fundamental
 principles of this Govern ment
 the States of South Carolina
 Mississippi Florida Alabama Georgia and
 Louisiana have renounced the Confederacy
 and assumed the atti tude
 of independent republics The party
 into whose hands the control
 of the Administration is passing
 so far from a recourse
 to conciliatory measures and a
 recognition of the right of
 seces sion obdurately reject all
 overtures of compro mise and
 avow a purpose to employ
 all the re sources of
 Government for the subjugation of
 the retiring States And so
 it is that the calamities
 of civil x var are
 about to be precipitated upon
 the country Mr Speaker in
 the suspense of this dreadful
 expectation the people of the
 South are sustained by the
 conviction that after the passions
 and pre judices of the
 moment have passed away im

 with the obligations of the
 constitutional compact thatüe South has
 exhibited its patriotic fidelity In
 our conception something more was
 exacted by the association of
 fellow citizcnship and we have
 denied the people of the
 North no facility in trade

 policy which might promote their

 the demon of sectional discord

 have the loyalty and de
 votion of thc South been
 requited by our con federates
 of the North I propound
 the inquiry 602 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 28 sir Iwould
 despise myself no less than
 the public would reproach ine
 if at this august mo
 ment I should contribute anything
 to the exas perätion of
 passions already too much inflamed
 i advert to the wrongs
 vhich the South has en
 lured with no other view
 than to vindicate the position
 she has assumed in this
 controversy In what manner I
 repeat has the North repaid
 the fidelity with which the
 South has redeemed all thepledges
 of confederate faith and discharged
 all the duties of common
 citizenship At the epoch of
 the Revolution and indeed when
 thc Fcderal Government was organized
 slavery prevailed in the North
 as well as in the
 Söuth If not the chief
 it was at least conspicu
 ous among the interests for
 the protection of which our
 I present system of Government
 was established The Constitution distinguishes
 it by express and repeated
 recognition in each case fortifying
 it by particular guarantees Now
 sir against this great and
 vital interest an interest of
 which the pecuniary value is
 in dicated by countless millions
 and tbc importancc of which
 in the more essential aspect
 of social and political relation
 no form of expression can
 adequately represent an interest on
 which subsists the material prosperity
 of the southern States and
 with which thcii security and
 inde pendence are inseparably associated
 this inter est so vast
 and so vital is the
 object of organized and ificessant
 assault by those who are
 bound by every obligation of
 written covenant and confed erate
 faith to protect it They
 have launched against it the
 anathemas of moral and legal
 out lawry and have canvassed
 Christendom for re cruits in
 the crusnde of Abolitionism They
 have burdened it with iniquitous
 and oppressive impo sitions They
 have denied it the development
 without which it cannot long
 endure They have attacked it
 in detail by every variety
 of criminal expedient And finally
 they have essayed through the
 instrumentality of servile insurrec tion
 to involve the South in
 total and irreparable These wrongs
 know appeal in vain to
 the men by whom they
 are inflicted but I im
 agine a case analogous in
 all essential particulars in the
 contemplation of which they witl
 not bc likely to exhibit
 so rnuch of insensibility The
 manufacturing interest if not the
 main is amono thc most
 important of the industrial pursuits
 of New England Now sir
 suppose the other Stutes of
 the Confederacy should combinc for
 the spoliation of this interest
 and to that end should
 hold it up to universal
 execration should invoke upon it
 the vengeance of Heaven and
 proclaim it beyond the protect
 ion of sociot y suppose
 t hey should employ the
 agency of Government for its
 destruction should organize conspiracics to
 rav agc it and to
 impart the last t ouch
 of enormity to the outragc

 believes the peoplc of New
 F nglaild would pa tienlly
 ondurc this accumulation oc injuries
 they bc of so abject
 a submission they possess not
 the spirit of those ancestors
 of theirs with whom the
 most trivial exaction of illegal
 power was an insufferable oppression
 Yet these and greater grievances
 are endured hy the people
 of the slaveholding States but
 you only mock our complaints
 and tighten the crrasp of
 oppression Why marvel then that
 the day of resistancc and
 retribution is corne a t
 last But sir we do
 not rest the vindication of
 the South on thc slavery
 issue alone nor luainly Our
 adversaries availing themselves of the
 prevalent prejudieo against slavcry havc
 diligently repro sented that the
 secession of the South has
 no other object than the
 perpetuation of bondage and the
 effectof the misstatement is visible
 already in the unfriendly criticism
 of the foreign press time
 our cause were placed upon
 the true grounds of defense
 upon principles which instead of
 in sulating it from the
 sympathies of the world will
 corn mund respect wherever justice
 rules and the maxims of
 republi liberty are revered True
 it is that the grievances
 of which the South com
 plain affect chiefly the interests
 of slavery but It is
 a naprovv and unphilosophical view
 of the controversy to represent
 thc South as protcstino only
 against those cricvanres There indeed
 tho weight of the is
 most heaviiv fiAt but corn
 its source must be sought
 elsewhere mit an error in
 and what is möre o
 blunder in policy when we
 confound the practical effect with
 the radical principle of tyranny
 If we mean to apply
 the resources of true statesman
 ship to the disorders of
 the country we must dis
 cover and correct the organic
 derangements of the system i
 otherwise all our pretentious prescription
 is but the quackery of
 the empiric Sir for fifty
 years the interests of the
 South re posed and prospered
 under the sacred safeguards of
 the Constitution By that compact
 the equality of the States
 was guarantied their right of
 self government recognized and each
 member of the Confederacy mutually
 pledged to the others in
 a spirit Of fraternal alliance
 The States of the South
 acceded to the Union on
 those conditions on the conditions
 that they were to be
 the peers of their sovereiøn
 associates that their righ ts
 wrere to be inviolable and
 their property secure under the
 protection of the common Government
 This sacred covenant was the
 bond of union between the
 confederate Republics T hc Constitu
 tion im posed reciprocal obligations
 on the States and pledged
 them to mutual offces of
 good will In what manner
 are these pledges redeemed and
 these obligations fulfilled by the
 northern States Foremost in the
 cataloguo of southern griev ance
 is the complaint that the
 fundamental prin ciple of the
 Confcdcracy the equality of the
 States is subverted by a
 combination between a majority of
 States to exclude other States
 from an equal participation in
 the common domain and so
 to deny them equal advantages
 of expansion and development under
 the operation of the Federal
 Government Nay this Government itself
 is abused to the consummation
 of that iniquity To all
 candid men I appeal if
 this single fact of the
 exclusion of the South from
 any share and enjoyment of
 the joint territory of the
 States does not involve cvcry
 circumstance that can rouse the
 indignation of freemen a breach
 of constitu tional con pact
 a sti nna of inferiority
 a princi ple of civil
 disability and a measure of
 practical In private lilö individuals
 resent no grievance sooner than
 an invasion of their rights
 of property Amonff nations an
 oncronchrnenton their territorial possessions is
 an affront which war alone
 can redress Eat the exclusion
 of the South from the
 cornmon domain of the Conföder
 acy besides thesc circumstances of
 insult and ag gression ilnplies
 a breach of the most
 solemn stip ulation and a
 reflection the most offOnsive on
 the southern character For you
 cannot deny thö South equal
 rights in the Territories without
 sub verting the principles of
 the Constitution and in justification
 of this wrong the social
 system of the South is
 denounced as the sum of
 all vil lainics Whatother orgrcater
 grievance need the South urge
 in vindication of its conduct
 But this is not all
 In respect of another essen
 tial condition of Federal Union
 the guarantee of Stat e
 sovcreirrn t y the right
 Fcserved by each State ad
 rninist er its own affairs
 and to develop its to
 Intrtnony willi he general in
 own destinies tccests of the
 ConfLu eracy of this rnay
 have survived the systematic encroach
 Inents of Federal usurpation has
 vanished before the threat of
 military coercion A1 ready sove
 Cign States arc reduced in
 conternplation to the condition of
 provincial dependencies and that doom
 they would speedily realize but
 for the indomitable spirit which
 quails not before all the
 pony and circumstance of your
 martial prep aration Perhaps even
 these radical violations of the
 Constitution in its spirit and
 essence you natty repél as
 thc va uc refinements of
 a tcmpcr alert to discover
 material of sectional crimination Let
 us descend then for a
 moment to a sillgle in
 stance in illustration of the
 pcrfidy by which the South
 is defrauded of its covenanted
 rights An explicit provision of
 the constitutional compact exacts the
 restitution of fugitlve slaves vet
 that provision albeit so essential
 that wnhout it the South
 originally refused to join the
 Confederacy is sharnefully annulled by
 the 21 ortherrl States and
 by the default millions of
 southern property have been confiscated
 So flagrantly has the South
 been ich ted of its
 constitutional rights and de niod
 tl advantages of the Union
 a the burdens of whicn
 however it bears in enormous
 dispro portion What stronger argument
 than this of violated Faith
 and broken engagements of the
 invasion of chartered rio hts
 and the usurpation of forbidden
 power can be required in
 vindication if you please of
 revolutionary measures Alf writers except
 the partisans of divine right
 and passive obedi ence are
 agreed that an infraction of
 the implied contract between sovereign
 and subject absolves Ibis ihis
 principle the latter from his
 allegiance of constitutional liberty which
 distinguishes the great rebellion and
 the revolution of 1688 as
 the most glorious epochs in
 British history Say then there
 less obligation in a solemnly
 rati fied and written compact
 than in a tacit and
 dis puted engagement and are
 sovereign States denied a redress
 which the genius of free
 government guaranties to individuals But
 the defense of the South
 rests upon still stronger grounds
 and her secession from the
 Con federacy is justified by
 even higher principles than the
 right to vindicate a violated
 covenant Abso lute power is
 the essence of tyranny whether
 the power be wielded by
 a monarch or a multitude
 The dominant section in this
 Confederacy claims and exercises absolute
 power power without limitation and
 without responsibility without limitation since
 all the restrictions of the
 Consti tution are broken down
 and without responsi bility because
 in the nature of thing
 s the weaker interest cannot
 control the majority Of all
 species of tyranny the South
 is subjected to the most
 in tolerable Under the rule
 of a despot we might
 hope something of his impartial
 indifference be i tween the
 sections but to be exposed
 Lo the un bridled sway
 of a majority adverse in
 interest inimical in feeling and
 ambitious of domination is to
 be reduced to a condition
 more abject than that of
 the slaves whose emancipation is
 the pre text of all
 this controversy It is against
 this sectional domination this rule
 of the without law and
 without limit a rule asserted
 in subversion of the Constitution
 and establisl 10d on the
 ruins of the Confederacy it
 is in resistance to this
 despotic and detestable rule that
 the people of the South
 have taken up arms This
 ir sis the cause of
 the South and tell me
 if causc more just ever
 consecrated revo lution It is
 the cause of self government
 against the domination of foreign
 power the very cause for
 which our fathers fought in
 1776 Sooner than submit to
 the irresponsible rule of alien
 interests they tore themselves from
 the embrace of the I
 IY10thcr country and staked all
 in the triumph of secession
 Washington and Jefferson were the
 most illustrious of secessionists and
 we of to day are
 but walking in the light
 of their glorious example They
 held it unworthy of freemen
 to bear the burden of
 arbitrary imposition and they were
 not conciliated by the deceptive
 tender of partial representation in
 the British Parliament The South
 has her Representatives in this
 Capi tol but their voice
 is of no avail against
 the north ern majority She
 is taxed not with her
 own consent but by the
 votes of delegates whom she
 cannot control I repeat it
 is against the rule ofa
 sectional des potism that the
 South demands protection and It
 is to assert the cause
 of civil liberty that she
 declares her independence You of
 the North lavished your sympathy
 on the people of Hun
 gary in their revolt against
 Austrian absolut ism but our
 cause is identical in principle
 and in pur pose At
 this moment while you bestow
 admi ration and applause on
 the revolutionists of Italy 1
 would reniind you that the
 people of the South are
 moved by the same impatience
 of alien ascend ency and
 the same aspiration for self
 govern ment which after ages
 of slumber have at last
 I awakened the Italians to
 a recollection of their long
 lost liberties The cause of
 the South solicits recognition and
 regard by yet another consideration
 by a con sideration which
 appeals to the interest of
 every section To day it
 is slavery which suffers from
 the overthow of constitutional guarantees
 and the irresponsible reign of
 the majority But thc prin
 ciple of absolute power once
 ascendant in the Government no
 interest is secure aud circurn
 stances will determine a ai
 nst what object it may
 be directed If in contravention
 of tho compact of Union
 slavery may be oppressed by
 Federal action t he navigation
 of New England or the
 iron interest of Pennsylvania will
 be exposed to the same
 ruin whenever they shall incur
 the dis pleasure or invite
 the rapacity of other sections
 Che onlv safeguard 0k American
 liberty is in 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBfi maintaining the integrity
 ofthé Constitution and preserving intact
 the limitations of the Govern
 ment For that the South
 contends and all are alike
 concerned in the success of
 her cause If after the
 endurance of so many wronms
 and the menace of others
 still more intolerable any thing
 were wanting to justify the
 South in the pubhc opinion
 of the I vorld it
 would be supplied b her
 solicitude to avoid violence and
 redress her grievances within the
 Union W c arc rc
 proached I know with precipitancy
 in not awaiting an otert
 act of hostility from the
 sectional Administration Sir in our
 judgment a procla mation of
 war is an overt act
 and such proclama tion we
 find in the election by
 an exclusively sectional vote of
 a President pledged to put
 our rights and our property
 in course of ultimatc extinction
 a President who admonishes us
 in advance of his aggressive
 designs by the senten tious
 but significant declaration that they
 who deny freedom to others
 do not deserve it them
 selves and under a just
 God cannot long retain it
 We could not agree to
 await inactively the development of
 the disposition of the President
 elect for we claim to
 hold our rights by some
 higher and more solid tenure
 than the capri cious temper
 of any individual Indeed the
 argu ment of our opponents
 involves a concession of our
 case inasmuch as it implies
 that the rights of the
 South are no longer secured
 by constitutional guarantees but are
 suspendcd on the accident of
 an unfriendly Administration A more
 imperative consideration still determ ined
 the South to act at
 once and to act deci
 sively If negotiation might avail
 we thought to strengthen negotiation
 by a demonstration of our
 spirit Ifthe sword alone can
 reclaim our rights we were
 resolved not to be unprepared
 for the issue Mr Speaker
 since the fatal 6th of
 November to the present hour
 the Representatives of the South
 have invariably exhibited an accommodat
 ing dkposition The first day
 of our session was pacific
 adjustment of our difficulties A
 similar movement likewise originating with
 a southern man was initiated
 in the Senate Meanwhile various
 schemes of settlement have been
 submit ted in one or
 the other House of Congress
 which without much regard to
 their intrinsic cffcacy we have
 uniformly avowed our support while
 on the other side they
 have been as tun formly
 rejected with contemptuous disdain of
 commencement no doubt the next
 four years Will reconcile the
 South to the rule of
 the dominant party In aggravation
 of circumstances themselves sufiicienily exasperating
 the rumor too mon strous
 for belief that all these
 measures of coer cion against
 the South are stimulated and
 directed by a son whom
 the South has delighted to
 honor in proportion even to
 his own conceit of his
 own merit imparts a tone
 of deeper indignation to the
 murmurs of an outraged people
 Thus Mr Speaker by a
 series of aggressions of which
 I have attempted nothing more
 than an imperfect sketch the
 dominant party in the North
 have effected that which the
 world m arms could not
 have accomplished the overthrow of
 this once glorious Confederacy And
 not content with an achievement
 that will burden their memory
 through all coming ages they
 now propose to consummatc their
 work by afflicting the country
 with the calamities of civil
 war Mr Speaker we of
 tl e South maintain that
 among the fundamental and essential
 articles of the Republican faith
 is the doctrine that the
 States having subscribed the constitutional
 compact on their own independent
 volition and in the exer
 cise of an inherent sovereignty
 have the right perfect and
 iY violable to renounce the
 Union xvhenever in their judgment
 the Constitution is annulled and
 the Union abused to their
 oppres sion Nay in very
 act of assent to the
 league of confederation Virginia and
 other States by express stipulation
 reserved to themselves the right
 to resume their original sovereignty
 when over in their opinion
 the conditions of alliance might
 be violated As we understand
 it this is an association
 of coequal sovereignties held in
 fraternal embrace by the sweet
 influences of re ciprocal confidence
 and regard not u system
 of reluctant and oppressive connection
 bound to gether by the
 fetters of Federal force Nor
 have the people of the
 South contemplated the right of
 secession as a vain speculative
 proposition but have cherished it
 as an actual and inestimable
 in this particular tl iat
 tile citizens of the United
 States have the advantage of
 the people of all other
 countries in that when the
 checks and bal ances of
 the central Government arc overthrown
 there remains the rampart of
 Statc sovereignty bchind which they
 may rally and maintain their
 rights and in the still
 more important particular that through
 the instrumentality of secession they
 may recover their liberties by
 the organic compromise Thus while
 the South are willing operation
 of the system without recourse
 to the dreadful extremity of
 revolution to remain in the
 Union with an assurance of
 their r Ehese principles it
 appears by too many distress
 rights the North declare by
 a refusal of all con

 rapidly then be necessary that
 nobody can tell us anything
 of the bill and Mr
 STANTON If the hag an

 complicated in the The SPEAKER

 will make the proper explanation
 on the demtind for the

 to a resolution of the

 of the late Senator Lewis
 F Linn Mr HALE The
 resolution to which the munication
 is an answer was submitted
 by Ille and I wish
 that the communication may bc

 printed As this is a
 ques tion that relates to
 the privileges of the body
 I think it requires the

 is due to the occasion
 think tbcre is an atternpt
 to instituto a sort of

 will not submit to l
 hoy certainly will not without
 a remonstrance on my oart

 William G Bernard on the

 at Boston enlisted in company

 that he was with his

 there being an occasion for

 states he was accidently thrown

 by the Com rnissioner of
 Pension bemg tho extent permitted

 extraordinary effort of mind and
 of body involvjng i advice

 labor by day and by

 all that was required of
 him and as far as
 I can learn to the
 satisfhction of ail concerned Having
 witnessed during a portiön of

 untiring devotion to the relief
 of all who camc within
 the provisions of the act
 of Congress above cited can
 speak understandingly ofthe nature and
 extent Oftheuuties which wcrc thrown
 upon Dr McCormick and I
 am free to say that
 if remuneratibtv for eætra labor
 performed heavy responsibility assumed or
 actual toss sustained can in
 any instance be accorded to
 a pnblid agent the prayer
 of the memorialist is entitled
 to the most favorable consideration
 With sentiments of very high
 respect I am your obedi
 THOMAS LAWSON ent servant Surgeon
 Ceneral Hon JAMES SHIELDS United
 States Senate Mr FESSENDEN Mr
 President 1 believe that report
 was read the other day
 I listened to it then
 and did not get a
 very favorable impres Sion with
 regard to the claim itself
 I have novvr listened to
 it again with attention and
 my previous impressions those which
 I derived from the first
 reading are confirmed 1 see
 no reasonable ground upon which
 the allowance herc proposed or
 any allowance should be made
 to Dr McCormick I wish
 to call tho from the
 reading of the report attention
 of the Senators and of
 everybody en gaged in the
 disbursement of public moneys by
 legislative action if that may
 be called disburse ment to
 the fact that there is
 hardly an offcerin our employment
 in any grade of any
 condition connected with any department
 who if accident ally called
 u on to render a
 service not exactly in the
 strict line of the placc
 in which he is located
 does not come here and
 ask for an allowance in
 consideration of that extra service
 Why sir it has crot
 to be the fact with
 regard to the public servmcc
 generally here tunoncr us that
 no tnan thinks he is
 under slightest obligation to do
 any thing that is not
 precisely marked out for him
 by t hc rules and
 regulations wl lerevel he may
 be in any particular branch
 of the scrvicc without being
 entitled to come here for
 extra pay The thing is
 not creditable We have such
 applica tions from clerks in
 the Departments almost every day
 we have them from other
 quarters officers of the Army
 odicers ofJhc Nåvy offcers in
 every branch of the public
 service everywhere Now sir what
 did this man do 1
 hold that he did not
 do any thing out of
 his proper line He was
 an assistant surgeon in the
 Army sta tioned at Orleans
 The particular duty of in
 the Army or a surgeon
 in the Nåvy is deÄned
 by no law and I
 am not aware thal it
 is defined by any particular
 regulation What was he called
 upon to do Hc was
 called upon to purchase stores
 peculiarly appropriate to his own
 department medicines medical stores and
 things of that kind for
 the Government While he was
 in that business he was
 not en and certainly it
 was gaged in attending the
 sick It wus a service
 no more disagreeablc busii less
 Ilhey I vere to be
 pur that he well might
 render chased by somebody Their
 vaiue their quality was to
 be tcsted Why should it
 110t be lcft to a
 surceon to rnake these ptrchuses
 for the Govern ment and
 why should he charge us
 for the time that was
 taken from other duties which
 he might have been called
 upon to perform to devote
 to that The Government was
 cu titled to his advice
 and his aid in reference
 to thcse matters l o
 be sure he might havc
 been cn raged in attending
 thc sick but while engaged
 ih this he was not
 attending to the sick and
 I take it it was
 no loss to him What
 was the other duty Certain
 invalid sol diers sick soldiers
 were landed there and it
 seems an appropriation was made
 for their ben efit and
 an assistant surgeon being present
 he in their line but
 connected with it then there
 is an application for additional
 pay It comes from your
 clerks when employed a little
 out of offce hours and
 so on Sir it is
 discreditable to every branch of
 the service This man talks
 about losses He does not
 say He exhibits that he
 has sustained any losses no
 evidence that he lost anything
 The committee do not say
 that he lost anything Nobody
 says that he lost anything
 in any way although he
 talks about the losses thal
 he might have experienced If
 he lost anything which was
 not occasioned by his own
 carelessness or lost anything in
 conse quence of beingemployed in
 this business I would pay
 it but because some portion
 of his time was taken
 up for the benefit of
 the Government in a service
 which he might well render
 in this line I see
 no reason why we should
 give him the sum 1
 should of 2 500 or
 any other surn whatever like
 to hear better grounds for
 it than have been given
 in the report or memorial
 before it can com mand
 my vote at any rate
 Mr LANE Mr President 1
 will briefly state this case
 and nothing more Dr McCormick
 then an assistant surgeon in
 the Army was or dcred
 to duty at New Orleans
 at the commence ment of
 the war with Mexico and
 was continued on duty there
 for two years and a
 half The duty of an
 assistant surgeon in the Army
 is to attend to the
 sick and wounded and these
 are all the duties pertaining
 to the offce of but
 this rnan wus required to
 perform other duties and duties
 that did not belong to
 an assistant sur geon He
 vvas made the medical purveyor
 was made his duty to
 take carc of all the
 sick and wounded on their
 return from Mexico as well
 as those going to Mexico
 and he was busy every
 i day ahnost every hour
 during that whole time i
 Well sir that was not
 all He was also made
 a paymaster and he disbursed
 and paid out over 180
 000 I Ie discharged the
 duty of paymaster I Ie
 was directed to do it
 m paying thc soldiers as
 an exmnination of the papeus
 will show Hc paid money
 for medicines paid for attendance
 and disbursed an amount of
 money that if it had
 been disbursed by a regular
 paymaster would have given an
 allowance of and for that
 reason the original bill that
 proposed to pay over 7
 000 was reduced on the
 motion of the Senator from
 New York a member of
 the Committee on Military Affairs
 LVIr KING to that sum
 of money for the law
 allows in addition to the
 reff ulat salary of u
 puymaster 1 000 a year
 when employed in paying volunteers
 It was so through the
 wtu with Mexico Now sir
 we propose t o pay
 this m tn not what
 in my judgment he ought
 to have nor what the
 committee heretofore be lieved that
 hc ought to have for
 this body twice passed a
 bill allowing him over 7
 000 givinQ him the regular
 percentacre on the amount dis
 burscd but it has been
 reduced to precisely the amount
 that a paymaster would have
 received in he had disbursed
 the addition to his salary
 if money With this statement
 of facts and with the
 unani mous report of the
 conunittee after careful inves tigation
 I hope the Senate will
 not reject this claim for
 I look upon it as
 just and if l did
 hot I should not have
 given my consent to this
 report I examined it and
 so did thc whole committee
 I They believc it just
 and my judgment is that
 it ought to pass l
 do not intend to consume
 time Mr FOSTER 1 am
 satisfied Mr President from what
 I have heard that this
 bill ought not If these
 services were rendered by this
 to pass man in the
 regular performance of his duty
 I was called upon to
 attend to them and see
 that i understand that the
 compensation provided by they were
 furnished with necessary clothing and
 taw is his proper compensation
 and t hat he has
 attendance and made comfortable That
 would no further demand upon
 the Government seem to be
 in the line of his
 duty particularly and i claimed
 that these were cxtra services
 and be peculiarly But for
 these services he calls for
 ex yor d those which
 belonged to his proper duty
 tra compensation as services out
 of the line of his
 Under the circumstances and considering
 the re particular business that
 he x vas engaged in
 in ad lation or rather
 the office which this man
 held I should be opposed
 to payinghim even if these
 dition to his salary Does
 he give the Govern services
 were extra services quite as
 much as ment any credit
 for thc time that he
 was not en gaged in
 business peculiar to his profession
 Not though they were his
 own proper services and at
 all There are many seasons
 of the year when falling
 within the line of his
 appropriate duty these gentlemen have
 nothing to do of any
 con and for this reason
 here is a surffeon or
 assistant sequence when they are
 at perfect leisure They i
 surgeon of the Army in
 time of war voluntarily for
 we must assume that this
 service was volun tary if
 it was outside of the
 line of his duty as
 suming and discharging duties which
 do not belong to him
 as a surgeon or assistant
 surgeon Of coürsc he can
 perform these services only by
 the neglect of his appropriate
 duties ond a surgeon of
 the Army or Navy in
 time of war has no
 bus iness to neglect his
 appropriate duty which the Senator
 from Oregon very properly observed
 is devotion to the wounded
 and the sick and a
 sur geon who steps aside
 from that duty to perform
 any other service not belonging
 to his profession ought not
 to be paid butought to
 be reprimanded I speak sir
 for the sick and the
 wounded and I am astonished
 that the Senator from Oregon
 him self a soldier knowin
 much more about this than
 I do should be willing
 to pay a surgeon for
 departing from the line of
 his proper duty and doing
 other duty no matter how
 well he per formed it
 Hc had a higher duty
 and that was to attend
 to the sick and the
 wounded and if he neglected
 that I repeat I would
 not pay him one penny
 for it not one penny
 I would frown indignantly on
 a surgeon in time of
 war doincr any other than
 his appropriate duty and I
 shoulä feel that I was
 not speaking for those who
 can not speak for themselves
 the sick and wounded soldiers
 if I did not take
 this ground on all such
 I hope that the bill
 will not pass applications Mr
 evVIN rose Mr LANE Only
 a word and I will
 yield the floor to the
 Senatorfrom California for I want
 to hear his opinion in
 relation to this matter I
 will say to the Senator
 from Connecticut that neither he
 nor the Senator from Maine
 expressed any surprise or astonishment
 or remorse or regret at
 the last session of this
 Congress in voting to increase
 a man s pay that
 had been fixed by law
 to the amount of seven
 thousand dollars and over though
 he had only rendered eighteen
 months service and had received
 2 500 a year for
 nearly four years They found
 no obiection in the world
 to voting to increase it
 to 4 500 a year
 Mr FOSTER 1 would ask
 the Senator from Oregon whether
 that was the cuse of
 a surgeon who had departed
 from his duty It was
 the case of a Mr
 LANE No sir superintendent of
 Indian affairs That gentle man
 was appointed utder a law
 that fixed hig sal ary
 at 2 500 He rendered
 eighteen months ser vice only
 and that was established here
 in the Senate and notwithstanding
 that the Senator voted to
 increase his pay for four
 years or nearly that There
 was no difficulty in getting
 that through on the yeas
 and nays and every gentle
 man on the other side
 voted for it Now when
 a rnan has rendered service
 and was every day on
 duty for two years and
 a half and performed such
 service that entitles him to
 pay to the com pensation
 provided for in this bill
 at least the Senator finds
 objection to it I leave
 it to the Sen ator
 and to his conscience and
 to others to act as
 they picasc in th is
 Inatter and reconcile their action
 in that casc with their
 action in this Mr GWIN
 Senator from Connecticut has said
 that Dr IVIcCormick neglected his
 duty It is the first
 tinw I ever heard the
 charge made He is an
 etninent sur reon Mr FOSTER
 The Senator will excuse me
 I did not by any
 means intend to charge DY
 McCormick with neglect of his
 duty He is a perfect
 stranger to me and for
 aught I know a very
 valuable and meritorious oflicer I
 spoke merely of the necessary
 result ofencoura ing sur geons
 to disregard their duty and
 attend to other service which
 they could only do by
 lieglecting their duty Mr G
 WIN He was ordered by
 his superiors to perform this
 additional service not to neglect
 his duties as assistant surgeon
 No man can charge that
 upon him because there never
 was a more faithful public
 servant than Dr McCormick I
 vas residing in New Orleans
 at the time and i
 know that he performed the
 services that have been stated
 He also performed his own
 regular services as an assistant
 surcyeon to the satisfäc tion
 of everybody Nobody i vas
 neglected No duties of his
 office as assistant surgeon were
 neg lected during the time
 he performed these other services
 by ofder of his supertors
 involving him in heavy responsibiiities
 Any loss which he lhight
 have sustained any robbery committed
 on him any mistake would
 have involved him in I
 very large pecuniary liabilities He
 was required THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
 PUBLISHED BY JOL IN T
 HIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D SESSION
 by his superiors to do
 these duties and he did
 them well i think thöre
 never was a more meri
 tot ious claim brought before
 the Senate than this Mr
 HALE Mr President I am
 opposed to this bill and
 I have heard the remarks
 ot the Sen ator from
 Maine with a great deal
 of satisfac tion The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Chair must interrupt
 the Senator from New Hampshire
 The hour of one o
 clock having arrived it is
 the duty of the Chair
 to call up the special
 order There is upon the
 Calendar a long list of
 special orders some of them
 made at the last session
 and in which the Senate
 seems to take no interest
 Mr HALE I move that
 we begin vith the Calendar
 because I have been a
 member of the Senate for
 twelve years and the Senate
 never took up the Calendar
 a day since I have
 been in thc body and
 as they say the Union
 is going to be dissolved
 I want to have it
 to say that one day
 while I was in the
 Senate it went on with
 the Calendar in order Mr
 G WIN I have been
 here twelve years very nearty
 and never saw the Calendar
 taken up regularly once and
 as my time here is
 short do not want it
 taken up now I think
 there is something more important
 before us now and i
 move to suspend all prior
 orders to take up House
 bill No 701 The VICE
 PRESIDENT The question is n
 the motion of the Senator
 from Calitörnia RAILROAD TO TIIE
 PACIFIC The motion was agreed
 to and the Senate as
 in Committee of the Whole
 resumed the consid oration of
 the bill H R No
 701 to securc con tracts
 and make provision for the
 safe certain and more speedy
 transportation by railroad of mails
 troops munitions of war military
 and naval stores between the
 Atlantic States and those of
 the Pa cific and for
 other purposes Mr FOSTER i
 have a slight amendment to
 this bill which I think
 has been made necessary by
 the previous amendments I move
 in the sixty third line
 of the fourth section to
 strike out the words passage
 of this act and insert
 in approval by the Congress
 of the lieu thereof United
 States of the said acts
 of incorporation I think that
 it is necessary in order
 to make the bill consistent
 with itself Mr GWIN 1
 think that is already in
 the Mr FOSTER Not at
 this point at all events
 I think the Senator is
 right in reference to its
 bein in the bill elsewhere
 but it ought to be
 in here in order to
 make the bill consistent with
 itself Mr GWIN is right
 to put in the rnent
 if it is left out
 there The amendment was agreed
 to Mr DOOLITTLE 1 observe
 that in the printed bill
 as amended an amendment which
 I offered when the measure
 was last under cohsid eration
 by the Senate is not
 Included and on conversation with
 the Clerk I ascertain that
 his impression is that the
 question wag not put to
 the I therefore desire Senate
 upon that amendment to call
 it up that the vote
 may be put to the
 Sen ate so that there
 may be no mistake about
 it Mr LATHAM The vote
 was put and the amendment
 was declared by the Presiding
 Officer to be carried I
 recollect it distinctly Mr DOOLITTLE
 That is my recollection but
 on looking to the Journal
 of the Senate it does
 not appear so and the
 Clerk was of a different
 impression The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Secretary will read the amendment
 The Secretary read Mr DOOLITTLE
 s amend ment which is
 in section four line fifty
 onc after the word dollars
 to insert Provided That thirty
 per cent of the whole
 arnount of bonds of the
 United States to be advanced
 as atöresaid shall be retained
 by the Secretary of the
 Treasury until said road Shail
 be fully convicted throughout the
 whole Jine and in case
 the road shall not be
 completed the bonds In the
 hands ot the Secretary of
 the Treasury shall be forfeited
 to the United States Mr
 GWIN Is that under consideration
 now 39 WEDNESDAY JANUARY 30
 1861 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 in the chair It is
 called up by the Senator
 from Wisconsin Mr DOOLITTLE My
 recollection is that this amendment
 was put io vote of
 the Senate when the bill
 was lust under consideration and
 that it was adopted but
 tbc Journal does not state
 the fact and it is
 not printed in the bill
 as amended Mr G WIN
 And therefore as I understand
 it is now under consideration
 as the Journal does not
 show that it has been
 adopted Mr DOOLITTLE Yes sir
 Mr G WIN I have
 bccn exceedingly anxious not to
 say a word that would
 postpone immediate action on this
 bill but I am very
 much opposed to this amendment
 I think it will jcopardize
 the whole enterprise The bill
 now is sccurely guarded to
 prevent exactly what the Senator
 from Wisconsin wishes to guard
 against by this amendment so
 that the rond shall be
 completed throughout The great compensation
 is in the center The
 great profits of this great
 enterprise will be in building
 the road entirely and the
 withdrawal oi a large amount
 of the credit of the
 Government of the Ünited States
 in my judff ment will
 jeopardize the vvholc enterprise the
 Senator will look with attention
 through thc whole bill he
 will find that it is
 particularly guarded so as to
 force the corporator s to
 build the whole road The
 great compensation is in the
 center and they arc to
 forfeit all the moneys they
 have put in it if
 they do not complete it
 know that thc Senator is
 a friend of this great
 measure but I believc he
 will jeopardize it by pressing
 his amendment I am however
 so anxious to get thc
 bill out of comrnittee and
 into the Senate that I
 shall say nothing more on
 the subject than that I
 hope the amendment will not
 be adopted Mr DOOLITTLE 1
 shall the Sen l regard
 this amendment as essential and
 ate without some further security
 in tbc bill I doubt
 exceedingly whether 1 could bring
 mind to vote for it
 at all Looking through the
 bill I see there may
 be a chance for specaEiators
 to go on with the
 road to accrtain distance and
 when they comc to some
 mountain that will involve a
 large expenditure or when they
 comc to crossa desert C

 To causc the public lands

 such road as the parties
 Inay indicate to be withheld
 Mr BRAGG I would like
 to hear the Sena tor
 explain the effect of this
 amendmcnt It seems to Ine
 it increases the quantity of
 public land that is to
 be given to this company
 vastly Mr CHANDLER The effect
 of the amend ment will
 be to allow six sections
 per mile instead of one
 The amendment which has just
 been adopted by the Senate
 reserves thirty per cent of
 the bonds which are to
 be issued to the road
 as a guarantee for its
 final completion this amend ment
 proposes to increase the quantity
 of land throughout the Territories
 to the extent of five
 sections per mile That is
 the whole of it Mr
 BRAGG Then understand it itmäkes
 the quantity of land to
 be given to the corpora
 tors about five or six
 times as great as the
 bill proposed to give originally
 Mr CHANDLEn Yes sir but
 we reserve thirty per cent
 for its final completion through
 the more difficult portions of
 the route Mr BRAGG I
 can only gay that 1
 cannot vote for that amendment
 I do not think it
 ought to pass Mr DOOLITTLE
 1 am not altogether sat
 isficd with the amendment offered
 by the Senator from Michigan
 so fur as the lands
 are concerned within the limits
 of the States certainly I
 do not know but I
 would consent to givc six
 sec tions per milo through
 the Tcrritories but to give
 six sections per mile commencing
 on the Mis souri river
 and going through thc good
 lands for two three or
 four hundred miles from there
 with the money proposed to
 be given I think is
 more than ought to be
 givcm Mr G WIN r
 am willing to strike out
 the State of California That
 is the only State af
 I fected It will not
 give a foot of land
 there any i how for
 it is all mineral region
 country wherc it will involve
 a large expendi they may
 abandon the contract and pocket
 Mr CHANDLER I am an
 very large profits in tho
 speculation without goino amendment that
 the sixth section shall be
 confined I through with the
 work and throw it back
 on our I therefore desire
 to retain in the Treas
 hands ury enough to secure
 the buildincr of the road
 and the buildihgofit through hence
 desire that this amendment shall
 be adopted I Mr CHANDLER
 1 hope that amendment will
 bc agreed to I am
 very anxious to vote for
 i any measure which will
 securo the building of a
 Pacific railroad I will state
 that in tend to offer
 another amendment after this one
 shall have been adopted which
 will perhaps obviate to some
 extent the objection which the
 Senator from Cal I shall
 offer an amendment at the
 ifornia makes proper time mcreasing
 the quantity of land to
 be given to thc road
 from one to six sections
 per mile I think that
 will perhaps be more than
 compensation for this thirty per
 cent which will be reserved
 to insure the final completion
 of the road think it
 a very proper amendment Any
 company that will take hold
 of this great enter prise
 with the intention of completing
 it would certainly not object
 to a suffcient guarantee re
 maining in the Ijsnds of
 tbc Government for its completion
 and I think thirty per
 cent a reason able amount
 for that guarantee The PRESiDi1NG
 OFFICER The question is on
 the atuendrnent proposed by the
 Senator from Wisconsin The amend
 Eitent was agreed to Mr
 CHANDLER 1 to strike out
 to the Territories Mr DOOLITTLE
 say section mile in the
 States and six sections per
 mile in the Ter I
 ritories As Kansas is now
 admitted this amend ment would
 exclude Kansas and California The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on the amendment as modified
 by the mover Mr BRAGG
 Let us see how it
 would read as modified The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The amend ment
 will be read Mr DOUGLAS
 I should likc 10 understand
 this proposition I Mr DOOLITTLE
 will state to the Senator
 from Illinois that the bill
 as it now stands pro
 i poses to give one
 section pcr mile throughout besides
 bond g The Senator from
 Michigan pro poses to amend
 it so as to give
 six sections per mile through
 the Territories and one section
 per mile through the States
 Mr DOUGLAS lam content with
 that I Ms GREEN As
 the bill now stands 1
 think the amendment ought to
 be adopted I think the
 construction put on the bill
 is a mistake My reading
 of it makes it a
 half section per mile It
 says c the odd section
 within a mile and you
 cannot make that tunount to
 more than a half section
 Mr GWIN Well it be
 six now Mr GREEN I
 am in favor of that
 but I say in line

 Mr SEWARD 1 wish to

 I have already ex ao
 ainst this amendment pressed the
 reasons why I am opposed
 to any amendment to this

 faith and voted against cvcry
 amendineflt which has been offered
 in the Senate I shall
 vote against this Mr TRUMBULL
 1 shall for this amend
 rnent the effect aud object
 of which are as the
 Senator from New York will
 see by reducing the amount
 appropriated for the cen tral
 and south ern routes to
 create a fund for a
 northern route Like the Senator
 from California I am in
 favor of one railroad to
 the Pacific I think there
 should be onc great central
 route but if you are
 to have a central and
 a southern road I think
 the upper portion of the
 north western States are entitled
 to a northern route and
 as this amendment is to
 reduce the amount appropriated to
 the central route 10 000
 000 and the amount to
 the southern rou and a
 ppropriate these two stuns with
 an additional sun 1 of
 4 000 000 to a
 north route increasing the whole
 amount appro priat d by
 thu bill on ly 4
 000 000 I shall vote
 for the amend mci t
 though holding myself at liberty
 afterwards to vote to strike
 out the provision for the
 southern route and confine the
 bill to one rail road
 to the Pacific ocean If
 an opportunity can iven to
 pursuc that course I shou
 ld prefer it otherwise I
 shall vote for this amendrnent
 I deem it proper sir
 to remind Mr BAKER the
 Senate of tlre effect of
 this atnendmcnt com bined with
 others already offered Upon the
 ino ti on gentleman I
 believe the Senator from Oregon
 M r hasalready bccn added
 to tbc kinc of road
 provided for in this bill
 a road from the valley
 of the Sacramento through the
 valleys of Rog cte river
 Urnpqua and Wiliaructte a railroad
 not f ar from six
 hundred miles long fifty so
 as to rnakc a new
 l ü rdcn upon the
 bill as it came from
 the Provided I hat sunl
 so advanced as aiörcsaid shall
 I louse of Representatives not
 exceed It is proposed now
 adding only in annount 4
 000 000 to direct the
 This is for the central
 route and if this amend
 ment shall be adopted I
 propose to follow it up
 by nruoving to strike out
 in the section in relation
 to the southern route and
 substi t utiucr 25 000
 000 r I lje ob
 jeel which have is to
 so all er this bill
 that we provide a road
 on the northern rou te
 and rna kc provision fi
 r the ment of fin
 t hat whic h is
 the amount that I propose
 gi ve to the southern
 routc By adoptin r the
 which now offer and those
 with which I propose to
 follow it the bill will
 provide an advance in bonds
 of for the route for
 the southern route arid 25
 000 000 for the I
 believe the adoption of this
 amend ern route ment is
 necessary aud cs s cnlial
 to make a fair and
 honest bill It will only
 increase the whole construction of
 another road the length of
 which would be by thousands
 of miles the Senator from
 Minnesota will correct me if
 I am wrong DII what
 is called the northern route
 I believe thal every real
 friend of the measure ho
 ha long and l atiently
 entertained the hope thut bill
 tuit llt pass and a
 road be built is op
 posed to cither of these
 arncndrnen ts not because not
 because if I may bc
 sve do not desire then

 allow od to repeat it
 herly State in the Union
 would not mnphat ica ly
 desire it if it were
 practicable but because and fecl
 and think we know that

 five hundred or three thousand
 miles of road with an
 increase of 000 0000nly will
 bc so to cause tbc
 road t f that it
 will fall arnount raising it
 up from W c cannot
 do it I will vote
 with all the cheer to
 offer this an endn lent
 prepara ft ilness in the
 world as the distinguished Senator
 to the others which I
 have indicated G M I
 N I hope this amendment
 will not be adopted It
 is the conunencement ofa third
 line to the Pacific My
 own judgment always has been
 that the whole power of
 this Government should be devoted
 to the construction of one
 line but I have Diven
 up my preferences for that
 plan and yielded to the
 bi i that has been
 sent to us from the
 I louse Representatives provi l

 Uni ted States and all
 that bill amended as the
 Senator from A inncsota proposes
 can give We II froin
 New York said he would
 a northern road I will
 vote Inore than cheerfully I
 will vote gladly for an
 V road from California through
 Or II wouil l be
 m v duty and my
 pride but I cannot be
 tempted I was about to
 say bribed by a roa_d
 going through y State or
 near it I do not
 feel myself at liberty to
 forego the on y opportunity
 I have had or evcrtnay
 have to lend hiy aid
 to he practical of the
 greatest dition to two roads
 you make three by a
 branch from the vallcy of
 the Sacramento to Portland and
 in addition to three you
 tnake four by a great
 northern rou te which as
 the Senator from Cali fornia
 has well said is not
 in his judgment nor is
 it in mine necessary for
 public military defense and when
 to do all that you
 only add 4 000 000
 as compensation to the corporators
 who are to make these
 roads it strikes me that
 these are measures which the
 enemies of the bill may
 de sire but which the
 friends of the bill can
 in wise approve While I
 do not complain of the
 Senator from Minnesota it is
 his duty and hig interest
 and his pride to do
 it I do add the
 last words which I propose
 to say upon this measure
 to the friends of the
 bill asking them if they
 bc lievc it possible that
 they can provide successfully for
 any road at all if
 they add what is not
 far from twenty five hundred
 miles of road and then
 increase the money advance of
 the Government by the poor
 pitiful sum of 4 000
 000 I hope therefore that
 those of us who do
 really love the in its
 last agony vote against any
 road will amendmcnts Mr GWIN
 only add one word for
 1 am anxious to have
 action on this bill W
 Inag the Senator from Oregon
 has said is literally true
 It is not in ordel
 to spcak of what wilt
 occur else where but it
 is very doubtful whether we
 can get enacted into a
 law by the sanction of
 alk the departments of the
 Government such a bill even
 as cäme to us from
 the other House covering the
 amount which it proposed to
 advance Now we shall crush
 down and destroy this measure
 en tircly in my honest
 judgment if we add another
 road destroy it either between
 the two Houses 0 elsewhere
 There are many friends of
 the ce ntral road who
 believe it cannot be built
 wit i the aid which
 this bill proposes that the
 Govern If you weaken it
 at all 1 ment shall
 give weaken the confidence of
 capitalists who have to put
 their Inoney in it aside
 froin t he credit of
 the Government that is given
 and the land that is
 granted the whole Ineasure may
 be destroyed and the road
 rnay never start As I
 havc frc quentiy stated before
 will vote for what the
 Senator froun Min nesota brings
 forward as a sep Let
 it stand on its otyvn
 merits arate measure If the
 bill had cornc to us
 from the I louse of
 Rep rosentatives writh this other
 road in it I should
 have sustained it Now I
 hope every friend of the
 Pacific railroad bill will vote
 against this amend ment Perhaps
 I ought not to say
 that it may be a
 reflection on those who are
 its friends know that there
 are local interests which gentles
 Inen n nlxst respect but
 I wi sh to remind
 them of the fact that
 they may destroy the whole
 rneasure by standing by amendments
 to this bill that are
 urged on account of the
 effect thev will have on
 t héir localities I wait
 it to be understood by
 the Senate that this particular
 amendmei t striking out from
 the central road does not
 diminish the whole amount to
 be appropriated but will tend
 to increase it Ithis amount
 is to be stricken from
 the central route and a
 like stun is to be
 stricken frotu the southern route
 and both an lounts with
 an additional sum are to
 be given for a northern
 route T he result of
 this amend ment therefore will
 be to increase the amount
 of bonds to be issued
 and to add to the
 lands granted to the extent
 of millions of acres for
 of course this northern route
 will have its six sections
 to the mile also Mr
 DOOLITTLE desire to sav a
 single I bölievo that word
 ill relation this amendment there
 are three railroads already in
 process of bc ing built
 frorn the eastern to the
 western slopes the Rock y
 Mountains There is a road
 in pro cess of construction
 on tho central line There
 is one across Texas which
 is to reach El Paso
 and smne day will reach
 to the waters of the
 Gulf Of Cali ornia cither
 at Fort Yuma or perhaps
 at some lower point down
 upon the Gulf but it
 is in Iny judgment whether
 it will very doubtful ever
 go from Fort Yuma across
 the Colorado des ert and
 from there up to San
 Francisco There 111 y podr
 word is a road in
 process of construc tion upon
 the cen and I desire
 i work of the acre
 will pass for anything to
 say to every gentlernan h
 vho really does desire the
 buildin y of a road
 that you are causin y
 it to under amend until
 it will fall Sixty million
 dollars is a good deal
 of money i but the
 road is very long and
 when in addition to the
 length as at prescribed and
 in ad trai line as
 I have said and it
 is bound to 70 through
 The people of Pike s
 Peak and those and are
 settling in that neifrh who
 havc settled borhood are bound
 to have a rai road
 communi eni ion the people

 desire to look upon this

 practicable thing and I say
 there are three crrand lines

 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on striking ont the sections
 specified and in septing thosc
 which have just been read
 Mr WILKINSON A1 thesuggestion ofsomc
 friends of this Inoasure I
 wish to modify my motion
 so as to Lhcse as
 additional sections to the original
 bill Mr SAULSBURY I am
 not certain about it but
 according to ID y recollection
 I think this line will
 bring us within from thirty
 to fifty miles of tho
 British possessions I suggest to
 the hon oral lo mover
 of this amendment whether it
 would not be well enough
 to carry this road a
 little higher and pat it
 on the line between us
 and the British possessions Every
 friend of the bill proposes
 simply to construct the road
 for the pur I poses
 of military defense and then
 perhaps by Lreaty with Great
 Britain she would join us
 in constructing it and both
 sides could agree that it
 should remain unobstructed both in
 limes of peace and war
 IVIr WILKINSON If 1 understood
 the Sen ator correctly he
 is laboring under a very
 great mistake The line of
 this road does not go
 into the British possessions at
 all or near thcm If
 the Senator will examine carefully
 the map that has becn
 laid on the tables of
 Senators he will find that
 it does not touch the
 British posses slons Now the
 objection which was nrgcd to
 my other amendment by tho
 Senator frotn Oregon Mr 13AKCR
 certainly cannot apply to this
 II is very evident to
 any one who tunendmeut has
 examined this matter at all
 that the best route altogether
 of either of the three
 which are men I should
 like to tioncd is the
 northern route understand how it
 is that Senators on this
 side of the Chatnber at
 least can vote 36 000
 000 for a i southcrn
 route going through the entire
 length of the State of
 Texas now in the act
 of secession now about to
 go oub of this Union
 I should like I say
 to hear some person get
 up and explain the reason
 and the propriety of of
 the Treasury for that route
 while they stand up here
 and oppose northern route I
 do notat all accede to
 the doctrine that we arc
 to reward a State which
 is in arms a yainst
 the Federal Gov ermnent by
 voting t Le Federal money
 into their hands and the
 same Lirne withholding it from
 that portion of the Union
 which is true and loyal
 this act of in to
 the Constitution If however justice
 can be done under the
 pretext of saving the Union
 I am perfectly willing that
 Sehators As for Inyseif will
 never sustain a shall do
 it wrong like this for
 the sake of rew ardinø
 the State of Texas or
 the State of Arkansas or
 any 612 THFI CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 29 power have no
 doubt C01 gress can make
 roads other State or to
 keep them in the Union
 If sas and run several
 hundred miles on each branch
 It is very convenient to
 those neighborhoods to for that
 purpose If it is necessary
 for the de they cannot
 be held loyal td the
 Constitution and have those branches
 butl am not prepared to
 say fense of the country
 a road along the border
 near laws of tbc land
 without voting this great wrong
 that the public interests of
 this nation are to be
 Mexico it appears to me
 would be proper that I
 for one will not keep
 them in at all let
 them very materially affected by
 them You are delay is
 the southern road If these
 roads should be But if
 it is the object and
 purpose of the friends ing
 the main line by havino
 so many branches i necessary
 for military purposes it must
 be by an of this
 measure to vote for the
 proposition which Then on the
 central route as it iscalled
 you make interruption of the
 relations between our Govern is
 the best calculated to promote
 the interests of two branches
 one to the western border
 of Mis l ment and
 Mexico on thé one sidc
 and our Gov thc whole
 country then they will corne
 forward souri and one to
 the western border of Iowa
 to ernment and Great Britain
 on the other with It
 is forcign Powers that would
 attempt to blockade and vote
 for this northern route for
 it has been I come
 together after several hundred miles
 I look upon the southern
 route as demonstrated by Governor
 Stevens in his survey very
 convenient for the railroad interests
 in Mis our coast souri
 and in Iowa to have
 those branches made necessary for
 military dcfensc in the event
 of war and by others
 iVho have carefully investigated it
 that it is beyond all
 question the most feasible for
 them t vith a view
 to connect with the main
 from that side or an
 attempt to blockade that route
 i should like to heat
 the Senator fron Ore gon
 Mr LANE cxpreds his views
 upon it is acquainted the
 military bearing of this question
 and I do not pretend
 to understand any thing about
 those matters If the friends
 ofa Pa cific railroad wish
 to do justice and wish
 to pass an honest and
 fair measure for the interests
 of the apprehend thcy will
 come Tor whole country ward
 and vote for this amendment
 It has been customary for
 some gentlemen thc Pacific coast
 to get up in this
 Chamber and denounce every man
 who did not support their
 particular measure as being opposed
 to the wholc schemc of
 the Pacific railroad Now sir
 I do not admit that
 those men are the especial
 guard ians of this measure
 at all Mr GWIN Does
 the senator allude to me
 as one of those Senators
 Mr WILKINSON 1 more particu
 larly to the Senator from
 Oregon and the rernarks he
 made the other day Mr
 G WIN All I havc
 got to say is that
 if the Senator referred to
 me he IS entirely mistaken
 Many friends of the Pacific
 railroad differ with me on
 this and other points but
 I do not pretend to
 throw any imputation on gentlemen
 who inter posc their measures
 becausc I believe they arc
 just as Rood friends as
 I mn to the Pacific
 rnilrond Mr WILKINSON 1 had
 in my mind the timc
 morc particularly some remarks madc
 by the Senator from Oregon
 the other day Now sir
 I deny that those gontlmnen
 or anybody else have any
 right to charge us with
 being cnemies of thig measure
 because we do not favor
 the partic ul u bill
 that has been introduced Sir
 this bill thut has conie
 to us from the House
 of Repre scntativcs is a
 bill of abominations It is
 fraught with tnnnifest injustice and
 wrorw aud instead of producing
 thc results which some gcntlernen
 expect I believe these Texan
 seccssicnnists will Ifmcn arc not
 bound to this Union laugh
 at you by any stronger
 ties than those furnished by
 this railroad scheme then the
 quicker they get out of
 the Union in my humble
 judgment the better Mr DOUGLAS
 Mr President so long us
 we wero proposing to set
 apart the pul lic lands
 for the construction of a
 Pacific railroad I was always
 in favor of makincya crrant
 to three routes putting them
 on terms of exact equality
 and al lowinrr each of
 them 10 make thc road
 as fast as they could
 but if we arc to
 make large appro priations from
 the Fedcral Tu easury under
 the war power or any
 other specific power it is
 hard to say that three
 are necessary or that we
 could not Ct along even
 with one I am afraid
 we arc going to defeat
 any Pacific railroad bill by
 encumbering it with too many
 roads too many branches and
 too large an amount of
 tnoncy so that it will
 fall of its own weight
 Now we have inserted a
 branch I believe from Sacramento
 in California over to Puget
 Sound Mr LANE To Portland
 Oregon Mr DOUGLAS To Portland
 A road there would be
 of great service I would
 be will ing to give
 any amount of land there
 to aid in the construction
 ofa road as we have
 done in other States but
 really I cannot say that
 that is one of the
 essential works of national defense
 that comes within the ronteof
 the main stem across the
 Rocky Mountains It will be
 a verv expensive road will
 run over various ranøes of
 mountains where there is very
 little travel It wili bc
 very conve nient to those
 people I should be glad
 to exer cisc the powers
 of this Government as far
 as I could 2 to
 promote their interests and their
 conve nience but sir svc
 arc adding greatly to the
 diff cullies surround ina the
 bill by putting in that
 clause T he sanu is
 true if the branches on
 this side W c be
 in this southf u n
 route on the western bor
 trunk but they would make
 them themselves very coast The
 route is a good one
 I have traveled soon if
 we would make the main
 trunk without over it and
 believe every gentleman who has
 i traveled over it will
 join me in saying that
 there the Federal Government making
 the branches Now after having
 put on those the proposition
 is very little obstruction scarcely
 any impedi is for a
 third road from Lake Superior
 to Puget ment at all
 You may drive in a
 buggy on a Sound That
 is a very good route
 for a railroad trot over
 every mile of the country
 that I passed I have
 often over on that route
 No doubt it is entirely
 practicable pointed out the route
 as a practicable one and
 as Then sir the northern
 route I am sure is
 a one to which we
 ought to make a grant
 of land very practicable one
 and would terminate as pro
 setting apart alternate sections for
 many miles on vided by
 this amendment at Puget Sound
 the finest sheet of water
 on the face of the
 earth The each side to
 create a fund to make
 that road but if we
 are going to put it
 upon this bill I anl
 sir afraid we arc taking
 upon our shoulders a little
 more weight than wc can
 carry I am afraid we
 are imposing on the Fedcral
 Treasury a demand than we
 can supply I fear we
 are Y01nø to make them
 all useless by dividing our
 sub scriptions between so many
 that we shall either defeat
 the whole or postpono the
 construction of all for an
 indefinite time I would much
 rather make but one road
 so situated us to be
 fair to all sections and
 so that all roads on
 this side could connect with
 it I bc licve if
 we could set aside all
 thesc local interests and start
 one road at the city
 of Sacramento Cal ifornin and
 then over to the Washoe
 mines and kcep due east
 until you strike the head
 of thc Arkansas you woul
 l find a good route
 and a practicable road When
 you get to the head
 of the Arkansas one branch
 should run down to Louisiana
 in the direction of New
 Orleans and the other to
 Iowa in the direction of
 the north western States and
 thus you would accornmo date
 the wbolc country quite as
 well perhaps better by one
 road with two branches than
 you would rather do f
 would with all these roads
 It would require very lit
 tle changrein this bill This
 Texas company incorporated in Texas
 would only havc to l
 end their road a little
 to con nect As to
 our central road as you
 call it I believe the
 head of the Arkansas the
 best pass for it 10
 go through thc mountains I
 do not think we should
 find as good a route
 north of itas we should
 find there do not pretend
 to make a motion to
 this effect I dcsire t
 o see the bill passed
 I was prepared to vote
 for the two routes even
 with these ob noxious branches
 upon them under protest and
 without any disposition to quarrel
 With the Sen ator from
 M innesota for saying it
 is a bill ofabom inations
 rl hcrc is too much
 truth in that remark are
 too many provisions in it
 that cannot There country east
 of the mountains and up
 tbc Mis souri nver is
 generally level and until you
 strike the Rocky Mountains it
 presents very little ob struction
 to the building of a
 road From Fort Benton on
 the navigable waters of the
 Missouri to Fort Walla Walla
 on the Columbia river upon
 the border of Oregon and
 Washington and only a short
 distance from Puget Sound it
 is only six hundred miles
 By this statement you see
 Mr President that a railroad
 on that route is practicable
 and would be necessary for
 the de fense of the
 country The central route is
 the great route and I
 look upon it as the
 route for the defense of
 San Fran Cisco and all
 that portion of California of
 which it may be said
 to be the center and
 for the de fense of
 the Salt Lake and the
 Pike s Peak coun try
 It would be the business
 route at any rate for
 many years T hc distance
 from thc contem plated southern
 route to the northern routc
 pro I vided for by
 the amendment is some fifteen
 degrees of latitude a rough
 country to travel over and
 neither onc road nor the
 other would an swer the
 purpose T hc southern road
 would not answer the purpose
 of thie defense of our
 north ern frontier nor would
 the northern road answer for
 the defense of the southern
 frontier When this bill was
 first presented here I was
 very much opposed to it
 and 1 doubted as I
 do yet very seriously our
 right to pass it certainly
 we cannot do so unless
 it is necessary for the
 de fense of the country
 I put it on that
 ground and on that ground
 alone can I vote for
 it Since the bill camc
 here it has been amended
 and very much changed many
 guards have been thrown around
 it It is a much
 safer bill than it was
 when it came from the
 House of Representatives Be sides
 a provision is now made
 for a branch from the
 central linc to Portland in
 the State of Orcgon very
 neat to the line dividing
 Oregon from Wash ington Territory
 shall feel it my duty
 therefore well be dcfendcd for
 us to say it is
 not liable to to vote
 for thc bill without this
 amendment but have Ei believing
 that these extreme portions of
 the coun very strong an
 l vcry serious objection made
 up 111 y mind to
 vote for it aftcr such
 mod try ought to be
 provided for the North as
 well ifications ns we can
 get but it is about
 as stronty as the South
 and tho South as well
 as the Norbh a pull
 upon my conscience as I
 am prepared to i I
 feel inclined to vote for
 the amendment offered If we
 are going still to accumulate
 more I by the Senator
 from Minnesota knowing that bis
 endure route is practicable and
 seeing that that road will
 and more branch after branch
 and a new road I
 will give no guarantees that
 I shall votc for the
 be needed in the event
 of a war with Great
 Brit bill in the shapc
 it may finally assume I
 would ain fbr the protecli0F
 of that portion of your
 coast bordering on Puget Sound
 and for all the country
 I would rather con rather
 lop off than increase centrate
 upon one central route with
 only one lying on the
 line I only make these
 remarks to give my views
 branch to the southwest and
 the other to the I
 northwest than to add to
 it and yet I cannot
 say about the Practicability oftl
 le several routes The that
 the people on this northm
 n route have not northern
 route is very practicable and
 so is the just as
 high a claim as they
 have upon either of i
 southern The central route will
 be a pretty heavy the
 other routes if we are
 going beyond what is I
 one but it is practicable
 and the road ean be
 made really essential for military
 purposes and will be verv
 useful suggest to the friends
 of the bill that we
 must Mr CLINGMAN If I
 understand this mo vote upon
 the various propositions with a
 view tion it is to
 strike out the Texas line
 and insert to national interests
 and not witha view to
 mere Oh no The PRESIDING
 OFFICER local interests that may
 be protected by the va
 ment has been modified it
 is silnply to ndd the
 rious amendments Mr LANE If
 I understood the Senator from
 sections which have been read
 noL to strike out Minnesota
 he said he should like
 to hear my any portion
 ot tbe bill Mr CLINGMAN
 Then the explanation views on
 this subject The discussion the
 other day on the amendment
 of thc Senator from Lou
 which I was about to
 make is not necessarv Mr
 SIMMONS I have not had
 an opportu isiana Mr BENJåi1JN
 satisfied me that the Sen
 ate believed it was necessary
 for the defense of nity
 to examine the details of
 this bill but I der
 of also at Fort Smith
 Arkan the country to build
 thesc railroads Under that perfectly
 clear that it would add
 greatly to the 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOB E 613 popularity
 and strength of thc measure
 in the I a northern
 a central and a southern
 road has Mr G WIN
 If the Senator from Magsacliu
 country to put on this
 northern road intend much as
 I may not be able
 to vote for the bill
 as i setts will withdraw
 his amendment we can try
 it if I can get
 an opportunity before this bill
 passes it may finally before
 the Senate tind Iam Mr
 WILSON I Withdraw my amendment
 if the provision is not
 already in it to propose
 about to vote fort amendment
 I think it proper for
 the purpose of a motion
 made whiCli that separate books
 be opened for subscriptions that
 I shonld make this explanation
 will limit the bill to
 a provision fdr thegreat een
 for each of these three
 roads and that whenever Mr
 SIMMONS called for the yeas
 and nays tral road across
 the continent giving land aid
 there shall be half money
 enouRh subscribed by and the
 were ordered and taken 60
 000 000 for that road
 and let the northcrn and
 Mr YLARK who at first
 voted in the nega southern
 roads go individuaig to build
 either one of them the
 Gov thought Mr GWIN That
 strikes out all of the
 bill ernment of the United
 States shall subscribe the tive
 misapprehended the question other half
 That wili test the sincerity
 of the the vote was
 simply upon striking out the
 gouth I have reo idea
 myself of voting crn route
 and therefore voted in thc
 negative I stockholders to any
 corporation for any road understand
 now it is to add
 a northern road I and
 then not have any control
 over it after they change
 my vote have expended our
 money It is a great
 deal of I he result
 was announced yeas 22 nays
 19 money but I believe
 it will be a valuable
 invest as follows mcnt if
 we have any legislative power
 over the i YDAS Messrs
 Anthony Binghmn Bright Chandler Clark

 King road to prevent it
 from being made a monopoly
 Lane Morriil Powell Rice Simmons

 a corporation for taxing the
 rest of us through Trumbull
 Wade Wilkinson and Wilson 22
 our livcs I would give
 no corporation that power NA
 YS Messrs Baker Biglcr Bragg
 C uneron Cling but I
 would be willing to makc
 provision in the Inan Crittenden
 Dixon Foster Green Gri nes
 Gwin bill that a fair
 toll shall be charged so
 as to allow larlan flenrphili
 Johnson of Tennessee Lathani Nich
 olson Polk Saulsbury and VVigfall
 say an income of twelve
 per cent upon each road
 and whcn they got it
 to that the Government so
 the amendment was adopted should
 have power to reduce the
 tolls The Gov ernment havzno
 some intel est in the
 dividends there would be some
 motive for us to let
 them make that much but
 this offering of 100 000
 000 to people to make
 a road and then to
 let them manage it and
 ingraft their projects upon it
 with out any control on
 our part I think is
 the most unwise measure to
 which this Government could give
 its sanction 1 should be
 not only willing to takc
 one half the stock as
 we did in the Louis
 ville and Portland canal but
 I should be willing when
 they had paid in 1
 000 000 in cash and
 expended it to loan them
 another million upon a mortgaze
 of their half of the
 road so that the road
 itself would bc three qiarters
 of it built upon the
 credit of the United States
 who can raise money at
 one half the rate of
 interest that any in divid
 corporation can In that way
 one fourth of the money
 coming out of the pockets
 of indi viduals would give
 them a sufficient individual in
 terest in each road to
 secure good mana ement and
 econorny and the Government w
 ould have interest enough to
 participate and to see to
 this road see that the
 tolls are not too high
 see that the public are
 not imposed upon I believe
 that this central road if
 it costs Mr WILSON I
 move to amend the thirteenth
 section of the bikl which
 relatcg to the southern route
 in the eleventh and twelfth
 lines by strik I ing
 out at or near San
 Francisco so that the section
 will read And by the
 nearest and best route to
 the Pacific ocean i propose
 also to strike out 4
 at or near San Francisco
 in the thirty third line
 of the four teenth section
 and as we have amended
 the bill by adding another
 road to it which will
 cost very large stun of
 money I move to strike
 out thirty six und insert
 twenty five in the thirty
 fourth line of the fourteenth
 section By doinx this we
 shall give to central road
 60 000 000 to the
 southern road 25 000 000
 and to the northern road
 25 000 000 which will
 make the whole sum 110
 000 000 The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr FOSTER in the chair
 I hc question is on
 the mnehd ment to the
 thirteenth section proposed by the
 Senator from Massachusetts Mr WILSON
 I will briefly explain this
 amendment The central route goes
 to San Fran cisco and
 in reality I think myself
 it is the only road
 we ought to undertake to
 build at this time Still
 I understand ve cannot geta
 bill through of 100 000
 000 will pay twelve per
 cent the first that kind
 sirnple and alone We propose
 to year it starts without
 the travel that now goes
 grant a certain quant ity
 of land and look upon
 it as the great road
 between the States on the
 western Sidc and those for
 that röad It goes to
 San Francisco across the ccntrul
 regions on the eastern side
 of the Rocky Mountains 1
 went over these figures a
 year or two ago and
 I of the continent The
 southern route is alto satisfied
 myself that according to the
 bill then gether through the
 Territories and through Texas proposed
 and the rates of there
 allowed it and a portion
 of California to San Francisco
 and would pay 15 000
 000 a year and I
 have no the bill gives
 that 36 000 000 and
 a certain after the ninth
 section I think Mr GRIMES
 1 make that motion Mr
 BRAGG All after the twelfth
 section Mr GWIN Strike out
 from the thirteenth section Mr
 BRAGG What will become of
 to Oregon Mr CLARK Docs
 that get rid of the
 amend ment which roposed to
 the last section Mr No
 sir that is an additional
 section which was put on
 as an amendment The motion
 is to strike out all
 of the original bill aftet
 the twelfth section leaving only
 provision for a road on
 one route the central route
 I Mr FESSENDEN That does
 not deliver you from the
 northern route wliich has just
 b cen added Mr GWIN
 Yes it does The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The motion is to
 strike out all after the
 twelfth section of the original
 bill Mr TRUMBULL That would
 strike out the amendment which
 has just been adopted provid
 ing for a northern route
 apprehend it is not in
 order to make that motion
 I should be very glad
 to have an opportunity of
 voting for the one route
 but it seems to me
 it cannot be reached in
 this way we must wait
 until we get into the
 Senate We have just adopted
 an amendment för a northern
 route Now is it competent
 to turn round and move
 to strike that out The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Not by itself
 Mr TRUMBULL Can you couple
 some thing else with it
 and move to strike it
 out The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair is of opinion that
 that can be done The
 question is on 8triking out
 all after the twelfth section
 of the original bill Mr
 WILKINSON called for thc and
 nays and they were ordered
 Mr LATHAM 1 my consent
 to this amendment for the
 reason that from the comm
 encement of the discussion upon
 this bitl I have consistently
 advocated the construction of two
 roads and I am unwilling
 now to depart from that
 policy It is immaterial to
 me as I stated on
 a previous occasion where these
 routes commence and wherc thcy
 end I care not where
 they start on the respective
 sides I am unwill doubt
 of it Take the Pike
 s Peak country where amount
 of land I propose that
 instead of going there are
 said to be sixty thousand
 people now i to San
 Francisco that road shall go
 to the Pacific II ing
 at this time to depart
 from the course I have
 If there was a railroad
 thcre would bc a hundred
 ocean wherever the company choose
 to carry it heretofore adopted
 on this measure If I
 was thousand at work thcrc
 every summer and every across
 the country coming out at
 San Diego or satisfied that
 it was utterly impossible to
 pass a one of them
 would come home to live
 in winter i anywhere else
 they choose and that they
 shall bill which wrould plcasc
 all the sections which I
 They cannot do anything there
 in winter until have the
 sum of to build the
 southern am not as yet
 I certainly would vote for
 but one route becausc the
 people of the State that
 I rep route W c
 have adopted an amendment which
 they mild comfortable homes and
 raise sorne thing to live
 on and the miners would
 all return adds the northern
 route from Lake Superior to
 resent want a road and
 not roads and the only
 reason why heretofore I have
 advocated the esta b when
 the weather was so that
 they could not sub Puget
 Sound with n branch I
 think and ve pro lislnncnt
 of two roads as I
 before stated is that sist
 comfortably there but it is
 nearly a two pose to
 give to that road 25
 000 000 Now if I
 my amendment bc adopted we
 shall give the it better
 reconciled all conflictincr interests than
 months journey I am told
 or journey of over a
 month at any rate and
 therefore they have to southern
 road 25 000 000 and
 the northern road any other
 schemc which could possibly be
 pro winter there But if
 this railroad went through 25
 000 000 and the central
 road 60 000 000 posed
 Whenever I am satisfied that
 cannot be making 110 000
 000 and it is a
 pretty large gum done I
 shall bc prepared to give
 a vote for a sin
 that country the travel would
 be increased focir I of
 money for us to vote
 at this tune Thercfore gle
 route fold There is no
 kind of doubt about that
 hope a road will be
 provided for and proper pro

 Mr DOUGLAS That amendment I
 suppose so as 10 reduce
 the rate per mile in
 the other parts of the
 bill otherwise from Illinois that
 if this amendment prevail some
 other gentleman will undoubtedly move
 corre sponding amendments to make
 the bill suit and those
 proposit ions wiil be adopted
 afterwards Mr DOUGLAS 1 have
 no objection to that provided
 the assurance can be given
 that the rate will be
 enough to mak c the
 road I suppose the bill
 gives just so much per
 milc on the idea that
 it required that amount to
 make the road Mr GREEN
 If the Senator will me
 1 will make a suggestion
 The same diffc ulty ap

 IVIr BRAGG I have an
 amendment or two I Enove
 in linc t wclvc section

 to strike out the after
 the word by service so
 rendered My purpose words ill
 this arnendment is not to
 confinc Lho clailn of the
 United States upon this corporation
 simply to reimbursement by services
 rendered I shall fol low
 it up by a 11
 0tion to strikc out the
 same words in relation to
 the morto ago which it
 is pro posed to make
 so that the Inorlgage shall
 be a full lien unoa
 the whole road without its
 beinff lirnited to reiniburscments in
 any particular way I rnovc
 to strikc out these words
 by services so rendered MY
 of At kancas T hc
 Senator from North Carolina has
 ought this bill faith fully
 is no question about that
 and I complitueüt hilu and
 those who have acted with
 vote for the bill as
 it stands and leave it
 to that future legislation for
 I am satisfied that the
 lines and directions marked out
 by the bill are the
 best that we shall ever
 make Under these circum stances
 disposed as I am to
 vote for it feeling that
 the bill has become an
 annoyance to the Senate and
 such a one that x
 ve should no longer trifle
 with it by petty amendments
 believing that we should as
 a matter of self protection
 vote down any further amendments
 I prefcr to make this
 protest on the present amendment
 introduced by one whom I
 esteem so highly as I
 do the Senator from North
 Carolina rather than on an
 amend ment introduced by a
 Senator who it might be
 supposed I could oppose asa
 matter of feeling I therefore
 earnestly ask the Senate to
 shot Y plainly that they
 mean to consider this matter
 no longer but to take
 the bill as it stands
 vote upon it pass it
 send it to the other
 House and have done with
 it in this body in
 ordcr that we may go
 on with whatever else has
 to be considered by the
 Senate Mr BRAGG I admit
 the force ofa great deal
 that my friend has said
 about this matter but I
 had intended to offer these
 amendments hereto fore but was
 prevented by an absence from
 the I think Senate necessarily
 for several days while we
 are amending the bill whether
 it is to bavc any
 effect or not I will
 not undertake to say it
 requires amendment in the particulars
 i I have indicated 1
 have heretofore stated notwith standing
 what my friend says that
 I have not fought this
 bill in any factious spirit
 at all The amendments I
 have offered I think have
 been proper ones and while
 I am opposed to the
 meas ure I have admitted
 that candidly If it is
 to pass in any shape
 I want to see it
 passed in a shape in
 which the interests of the
 country will bc pro tccted
 As I said before as
 I understand this bill it
 looks to a reimburse_ment of
 the Government solely by services
 to be rendered by the
 cm pora tion and I
 call the attention of the
 Senate to the words which
 I propose to strike out
 from line page 7 r
 he clau se would then
 read twelve Until the whole
 tunoufit of money and accruing
 interest advanced by the United
 States to said corporation or
 cor porations shall bo refinburscd
 The bill as it now
 stands adds the words by
 services so rcndercd If it
 is to confine the re
 imbursement to thc service to
 be rendered I want to
 get clear of those words
 By referring to line seventy
 eight on page 10 of
 the bill the section wherein
 there is a provision for
 a mortgage upon the whole
 road which it is provided
 I admit Å hall be
 a first rnortgage and f
 suppose intended by the Senate
 to be a full lien
 for the security of the
 United States for the whole
 amount advanced it will be
 seen that that section ends
 thus As security that the
 amount of the bonds and
 interest thereon advanced by the
 United States as aföresaid shali
 be reixnbutsed in Inau and
 other service according to the
 provisions of this act I
 wish to strike out the
 words in mail and other
 service according to the provisions
 of this act so that
 the mort yage shall remain
 and be a security that
 the full amount of the
 bonds and interest thereon advanced
 by the United States as
 aforesaid shall be reilnbursed It
 will give the Government a
 control to some extent over
 the corporation a control which
 they ought to have thc
 power t o exorcise I
 therefore move to strike out
 those words in both the
 sections I think they ought
 to coine out Mr WiLSON
 Mr President the Senator from
 North Carolina who avows that
 he is op posed to
 tbc bid Inoves this amendment
 and I certainly can boar
 testimony that hc has not
 atternpted to thwart the bill
 in any unfair way He
 has moved amendments and I
 consider some of them very
 good but in this amendment
 I think vou will give
 s _ much per mile
 on the road which and
 then limit it to which
 I suppose would render a
 supplemental bill necessary to carry
 it jut Mr WILSON The
 is in tho other him
 on the success with which
 the battle has been the
 Senate should not concur I
 do not believe that there
 are too many inducements in
 this bill that havo already
 been adopted the bill itself
 will I ann also satisfied
 that ali never build tl
 e road that the bill
 can or wili do is
 to establish the lines of
 the road and that future
 legislation alone will ever reach
 thc object which Congress has
 in v cw Mr DOUGLAS
 1 think the II Hereafter
 those rho will be intrusted
 with this should be so
 adjusted that they wili correspond
 matter can perhaps proceed under
 this bill so with the
 s lm total we are
 to pay from the Treas
 far as to fix tho
 line of the road To
 that extent up Y otherwise
 a restriction that it shall
 not go the bill Inay
 be effective No farther do
 I believe over orany other
 sun will notamount itcan ever
 be effective Under these circumstances
 to anything future legislation Illü
 st carry it out and
 IVIE BAKER Let me t
 to the Senator II and
 perfuct the measure I an
 l willing now to nowr
 to get this road built
 and especially to build what
 I regard as the greatest
 of all the great central
 road I do not believe
 that these roads I will
 ever be able to pay
 back this money and do
 not think we ought to
 amend the bill in the
 manner proposed The bill provides
 that the money and accruing
 interest shall be paid back
 by certain services by carryino
 troops and mails If we
 can get our troops and
 our mails carried over these
 roads at fair rates and
 insomuch reducc the interest on
 the bonds the amount of
 tho bonds themselvcs and extinguish
 those 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 615 amounts T certainly shall
 be glad to see it
 but I I would put
 a bit in the mouth
 of these corpora just offered
 Should have the yeas and
 nays have no idea that
 in any other mode or
 in any tions and the
 Government would be able to
 hold ask that the yeas
 and na s may be
 taken upon it I Several
 SENATORS The bill is now
 the other way will these
 companies he able to pay
 them down to it That
 is the reason I offer
 it back these sums to
 the Government We must l
 not that I expect it
 would ever be foreclosed Senate
 remember that these roads will
 pass over barren sections of
 the country where there can
 never be many inhabitants l
 hey pass over secüons of
 the country in which it
 must cost a vast deal
 of money to finish and
 construct the roads Sir I
 repeat what I have before
 said that in voting for
 this bill and this appropriation
 of 116 000 000 I
 vote with the conviction that
 this sum o money is
 to go for the general
 interests of the country and
 that we never can expect
 it back in the Treasury
 If the interest on these
 bonds from the time the
 road commences forever can be
 paid by the services the
 road renders the coun try
 it is as much certainly
 as I can expect 1
 vote for the road with
 that expectation and that If
 these three roads could be
 com understanding pleted within the
 next three or four years
 I should feel that they
 had added to the country
 hundreds of millions of dollars
 and added to its security
 and its safety and that
 or 1 for objects so
 o reat and so much
 for the interests of the
 country would be the merest
 trifle in tho world to
 this nation I have no
 doubt that tbc amendment proposcd
 by the Senator from North
 Carolina is honestly moved for
 the best of pur poses
 but hope it will not
 be sustained by the Senate
 for I believe the inducements
 in thc bilt in the
 amTreaate considering the whole of
 these liens are hardly sufficient
 now to induce to put
 their capital into the roads
 and complete them and I
 would not take out this
 inducement M r BRAGG I
 have but a word or
 two to say sir I
 will not detain the Senate
 Iwas fully I aware that
 the Senator from Massachusetts enter
 If they arc works of
 great pub Mr MASON I
 understand the bill is now
 do not believe it lic
 interest and great public benefit
 am very sure reported to
 the Senate the Governrnent would
 never foreclose them pro The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question vided
 tbc panics having the control
 do their duty I now
 is on concurring in the
 amendments adopted to the Government
 and to tile public But
 I wish to hold a
 rein upon them and not
 to give up any advantage
 of that kind to which
 the Government is justly entitled
 Hence it is that I
 Inove to strike out the
 words as to reimbursing the
 Government in this peculiar way
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on the amendment offered
 by the Senator from North
 Carolina in the twelfth line
 of thc third section of
 the bill to strike out
 the words by services so
 rendered Mr BRAGG I ask
 for thc yeas and nays

 I move to strike out

 for ovory year reduction ot

 the opinion which hc has
 just expressed pleting the work

 natned that the Government of
 the United States never I
 suppose that that provision applies
 to both would be reimbursed
 the amount which it was
 the northern and the southern
 routes as now proposed to
 expend in the building of
 these roads I incorporated in
 the bill for by a
 portion of sec while the
 Senator frorn California Mr Gw1N
 tion fifteen relating to the
 southern route it is who
 has this bill so much
 at heart avowed the other
 day a very different opinion
 Ele thought the enterprise would
 be one that would remuner
 ate these companies and be
 a payinff one Mr GWIN
 at the same time that
 if it never paid a
 dollar but would take the
 sum of 100 000 000
 to build it I would
 vote for it because it
 ought to bc built Mr
 BRAGG no doubt of that
 The I Senator would vote
 ten times that amount or
 ten times hat in order
 to carry tln oucrh the
 bill Mr GWIN The is
 very much I would not
 votc ten times that if
 it would I taken provided
 that each and every provision
 condi tion limitation and restriction
 therein before ap plied to
 or imposöd on the company
 or corpora tion l mdertaking
 the construction of the railway
 and telegraph lines starting as
 the first part of the
 bill specifies shall apply to
 this other hnc I sn
 nposc of course it applips
 to the northern route us
 in Committee of the Whole
 The Senator can renew the
 amendment as soon us the
 question is taken on them
 Mr G WIN The Senator
 can renew his amendment in
 a moment after this question
 is dis posed of Mr
 MASON I ask that that
 amendment may be excepted so
 that we may have the
 yeas and nays it in
 the Senate The PRESIDING OFFICER
 That amend mcnt not having
 been adopted the question will
 not be taken on it
 but the Senator can move
 it again and may have
 the yeas and nays upon
 it if hc requests it
 Mr G WIN I hope
 there will be no objection
 to taking t be question
 on all the amendments that
 are not cxcepted Senators can
 except those on which they
 wish to have a separate
 vote I want to except
 the amen lment offered by
 the Senator from North Carolina
 Mr BRAGG in line one
 page 5 I desire to
 propose hundred and four an
 amendment to it and therefore
 I except it The PRESIDING
 OFFICER It is moved that
 the question be taken collectively
 on concur rincr in the
 amendments madce as in Committee
 of the Whole with the
 exception of those that Sen
 ators shall except so that
 the vote may be taken
 on them separately and upon
 the others collecl ive y
 That will be considered the
 sense of the YI he
 Senator from Senate unless objected
 to i California indicates one
 that he wishes to be
 cx I cepted Mr G

 It is on page 9

 I do not know the

 Now I hope the question
 will the Federal Government to

 for the benefit of the
 country Mr BRAGG There is
 not the least doubt and
 I do it not from
 any idea that the motion

 The Senator has very enlarged

 616 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 29 The PRESIDING OFFICER Not
 separately but in the opinion
 of the Chair a motion
 to strike out those with
 other natter would be in
 order Mr HALE 1 think
 the Chair is right Mr
 GREEN A separate vote is
 reserved on the northern route
 and you have a right
 to strike out the southern
 route and that will accomplish
 what thesenator from Illinois vants
 Mr CHANDLER 1 wish to
 ask whether the first amendment
 has been excepted It is
 in line seven of the
 first section after the word
 Missouri to insert the words
 At the mouth of the
 Kansas river and proceeding thence
 up the valley of said
 river to the vicinity of
 Fort Mr GWIN That has
 not been cxcepted Mr CHANDLER
 1 wish to except it
 The PRESIDING OFFICER That will
 also be noted Mr POLK
 There was another amendment offered
 by the Senator from Wisconsin
 Mr DOOLITTLE in consequence of
 the adoption of NAYS Messrs
 Anthony Chandler Clark Collamer spent
 not only hundreds of thousands
 but mil Crittenden Dixon Doolittle
 Durkee essenden Foster lions of
 dollars which will be camplete
 very soon Grimes Ilale Harlan
 King Morrill Seward Simmons to
 the city of St Louis
 Sumner Ten Eyck Trumbull Wade
 and Wilson 22 Mr CHANDLER
 That road is not yctcom
 So the amendment was concurred
 in pleted The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Secretary Mr POLK It
 will be completed before the
 will read the next amendment
 other is begun Mr GW
 IN I hope that the
 reading of the Mr CHANDLER
 Then J was mistaken in
 I supposed there was no
 railroad next amendment will be
 dispensed with It is that
 regard connection there and hence
 this terminus would i merely
 as to the insertion of
 names It IS un necessar
 to read them be of
 no use But though there
 may be railroad connection at
 this point it is better
 that it should be left
 to the option of this
 company to terminate it where
 it is to their best
 interest cither at St Joseph
 or at Kansas City as
 they may sce fit A
 railroad is already completed from
 St Joseph to Philadelphia Baltimore
 New York and alt the
 great citics and J think
 it should be left to
 the discretion of the company
 to terminaLc their road where
 it is for their interest
 to do so I hope
 the amendment will not be
 concurred in The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question I suppose the
 two will go to is
 Will the Senate concur in
 thc amendment that amendment Mr
 CHANDLER Where was that ment
 Mr POLK In the samc
 section it requires the road
 to pass at or near
 Fort Kearny Mr CHANDLER 1
 except that likewise The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Secretary will note
 that aigo Mr LATHAM 1
 do not wish to be
 under stood as excepting that
 portion of the first section
 which refers to the associates
 of the subscribers It is
 merely the additional and corporators
 names that I wish to
 except The amendments not excepted
 were concurrcd in there being
 on a division ayes twenty
 seven noes not counted Mr
 G WIN Now Ict us
 take separate votes on the
 excepted muen hnents in their
 order The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will su ygest to
 save time that the tuncndrncnts
 bc taken up in their
 order The first amendment excepted
 will be read Thee Secrctnry
 read it l o insert
 after the word Missouri in
 linc seven of the first
 section the words at the
 meuth of the Kansas river
 and proceeding thence up thc
 valley of said river to
 the vicinity of Fort Riley
 so that the scction wilT
 read Phat to insure the
 gafc certatn and speedy transporta
 tion of mails troops and
 public stores from the western
 border of what is called
 our western States by railroad
 to wit starting from two
 points one on the western
 bor ler ot the State
 of Missouri at the mouth
 of the Kansas river and
 proceeding tbeuce up tbe valley
 ot said river to the
 vicin ity of Fort Riley
 and tho other on the
 western border of Iowa wit
 h two converging lines bearillß
 westward and uniting within two
 hundred miles of t11C Miesouri
 river Ec Mr POLK That
 takes in the amendment in
 line eleven to insert at
 or near Fort Kearny Mr
 CHANDLER 1 hope the Senate
 will not concur in that
 amendment I think it should
 be left to the compnny
 to select their route and
 to say where it shall
 cmnmcncc There is already u
 railroad communication open to St
 Joseph which is I think
 some forty or fifty milcs
 ft tr ther west than
 Ibe point here named and
 by going to St Joseph
 the building of some forty
 or fifty miles of raih
 oad may be saved That
 nlt ty not bc the
 best terminus or it may
 I think it should be
 lcft open to the contractorg
 to decide whether they will
 terrninate their road at St
 Joseph or at Kan sas
 City where there is no
 connecting road or wherever it
 is for their interests and
 the interests of the country
 to locate it So far
 as the Fort Kearny amendment
 is concerned I can see
 no rcason whatever for that
 There is simply a w
 acron road there that costs
 nothing or next to nothing
 to build and I sec
 no reason at all for
 taking this railroad there Mr
 POLK I do not propose
 to discuss this matter now
 I merely wish to correct
 a misap prehension that I
 think the Senator from Mich
 if ran is under have
 already said when the Sen
 ate was in Committee of
 the W110 e on this
 arnendment all that I propose
 to say except that I
 think the Senator is mistaken
 in the distance and he
 is also mistaken when he
 gives the Senate the impressiön
 as I think Ilie does
 that starting it at or
 near the mouth of the
 Kansas would not oive it
 a railroad connection It connects
 there with the Pacific railroad
 of Missouri now nearly finished
 and on which the State
 of Missouri has The amendment
 was concurred in The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The next amendment is
 in section one in line
 eleven after Missouri river to
 insert at or near Fort
 Kearny Mr POLK and Mr
 LATHAM That was included in
 the last The PRESIDING OFFICER
 It will be con sidered
 as included in the other
 vote unless a sep arate
 vote is asked Aareed The
 next amendment is to insert
 after s California in the
 fifteenth line of the first
 section Thence branching north through
 the valleys of Sacra mento
 and Rogue rivers Umpqua and
 VVillamette to Port land in
 Oregon and for the construction
 of this branch a grant
 of alternate sections of land
 tor six Inilcs on each
 side of said road is
 hereby made to bc selected
 in odd nu n bers
 frcnu tbc nearest unoccupied and
 unappropriated ao ricultural lands Mr
 LANE I suppose no one
 will have any objection to
 changing the word north to
 northerly in that amendment The
 PRESIDING OFFICER That change vill
 be made by conunon consent
 Mr DOOLITTLE That is amendment
 to the bill which I
 desired to have cxceptcd will
 state in a single word
 my objection to it By
 an amendment which has been
 made to the bill a
 route has been added from
 Lake Superior to Puget Sound
 with a branch to Portland
 this same point This isa
 railroad in fact in theState
 of California and in the
 State of Oregon running parallel
 with the coast of the
 Pacific ocean about four hundred
 miles in length It is
 a railroad en tirely within
 the States an addition to
 the length of the line
 of some four hundred miles
 If there were silnply grant
 of land to the States
 of Cali fornia and Oregon
 to aid in the construction
 of that road I would
 freely vote for such a
 grant but as it comes
 in as a part of
 this bill the money grant
 also ns I suppose goes
 with it and there fbrc
 I cannot vote for it
 Mr GREEN The aggregate amount
 of money appropriated is not
 increased one dollar by this
 amcndment Therefore they can get
 nothing but the land The
 limitation still continues Mr LANE
 will not discuss the importance
 of this extension I did
 that before but I will
 simply ask for the yeas
 and nays The PhESIDING OFFICER
 The question is on concurrino
 in the amendment made as
 in Committee of the Whole
 inserting the names of individuals
 in the first section of
 the bili Mr CHANDLER Is
 it in order to move
 to insert another name before
 that is acted on The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair thinks
 not The amendment was concurred
 in The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 next amendment is in section
 one line one hundred and
 four after the word constructed
 to insert nor until said
 acts of incorporation shall have
 been submitted to and approved
 by the Congu ess of
 the United States I Mr
 GWIN 1 to amend that
 ment by striking it all
 out except the word G
 nor and insertirv if said
 act of incorporation shaft be
 disapproved by the Congress of
 the United States at tho
 ensmncr session e My object
 is to rive the next
 session of Congress the control
 of this question That is
 to say if they disapprove
 of these acts of incorporation
 ret Congress say so and
 nullify the action that may
 be taken under this law
 up to that time but
 I want to make the
 legislation positive on the part
 of the next Con gress
 and not give the power
 of delaying the work putting
 it off for years and
 thereby defeat ing the object
 of the bilr Mr BRAGG
 I hope the Senate will
 not agree to the amendment
 of the Senator from California
 I think it completely emasculates
 the amendment which I offered
 and which was adopted in
 Com mittec of the Whole
 and makes it virtually arnount
 to nothing It will be
 observed that the amendment offered
 by the Senator from Califor
 nia does not even require
 these acts of incorporau tion
 to be submitted to Congress
 How we are to get
 them licre I do not
 know The amend ment instead
 of requiring these acts of
 incorpora tion to be submitted
 to Congress and approved by
 Congress at its next session
 only provides that the title
 to the landé and the
 bonds granted to the company
 shall not vest until they
 are incorpo rated nor if
 said acts of incorporation shall
 be disapproved by the Congress
 of the United States at
 the ensuirp session but it
 does not require them to
 be submitted to Congress at
 all there is no provision
 in the amendment offered by
 the Senator from California to
 that effect very ingenious way
 it seems to me completely
 emasculating the amendment which I
 offered and making it amount
 to nothing The acts of
 incor poration never will be
 submitted here under this amendment
 and we shall hardly know
 what they are certainly not
 oflicially and it seems to
 me that in that shape
 it will amount to just
 nothing at all If there
 is anything in the argument
 the Senator has urged that
 thc gentlemen who under take
 to build this road will
 not know what to be
 The oas and nays were
 ordered at it applies with
 just as much force to
 hisamend Mr BUGI I I
 shall vote for this amcndt
 ent i I ment as
 to mine if his an
 nndment amounts to because the
 Senate have refused to agree
 to the anything because Congress
 still has control and motion
 of the Senator from Louisiana
 Mr BEN has the right
 to disapprove all these acts
 of incor jAMIN l to
 strike out so much of
 the bilk as pro poration
 How in what way they
 are to signify vides the
 construction of railroads within the
 their disapproval how much or
 what part of these States
 of rrexas and California can
 see no acts if they
 disapprove of them is to
 be effectual reason why we
 should not extend an equal
 dc and what part is
 to be ineffectual the amendment
 I am opposed to the
 does not provide gree of
 favor to Oregon In other
 words as I said just
 whole of it I do
 not intend to vote for
 the bill now in my
 humble judgment it is a
 very inge as long as
 any provision is made for
 the construc rnous way of
 getting rid of the amendment
 which tion of any rond
 in any State but still
 the bill the Senate after
 full consideration incorporatcd containing provisionsfor
 theconstrnction of roads into the
 bikl when acting as in
 Committee of the in Texas
 and California I see no
 reason why l Whole Oregon
 should not have equal favor
 and thero Mr G WIN
 My only ouject is to
 have this fore while I
 am against the whole system
 I shall question definitively settred
 at the next session vote
 for this amendment i Certainly
 the Congress of the United
 States can The question being
 taken by yeas and nays
 command all these acts of
 incorporation to be resulted yeas
 28 nays 22 as follows
 placed before them and no
 doubt will do it if
 YEAS Messrs Baker Bayard Bragg

 If we do not do
 it we shall fol II
 God s sake do not
 let us make this concern
 a cor Mr BAKER 1
 hope the amendment of the
 tion of the road Senator
 from California will be adopted
 I have low thc example
 set in other parts of
 the country rupt jobbing concern
 do not let men without
 examined it carefully and it
 is just as he says
 heretofore and we shall have
 a set of speculators character
 and without money take control
 of it As the amendment
 stands nov r in the
 bill any and stock gamblers
 brought into the road and
 in the hope of making
 some money outof the they
 will not put their money
 in it they will come
 United States and out of
 these lands putting no delay
 on the part of Congress
 at its next session in
 to make money out of
 it to make a job
 of it would entirely defeat
 the road This autendment i
 i merely changes whata lawyer
 would call the bur to
 cheat the honest men who
 put their money in tho
 road as has been do
 oe heretofore and mort den
 of proof It requires Congress
 to dissent i from the
 act of incorporation in a
 certain time or gage the
 road and before we get
 through the whole thing will
 bc thrown on our hands
 else the road goes on
 Mr SI MM ONS I
 hope that amendment will Natismy
 deliberate judgment and the history
 If these people cannot come
 here of railroad building in
 this country for twent y
 not prevail with such acts
 of incorporation as will bc

 this policy This tends to
 by Congress they ought not
 to have the road or
 honesty the other I believe
 Will invite dishonest t men
 into thc road stock gamblers

 do not wish to sec

 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on the amendment proposed by
 tbc Senator out the time
 will come when we shall
 wish and from California to
 the amendment which was the
 country will wish we had
 kept this check adopted in
 Ccnnmitteeof the Whole I hemnend
 upon it That is my
 judgment I Mr CHANDLER is
 of capital who ment which
 was adopted in Committce of
 thc money in themselves but
 cheating the honest man who
 is induced to contribute to
 build the road from high
 considerations Mr FITCH The mortgage
 can in no way affect
 the interest of the United
 is very certain except it
 may be the means of
 more quickly completing the road
 and therefore may affect the
 interest of the United States
 beneficially not prejudicially The stockholders
 under an amendment to the
 bill adopted at the suggestion
 of one of the Senators
 from Louisiana can if they
 will have control of the
 road for any man citi
 zen or foreigner can subscribe
 to this stock and make
 himself a party in the
 directory of the road If
 then after having subscribed and
 expended their own means to
 the extent either of then
 abil ity or their willingness
 they consent through their representatives
 in the board of dircctory
 to mortgage what they have
 expended and procure money for
 the completion of the road
 it is their It only
 expedites and secures If 1
 lookout not ours build railroads
 anywhere and everywhere Whole was
 to add to the proviso
 at the end of those
 men of capital after having
 placed as they the first
 section of the bill nor
 until said acts supposed thc
 requisite amount in the road

 have been submitted to and
 II plete it discover that
 it takes a million or
 two mil approved by the
 Congrcss of the Unitcd States
 The Senator from California proposes
 so to arncnd lion or
 three million dollars more and
 other men stand ready to
 take their bonds and they
 have it as to make
 it read nor said acts
 of incor poration shall be
 disapproved by the of advanced
 all they are willing to
 advance for the II cotnpletion
 of the road why should
 we prohibit the United States
 at its ensuing session The
 them from raisincr money in
 that way I ap question

 of the Senator from Mas

 all jected and the question
 recurring upon the amend they
 arc willing to subscribe will
 be enabled to ment made
 as rn Committee of the
 Whole it was raise money
 upon bonds that moneyed men
 con I think the insertion
 sidcr to be good securities
 concurred in The question was
 next stated to be on
 concur I of this amendment
 will be a fatal clause
 in t he ring in
 the amendment made in the
 fou section by inserting after
 United States in the forty
 The question being taken there
 were on a division ayes
 twenty five seventh line the
 words Mr G WIN I
 ask for the yeas and
 nays And no mortgage or
 construction bonds shali ever be
 The eas and nays were
 ordered issued by said cunpany
 on said road or mortaatye
 or licn Mr BITCH It
 is so manifest to me
 that the Inade in any
 vay except to the United
 States adoption of this amendment
 will defeat t he object
 Mr G WIN Ido not
 want to occupy thc time
 of the Senate but look
 on this as a matter
 of i of thc bill
 and effectually prevent the construc
 tion of the road or
 roads that if the amendment
 vital consequence A vast amount
 of money will have to
 be raised by the subscribers
 The first be adopted I
 shall feel constrainedto vote against
 If the stockholders are l
 he the bill in all
 its phases mort rage will
 secure the United States Government
 is to have the first
 lien on the road willing
 after subscribing and paying to
 the ex tent of their
 ability to mortgage their own
 credit which is a sufficient
 guarantee to the United States
 and the amount they have
 sub scribed is the basis
 for the payment of the
 indebtedness of the com pan
 y to them if it
 shall ever be able to
 pay any of the loan
 it is their loss and
 they incur the If you
 prohibit them loss with their
 eyes open del t at
 all Then the amendment offered
 this morning by the Senator
 from New Hampshire from borrowing
 after expending all their own
 means the roaa falls mcessarily
 falls and the giving the
 control to the Congress of
 the United the completion of
 the rdad instead of retarding
 If they are cheated they
 are cheated by their it
 own agents and the prospect
 that they may be cheated
 iVill probably Induce them to
 be extremely cautious in the
 selection of a board of
 directors But to prohibit that
 mode of using the capitol
 which those men may subscribe
 is to prohibit them from
 making the stock valuable to
 the very men who themselves
 have taken it Mr CHANDLER
 1 do not believe there
 has been a railroad built
 in the United States ten
 miles in length without the
 issue of bonds I never
 heard of one Certainly there
 has not been one built
 of fifty miles in length
 without issuing bonds The projectors
 of a railroad obtain subscriptions
 to an amount sufficient as
 they suppose to com plete
 the road but when they
 come to construct It they
 encounter a granite hill or
 as in my own State
 an almost bottomless lake The
 cxpense of bui ding the
 road is thereby enormously in
 creased uncxpected y increased Does
 the Sen ator from Massachusetts
 suppose that when they have
 comc to an obstacle of
 thit kind they are to
 obtain a new subscription to
 complete the road They never
 can do it Up to
 that point their road is
 useless while if they can
 complete it through it is
 valuable By the issuing of
 bonds or evi dences of
 debt they can raise money
 to complete the road It
 may cost more it may
 sink the cap ital of
 the original subscribers to the
 stock but it was sunk
 any way if the road
 stopped there and it is
 not wort h a farthing
 on the dollar if you
 stop it half way Then
 if you raise money I
 carc not it it be
 at a usurious rate of
 interest to carry the road
 throvh something may be made
 whereas nothing wfil be made
 if you stop there That
 is precisely the case here
 You propose to build a
 railroad across the Rocky Mountains
 but do you know how
 much money it will take
 to carry the road through
 those gulches You know nothing
 about it After you get
 subscriptions sufficient as you sup
 pose to complete the road
 you get up into one
 of the passes of the
 mountains and you find that
 you lack 2 000 000
 the Senator from Massach u
 setts says you shall not
 borrow this 2 000 000
 States and giving them a
 supervision over this i very
 object of the bill will
 be clearly defeated by who
 wilt comc in and supply
 the money unless work if
 thero is any abuse in
 it it seems to Ine
 the passage of the amendment
 answers the purpose which the
 Senator from Mr WILSON Allow
 me to state this point
 you can borrow it Your
 security is ample You Massachusetts
 had when he offered this
 amend i to the Senator
 from Indiana if the manao
 ers of have already invested
 as you suppose money I
 am afraid thiz would so
 cripple the work I this
 road are allowed to mortgage
 the roaa they enough to
 build the road It will
 not do it You on
 both routes that it might
 prevent anything can do so
 and the original stockholders will
 be offer bonds that are
 satisfactory to moneyed men your
 stockholders have exhausted themselves cheated
 altogether Has not this been
 the experi effective in building
 either of the roads ånd
 there ence of the country
 The result has bccn that
 the they have paid up
 all their stock they have
 in fore I hope it
 will not be adopted MI
 CEIANDLER I hope this aunendment
 honestportion of the community that
 invested their vesied all the
 money they are willing to
 invest will not be adopted
 If moneyed men see fit
 to means to build railroads
 have last their money and
 now they come forward with
 securitiesthatare take second mortgagc bonds
 of this company I lost
 their stock lost their bonds
 and the mana perfoct y
 satisfactory to moneyed men to
 carry cers and jobbers and
 speculators have lost their the
 road through the pass and
 the Ser ator from see
 no reason why we should
 undertake to inter character but
 a great many of them
 ha ve made Massachusetts says
 it shall not be done
 Sir fcrc between the company
 and those who are will
 It If I had millions
 of dollars I this proposition
 is an absurdity upon its
 face It money out of
 it incr tf advance money
 to carry on the road
 like a nccdless interference with
 the would not take a
 dollar in this road if
 the man No railroad ever
 was built or in my
 judgment progress nt the work
 and I hope the amendment
 acers of it could mortgage
 it away for I would
 ever will be completed without
 the power of bor rowincy
 money I know that should
 lose every dollar of it
 and I be adopted Mr
 SIMMONS r would suggest to
 the Sen 2Mr WILSON I
 do not wish to take
 up the tell you they
 will lose every dollar if
 the man ator from Michigan
 tl lat in just such
 a case as time of
 the Senate but I think
 we had better stand acrers
 have this power We offer
 great induce he puts they
 can a ply to Congress
 to get liberty by the
 vote adoptinæ this amendment and
 adhere mcnts to go into
 this road We give to
 the cen to borrow Let
 tlhern put their money in
 and to this policy for
 the reason that if it
 stands in tral road and
 a large quantity Of land
 and now if the moneyed
 men and the people of
 i give somc security before
 you authorize them to the
 bill it will induce mcn
 to into the measure hire
 money It is for the
 very purpose of pre and
 rnen onlv who are willinT
 to put their money this
 country cannot contribute the balal
 lce that I think it
 will tend to secure the
 construc is necessary I am
 willinff to vote more but
 for ventincr stock jobbing that
 this amendment owht 618 to
 be put in If there
 is enough money subscribed to
 cmnpletc the road to the
 Rocky Mountains and they met
 with an unexpected obstacle cannot
 Chey apply to Congress sayinø
 We have now spent 50
 000 000 and cannotget ihrough
 author izo us to borrow
 25 000 000 and Congress
 would do it in a
 minute but by holding out
 the idea that they are

 Cominit tee to present this

 have alluded The Representatives from

 satisfied with this on condition
 that a daily overland mail
 is granted by Congress Upon

 forty thousand dollars T hc
 pro vision we havo already
 adopted making thc post agc
 to California and the Pacific
 upon letters uni form at
 ten cents the half ounce
 whether it passes o ver
 three thousand miles or not
 will also increase the revenue
 froin the California mails to
 an amount not definitely ascertained
 but probably twenty or twenty
 five thousand dollars Saying nothing
 about the increase in correspondence
 that wrili certainly result from
 these daily facilities these two
 provisi0i 1s will reduce the
 expense of this daily route
 over the present service to
 about one hund red and
 forty thousand dollars a year
 and for this additional expense
 we shall receive thirty inails
 a month each way between
 the Atlantic and the Pacific
 coasts instead of five and
 we shall also have the
 mails carried through five days
 quicker than at present I
 therefore by the direction of
 the Post Offco Connnillee submit

 that they would build a

 an amend ment to the
 amendment of the Senate Mr
 VVASHBURNE of Illinois When does
 the morning hour expirb The
 SPEAKER In three minutes Mr
 PHELPS 1 move to the
 words reserving to the Govermnent
 the privilege of annulling the
 contract after the commencement of
 the overland service upon ninety
 days notice and in lieu
 thereof to insert a prov
 so that the service shall
 end on the 30th of
 June next Mr Speaker the
 effect of the amendment I
 propose will be to terminate
 this service by steam ships
 at the time of the
 commencmnent of the over land
 mail service You already have
 one over land mail route
 at a cost of 600
 000 per annum siderable additional
 expcnse of sending t hc
 mails daily not only to
 them but to all our
 people on the Pacific I
 imagine they cannot look at
 this ad ditional expense as
 any very great scare crow
 When you take into consideration
 the fact that very short
 time ago 600 000 was
 considered by Congress as a
 very small sum for carrying
 the mail consisting of nothing
 but letters to Pike s
 Peak and that it is
 now proposed to carry all
 the than two hundred thousand
 dollars additional expense this must

 objection and it was order
 d ac cordingly STATE OF
 UNION The House then resumed
 the consideration of the special
 order being the report of
 the special committee of thirty
 three Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 I do not expect to
 be heard ill all parts
 of the Hall owing to
 the bad stat_e ot my
 health and voice but I
 will present some views on
 the pending ques tion which
 I may not have another
 opportunity to do I regret
 sir that I am compelled
 to concur in the belief
 stated yesterday by the gentleman
 from Vir ginia PRYOR that
 no compromise which can be
 made will have any effect
 in averting the present diffcuity
 I concur in that belief
 because it is rny belief
 although I regret the fact
 for when I sce these
 States in open and declared
 rebellion against the Union seizing
 upon her public forts and
 arsenals and robbing her of
 millions of the public property
 when I sce the batteries
 of seced Ing States blockading
 the highway of the nation
 and their armies in battle
 array against the flag of
 the Union when I see
 sir our flag insulted and
 that insult submitted to I
 have no hope that con
 cession l iumiliation and compromise
 can have any effect whatever
 And what confirms me if
 confirmation were necessary and what
 confirms thc remark of the
 gentleman from Virginia N lr
 PRYOR is a piece of
 news contained in the paper
 just laid upon the desks
 of members Virginia sends embassadors
 to the head and front
 of the empire that is
 proposed to be erected upon
 the ruins of this Government
 for the purpose of get
 ting South Carolina to appoint
 commissioners for the purpose of
 proposincr amendments to the Consiitution
 of the United States to
 secure their rights as they
 say and that kingdom of
 South Carolina peremptorily refuses to
 appoint any such commissioners for
 the reason that it has
 no de sire or dcsiffn
 of promoting the ultimate object
 set forth in the joint
 resolutions of the State of
 Vir ginia that is the
 procurement of amendments to or
 new guarantees in the Constitution
 of the I has cnds
 negotiation thus ends United States
 concession thus ends compromise by
 the solemn declaration of the
 seceding party that they will
 not listen to concession or
 compromise Mr Speaker following close
 upon the belliger ent speech
 of tho gent leman from
 Virginia yester day I saw
 the contribution toward compromise which
 the slaveholding States are willi1V
 to make to the North
 for compromise means some con
 Immediately after that cession from
 both sides speech a bill
 came up to admit Kansas
 into the Union and I
 am sorry to say that
 almost every southern man men
 who had just been appealing
 to us to furnish them
 ground to stand upon almost
 in a solid body the
 southern men voted acrainst even
 the consideration of the question
 of admitting Kansas that source
 of all our WOCß II
 leave the inference to the
 country I have no expectation
 that anything that we could
 say or do or that
 could be said or done
 in Congress would have the
 least effect in retarding or
 accelerating the onward career of
 the secession movement which already
 pervades this land Ido not
 believe that words now will
 have any effcct yet it
 is right that the effort
 should be made It is
 right that upon this floor
 we should enunciate our views
 that from this Hall sacred
 to freedom and free debate
 we should inform our constituents
 of the condition of things
 that they may well con
 sider thenr so that if
 we are wrong they may
 of that in the resolutions
 of the leading seceding State
 South Carolina which are as
 follows Resolved unanimousty That the
 Generat Assembly of South Carolina
 tenders to the Legislature of
 Virginia their acknowledgnent of the
 friendly motives which inspired the
 lilission intrusted to Hon Jud
 re Robertson her com niissioncr
 Resolved unanimously That candor which
 is due to the long
 continued sympathy and respect which
 has sub sisted between Virginia
 and Soulh Carolina induces the
 Assernbly to declare with frankness
 that they do not deem
 it advisable to initiate negotiations
 when they have no dc
 sire or intention to protnote
 the ulti natc object in
 view that object which is
 declared in the resolution of
 the Vir ginia Legislature to
 be the procurelncnt of amendrnents
 or new guarantees to the
 Constitution of the United States
 Resolved unanimously I txat the
 separation of South Carolina from
 the Federal Union is final
 and she has no further
 interest in the Constitution it
 the United States and that
 the only appropriate negotiations between
 her and the Federal Governunent
 are as to their mutual
 relations as foreign States Bu
 t I have not heretofore
 expected that anyth ing that
 has been done or could
 be said or done here
 could have any effect in
 retarding or accelerating the headlong
 career of treason and rebellion
 that now frighten the land
 This I deeply regret as
 should be willing to go
 to the verge of principle
 to avert this catastrophe The
 question of the dissolution of
 the Union is a grave
 one and should be approached
 with out excitement or passion
 or fear Difficultics have surrounded
 all nations in their inception
 in their proo ress to
 greatness and in their stability
 Much of their success has
 depended on the abil ity
 and the firmness of the
 statesmen who had the management
 of affairs in the days
 of their trouble i he
 virtue most needed in times
 of peril is courage calm
 unwaverin5 courarre which no danger
 can appal and which will
 not be excited to action
 by indignation or revenee If
 such statesmen governed by such
 qualities should be found at
 the head of this nation
 when danger comes there can
 bc no fear for the
 result The Union will overcome
 all difficulties and last through
 unnumbered ages to bless millions
 of happy freemen Homilies upon
 the Union and jeremiads over
 its destruction can be of
 no use except to display
 fine rhetoric and pathetic elo
 qucnce The southern States will
 not be turned from their
 deliberate and stern purpose by
 soft words and touching lamentations
 After the extent to which
 they have gone it would
 do them no credit condemnation
 which is now felt for
 their conduct would degenerate into
 contempt The annual message of
 the President contains some wholesome
 trut h s mixed with
 atrocious cal It states that
 umrnes l he long continued
 and intcnuperate interterence of the
 northern people with the question
 of slavery in the southern
 States has at length produced
 its natural effects The President
 well knew that tho anti
 slavery party of the North
 never interfered or claimed the
 right to interfere or expressed
 a desire to in termeddle
 with slavery in the States
 Search the proceedings of their
 Legislatures their con ventions and
 their party creeds and you
 will find them always disclaiming
 the right or the intention
 to touch slavery in the
 States where it existed But
 this calumny on the freemen
 of the North traitors and
 we shall long remain a
 united and happy people ft
 did not require the present
 Constitution to make our Union
 perpetual in theory The Articles
 of Confederation declared in express
 terms That the Articles of
 Confederation shall be inviolably observed
 by every State and the
 Union Shall be perpetüal If
 the force of moral suasion
 and patriotism were alone to
 be relied on to jnsui
 e its perpetuity the convention
 which substituted the present for
 the old Constitution was but
 little needed True there were
 other defects in the old
 Articles The several States had
 conflicting laws with regard to
 the revcnue t axation and
 other subjects As Congress could
 operate only on the States
 if they refused to comply
 t vith then requisitions it
 was diffcult to enforce them
 But the great defect in
 the preceding Government was the
 want of au thonty and
 the main motive for the
 change was to clothe the
 central Government with suffcient power
 to perpetuate its own existence
 The res olutions of the
 several States appointing delegates to
 the convention and thc act
 of Congress rec ommending it
 show that The act of
 Congress of May 1787 recommended
 a con ven lion so
 to alter the Articles of
 ConCederalion as shall be necessary
 5 to the preservation and
 support of the Union Massach
 u setts instructed her delegates
 so to amend as to
 render the Federal Constitution adequate
 to the preservation of the
 Union Connecticut instructed hers in
 the same words New York
 instructed so to amend as
 to render the Federal Government
 adequate to the exigencies of
 Gov ernment and the preservation
 of the Union As to
 coercion General Washington in a
 let ter to Mr Madison
 dated before the convention March
 31 1787 in discussing the
 necessity for a stronger Federal
 Government says I confess however
 that my opinion of public
 virtue is so far changed
 that I have my doubts
 whether any system without the
 means of coercion in the
 sovercign will en force due
 obedience to the requireunents of
 the General Gov ernment without
 which everything else fails These
 quotations might bc fortified by
 similar ones from many States
 and leading statesmen They prove
 beyond all doubt that the
 Constitu tion was intended and
 supposed to confer on the
 Government sufficient power to defend
 and per petuate the Union
 if necessa ry to coerce
 a rebel State or to
 reach the same point by
 a surer road to coerce
 the people of the State
 to obey all laws of
 the General Government The Congress
 of the Confoderation could act
 If they were refractory it
 was only on States found
 difficult to enforce the laws
 l he Consti tulion ismade
 to operate directly on the
 individuals on the people without
 resorting to State au thorities
 or asking State aid The
 Constitution being ordained by the
 people and operating di rectly
 on them does not permit
 the States to thwart its
 operations any more than it
 invokes It is a self
 sustaining independent their aid power
 and absolutely sovereign wJthin its
 sphere If a State pass
 laws or ordinances hostile to
 the Constitution no citizen is
 bound to obey them Nay
 he is bound not to
 obey them If in obe
 I dicnce to them hc
 vioJates the Constitution he so
 often repeated by a Inan
 who during his whole political
 life has been the slave
 of Slavery is not cannot
 plead such laws in his
 defense hooves every citizen at
 his peril to decide whether
 worth a moment s consideration
 He makes I hc will
 obey the higher or the
 lower power Ibe very able
 and conclusive argument against the
 right of secession and had
 he followed it out to
 its legitimate results he would
 have deserved the gratitude of
 his country Bu tafter denouncing
 secession as a great wrong
 he came to the impotent
 conclusion that there is no
 power in the Government to
 prevent or pun It is
 time that this important question
 were I do not perceiye
 when any better oc solved
 Constitution of the United States
 or thc void en If
 he commit treason against actment
 of States i the United
 States hc will not be
 excused like a soldier who
 obeys his commander on the
 ground of obédicnce to higher
 authority In order to clothe
 the central Government with power
 to defend the Union and
 rnake it perpetual the Constitution
 provides that Congress shall have
 power to lay and collect
 taxes du i ties imposts
 and excises to provide for
 the colli1Ri01i de easion can
 present itself to decide whether
 this ttnse and general weifhre
 of the United States to
 regulate if we are right
 they may strengthen Union exists

 I do not that northern

 Mr WEBSTER ask the gentleman
 to allow me one minute
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania 1
 do not like to say
 no but my time is
 passing rapidly I vlr WEBSTER
 well sir our districts run
 together for some distance and
 as the gentleman has referped
 to what he says occurred
 in Chester county h respect
 to kidnappmg desire to state
 one or two circumstances which
 I know to be facts
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania I
 havc stated nothing that I
 do not know to be
 facts Mr WEBSTER vvTell sir
 the gentleman has reterred to
 certain events which he says
 hap pened in my district
 Now Mr Speaker I have
 no wish to enter upon
 crimination and recrimina tion Mr
 STEVENS of Pennsylvania If 0b
 ject of the gentleman be
 recrimination I cannot yield the
 floor for that purpose Mr
 WEBSTER well sir 1 desire
 only to refer to an
 occurrence which took place in
 Car lisle Pennsylvania A man
 from my Stato went to
 Carlisle to reclaim a slave
 who had fled from him
 and was murdered in his
 atternnt to arrest his own
 slave Another gentleman went from
 Baltimore county in my district
 to the gentle man s
 State to reclaim his slave
 who had escaped and he
 was murdered at Christiana while
 endeav orinrr to efll ct
 the reclarnation and no man
 in either case was ever
 brought to justice for the
 act Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 1 know something aboilt that
 myself but I do not
 see the necessity of bringing
 it in here Mr WEBSTÉR
 The gentleman should not make
 charges against the people of
 Maryland if he does not
 expect a reply Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania I have not
 madc any charges Llmt are
 not true The fact to
 which the gentleman now refers
 is silnply that a man
 from Maryland came into Pennsylvania
 to reclaim his slave and
 in at tempting to carry
 out that purpose his own
 slave took his life Mr
 WEBSTER There was great crowd
 of persons aidincr and abetting
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania No
 sir there vere only two
 white persons present the rest
 were negroes IVIt WEBSTER It
 was shown before the court
 that there was a great
 crowd of white men and
 ncgt oes all tocether there
 Mr JUNKIN No sir no
 white man had any hand
 in the matter Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania The rights of
 conscience and freedom of speech
 are forbidden to northern men
 They are not allowed to
 re ceive or read documents
 which deny the justice of
 slavery A citizen of Virginia
 at the late elec tion
 voted for the man of
 his choice IN Ir Lin
 coln and was seized in
 broad daylirrht in the midst
 of the respectable people of
 the place his face blacked
 and he expelled from his
 home Sir the South at
 this moment is a hideous
 des pot ism so far
 as northern citizens are concerned
 T heir courts are inaccessible
 to secure redress T bo
 slnve trade is openly justified
 When a sla ving pirate
 is sent them for trial
 with the fullest proof of
 guilt the bills are either
 icrnored or juries acquit I
 have ornitted the real agcrrcssion
 which one I of the
 States frankly assigns as the
 reason ofseccs North has taken
 from them the power of
 the Governnlent which they have
 held so long According to
 the strictest forms and principles
 of tbe Constitution they have
 clccted thc man of their
 choice President of the United
 States No violence was used
 no malpractice is charged but
 the American people dared to
 disobey the com mands of
 slavery and this is proclaimed
 as just cause of secession
 and civil war Sir has
 it come to this Canr
 ot the people of the
 United States choose whom they
 please President without stir ring
 up rebellion and requiring humiliation
 con cessions arid cornpromises to
 appease the insur gents Sir
 I would take no steps
 to propitiate such a feeling
 Rather than show repen tauce
 for the election of Mr
 Lincoln with all its conse
 quenees I would see this
 Government crumble intoa thousand atoms
 If I cannot be a
 freeman let mc cease to
 exist The committee of thirty
 three have shown their esthnate
 of the maonitude of southern
 grievances by a most delicate
 piece of satire As a
 cure for their wrongs and
 to seduce back rebell_ious 1861
 TliE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 623 States
 they offer to admit as
 a State about two hundred

 of vol canic desert with
 less than a thousand white
 An glo Saxon inhabitants and
 some forty or fifty thousand
 Indians Mustees and Mexicans who
 do not ask adnaission and
 who have shown their capacity
 for self government by the
 infamous slave code which they
 have passed which establishes the
 most cruel kind of black

 sure the distinguished chairman of
 that committee NIr C0RwiN seems
 to have become enamored of

 it as a be ncvolent
 institution which saves tho poor
 man s cow to furnish

 sellin y the father instead

 Will the gentleman allow me
 to explain that peon law
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania Certainly
 if it does not come
 out of my time Mr
 OTERO got the law here
 Mr S rßVL NS of
 Pennsylvania Ah the gcntlernarl is
 going to make argument Mr
 OTERO Oh no Iam only
 going to refer to thé
 law I have here the
 law to which I pre
 sume the gentleman has reference
 It is the one which
 was attelnptcd to be repealed
 by the bill of the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr BINGHAM
 session Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 The same one Mr OTERO
 I want to havc this
 portion of the law read
 The Clerk read as follows
 No court of this l
 crrftory shall have jurisd ction
 nor shall take cotrnizance of
 any cause for the parental
 correc tion that masters may
 give their servants fin neglect
 of their duties as servants
 tor they are considered as
 ii lnestäc serv ants to
 their masters and they should
 their neglects and faults for
 as soldiers arc punished by
 tileir chiefs without the intervention
 o the civil authority by
 reason o f the salary
 Chey an equal rioht should
 be granted those persons who
 pay their Eiloaey to be
 served ill the oc their
 property Provided that such eon
 ection shali not be iriflicted
 in L cruel nnanner with
 clubs or stripes rental reprinut
 nd that masters may give
 their ser varit s neglect
 of their duties as servants
 That I is the correct
 translation and such is the
 mean ing of the words
 rcconvenciones familiares STEVENS ofPennsylvania Then
 take it for granted that
 slavery in Now Mexico means
 nothing more than parental admonition
 Laugh T hc secession and
 rebellion of the South have
 been inculcated as a doctrine
 for twenty years past among
 slaveholding communities At one time
 the ta riffwas deemed a
 sufficient cause then the exclusion
 of slavcry from free Territories
 then some violations of the
 fucritiver slave law Now the
 culminating cause is the election
 of a President who does
 not believe in benefits of
 slavery or approve of that
 great missionary en terprise the
 slave trade The truth is
 all these things are mere
 pretenses The restless spirits of
 the South desire to have
 a slave empire and they
 use these things as excuses
 Some of them desire a
 Inore briiliant and stroneer government
 than a Republic Tl heil
 domestic institutions and the so
 Cial inequality of their free
 people naturally pre parc them

 a lordly for a throne

 must de term ine whether
 they have couraæe enough to
 maintain the irjstitutions which their

 Illiis is a great responsibility

 Would certainly not ment not
 a difficult one I advise
 the shedding of A inen

 be to execute the crimihål
 in the midst of an

 are other means which will
 prove effbct ual South Carolina
 and when speak of South
 Carolina I mean to include
 under that name seceding States
 to avoid prolixity and thus
 What I say of her
 shall apply td all that
 have Seceded or may secede
 has with others declared herself
 out of the Union and
 no doubt fancies that she
 is so What ought to
 be done Send no armies

 us alarmists pretend The General
 Government should annul ail postal
 laws within her Territory and
 stop the mails at the

 will suffer hy that For
 tbc last year the revenue
 derived from post age in
 South Carolina was 107 596
 the expnnse of tra ns

 deficit of 211 532 to
 be paid by thc Government
 I his saving co nld
 be borne by the United
 States How it wi fi
 afféct South Carolina her citizens
 will soon discover There are
 but a few other Federal
 laws which it will be
 important to enforce I hc
 regulations of commerce and the
 collection of the revenue by
 the General Government is the
 strong whick will hold the
 Union together and punish refrac
 tory members without bloodshed Tho

 for thc last fiscal year

 Let the revenue Itués be
 executed and the money paid

 help to pay the expenses
 caused by the refractory mcrnbcr
 leave the new emnire to

 their great burden I low

 to a mathemati cal certainty
 Not lonR i predict But
 it may be that this

 Mr OTERO hope the gcntlcman
 will act fairly in presenting
 this case Mr STEVENS of
 Pennsylvania There is a clause
 in the which provides that
 anybody can take up a
 servant if he is found
 out after dark and have
 him lashed thirty nine times
 on the bare backe Mr
 OTERO Is that in this

 Yes Mr OTERO l he
 gentleman may read the entire

 OTERO These are the laws
 of New Mexico Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania 1 do not
 know whether that is in

 make explanation of this subject
 just here and at this

 So of the other rebel
 lious States But she proposes
 to enter into treaty stipula
 tions with Europe and by
 granting frec trade attract the
 direct trade of commercial nations
 But she cannot do that
 without a direct violation of
 the Constitution No State shall
 enter into any treat y
 alliance c Although she may
 disre gard that provision being
 in rebellion yet no foreign
 nation being l varned that
 it is a violation of
 the supreme law of the
 nation will venture to negotiate
 Her embassadors will not be
 received ilia single Court in
 Europe it would be just
 cause of war Nor can
 she negotiate with n State
 The Constitution is careful to
 prohibit treaties with foreign nations
 and it adds Alliance or
 con federation She could not
 confederate even with the independent
 free trading island of Manhattan
 If the revenue could not
 be thus collected and smug

 abolis all laws establishing ports
 of entry and collection districts
 within the seceding States and
 prevent all vessels foreign or
 domestic froni en tcring or
 leavin any of their ports
 How will she send her
 cotton and other surplus n

 for therc are no national
 officers to give do his

 that this is not the
 language of Pennsylvania us represented
 by the united i voice
 of her two Senators I
 know It is not But
 I do not believe that
 either of them represented the
 principles ot any considerable portion
 of the people of that
 State While Pennsylvania would go
 as I would to the
 verge of the Constitution and
 of principles to maintain peace
 I believe i it is
 a libel on the good
 natne of her virtuous peo
 I ple to say that
 shc would sacrifice her principles
 to obtain the favor of
 rebels I believe it to
 be a libel on her
 manhood to say that she
 will pur chase peace by
 unprincipled concessions to insur gents
 with arms in their hands
 If thought such was her
 character I would expatriate myself
 I would leave the land
 where I have spent my
 life from early manhood to
 age and would seek some
 spot untainted by the coward
 breath of servility and meanness

 and the slaveholding States reconciled
 to the coritinuancc of a
 Union which was fast losing
 its hold upon their affections
 I was not indifferent to
 the Union of these States
 nay to preserve it was
 with me a labor f
 of love But in my
 judgment no patched up compromise
 no alleviating and palliating remedy
 was either just or prudent
 nor did I subscribe to
 the dogma of its preservation
 at all hazards A Union
 which did not effectually provide
 for the conunon defense and
 the general welfare which did

 of her statesmen as to

 as the steel embosomed in

 performed those duties with adrnitted
 fidelity She will take in

 her honor and her interest
 and her obli gation to

 she leaves you now it

 it in no light whatever
 as a moral social 01
 po litical eviF looking upon
 it as if not an
 essential at least a desirable
 feature in a Government founded
 upon univcrsal suffrage we needed
 no discussion to confirm our
 judgment or our opinions nor
 were we disposed to become
 propagandists of that or any
 other system among our neighbors
 We looked upon ourselves as
 trustees undera higher power into
 our hands certainly by no
 direct twency of ours had
 been confided the care and
 nurlure and Christianizing ofa heathen
 and an im provident race
 fitted only for compulsory labor
 we had no right to
 thrust from us that charge
 or to cry craven and
 refuse its administration How we

 OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED
 BY JOHN C RIVES WASHINGTON
 D C THIRTY SIXTYI CONGRESS
 2D SESSION before them for
 their protection If their priv
 ileges have been at any
 time curtailed that has been
 the consequence of your own
 mad fanaticism which sought with
 a falseand sickly philanthropy to
 interfere with institutions about which
 you knew nothing and would
 inquire into from no higher
 sources than the catch penny
 productions of renegades from our
 country who sought to play
 upon your prejudices to their
 own aggran dizements The miserable
 vipers who drew their existence
 from our soil and sought
 to sting their benefactors you
 took instantly to your bosom
 forgetting that the wretch who
 was false to the land
 of his birth could never
 be true to that of
 his adoption Or if you
 advanced a step further for
 higher sources you found them
 in the senti mental productions
 of you t strong minded
 women who rashly abandoning the
 proper sphere of their sex
 and rudely seizing the habiliments
 of the other undertook to
 instruct their superiors in matters
 of polity and economy We
 cared not then at any
 time to open that subject
 before you though we felt
 conscious and so repeatedly warned
 you that your interference with
 our rights your denial of
 our constitutional privileges your offensive
 assaults upon us your failure
 to respond to your constitutional
 obliga lions your assertion of
 the doctrines of a higher
 law and an irrepressible conflict
 the vv icked and inflammatory
 appeals to your passions by
 your leaders your provocation to
 our slaves to rebel against
 us your approbation of the
 armed foray in the State
 of Virginia your denial of
 our equal icy in the
 Territories your thweats to reorganize
 the supreme judicial tribunal so
 as to mecl your views
 and opinions your declared purpose
 to interfere with the future
 status of our peculiar in
 stitution as foreshadowed by the
 repeated decla rations of the
 great Corypheus of your party
 who if report speaks truly
 is to shape for the
 next four years its policy
 would finally result in disruption
 of the Union You would
 not heed us One by
 one the ligaments of the
 Union have been snapping asunder
 but you turned a deaf
 ear to the ominous sounds
 One by one those sym
 pathies and attachments which sprang
 from the remembrance of past
 trials and common sorrows and
 sufferings from the recollection of
 past glo pies and triumphs
 have faHen off and been
 fbr gotten like the leaves
 of the oak in your
 forest resiffning themselves to the
 winds of Heaven but you
 failed to see it Having
 eyes you would not see
 and having ears you would
 not hear At last your
 efforts culminated to a point
 be yond toleration By your
 denial to us of equality
 in the Territories you sought
 to reduce us to the
 conditi0B of a degraded people
 and presenting before the country
 a ticket strictly sectional avail
 ing yourselves of unhappy differences
 you sue ceeded in establishing
 an Administration a sub mission
 to which without further øuarantecs
 would leave us a conquered
 people under foreign domination You
 threatened us with copstitutional modes
 by which you could and
 hereafter meant to extin guish
 slavery a system which had
 in the mean time become
 so interlocked and interwoven with
 our institutions that the destruction
 of the para site would
 bc death to the tree
 it clings to It was
 in vain to say that
 tho ends and aims of
 the Republican party were directed
 to the over throw of
 the great Democratic party which
 had so long wielded the
 power of the Government You
 were tendered by the other
 great party op posed to
 you a ticket headed by
 constitutional statesmen in wh ose
 patriotism vou professed con fidence
 Amid all this we asköd
 for nothing no concession butour
 rights The ConsLilulion and the
 equality of the States the
 symbols of ever lasting union
 Thc time bad come when
 we were called upon to
 speak right out and in
 view of threatened dan gers
 to provide new guards for
 our future safety Under these
 circumstances it was we met
 you at the assembling of
 the Congress under those circumstances
 that a member from V
 iH1inia took the initiative in
 pr opo sing a peace
 conference and THURSDAY JANUARY 31
 1861 that southern members Consented
 to meet you in a
 committee of the Stales to
 take counsel to gether of
 the common perils and the
 appropriate remedies You may judge
 of our astonishment when at
 the very first day of
 the meeting of that committee
 silenee was broken by a
 northern mem ber representing a
 large and populous district with
 professions of utter ignorance of
 the exist ence of any
 causes of complaint and with
 the mild requést that southern
 gentlemen would be kind enough
 to furnish a bill of
 particulars Meeting that committee in
 a spirit of frankness determined
 to speak right out on
 the diffcultques tions which embarrassed
 the country we could not
 but be astonished at what
 we looked upon as a
 species of diplomacy out of
 place in bad tastc and
 ill suited to the momentous
 occasion It did not at
 all provoke a like conduct
 on our part but at
 once declaring tl hat we
 looked upon the territorial policy
 as the question of perplex
 ity and that if that
 were properly adjusted we thought
 minor matters would arrange themselves
 we proposed through the member
 from Arkan sas a proposition
 of adjustment which while a
 large concession on our part
 svas one the North might
 accede to with honor and
 the pride of all sections
 be saved It was gratifying
 t o find that the
 venerable and distinguished Senator from
 Kentucky had in the series
 of resolutions offered by him
 in the Senate fallen upon
 the same plan of adjustment
 It was especially gratifying to
 find thal the sentiment of
 the whole country rapidly concentrated
 upon it It was proposed
 in comrmttee on the 10th
 day of December Although we
 pressed a vote upon it
 although we urged the rapid
 approximation of the crisis upon
 the country and declared that
 thc anxiety and solicitudo of
 our constituents were great and
 urgent and that for many
 reasons it was desirable to
 have upon it speedy action
 for 1 will not say
 pretext or prc some cause
 or Othm tense day after
 day dragged their weary length
 along the time of the
 cotnmittec precious as it was
 was consumed in tho discussion
 of abstract prop ositions or
 in the arrano ement of
 another matter about which there
 was no insuperable difference of
 opinion It was not until
 the 271b day of Decem
 ber that a vote was
 forced upon it resulting in
 the negativing of the proposition
 by the unani mous voices
 of the Republican members Sir
 deemed this a great conccssron
 of our legal and constitutional
 rights Under the decision of
 the Supreme Court in the
 Dred Scott case we were
 assured of our right to
 take our slaves into all
 of tl le common territory
 of the States We proposed
 to surrender that right above
 the par allel of 360
 30 by an absolute constitutional
 pro hibition reserving only protection
 to our property below such
 protection as would be afforded
 to yours and that too
 in a section in which
 you yourselves thought the insti
 tution of slavery could never
 obtain a permanent footing You
 say this was no concession
 for that slavery by the
 law of nature and of
 climate could never exist above
 that pårallel Be it so
 Why thcn refuse acon cession
 if you choose so to
 call it or if we
 choose so to call it
 that could never according to
 your own declared opinions contribute
 to that state of things
 which you so much deprecate
 the exten Sion of the
 area of slavery Would you
 refuse to I heal the
 wounds from which the bod
 y politic now suffers Would
 you refuse to maintain the
 Union to which you sing
 daily peans Would you refuse
 to your brethren of the
 South mad insane and excited
 as you deem thern thc
 poor pittqnceof an abstraction which
 might soothe them into quiet
 Not so You are eminently
 a practical people The cause
 lies deeper thun that On
 the other hand you say
 slavery can novcr 0 to
 New Mexico and that we
 stand upon an abstraction But
 consider We maintain our right
 It is a fancied or
 real to carrv our slaves
 thcrc right the former you
 admit it can do you
 no NEW 40 yours would
 reduce us to the condiiiOn
 Of graded people and worka
 forféitui em of öi ir6wn
 self respect Nay rtf0 make
 this proposition less distasteful to
 you we consulted you and
 proposed to clothe the amendment
 to the Con stitution in
 the language that the instrument
 now uses This view of
 it was forcibly pressed upon
 you by the distinguished gentleman
 fröm Vii ginia but without
 avail It shared the like
 fate with the orginal proposition
 I may add Mr Speaker
 before passing away from the
 subject of the action of
 the committee that failing In
 the proposition of Mr RUST
 and successively in _those of
 the patriotic member from Tennessee
 Mr NELSON ahd of Mr
 CRITTEN DEN all the southern
 members with a Single ex
 ception sustained the movement of
 the member from California Mr
 BURCH for calling a Coh
 vention of the States It
 met no favorfrom the Republican
 members but on the other
 hand after an incubation of
 some six weeks the con
 sultations of the committee ushered
 into existence this miserable abortion
 which you are now con
 sidering I may safely say
 that perhaps no single proposition
 received the majority vote of
 f hc com mittec and
 strancre to say a motion
 to recommend the series to
 the House for adoption signally
 failed Upon the whole when
 these proceedings come to be
 reviewed hereafter it Will be
 pronounced that every fair liberal
 aid enlarged concession had been
 tendered by southern Representatives not
 one of which was met
 in a corresponding spirit of
 liberality The Republican members declared
 their settled purpose to refuse
 any adjustment or this question
 by constitutional amendment and sonie
 wondet was expressed at our
 persistence in demanding that mode
 Could we do otherwise when
 we re membered that the
 Dred Scott decision was held
 not to be law by
 you And that from high
 quar ters there had been
 announced in high places the
 determination to seize available opportunities
 to reorganize the Saprcme Court
 so as to secure a
 reversal of its judgments and
 restrictions Besides our constituents demanded
 and rightly demanded a settlement
 final förevcr and irreversible of
 this vexed question one that
 would remove it from the
 halls of this Capitol and
 from Che political arena to
 the end that peace hereafter
 might reign within our borders
 To the objection urged that
 the resolutions of amendment professed
 to cover not only the
 pres ent but all future
 acquisitions it was offered on
 our part to accompany it
 with the prohibition of any
 future acquisition unless by treaty
 confirmed by a two thirdé
 vote in both Houses of
 Cöngi ess As the northern
 section of the Union has
 in both branches a decidcd
 and rapidly increasing pre ponderancy
 that subject necessarily for all
 time would be under your
 control But you proposed the
 erection of all the terri
 tory into two States Without
 stopping to show that as
 an original proposition totally discon
 nected with thepolitical question expediency
 and justice to the great
 States shotild forbid the intro
 duction of anew State with
 a population of ninety two
 thousand and an area of
 more than three hundred thousand
 squarc miles its in habitants
 generally ignorant of our laws
 and our language upon an
 equal footing with them it
 sufficient to say that the
 proposition in the opinion of
 a majority of the southern
 members was wholly inadmissible There
 arc about a score of
 slaves in New Mexico You
 had no assurance that she
 would make a constitution recognizing
 slavery much less could you
 impose such constitution upon her
 You called upon us to
 surrender our riffht to the
 whole of the Territories upon
 the I barren condition of
 permitting byea fresh enact mcnt
 New Mexico to do that
 which by her or crnnic
 law you already assured to
 her and the security to
 us for the concession we
 werc called upon to make
 was the bare possibility that
 she harm cannqt affect your
 policy effect ours If might
 by her constitution permit that
 10 be done real then
 the deprivation o it is
 to us a great against
 which you declared nature and
 climate wrong and according to
 our notions the surren aud
 sail and circamstances had prohounced
 der of it on our
 paltt and the prohibition of
 it upon Believing the question
 of equality in the Terri
 626 Qaiesæjnothcr words the recognitipnof
 thc right of property in
 slaves to be the question
 at issue we declared that
 other matters in our judgment
 would regulate themselves when peace
 and har mony should be
 restored among us The pcr
 sonal liberty bills were offensive
 to us in a dcgree
 from the consideration Of Ehe
 causes which håd prompted _their
 enactment Perhaps réally they had
 iliflicted no very great amount
 of injustice but we felt
 them more poignantly from the
 reflec tion that they were
 intended as evidences å ftemper
 and resentment Even little Vermont
 away up in the hyperborean
 regions of the North where
 an African was scarcely ever
 seen save the few that
 Btrayetd thither in the summer
 as certain of your poets
 had said Like the sweet
 south stealing and giving odor
 had thought proper to take
 mcasures to prevent our kidnapping
 her free citizens into slavery
 You deny us the right
 of transit and temporary sojourn
 with our slaves in all
 your territory save in New
 Jersey that people who while
 ever ready to maintain their
 own rights are so gen
 erously forbearing of the rights
 of others and Who are
 justly eåtitled and ever receive
 the respect and veneration of
 their southern kindred Thesc things
 are till irritating They spring
 from the one idea hostility
 to slavery and indi cate
 what solemnly believe a settled
 purpose ultimately to extinguish our
 institutions not charge you with
 any intention to interfere With
 slavery in the States directly
 You dare not do it
 You dare not I do
 not Mr Speaker mean this
 in the way of threat
 cn menace to the N
 Orth I have no idea
 that that great pcoplc for
 indeed they are a great
 people could bc frightened from
 their propriety by any such
 base sentiment as fear and
 if they could I would
 scorn to extort from their
 fears what I had n
 right to expect frpm their
 sense of justice But they
 dare not do it for
 such an interference would bc
 an overt act and unite
 our people in resistance and
 disrupt the Union l cannot
 call to mind that I
 havo ever heard an intelligent
 man in my State express
 the opinion that you meditated
 such direct interfer ence But
 there is a future to
 us and that future would
 look to and provide or
 You look upon stavery as
 a great evil you will
 continue to war 1 11
 on It so long as
 it remains a political element
 and it will so remain
 so long as you deny
 to us equality in the
 TOrritories Settle this question now
 fully finally forever I am
 free to say for my
 part that I deem this
 concessions this proposed amendment as
 to the Territories the ultimatum
 of a settlement In honor
 the South can take 110
 lcss Arrange Lhat and peace
 may possibly conne to our
 country I know not indeed
 if it be possible under
 any terms to win back
 the sccednno States But let
 us do justice and perform
 right nod trust tho con
 sequences Secure to us the
 Constitution and tho equality of
 the States These are tl
 1C symbots of everlasting Union
 Gent letnen of the North

 threaten our yet ccnn mon
 countrys can you rise to
 the height of this If
 you can now is the
 accepted I great arcrurnent time
 come with us to the
 altar ot our cornn ron
 country and Ict us make

 The gentleman from Mugsachusetts E
 Mr AD AMS for whom
 I need hardly soy I
 have sincere respect made a
 proposition which hc supposed I
 to be a very great
 concession and comin r from
 that quarter f look so
 1 11 on it indeed
 Hc pro posed to amend
 the Constitution so that no
 con vention hereafter called shall
 have the privilege of abolishing
 slavery in the States unkess
 by unan imous consent I
 repeat here what I have
 already said I never yet
 met with an intelli ent
 man in my State who
 thought for a moment that
 the views and purposes of
 the Republican party were to
 interfire with slavery directly in
 the States We hold that
 you have no power under
 the Consti tutlon as it
 now stands to abolish slavery
 We vnll r ever yidd
 to anv such construction and
 to CONGRESSIONAL GLOBØ jånuar y
 29 Ldo nob make the
 complaint in regard to the
 enforcement of the fugitive slave
 law which has been made
 by many gentlemen from the
 extreme South I am froe
 to admit that perhaps in
 nine teen out of twenty
 cases it has been fully
 and fairly administered But it
 is also true that for
 every slave who has been
 rendered back t o us
 under that law t wcnty
 have escaped from bond age
 and have not been returned
 Nor do I com plain
 of your State governments for
 the non execution of the
 law I grant that no
 Government on earth can execute
 a law against the wishes
 Of its people Your people
 from the continued ex citement
 which has taken place on
 the subject of slavery have
 come to entertain the desire
 for its extinguishment and that
 it shall be abolished whcrcvei
 they have the power to
 abolish it grant that they
 would not resist the enforcement
 of the law they would
 not do it because such
 disturbances cost large sums of
 money But sir you are
 under constitutional ob igations to
 rc turn our slaves to
 us when they leave our
 coun try and take rcfugc
 in yours you know it
 you cannot deny it Your
 abolition orators your pulpits your
 fbrums and your strongminded vvomen
 have been uzwe nt to
 induce you for year after
 year to resist these constitutional
 obligations and it is through
 their efforts that you havo
 piaced these unconstitutional laws upon
 I hey stand there monu
 your statute books ments ofa
 faith worse than Punic among
 north cyn men When I
 usc that expression I refer
 to the class of men
 who predominate there I know
 that you have other men
 patriotic and true When I
 look before me and behind
 me or on either side
 here in my place in
 this House see gallant sons
 of the North who have
 stood up and battled not
 for our rights but the
 rights of the Constitution If
 we aro to part from
 them it will be to
 us source of unfeigned retrret
 They have had a hardcn
 task in maintaining their position
 than we havo had to
 perform Ours has been the
 easy task to run with
 public opinion while they have
 had to run adverse to
 it and to stem fanat
 icisrn while they endured contumely
 Around their memories shall cluster
 our richestafiöctions We shall always
 remember them with grateful feelings
 Now sir upon these great
 questions at issue between the
 North and the South posterity
 will have to judge We
 shall all of us have
 to sub mit to the
 tribunal of time a tribunal
 whose decrees arc irreversible because
 they arc just When men
 come to review these questions
 after the lapse of long
 years when passion has sub
 sided and party spirit has
 passed away they will look
 back with amazement at the
 madness and excitement that rules
 the hoar Sir pos terity
 will do us of the
 South justice Have we had
 no cause to complain We
 are hero t E iirty
 three States which everybody admits
 to be sovereign and ask
 whether as sovereign States confederated
 with you have not the
 right to demand at least
 the security which is awarded
 to foreign nations But have
 we received it I will
 simvply rcfcr to two or
 three among numerous directly in
 point Anr embassudot of the
 United States accredited to a
 foreign nation is in the
 city of Washington In order
 to reach the armcd vessel
 which is to carry him
 to the I when her
 property was stolen from she
 was left to return to
 her own State of Kentucky
 as she might Kind reception
 to the bereaved matron returning
 in sorrow to her native
 land Comity indeed from a
 confederated State Now sir if
 these things had occurred to
 Amere ican citizens in any
 other country either instance v
 rou d have been cautse
 for war Mr HALE As
 the gentleman has referred to
 a transaction which took place
 in the State of Pennsylvania
 I beg leave to correct
 in one or two points
 the statement he has made
 Judge Kane alleging that Mi
 Williamson had made an incom
 plete return to a writ
 of habeas corpus imprisoned him
 after which a suit was
 brought againstJudge Kane for false
 imprisonment It was a matter
 which had nothing whatever to
 do with the slave queStion
 Mr WINSLOW The gentleman has
 the facts correctly a nd
 not materially differed from my
 statement Mr JUNKIN I ask
 the gentleman from North Carolina
 if he is not aware
 that the decis ion in
 that case was affrtned by
 the supreme court of the
 State of Pennsylvania Mr WINSLOW
 the fact it is one
 I am glad to hear
 The principal point however to
 which i desired to call
 attention in that case was
 that the owner of the
 lost negro has never received
 a dollar of reparation to
 this day Now sir if
 we had sent an embassador
 to France and in passing
 through Great Britain his slave
 had been seized and retained
 and Great Britain had refused
 to make reparation why even
 you at thc North you
 gentlemen to defend whose right
 to catch codfish away down
 on the banks of New
 foundland for whose cornmercial privileges
 we vent to war in
 1812 v rould have considered
 this a matter suffcient to
 go to war upon with
 Great Britain And for us
 who are nations kindred to
 you in blood wheh you
 refuse us what even the
 comity of foreign nations demands
 can you un der these
 circumstances expect us to remain
 in union with you Mr
 CURTIS Iwish to ask the
 whether ho supposes that a
 slave taken from here to
 Great Britain would be recænized
 as property and if taken
 away restored to his owner
 Mr WINSLOW 1 say to
 the gentleman that if a
 minister was sent from the
 United States to France and
 he had necessarily to pass
 through Great Britain on his
 way whatever was recog nizcd
 as property belonging to him
 under the laws of bis
 country would be recognized by
 Great Britain under the laws
 of nations It has been
 so recognized in nu merous
 instances do you doubt it
 MT CURTIS 1 certainly do
 The British courts go upon
 the principle that every man
 is free who touches the
 English soil and breathes the
 English air Mr WINSLOW 1
 If it were necessary for
 the minister to France to
 pass through England in transitu
 to Russia or Persia or
 any other Power the seizure
 of his property no matter
 what by the Government of
 Great Britain would be a
 casus bel bi It would
 be so considered by my
 friend from Iowa or any
 other who entertains like political
 sentiments Mr SICKLES If the
 gentleman from North Carolina will
 permit me I will state
 the Well court to whiclr
 he is accredited he necessarily
 known fact that Mr King
 of Alabama took two has
 to pass through t he
 great State of Pennsyl i
 slaves with hirn when he
 went to Paris as the
 vania During his transit across
 that State his minister of
 the United States Other instances
 have occurred I believe there
 is notaGovc1 nment slaves held
 as property under the laws
 of his own State arc
 rudely and forcibly seized The
 Fed I in Europe which
 would hesitate for an instant
 to eral judge an honest
 judge whose name will al
 protect with all the necessary
 power the prop ways occupy
 an honorablc position in the

 of any of his couniry

 I have heard the ques

 public law is of Pennsylvania
 by the very individual who
 admitted as it is stated
 by the gentleman from stole
 the slaves The staves were
 not returned No rt l
 Carolina and yet tbe great
 State of Pennsylvania has never
 Mr TAYLOR It is a
 part of the public law
 by any legislative act deplored
 this transaction of nations and
 it extends so far that
 a member much less has
 attempted reparation of an embassy
 from Turkey to a Christian
 coun A gentleman from Virginia
 on his way to a
 try is protected in the
 enjoyment even of his right
 distant portion of the country
 passing through to a plurality
 of wives Laughter vote for
 that proposition as a single
 one discon New York while
 intransitu had his slaves seized
 Mr WINSLOVV That has been
 so held nected with some
 real concession would be to
 and taken from him and
 to this day no redress
 I arguendo by the court
 of my own State I
 mean adrnit of a doubt
 on that point Talcen in

 ß27 Mr SICKLES Let me
 make a suggestion to I
 question slavery is not to
 be regarded in other the
 genlléman from Iowa It stands
 upon a prin Words he
 draws back from his denunciations
 ciple and that principle is
 this that the sover i
 and sinks hiS doctrine of
 an irrepressible conflict eignty ofa
 nation always covers and protects
 the legation of that nation
 and every member of the
 legation In contemplation of public
 law the minister and his
 legation are always under the
 flao of their nation Mr
 CURTIS Of course I understand
 that Mr SICKLES It is
 a violation of the flag
 and the laws and the
 comity of nations to inter
 fere with a member of
 an embassy Mr WINSLOW Was
 there ever an embassy from
 Persia or Turkey or any
 other country in the world
 to Eno land that was
 refused the exer cise of
 the privileges and the use
 of such servants as they
 had at home Never l
 o carry the doc trine
 further I will refor to
 the case of the Queen
 of Denmark who murdered a
 man in her own building
 in Paris and who was
 not held to answer for
 the murder Now Mr Speaker
 let us see how we
 stand The gentlemen on the
 other side deny that sla
 very exists except by force
 of municipal law That I
 believe is thc doctrine Elere
 arc thirty three States banded
 together for what For the
 common benefit and the general
 welfare to estab 1ish peace
 and domestic tranquillity at home
 The affirmation on that side
 of the House is that
 sla very exists only by
 force of municipal law I
 so understand them Suppose a
 vessel going from my own
 port of Wilmington North Carolina
 to Charleston South Carolina with
 slaves amongst other cargo is
 overhauled by a cruiser of
 the cn emy suppose the
 English to be that enemy
 and suppose our Government makes
 a remonstrance to the EIFlish
 Government and that Government responds
 that my officer did wroncr
 and I am willi11 Y
 to mako reparation I apologize
 for the insult and I
 will pay for the caroo
 except what was in slaves
 and as to them I
 am informed there is a
 great party in your country
 calling itself the Republican party
 par excellence and headed by
 a man named Abraham Lincoln
 which party asserts that slaves
 ave not property If that
 re fusal wrere made by
 the English Government what then
 would a Republicafi Congress do
 Logi catly could or would
 they insist upon repara tion
 Can we stand that Is
 not our property upon the
 high seas to be as
 much secured and protected by
 the country as your property
 Yet sir by your doctrine
 that slavery is only a
 local institution havino its oriTik2
 only in the Inunicipal law
 we should be perfectly powerless
 and with out protection Do
 you think we can stand
 a Union of that kind
 No sir never never never
 Unless you come down from
 your doctrine and aTree that
 upon the highseas wherever your
 star spangled banner waves and
 if not in all the
 ter ritory at least stouth
 of the line fixed for
 the ex tension of our
 institutions our property shall have
 equal rigl lts with yours
 you ought not expect us
 to remain with you I
 listory must judge us in
 other respects I say that
 the position of the Republican
 ptuty threat ens the rights
 of slavery There have been
 in these Halls five distinct
 plans pronounced by which slavery
 can be eradicated from the
 land Mr John Quincy Adams
 himself affirmed upon this floor
 that Congress has the power
 to abolish slavcry under the
 treaty making power Tl hut
 is one Mr Giddings of
 Ohio said I would not
 be understood as desiring a
 servile insur rection but i
 say to southern gentlenlen that
 there are hun dreds of
 thousands of honest and patriotie
 men who will auoh at
 your calaåiity and will mock
 when vour féa r cotil
 P i would intitnidate no
 Inan I telfyou there is
 a spirit in the North
 which wilt set at dcfianee
 all thc low and unworthy
 machinations of this Executive and
 u re minions of its
 power vVhcn the contest shall
 cotne when the thunder shall
 roll and the lightning shall
 flash when the slave shan
 rise in the South when
 in imitation ot the Cuban
 bond nen the southerneslaves of
 the shall feel that they
 ate Inen when they feei
 the stirring emo lions of
 immortality when tbc slaves shall
 fccl that the masters shall
 turn pale and trernble when
 their dwellings hail smoke the
 lovers of freedom shall stand
 forth and exert toe legitimate
 powers of this Government for
 free dutn iVe shall then
 have constitutional power to act
 for the good of our
 country and do justice to
 the siave I heli we
 shali strike off the shackles
 from the hands Gf the
 Slaves T I lis plan
 was through insurrection availincr the
 General Government of the power
 of inter fetencc He has
 also his peculiar plans In
 his Roches ter speech he
 declares if reported correctly and
 I am not aware of
 any contradiction of the pop
 ular version what may be
 called thc corollary to his
 i emarks at Lansincr i
 IVilI favor as long as
 I can within thd limits
 of eon stituti01ta i action
 tbc decrease and diminution o
 African slavery in au the
 States At Rochester It is
 true that they the fathers
 necessarily and wisely modified this
 policy or freed01il by leaving
 it to the sev oral
 States afl7w ted as they
 were by different circum stances
 to abolish slavery in their
 own way and at their
 own pleasure instead of confiding
 that duty to Congress nut
 the very nature of these
 modifications fortifieg my position that
 the fitthcrs knew that the
 two systenas could not endarc
 within the Union and expected
 that within a short period
 slavery would disappear iörever Moreover
 in order that these modificatiOns
 might not altogether de teat
 their grand design ofa republic
 maintaining universal equality they provided
 that two thirds of the
 States tnight amend the Constitution
 But even for him there
 is still a lower deep
 In his Lansing speech he
 is reported as havin said
 that it was his duty
 as a patriot to go
 for havinø no Army and
 Navy of the Union be
 cause their whole object was
 that slaves mav not escape
 from the siave States into
 the free and that freed
 or emanci pated negroes in
 the free States may not
 enter and introduce civil war
 into the slave States and
 because that if we provoke
 a foreign enemy the southern
 frontier is exposed to invasion
 from France and Spain Here
 is an invocation of the
 war making power It remained
 for the President elect to
 cap the climax by presenting
 a fifth mode reaching in
 as sumption of power by
 the General Government far beyond
 the most dreamy conception of
 the most ultra disciple of
 the latitudinarian school He speaks
 of the further spread of
 slavery the restrictions of which
 will he predicts p it
 where the nublic mind will
 rest in the belief that
 it is in the course
 of ultimate extinction we know
 says he the opening of
 new countries tends to the
 perpetuation of the institution and
 so does keep men in
 slavery who would otherwise be
 free Nothing he again says
 will make you successful but
 setting up a policy which
 shall treat the thing as
 wrong This Government is exnressly
 éhargcd with the duty of
 providing for ti C general
 welfare i Ve believe that
 the spreading out and perpetuity
 of the institution of slavery
 impairs the general welfare press
 this thing we think is
 providing for the general welfare
 Now wili any unprejudiced mind
 fail to con cede that
 here exist causes of alarm
 that pru dence indeed would
 dictate demands for new guards
 for our future security and
 that if these are refused
 if every effort to secure
 them is ex hausted if
 the cool unimpassioned judgment of
 the North should refuse us
 reparation we should be justified
 in the ultimate measure secession
 Let us listen to a
 voice from your own section
 Mr Speaker Mr Fillmore said
 VVe see a political party
 presenting candidates for thc Presidency
 and Vice Presidency setectcd för
 the first time from the
 free States alone with the
 avowed purpose of electing those
 candidates by the suffrages of
 one part of the Union
 onlv to rule over the
 whole United States Can it
 be possible that those who
 are encaged in such a
 measure can Irave seriously reflected
 upon the consequences which must
 inevitably follot v in case
 o success Can they have
 the rnadness or the ihtly
 to believe that onr southern
 breth ren would submit to
 be governed by such a
 Chief Magis Suppose that the
 South having a majority of
 the elee toral vote should
 declare that they would have
 only slave holders fbr President
 and Vice President and should
 elect I such by their
 exclusive suffrage to rule over
 us at tige North do
 you think you would subinit
 to it No not lör

 believe that your sout hern
 brethren are In ent less
 eensitive on his subject than
 you arc or less jealous
 of their riuhts If you
 do let tne tell you
 that you are rnis taken

 that if this sectional pagy
 succeeds it leads inevitably to
 the destruction of this bcaatifu

 to Warn his own _péo

 I have neither t ime
 nor inclination to discuss this

 SPRING February 9 1833 SIR
 have received your lettet of
 the 24th ultimo There can
 be na doubt that the
 United States are in a
 de plorable situation and that
 the publication of the opinion
 you desire would bc useless
 has never been a secret
 and always stated to those
 who wanted to know it
 rn the year 1824 the
 Constitution was buried in the
 Scnat e the Senators who
 were then present vill it
 is believed recol lect the
 fact and never afterwards quoted
 by me vhkle I renrained
 in l he Senate The
 opinions of General I Vash
 ill Åton Mr Jefferson and
 Governor Clinton are known bu
 t not respected I have
 never believed that a State
 could nullify and remain in
 the Union bug I have
 aheays believed that a State
 might secede when she pleased
 provided that she would pay
 her proportion of the public
 debt and this right I
 have considered the best guard
 to public liberty and to
 public justice that could be
 desired and it ought to
 have prevented what is now
 ft lt in the South
 oppression The proclamation contains principies
 as contrary to what was
 the Constitution as nunification It
 is the great error of
 the Adininistration which except that
 has been satis fhctory ill

 use of force makes ene

 in peace under such a
 Government he case of South
 Carolina is as different from
 that of Pennsylvania as any
 two eases can be In

 With six of tbc States
 it is an accomplished fact
 and it would more avail
 to endeavor to ren dcr
 its further unnecessary than to
 en ga re itFnice discussion
 as to its nature and
 effect But you as the
 great remedy suggest coercion Coercion
 Can you for a minute
 suppose you can force upon
 the South a foreign domination
 Do you think twelve million
 people should they thin k
 fit to assert their independence
 can be forced to pay
 tribute to you or any
 other earthly power You mistake
 the temper and the character
 of our peopie Sir history
 is said to be philosophy
 Have you read the story
 teaching by example of the
 struggles of our fathers Have
 you not heard how an
 obstillate Prince and an infhtuated
 minister lost to England the
 priceless cem with which her
 diadem was studded Pass back
 to the times of the
 great Revolution I would I
 had time to quote at
 length the able common sense
 view of this question of
 coercion as expounded by the
 enlightened Cruger in 1774 in
 the British Parliament a man
 who I am proud to
 say drew his existence from
 the soil of Mas I
 have time to quote but
 a single sach usetts paragraph
 The expediency ot coercive measures
 is much insisted upon by
 sonne who I am sorry
 to say seetn to consider
 Iliore the distress and difficulty
 into which they may involv_c
 the South than the benefit
 they can procure from such
 vin dictivc conduct iii this
 country Iluinanity however _wiJ prompt
 the generous mind to weep
 over severities even when they
 are And the prudent ståtesrnan
 will reflect that the South
 cannot suffer without injury to

 sir that Mr Fillmore whose

 career as the Chief Executive
 of these Stales had utåctures

 you do not drive them

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 29
 What upon that point the
 words of wisdöm Which fell
 from the lips of the
 patriot Jackson in his Farewell
 Address to our people ft
 euch a struggle is once
 begun and the citizens of
 one section of the country
 arrayed in arms against thosc
 of another in doubtftil c
 oüfliet let the battle result
 as it may there will
 bc an end of the
 Union and with it an
 end Of the hopes of
 freedom Tbe victory of the
 injured would not Eecure to
 them the blcssmqs of liberty
 it would avenge their wrongs
 but they themséives would share
 in the com mon ruin
 I cite these remarks to
 show the opimon of a
 great mind as to the
 probability of a reconstruc tion
 of the Union if blood
 be shed in conflict It
 natural that this great man
 thc every pul ution of
 whose heart was for his
 country and his whole country
 should have taken a strong
 and gloomy view of the
 condition of things beyond disruption
 and that especially upon the
 occa Sion which led him
 to address the country Sir
 if blood be unjustly shed
 in this quarrel believe me
 all hope o reconciliation is
 gone This Union after such
 catastrophe can never bc reconstructed
 Like one of those beautiful
 vases from Etrui ia which
 has descended to us from
 retnote antiquity once broken into
 frag mentB all the craft
 of the potter cannot restore
 it to its pristine integrity
 No sir this Union can
 not be held together by
 forcc by any other cohe
 Sion than that of affection
 Do not rely in such
 contest upon your adrnitted superiority
 in wealth and population But
 you will have to come
 to invade us upon our
 éoil Perhaps it has been
 said no instance is to
 be found in the civilized
 world where a nat ion
 was conquered at its own
 door unless betrayed by traitors
 at home or by their
 own abject sub mission The
 southern States have not reached
 either of these points You

 II uselts revolted d uring

 Bat this x vas in

 me reverse the case Suppose
 a party camc into existence
 upon a platform something like
 the Chicago platform which instead
 of re pressing slavery in
 any State should impose it
 upon certain others Suppose that
 party had tri umphed had
 elected its President and had
 a pros pective possession of
 the Senate and of this
 House and suppose its forts
 which command the city of
 Boston were to be reinforced
 and gar in beha f
 of South State which has
 illåstra tdd your pölitical history

 like water I ask you
 to take warning from the
 ev ents which are rapidly
 occurripg I acknowledge my Self
 anxious to save the Union
 I do not know that
 it can be saved Perhaps
 it cannot be The probabilities
 are that it cannot be
 in its former Integrity If
 it can be it is
 only by securing the border
 States to you and availing
 yourself of their influence and
 their example upon the Guit

 faculties States of the North
 have scarcely been awakened to
 the real condition of things

 SICKLES I am now calling

 An appeal has been taken
 fi onx the decision of
 the Chtur and 1 1
 vant that appeal decided Mr
 SICKLES 1 call the gentleman
 frorn Massachusetts to order I
 have the floor The SPEAKER
 pro tempore The Chair wishes
 to dispose of the question
 of order raised by the
 gentleman from Massachusetts Mr SICKLES
 It is to that very
 point I rise The gentleman
 from Massachusetts could not raise
 a point of order when
 there was one already pending
 Mr GOOCH My question was
 raised before the gentlernan from
 New York rose at all
 I took an appeal from
 the decision of the Chair
 and a motion has been
 made to lay that appeal
 upon the table and that
 motion has been entertained by
 the Chair The SPEAKER pro
 The Chair will endeavor to
 dispose of the question of
 order Does the gentleman from
 New York yield the floor
 Mr VAN WYCK gentleman from
 Massachusetts Mr CONKLINC lobject The
 SPEAKER pro tempore T hc
 gentleman from New York has
 a right to yield the
 floor but the Chair does
 not understand whether he yields
 it or not Mr DAWES
 The gentleman from New York
 has twice yielded the floor
 to me and I have
 made a motion to adjourn
 The SPEARER pro tempore T
 hc Chair will put the
 question on the motion to
 adjourn Mr CON K LING
 Objection was made to the
 gentleman yielding the floor Mr
 SICKLES I rise to a
 point of order Tho Chair
 having decided that my col
 eague had the floor the
 gentleman from Massachusetts asked him
 to give way for a
 motion to adjourn Objec tion
 was made to my colleague
 yielding for ihat purpose and
 I maintain that without unanimous
 consent my colleague cannot yield
 the floor for any motion
 I cite as a precedent
 for that ob jection the
 objection made by the other
 side of the Iloase the
 other day to the gentleman
 from Virginia Mr CLEMENS yielding
 the floor to me under
 similar circumstances to offer an
 amend ment Flthe whole of
 the other side of the
 House objected to that and
 now I insist on the
 applica tion of the same
 rule to them I cite
 their author ity as conclusive
 and I object to my
 colleague Yielding the floor any
 rights upon this ileor on
 this occasion or not Laughter
 The SPEAKER pro tempo re
 The Chair de cidcs that
 it is competent a member
 to yield I the floor
 and if the gentleman from
 New York 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 029 who is entitled
 to the floor yields it
 it is compe tent for
 any member to move an
 adjournment Mr SICKLES If my
 colleague yields the floor docs
 he not yield it absolutely
 The SPEAKERprotempore The Chairunder stands
 that it has been the
 practice of the House for
 gentlemen to yield t he
 floor for motions to adjourn
 Mr CURTIS 1 was told
 yesterday that if I yielded
 the floor to the gentleman
 from Pennsyl vania Mr GRow
 l I must yield it
 absolutely Mr DAWES The motion
 to adjourn is not debatable
 Mr McKEAN My colleague yielded
 the floor and before any
 objection was made the gentle
 man from Massachusetts moved an
 adjournment Shouts of Order Order
 Mr McCLERNAND 1 rise to
 a point of order it
 is this it is competent
 for the gentle man from
 New York to yield the
 floor but he cannot yield
 it upon a contract or
 bargain en titling him to
 resume it in the morning
 If he yields it at
 ail he must yield it
 absolutely Mr DAWES He did
 not yield the floor upon
 any intimation from me that
 it was my purpose to
 move to adjourn I asked
 him to yield the floor
 to me for a moment
 observing that there was no
 quorum here I conceived it
 to be my right to
 call the attention of the
 Chair to that fact did
 call the attention of the
 Chair to it and then
 I moved to adjourn Mr
 McCLbRNAND There is no disagree
 ment then between the gentleman
 from Massa chusctts and myself
 According to his own state
 ment the gentleman from New
 York has yielded the floor
 absolutely The SPEAKER pro tempore
 The Chair dc sires to
 state that the fact has
 not yet come to the
 knowlcdge of the Chair that
 the gentleman from New York
 yields the floor Thc Chair
 propounds the question to the
 gentleman from New York does
 he yield the floor Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE And now we
 enter an objection to his
 yielding it unless he yields
 it unconditionally Mr VAN WYCK
 1 did not yield the
 floor unconditionally by any means
 yielded it to the gentleman
 from Massachusetts The SPEAKER pro
 tempore According to the rules
 the floor cannot be yielded
 conditionally It has been the
 pr adtice of the House
 however for a gentleman having
 the floor at a late
 bour of the day to
 yield it for the purpose
 of an adjourn ment But
 if objection is made to
 a gentleman yielding the floor
 the rule is that if
 he does so he does
 it unconditionally and waives his
 right to the floor Mr
 GOOCH Now I want the
 point of order which I
 raised decided It is this
 that my col league asked
 the gentleman from New York
 to yield the floor he
 did yield it no objection
 was made and my colleague
 moved to adjourn from the
 decision of the Chair in
 order Shouts of Order I
 appeal from the decision of
 the Chair The SPEAKER pro
 tempore I am not aware
 that the Chair has made
 any decision Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 hope my col league
 will be allowed to go
 on now Mr COX If
 the gentleman from New York
 does not desire to go
 on now my comague Mr
 HOWARD is willing to proceed
 Mr HOWARD of Ohio 1
 am willing go on now
 for the reason that I
 desire to leave the city
 to morrow The SPEAKER tempore
 Does the gentle man from
 New York yield to the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE 1 shall object to
 his yielding the floor Mr
 GObC1 1 I rise to
 the point that there is
 no quorum present Mr BRANCH
 The gentleman has n t
 the floor to make any
 such point The SPEAKER tempore
 The g from New York
 will proceed Mr VAN WYCK
 This the nineteenth annivcrsary of
 one of the most exciting
 sc lles witnessed in the
 American Congress On the 25th
 day of January 1842 John
 Quincy Ad ams introduced the
 petition of forty five citizens
 of Haverhill Massachusetts praying for
 a peace able dissolution of
 the United Stat Desiring that
 the right of petition should
 be recognized he moved its
 reference to a committee with
 instruc tions to report against
 its prayer I Ie with
 nearly the entire North and
 South was opposed to dis
 solution For a few years
 previous to that time by
 reason of the excitement with
 England and her colonies and
 other causes the slavery agita
 tion was deeper and more
 intense than at any pe
 riod in the history of
 our country The very men
 who then could not find
 words sufficiently strong to anathematize
 those they called traitors now
 seem to bc courting a
 traitor s doom and madly
 rioting in a traitor s
 saturnalia Tl he folly of
 Abolitionists did not force the
 South into treason against God
 and man Efforts were then
 being made to abolish slavery
 in the dock yards arse
 nals alid District of Colurnbia
 Personat liber ty bills existed
 in many of the States
 New York had passed one
 in 1840 Henry A Wise
 then pre dicted with as
 much hope of fulfillment as
 most of your prophesies at
 this time that in ten
 years a black Representative would
 appear in the na tional
 All the evils which you
 now lament existed then and
 the pcrnmnency of your institutions
 in more jeopardy Since that
 time Florida has been added
 to the galaxy I exas
 has been bought and acquired
 arid surrendered to sla very
 California vas obtained and the
 consti tution of a sovereign
 people placed on her mount

 robe of free labor and
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE Oh we
 have rubbed planted on her
 brow the diadem of liberty
 New Mexico has been acquired
 and that immense all that
 out and begun acrain L
 Laughter Mr MCCLERNAND we plead
 the statute rrerritory than the
 original thirteen States of limitations
 against that Mr GOOCH Such
 is the fact The SPEAKER
 tempore The Chair was not
 aware that that was the
 fact Mr DAWES I stated
 it to the Chair more
 than once I want to
 know of the Chair now
 whether I can be recognized
 by the Chair when 1
 make a motion in order
 If the House does not
 to adjourn they need not
 adjourn but I have n
 right to make a motion
 to adjourn and to have
 that motion put Cries of
 Order Order The SPEAKER tempore
 Not when an other gentleman
 has the floor Mr DAWES
 The gentleman from New York
 I yielded the floor to
 me at the outset and
 1 made the motion The
 SPEAKER pro tenzpore Does the
 gentle man from New York
 Mr VAN WYCK yield the
 floor Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1
 obje to his yielding Mr
 VAN WY CK I have
 already yielded the floor The
 SPEAKER pro tempore Then if
 the gen tleman says he
 does not yield the floor
 he will proceed Mr GOOCH
 He says no such thing
 Mr VAN WYCK 1 did
 not say that Mr DAWES
 Is such a thing as
 an appeal you have been
 sutTered to dedicate to the
 pecu liar institution Three fourths
 of the territory acquired since
 1842 has been surrendered to
 sla very and slave property
 has been steadily in creasino
 in numbers and value In
 1850 amore slave law was
 given to appcasc your growing
 dcmands Why with no greater
 cause of complaint were your
 people then so strongly attached
 to tho Union Why did
 you then deny the power
 in Congress or the States
 to dissolve it If the
 Union was an indissoluble bond
 then why not now Ellhe
 position we occupy on the
 slavery qucg tion and the
 policy of the Government as
 to the Territories is the
 sao ze held by the
 fathers of the Republic nearly
 all the statesmen of the
 South and the Democratic party
 down to 1848 Because we
 entertain those views and believe
 in that pot icy and
 for no other reason political
 incendiaries would trample upon the
 flag and burn the temple
 of freedom On the question
 of dissolution we nosv stand
 where the people of the
 South and the Democratic party
 stood in 1842 Shall we
 now hesitate to stand like
 men where they proudly stood
 And if fall we must
 will it not be some
 consolation to fall amid such
 Splendid ruins because it will

 referred to was présönted Mr
 Hopkins of Virginias asked If

 of Virginia asked If it
 was iii order to move
 to censure any member préSénting
 such a petition and to
 move that the House do
 now proCeed to inquire whether
 a member offered suéh a
 petition to this body and
 to proceed accordingly Mr Merriwether
 of Georgia Did not diink
 that sucha petition shotild be
 allowéd conie within the walls
 of this House Mr Campbell
 of South Carolihäj Did not
 think that a petition of
 such a character should be
 thus lightly passed over Mr
 Gilmer of Virginia resolved I
 bat in presenting to the
 cousideration pf tbis House a
 petition iör a dissolution of
 the Massachusetts Mr Adams bas
 justly incurred the cen sure
 of this I louse Mr
 Marshall of Kentucky moved the
 follow ing resolution Whereas the
 Federal Constitution is a permanent
 form of Government and of
 perpetual obligation until altered or
 nxodificd in the mode pointed
 out in fhat instrument A
 proposition thereföve to dissolve the
 organic law is a direct
 proposition to euch member to
 com mit perjury and involves
 the crime of higb treason
 is a wound at thc
 Constitution the ex istencc of
 the country and the liberties
 of the people of these
 States It struck him with
 horror it stupefied him he
 had not believed it possible
 that there could be Illen
 wild enough in the country
 and mad enough to make
 a proposition that the Goverrnnent
 of the United States should
 terminate its own oxistence and
 then to submit it to
 the members of that House
 inviting them to commit perjury
 or moral treason Coming from
 any quarter it was sacrilége
 The UniÖn was the only
 means of safety and liberty
 Mr Wise asked for a
 voice frorm the tombs that
 the Farewell Address of Washington
 m_igbt bo heard After extracts
 were read he said that
 the anti slavery palty was
 acrainst the Govern moot was
 an English party Yes vv
 hiie the Eng 1ish Abolitionists
 were moving on Jamaica and
 contemp ating to makc their
 next demonstration on Cuba wliile
 they vere establishing lines ofa
 comrner cial marine connecting England
 and the West Indies with
 this country and thus openin
 the q vay for a
 military marine to follow which
 at the first sound of
 the toscin would pour in
 armies of trained free blacks
 upon the whole South this
 proposition to dissolve the Union
 was simulta neously brought forward
 Can any ardent southerner present
 so formidable a list of
 griev And how happenéd it
 that men ances now who
 held these sentimen t s
 should be found bring ing
 forward Tory plans for upt
 urning the Gov ernment It
 was a British abolition disunion
 Speaking of Mr Adams s
 motion to re party port
 against the pctition he adds
 What did that amount to
 No more than this that
 it was not expedient to
 dissolve the Union just at
 this time not yet not
 now They had not yet
 låst all their love for
 that Union recommended by the
 Father of his Country This
 very ex Pres ident was
 the va y man who
 for the first time invited
 the Congress of the United
 States to re ccive discuss
 deliberate upon a proposition to
 break the union of the
 States It pointed to that
 which should God spare his
 life he expected to witness
 before ten years passed over
 his hcad the election of
 a black Representative to a
 seat on that floor English
 influence at home and abroad
 was in league to dissolve
 this Union Go on you
 shall have your reward Go
 on with this your moral
 treason and carry it so
 far as to come within
 Chief Justice Marshall s decision
 in Bunt s case and
 you shall get your hemp
 There were no dissolutionists in
 his sectio n of the
 country If they dared to
 show tlieir faces in his
 section they G ould meet
 with a alid a very
 summary disposal So spoke Hihry
 A Wise 630 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 29 now onc
 of the leaders of this
 organized armed rebellion Mr Underwood
 of Kentucky said They had
 no right to dissolve this
 Union but were bound to
 sustain it Because he knew
 that to dis sol_ve the
 bonds of this Union and
 separate the different States composing
 this Confederacy mak ing the
 Ohio river the linc and
 Mason and Dixr on s
 line the bouhdary he knew
 as soon as that was
 done slavery was done in
 Kentucky Mary land and a
 larue portion of Virginia and
 it would extend to all
 the States south of this
 line The dissolution of the
 Union was the dissolution of
 slavery Mr Botts in his
 remarks stated that a similar
 resolution some three or four
 years ago was pro pared
 by a member from South
 Carolina Mr William Butler of
 that Stale desired to know
 to Whom he referred he
 replied Mr Rhett Mr Rhett
 thon disclaimed any serious intention
 in the resolution that ho
 only proposed it as an
 amend ment to a proposition
 to abolish slavery in the
 District of Columbia that hc
 had no expectation of passing
 it or taking a vote
 on it South Carolina talks
 very much of status quo
 just now What was her
 status quo in 1842 Mr
 Marshall further said You may
 dissolve God in his mercy
 forfend that you ever should
 But you will never do
 it but by force Ncvcr
 Never Will they tell the
 American people that the people
 of Massachusett s have a
 right to dissolve their Union
 It is the detestation of
 the South to abolition that
 makeshcr a unionist And it
 is the love of the
 North for abolition that has
 It goes bC brought her
 in favor ofdissolution yond southcrn
 nullifiers The convention that sat
 at Columbia ncvcr took the
 ground that Congress had pox
 vel to dissolve the Union
 Our casc is here fully
 madc out the argu ment
 exhausted Your own men l
 iave proved that neither Congress
 nor tl e States can
 dissolve this Union save by
 force and when you have
 already commenced that process you
 leave us only onc course
 to oppose forcc by force
 Yoti and wc will not
 wc have driven us to
 the wall cannot surrender W
 c arc told that a
 rcmoval But of the cause
 of dangcr will produce peace
 what is the cause You
 say slavery agitation In that
 you stop one degree short
 of tlne real cause which
 is slavery itself Now will
 you cxcr cisc an cnlargcd
 patriotism by removing the cause
 of danger You may have
 an open powder mao azine
 on a public thoroughfare of
 the world Will you quarrel
 with every traveler who carries
 a lighted tapcr whenever his
 convenicncc or wants require Bctter
 close your deadly magazine and
 removc it from the tread
 of men We do not
 ask this We only insist
 that you shall not with
 it cursc the common Territories
 of the nation You do
 not pretend that your institution
 is endangered in thc States
 True you sometimes lament about
 personal liberty bills and the
 tardy execution of the fugitive
 slave law The attempted prohibition
 of slavery in the Ter
 ritories is the real cause
 of complaint The con dition
 of all the l erritories
 we now own is settled
 and we had hoped the
 inordinate desire to plun der
 our weak neighbors was subducd
 But rntu k what tbc
 Vice President and onc of
 the dcft hftted candidatcs for
 the Presidency in a Ictler
 to the Governor of Kentucky
 January G 186 1 says
 The Southern States cannot afford
 to be shut off from
 all possibility of expansion towards
 the tropiesb the hostite action
 of the Federal Gov ernment
 Let us not be deceived
 this key un locks the
 southern mind and peions Dreams
 of Cuba Mexico the Central
 and South Auncrican States frstoon
 the bloody machinations of south
 ern traitors as they rendered
 gorgeous the un holy schemes
 of Burr and his confederates
 In one breath you groan
 at the evils suffered from
 the Union and the Federal
 Government although nearly the whole
 time from its existence it
 has been in your hands
 or subject to your control
 In the next you boast
 of your great wealth and
 power of the spread of
 your dominions the in crcase
 in the number and value
 of your slaves the great
 overshadowing omnipotence of cott on
 A few days since you
 sought to demonstrate that northern
 wealth and commerce French industry
 and British enterprise depended upon
 a few slave holders The
 gentleman from Virginia Mr GAR
 NETT boastingly pointed to tho
 time in a few decades
 when the slave population would
 number thirty million I stop
 not here to prove the
 divinity of freedom or the
 despotism of slavery With your
 cannon pointed at the Capitol
 and your bayonets almost at
 our breasts it IS no
 time to argue abstract prin
 ciples neither on our knees
 to supplicate for life At
 all timeyn a question of
 freedom man should be right
 from instinct Would you take
 a man by the sounding
 sea to hear the sullen
 roar of its waters or
 stand him upon the yawning
 gulf down which volcanic fires
 madly ragc or dart their
 sul phureous fumes and hissing
 front into the vale be
 low Would you place him
 in the smiling val ley
 teeming With the fruits of
 autumn radiating the cheering sunshine
 of mid day or the
 mellow moonbeams of evening or
 from the bold mount ain
 summit beyond tbc reach of
 culture s hand or nature
 s growth where the dew
 of evenino or the rain
 of morning only gives life
 to the stunted pine and
 oak where thc eagle builds
 his eyrie and thtxcrcst wreathed
 in perpetual snow Would you
 ston cpldly to reason with
 such a man the existence
 bfa divine Creator So when
 you take a man and
 stand him by the great
 ocean of hu manity where
 be bends his ear to
 catch the surcy incr wail
 of oppression and want when
 hc staids over the yawning
 volcanic fires which despotism has
 created and is endeavoring to
 conceal or in the little
 valley of human happiness full
 of sun shine and peace
 or high up on the
 dreary mount tain of oppression
 Where scarce a green thing
 may grow where the sunshine
 of life its dews and
 rains make desolation more desolate
 will you pause to argue
 the divinity of man s
 free 40m or prove his
 inherent right to himself But
 wc have now to deal
 with facts not fancies realities
 not t heory W c
 supposed that we lived in
 a Republic where froe white
 men regulated its action and
 controlled its destiny that it
 was a Government of the
 people for the people For
 three fourths of a century
 we havc grown in wealll
 numbers and power although you
 claim to have suffered from
 multiplied wrongs South Carolina in
 onc of her many dectarations
 of in dependence says it
 has beeri ff0ing on for
 seventy four years Quitc likely
 our fathers comrncnced a crusadc
 against slavcry c vcn in
 thc colonial state they rcncwed
 it in the I eclaration
 of Independ ence and continued
 it after the adoption of
 the Constitution in its nhnost
 immediate abolition in one half
 the States o the Union
 And now you scandalize the
 Inemory of the revolutionary pa
 triots who hewed the pathway
 to national great ness through
 rivers of blood with fire
 and sword by charging that
 the only motive for unchainino
 the slave was the sordid
 and base consideration that slaverv
 would not pay Grant if
 you please that slavcryis right
 what then You say that
 the Territories belong to the
 people of the whole country
 Shall not they who Is
 it u nsafe to intrust
 thcn des own it control
 it tiny with the sovereign
 peoplc of the Republic l
 he majority constitutionally expressed must
 rovern What do you mean
 when you talk of the
 brute force of majorities which
 is manifested without forcc and
 exercised without violence Is that
 not safer than the brute
 forcc ofa minority You say
 you are excluded from settling
 in the Territories Not so
 Of your eight million pop
 ulalion scarce three hundred thousand
 are owners of slaves The
 hearthstones of many solitary cabins
 far away towards the light
 of the setting sun arc
 cheered by the songs which
 the cmiærnnt learned in his
 southern home Your seven hnil
 lion five hundred thousand population
 who have not the advantages
 of negro property can cross
 the dark line which slavery
 rears and not be com
 pelted to work in the
 furrow wet with the sv
 reat of the slave This
 very day is not a
 fair propor tion of the
 population of that country of
 which Twas said that far
 through the forest wild And
 over t he moantåins hold
 Was a land whose rivers
 and darkening cares Were getn
 d with the purest gol
 l men reared in a
 southern clime Let mc illus
 trate a poor boy was
 born in Kentucky not to
 an inheritance of wealth and
 slaves but entitled to the
 privileges of that immense territory
 over which your fathers said
 the dark wing of slavery
 should never be spread He
 removed to Iliinois by industry
 carved out for himself reputation
 honor and great ness and
 now stands a living cmbodiment
 of the principles we profess
 the lawfülly elected President of
 the United States Will Kentucky
 this day say that the
 ordinance of Jefferson excluding slavery
 from the great Northwest prevented
 her citizens from enjoying its
 benefits or aspiring to the
 highest offices in the gift
 of a free people The
 policy of the dominant party
 must pre In 1820 the
 policy of the dominant and
 vail slaveholdinm party said slavery
 should not go north of
 360 30 In 1854 you
 reversed that pol icy and
 the dominant party said that
 slavery should have a struggle
 with freedom north of thit
 line and that free labor
 or slave labor should be
 baptized in fire dild blood
 on the plains of Kansas
 We submitted to the brute
 force of majorities In 1856
 you claimed that your Nébraska
 then bill was sustained by
 the ieople and the whole
 patronage of the Government the
 Treäs ury and sword of
 the notion unsheathed to subdue
 us we submitted to the
 brute force of majorities then
 DOUGLAS told you that by
 his theory of pop ular
 sovereignty you had acquired New
 Mexico to slavery we submitted
 to the brute force of
 majorities then We never rnade
 any ruffan 8 threat or
 bragcrart s boast only waiting
 for an other expression of
 the will of tho American
 peo pie And now in
 the same spirit with which
 you demand the r iffht
 to convert mon into merchan
 dise you talk of dismembering
 a great Republic and establishing
 empires Do gentlemen so scri
 ously mistake the nature of
 our Union The Amphyctionic council
 the Achæan and Ionian league
 the Swiss and Italian Republics
 like the first Confederation of
 our fathers were but States
 in alliance ours is a
 Union of the people The
 Constitution itself shows by whom
 made and for what purpose
 We the people not the
 States for the purpose of
 a more perfect union The
 power that created can alone
 destroy The question is not
 now shall the African be
 a slave but shall the
 white freemen of the nation
 control the Government Shall I
 my constiw uents my State
 my section pass under the
 yoke and grant a willinrr
 submission to a power which
 yields to no reason is
 controlled by no Consti tution
 guided by no laws We
 are told that we must
 submit because we havc been
 misrepresented at home and abroad
 because southern people in their
 blind infatuation believe that we
 intend to overrun devastate and
 destroy the southern States and
 liberate their I am not
 disposed to humiliate slaves by
 force myself to excuse or
 atone for another s folly
 We are hot responsible for
 the ignorance of your people
 w c have neither created
 nor contributed to it You
 suffer papers filled with the
 ultra doc trines of Garrison
 to be circulated while those
 which are exponents of Republican
 principles arc consigned to the
 flames Southern and northern orators
 have willfully and wickedly misrepresent
 ed our purposes and objects
 You have been arous ing
 and alarming the worst passions
 of your peo ple and
 now you say you cannot
 control them You have sown
 the wind now yourselves reap
 the whirlwind You have created
 the storm now bond yourselves
 before its fury or break
 While you have lashed the
 angry waves into threatening billows
 you ask us to cut
 away our masts and scuttle
 our ship so that you
 may cnjoy one wide spread
 ruin You are now exultant
 over the destruction you are
 hoping to produce Like the
 moonbeatns on the blasted heath
 Mocking its desolation you are
 strivincr to prevent the fulfillment
 of the prediction made by
 the Bishop of Cloyne more
 than a century ago when
 speakmg of this vast continent
 Time s noblest empire is
 the last You have been
 shorn of your strength by
 your own Delilah and now
 in your blindness would wrap
 your arms around the pillars
 of the Repub lic and
 perish in its ruins But
 our northern allies are atoning
 for their vork of folly
 by branding their own falsehoods
 OuTht not this to remove
 apprehension from the minds of
 your people You trusted them
 to bc lieve their falsehoods
 Why not betieve them when
 the dangers they have produced
 and the fears they have
 excited are extorting from them
 an honest confession If you
 will not hear Moses and
 the Prophets you would not
 be convinced though one rose
 from the dead 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Chishour witnesses the
 fulfillment of all we have
 political moral or religious subjects
 not having predicted as to
 the encroachments and demands your
 approbation That you will not
 banish the cottage Bible from
 your realm because Ots com
 of slavery F corn coercing
 the labor of one racc
 piler may be opposed to
 slavery Any secur it places
 hand oti our throat and
 in the lan guage of
 the highwayman demands our money
 lty for the freedom of
 speech and press already or
 our life our Government or
 Oar principles Do they fail
 to see that when this
 institution is car ried to
 the Territories the freemen of
 the North are driven from
 it Whata commentaryupon this institution
 that like the Upas tree
 every green leaf and flower
 of those rights which exalt
 man and dignify his ex
 istence must perish beneath its
 shadow A few days since
 when the gentleman from Georgia
 was delivering his vulcdictory and
 presenting his grievances to the
 world ho said they could
 not tol crate that white
 men like SUMNER should address
 southern audiences and that freedom
 of the press and circulation
 of printed matter could not
 be al lowed in his
 State and for fear the
 incoming Ad ministration should exercise
 its power to prevent the
 rifling of the mails in
 southern States whcrc we pay
 frorn the Treasury 2 500
 000 for their transportation he
 gave notice in advance that
 they would commit treason and
 destroy the Union Can thc
 enormity of the slave power
 be prcscnicd in any stronger
 licrht This very day the
 shadow of hoary oppression and
 at the foot of thrones
 covered with the dust of
 centuries free speech and free
 press begins to grow and

 at the peril of its
 ex istence is forced to
 extend a system more des
 potic Zhan tyranny and more
 dogmatical than priestcraft The popular
 sovereignty candidate for the Presidency
 after the humiliating boast tllat

 secured by the Constitution You
 say you concede to freedom
 north of 360 30 thatis
 no concession We bought thatright
 in 1820 when we received
 Missouri as a slave Statcjnto
 the Union You forced that
 right from us in 1854
 and then We conquered it
 through the strife and blood
 of a civil war so
 that we have already a
 double title first by purchase
 and then I by conquest
 But you yield to freedorn
 all that we may acquire
 north of that line We
 never can obtain any more
 Canada and the British possessions
 will never be ours All
 our future acquisitions if any
 must be south of that
 line in I the direction
 of the tropics and you
 demand its I unconditional surrender
 to slavery Under the de
 lusion ofa compromise you seek
 to betray us into a
 surrender to the very men
 who are compact breakers and
 who claim that a compromise
 to which the faith of
 the nation was pledgcd had
 no sacredness beyond an ordinary
 act for the collec tion
 of the revenue or the
 establishment of a post route
 You have for years been
 telling us that all geoo
 raphical lines werc sectional and
 danger ous to the peace
 and stability of the Union
 en tirelyunconstitutional finally you obtained
 a de cision of the
 Supreme Court to that effect
 when you suddcnly discover that
 the Constitution is unconstitutional and
 you seek its amendment to

 establish sectional lines all the
 States possibly would bid the
 secéding States depart in But
 fbrcib ly seize the Federal

 toifjread the pall of desolation

 down the last home of
 the hopeof freedom for thepurpose
 of extending in thename of
 liberty and under the shield
 of religion the institution of
 slavery The gentleman from Ma

 just taken his seat appeals
 to us most earnestly to
 méke some compromise to save
 the Union Why not appeal
 to the men who are
 laboring for As well stop

 We desire not the destruction
 even of South Carolina Jewish
 history which you 80 much
 venerate ad monishes us that
 they had a South Carolina
 in their confederacy and she
 seceded After three severe battles
 thc disunionists were exterminated The
 conquerorsindulged in no shouts of
 victory but came to the
 house of God and abode
 ether e till even before

 voices and wept sore and
 said O Lord God of

 to pass in Israel that
 here be to day one
 tribe lacking in Israel If
 ihe people consent let the

 let us vote millions to
 purchase slaves of the border

 correspondent of the New York
 that Abraham Lincoln was born
 in Kentucky the graves of
 his parents were there but
 he dare not visit them
 Dare not Is that the

 forever protected in all our
 future acquisitions No wondergentlemen are
 regretting its destruction no wonder
 ghosts of murdered victims will
 rise before thenl and not
 down at their bidding no
 wonder they should strive to
 banish the apparition of the
 bloody hand and men like
 thc Senator from Illinois should
 desire to act as though
 they had never uttered a
 word or cast a vote
 Your unholy crusade therefore against
 the Union is to extend
 the area of slavery For
 that purpose you invoke the
 God of battles when your
 system ignores all His attributes
 and defies the spirit of
 His teachings You talk of
 the sacredness of your homes
 when for years you have
 been tore And you coolly
 say we must have no
 Gov I despoiling the homes
 of thousands and suffer four
 ernment to protect such men
 Kentucky has i million human
 beings to have no hearthst0
 ics Slavery in Maryland has
 decreased 6 000 the last
 decade There are in thatState
 80 000 slaves which at
 500 per head v 01Tid
 only amount to 40 000
 000 A duty of ten
 per cent on the of
 annual imports would pay for
 them in a single year
 Baltitnore would soon riva Philadelphia
 as a manufacturing city and
 Mary land would be converted
 into a garden to supply
 the wants of northern cities
 Delaware has only 2 00
 slaves One million dollars would
 indem nify the owners and
 make her a free State
 Mis souri has but 100
 000 slaves Fifty million dollars
 would pay for them and
 make her rival Illinois population
 and improvement Thus iri wealth
 less than 100 000 000
 would rid them all of
 an i institution for which
 neither their climate nor products
 are suited and bestow on
 them the spurned the demagogue
 and now she repudiates around
 which the afFections may cluster
 You vanttiges of free labor
 II talk about the recollection
 of wives and children q
 You also insist upon dissolving
 the Union be his libel
 Now you ask us to
 compromise What have we to
 concede We have done you
 no wrong and propose none
 You have been comprolnisino for
 years until you yourselves have
 often told us he day
 for compromise was past You
 com promised in 1850 and
 called it a finality You
 compromised in 1854 by violating
 a sacred com promtsc called
 that a finality and said
 you had removed the agitation
 out of Congress The only
 finality we have had for
 years we had at the
 ballot box the 6th day
 of November last True to
 your instincts you are trying
 to sot aside that finality
 that you may renew agitation
 You pro pose now to
 lay your hands upon the
 ark of the covenant our
 fathers set up to amend
 the Con stitution to give
 you greater guarantees for sla
 very than the States exacted
 when each held slaves You
 havo suggested no compromise that
 does not involve submission and
 surrender on our part You
 have proposed no plan which
 concedes anything to the North
 You ask us to admit
 the truth of your charges
 against us by a declaration
 in the Constitu tion that
 we will never steal your
 slaves or deprive you of
 your rights Of what avail
 would that be if your
 present position is correct that
 one State however insignificant can
 destroy the whole fabric You
 who have VIO lated the
 Constitution and set the laws
 at defiance are demanding constitutional
 guarantees that we will do
 neither Will you teli what
 concessions you propose to the
 North Do you propose any
 additional security for the protection
 of the life and liberty
 of the northern man in
 the slave States Additional security
 for the sacred right of
 prop ert y when that
 property consists in books on

 your system destroys cause some
 men believe that slavery will

 thousands of years offering up

 can reffain Think you another
 Senate can be formed wherein
 Delaware and Florida can equal
 New York and Pennsylvania Another
 I louse of Rep resentativcs
 wherein you will be allowed
 twentv Representatives on account of
 your property in man You
 are now opposed to the
 Arrny and Navy because you
 boldly assert that an enförce
 ment of the laws means
 a coercion of the States
 You were willing to vote
 millions to transport troops and
 provisions two thousand miles over
 I prairie and desert to
 coerce our brethren in Utah
 when you said they were
 in rebellion to thcGov ernment
 You sent the Army into
 Kansas to subdue the frecnnen
 in the North You have
 used the Federal troops to
 enforce the fuoitive slave law
 When John Brown with as
 mucfl authority to seize the
 property of the nation as
 you possess took the arsenal
 at Harper s Ferry the
 marines of the United States
 vvcre sent to its rescue
 You dreaded not then its
 despotic power The camp I
 had no terrors The plume
 of the soldier and the
 gilded trappings of the officer

 the throne and he who
 sat on it would have
 been powdered in the dust
 nor longer would the body

 chains nor the spirit flapped
 its wings against bonds and

 democracicg of Greece would have

 the turbulent republics of the

 the time must comé whenethe

 You may widen and deepen
 the gulf between freedom and

 The principles of our fathers

 No Sit the least of

 the Constitution can never bc
 taken or attempted to be
 taken from her Should her
 rights be invaded thousands of
 northern svgords would leap from
 their scabbards and every free

 You venerate his memory and
 cherish the sentiments he uttered
 in the Senate Chamber in
 1850 v vhen Georgia was
 threatenino to seccdc from the
 Union when he said Now
 I stand here in my
 place rncaning to be unawed
 by any threats whether they
 como frotn individuals or fro

 as as any man that
 arms should be raised against
 the authority of the Union
 either by individuals or by
 States But after all that
 has occurred if any one
 State or a portion of
 the people of any State
 choose to place thernselves in

 Government of the Union I
 arn for trying tbe strength
 of the Government I am
 for ascertaining whether we have
 a Government or not practical

 its authority and upholding the
 powers and interests which belong
 to a Governinent Nor sir

 or dissuaded f roxn any
 such course by intimations of

 us stolen from the national
 arsenals For myself sir never
 I would rather perish on
 the threshold of this Capitol
 defen ling the stars and
 stripes which float over it
 than vote at such time
 for any compromise involving a
 sacrifice of principle You your
 selves would desoisc a people
 who would exhibit the cowardice
 to retreat in the face
 of an armed arid threatening
 foe The true men of
 the North and South will
 rally round that standard sheet
 determined to defend and protect
 it from enemies without and
 foes within Some stars on

 JOHN COCHRANE None whatever Mr
 DAWES I might as well
 have gentlemen understand at once
 what my purpose is I

 that the floor is farmed
 out so that gentlemen on
 the other side are to
 have it in the morning
 and gentlemen on this side
 to have it late in
 the afternoon The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The Chair knows of
 no such arrangement Mr STEVENSON
 A gentleman from New York
 Mr CONKLING is to have
 the floor after his colleague
 Mr MAYNARD It will be
 recollected that the first member
 who had the floor this
 morning on this debate was
 the very ultra gentleman from
 Pennsylvania Mr STEVENS Mr DAWES
 I have observed that neither
 the ordinary parliamentary rule which
 requires that the member who
 addresses the Chair first is
 to be recognized first nor
 any arrangement known be forehand
 is observed in farming out
 the floor I Arn only
 desirous to know by what
 right the floor is farmed
 out Thut is all I
 have no in terest in
 the matter myself had just
 as lief hear the gentleman
 from New York as the
 gen tleman from Kentucky or
 any other man I have
 I am acting in concert
 with no other interest nobody
 Mr SICKLES Is debate in
 order The SPEAKER tempore The
 gentleman from New York is
 entitled to the floor Mr
 DAWES 1 insist that 1
 am entitled to the floor
 The gentleman from New York
 yielded the floor to me
 Mr BURNETT If my memory
 IS not en tirely at
 fault in the last Congress
 the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr
 DAWES himself when in the
 chair made pretty rnuch the
 same decision which the gentleman
 who now occupies the chair
 If am not mistaken he
 refused to has made recognize
 points of order on the
 ground that they were frivolous
 And in respect to the
 farming out the floor I
 vill say that understand the
 gentleman from New York is
 to be followed by one
 of his colleagues DAWES Will
 the gentleman from Ken tuckyhåélen
 to me for one moment
 Mr SICKLES 1 object to
 debate except by the gentleman
 from New York who is
 entitled to the floor Mr
 DAWES 1 hope the from
 New York will allow me
 to reply to the gentleman
 from Kentucky Mr SICKLES I
 object only because the gen
 tleman from Massachusetts made his
 comment which was replied to
 by the gentleman from Ken
 tucky I insist now that
 both sides have been heard
 that the gentleman from New
 York who is entitled to
 the floor shall be permitted
 to proceed Mr DAWES i
 rose to correct the statement
 of the gentleman from Kentucky
 and if I am pre

 the Senator from Ken tacky
 Mr CRITTENDEN 5 also presenta
 sim ilau petition of citizens

 State of Pennsylvania move that
 these peti tions lie on

 agreed to Mr BIGLER I
 also present tho memorial of
 a committee of thirty three
 appoint ed at a great
 mass meeting of workingmen held
 in Philadel phia in Independence
 square on Saturday even Ing
 last In presenting this inemorial
 Mr Pres ident I desi
 re t o stat c
 that it is one of
 far more than ordinary importance
 and I feel required to
 present briefly to the Senate
 and thc country its character
 nnd siffnificancc It was handcd
 to me this morning bv
 a conunittee of thirty three
 en t emen with the
 rcques t that I present
 it to the Senate These
 gentlemen Mr President rep resent
 fifty thousand citizens of Philadelphia
 the bone and sinew of
 that community the real work
 ino men that class of
 men upon whom the whole
 structure of society and the
 Govcrnmcnt rests have been moved
 to this by no politicians
 nor by the motives that
 ordinarily move politi cians They
 have been actuated by their
 deep solicitude for the unhappy
 condition of the coun try
 and they come here to
 make known their will to
 their representatives Afterconsiderincrvat ious propositions
 presented through a delegate meet
 Incr representing all the great
 industrial interests of Philadelphia the
 vast mechanical pursuits of that
 city and subsequently in a
 large mass meeting they agreed
 by a common voice to
 recommend to their representatives in
 Congress without dis tinction of
 party thc programme of peace
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 Mr CRITTENDEN I should have
 remarked Mr President that tbesc
 men were composed of all
 parties Domo Mr President the
 proceedings which they have submitted
 to me are of a
 truly interesting and patriotic character
 They breathe a senti ment
 of loyalty to the devotion
 to the rights and interests
 of all the States at
 the same time that they
 manifest an earnest desire to
 make every reasonable and honorable
 concession in order to reconcile
 the discontented States and to
 maintain this Union as a
 whole In doing all this
 it is just to say
 of them do not wish
 to be understood as countenancing
 to any extent whatever the
 recent movements of disso lotion
 of this Union Upon these
 movements they look with deep
 displcasure and are deeply grieved
 with the spirit in vhich
 these movements are pursued but
 they go on to say
 in a spirit of candor
 and devotion to the country
 that they will yield anything
 and everything which their duty
 to the Constitution requires that
 they regard the southern States
 as equals in this Confederacy
 that they are prepared to
 maintain them in every right
 which is enjoyed by the
 northern States or the northern
 people not only as members
 of thc Confederacy but in
 the enjoyment and use of
 the common territories They regard
 the proposi tion of the
 honorable Senator from Kentucky as
 amounting simply to an equitable
 division of the Territories and
 a guaranty to the weaker
 section of the Confederacy against
 aggressions in the fu turc
 the most effective mode of
 adjustment and at the same
 time involves the Icast sacrifice
 of position and prejudice on
 the part of any one
 of the great parties that
 now control the political affairs
 of the country Mr President
 with these few remarks I
 pre sent the memorial and
 proceedings and I ask that
 the memorial be printed Mr
 CAMERON I also have been
 charged with a petition similar
 to the one just presented
 by my colleague by a
 committee of thirty three workingmen
 representing as they say a
 meeting of four thousand workingmen
 held at Independ ence square
 in Philadelphia on Saturday evening
 I have no doubt the
 men were there and I
 have no doubt that they
 represent to a great extent
 thc feeling of Pennsylv4nia but
 thtit feel ino is not
 as represented by my colleague
 as I understand hi_m here
 now The other day when
 this subject wras up I
 had occasion to pay a
 com pliment to my colleague
 for the speech delivered by
 him I wished to say
 to the country that although
 that speech was conciliatory although
 it went yery to conciliate
 the South none of the
 gentlemen on the other side
 of the House paid any
 attention to it On account
 of what I said then
 I am charged with having
 indorsed the speech and the
 whole speech of my colleague
 1 said it was an
 able and a patriotic and
 a proper speech I think
 those werc my words but
 I did not say that
 i indorsed it for I
 never indorsed all his sentiments
 and certainly I could not
 have in dorsed the reasoning
 of this speech I agreed
 with him thus far I
 said that I indorsed his
 sen timents in favor of
 the preservation of the Union
 I say so now I
 say everywhere that I wilt
 make all reasonable concessions to
 save this Union from separation
 with a hope thala proper
 response Will be rnet Wilh
 in the South I look
 upon the question differently from
 my colleague in this respect
 Ido not think that there
 are any offending States I
 am sure the State of
 Pennsylvania has not offended her
 sister States She has done
 noth inT buc what she
 would do again in the
 exercise of her constitutional rights
 1100k upon it in this
 way the North have won
 the bat tle on the
 great question of free and
 slave labor they are the
 strong party and they can
 afford to make concessions to
 the weaker if concessions be
 desired and all my remarks
 the other day and all
 I shall say now and
 all I shall continue to
 say upon this question have
 been and will be based
 upon the idea that I
 am content to do anything
 that could honoraby be expected
 of me that will bring
 peace to this country and
 preventa separa tion of the
 States but before I act
 I desire to know that
 whatever concessions 1 and my
 con stituents be disposed to
 make will be received in
 the spirit in which brothers
 should receive crats Republicans and
 Americans as are the I
 kindly treatment frorn their brothers
 I warlt to working classes
 which they represent They are
 know from the South whether
 anything that exceedingly anxious to
 be regarded in no party
 I can do will bring
 back t o their duty
 in the Union sense burt
 simply as speaking for the
 class which tbosc who are
 leading this great rebellion south
 they represent ill refin ence
 to the present im I
 for 1 100k upon it
 as a rebellion I am
 wi31ing to periled condition of
 the country take the resolutions
 offered by the Senator from
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLObØ 635
 Kentucky as a basis of
 settlement I said that the
 other day I believes at
 least I have said every
 where in my conversations that
 while there are some points
 in his proposition which I
 cannot adopt I Will go
 far very far further perhaps
 than a majority of my
 constituents wouid go to take
 away all cause of complaint
 on tac part of the
 soulhern people Especially do I
 desire to hold out hope
 to the Un rnen in
 the South who are now
 battling with those who are
 disposed to dissever the Union
 want to en courage them
 and I will go as
 far as any man can
 be expected to go to
 enable them to put them
 selves right at home and
 among their constituents After said
 this I hayé the honor
 of pre senting the petition
 of these workingmen of Phil
 adelphia Mr MASON Mr Mr
 BIGLER Will the Senator from
 Vir ginia aliow me a
 sincle word Mr MASON One
 moment The Senators from Pennsylvania
 have spoken of a disposition
 on the part of their
 State to make any concessions
 to the South which they
 can make with proper regard
 to the Constitution or to
 themsclves Now I 10 not
 understand what those Senators or
 oth ers who use that
 term mean by concessions am
 not aware that the southern
 States haveasked for any concessions
 of any kind in any
 form Y ct that term
 is in as familiar use
 here as a house hold
 word that the South asks
 for concessions from the North
 and that the North is
 willing to make them We
 would never ask for conces
 It has been the uniforrn
 lan sions in any form
 guage of the southern States
 here through their representatives so
 far as I know that
 they are perfectly satisfied with
 the Constitution they have no
 complaint to make of the
 Constitution Their complaint is that
 thc Constitution has been violated
 and disregarded to the prejudice
 of the rights socurcd to
 them by the Constitution They
 It ask for no concession
 in any form or shape
 would be unworthy in them
 to ask it and derog
 atory in the other Statos
 to yield it What arc
 concessions The idea is that
 the North arc to give
 to the South something that
 the Constitution That is the
 only idea does not entitle
 them to of concession W
 c have never asked for
 it in any forni or
 shape We have aslccd only
 that thc Const if uti0k
 i be regarded fulfilled carricd
 out as the makers of
 the Constitution designed its hould
 be for the protection of
 those rights under t be
 Constitution that we say have
 been outraged and and eloquent
 than I am the sentiments
 and con victions that I
 entertain As an individual Sen
 atop looking upon myself ns
 the humblest mem bet of
 the body but still feeling
 Lhat responsibil ity which wus
 imposed upon me vhen I
 took the oath to support
 the Constitution of the United
 States and feeling something of
 the resnonSibil ity which thc
 exti aordinary posil on of
 public affairs at present imposes
 upon everbody I desire to
 acquit myself so far as
 I may of any patriotic
 obligations that rest upon me
 as a member of this
 body Not taking up the
 hour of the Senate nor
 keeping the impatient ears of
 the Senate from hearing the
 du Icet tones of the
 Senator from Penn sylvania Mr
 BIGLER who is waiting for
 me to sil down I
 shall yield the floor with
 the an nouncen ucnt that
 at some time which will
 be con venient to tho
 Senate and when there is
 nobody who thinks he can
 address the Senate better than
 can if such a time
 ever arrives I hope to
 ad dress a few remarks
 upon this subject to the
 Sen ate and to that
 portion of the country that
 takes any interest in what
 we arc doing here Mr
 BIGLER Mi Mr FOS I
 ER I ask what question
 is before the Senate Mr
 BIGLER The motion which 1
 made to print the memorial
 MI GRIMES 1 think there
 was no such mo tion
 made Mr FOSTER 1 did
 not heap any motion There
 was no business before the
 Senate that I saw The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr POLK The
 Chair did not hoar the
 motion but the Sen ator
 froin Pennsylvania says he made
 it Mr BIGLER Mr The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator from
 Pennsylvania is entitled to the
 floor Mr G PLIMES On
 what motion The PRESIDING OFFICER
 on the motion to print
 the memorial he offered I
 regret exceedingly that my Mr
 BIGLER im patience has abbreviated
 the speech of the Sen
 ator from New Hampshire for
 I am very sure we
 are always glad to hear
 his musical voice but that
 regret is relieved by the
 announcement that we shall hear
 him soon again 13ut enough
 of that sir Nor do
 I intend to go into
 this general sub ject My
 object is simply to say
 a word to my col
 caguc which I know he
 will receive in all as
 to policy btit as to
 law in order that the
 country may saved was in
 that sense that I used
 thé term concession 1 certainly
 did not mean and I
 never shouldämö pute to Virginii
 or any other sovereign Ståtes
 the purpose of conceding a
 cléarly aelcriösvl edged constitutional right
 but sir a concession of
 party position a concession of
 patty organi zation a concession
 of prejudice if you please
 is a concession at this
 time Oh which I think
 every man might well pride
 himself I do not thesitate
 to say that I am
 perfectly ready to abandon party
 organization and party prejud ice
 and actas though I had
 never participated in pol lics
 if by that I can
 procure the adoption of a
 measure that will secure to
 any extent the peace of
 the country Sir ibis no
 ordinary time State after State
 is by solemn ordinance claiming
 to be out of this
 Union the whole fabric is
 going to pieces and yet
 gentlemen express astonishment that terms
 are used in these extraordinåry
 times which seem to imply
 an undue anxiety or feeling
 on the part of some
 confess to deep heartfelt anxiety
 perhaps to undue zeal What
 express comes from a sn
 ong conviction that never since
 the organization of this Govern
 ment was there devolved upon
 the Senators of the Unitcd
 States such an imperative high
 holy and momentous duty as
 devolves upon it just at
 this dav and this hour
 Mr TRUMBULL Mr to present
 the remonstrance of Murry Nelson
 and one hundred and sixty
 tln ec ot bcrs citizens
 of Chicago Illinois who express
 themselves as be ing in
 favor of the Constitution and
 laws as they are and
 agail lst any concessions to
 thc people of the South
 while arrayed in rebellion arrainst
 the Union and the laws
 but in favor of hearing
 their grievances after they shall
 have returned to their allegiance
 and redressing them so far
 as may be in their
 power This remonstrance is signed
 as I said by over
 one hundred and sixty citizens
 of Chicago and takes the
 same view which I am
 glad to hear that thc
 Senator from Virginia takes I
 believe that the Constitution is
 good enough sir that the
 Constitution is good enough and
 the difficulty is that we
 do not live up to
 the Consti I think tution
 that thcrc is rebellion acrainst
 it our first dutv and
 the first duty of the
 Senator from Pennsylvania if he
 wants to preserve this Union
 is to defend the Constitution
 and laws as It is
 not by making concessions to
 men Ele certainly docs not
 intend to inti who ask
 no concessions blit spurn them
 who kindness maie that I
 had any agencv in creating
 the impres say they want
 nothing to do with the
 Union who violated We ask
 for no concession should Sion
 that he intended to ihdorse
 all that said in bc
 humiliated if we did ask
 it and they would be
 humiliatcd if they granted it
 We ask for no con
 cession we ask only for
 right We are asking for
 no new provisions whatever We
 are asking for a security
 not a concession N h
 HALE Mr Mr BIGLER 1
 hope the Senator from Hampshire
 will allow mc a moment
 Mr I I ALE I
 have got the floor about
 four times within the last
 fortnight to say very few
 words and on each occasion
 there has been some other
 member of thc Senate so
 well convinced that hc could
 address the Senate better than
 I could I that he
 has appealed to me and
 I yielding to the impression
 have given way and the
 Senator from Illinois Mr DOUGLAS
 says that I did not
 hear a better speech than
 should probably have made myself
 That will do for him
 to say not i i
 for me Laughter I do
 not mean to occupy I
 desire to state that I
 wish to address the Senate
 upon this subject notat great
 I desire some convenient opportunity
 to do it but while
 I arn up now permit
 me to say that I
 have i becn listening from
 the first day of the
 session until to day this
 moment to hear from the
 other side of the Chamber
 just exactly so sensible a
 speech as the Senator from
 Virginia has just made I
 certainly had my speech of
 the 21st instant I did
 not so understand him I
 knew he not could not
 But I will say that
 I was rnuch grat ified
 with the rnani fi station
 of a I know he
 frels to reconcilc the unhappy
 differ ences which are dividing
 and breaking u D the
 For that I thank hitn
 And I a have country
 never so far as am
 concerned anywhere inti matcd that
 my colleague could or would
 indorse nor had I any
 I all the sentiments of
 my sieech reason to believe
 that he wras satisfied with
 all the fcaturcs of the
 proposition of the Senator from
 Kentucky or that submittcd by
 myself but hc did say
 substantially that he was willing
 to make those propositions a
 basis of adjustment alli l
 to cro to any reasonable
 length to accomplish the dcsircd
 end But enough of that
 point Now sir I shall
 not follow the distinguished Senator
 frorn Virginia through all his
 remarks When he announced the
 fact that the expression the
 making of concessions had concession
 become as familiar as househo
 d words he offered a
 sufiicient apology for the use
 I made of it on
 this occasion Bat sir I
 say Inorc we Ilia y
 as well 100k at question
 practically Everybody knows that there
 are very decided differences of
 tand with arms in théir
 hands who fn e into
 your vessels who capture your
 soldiers who seize your property
 who rob your Treasury that
 you are to have peace
 and if this country has
 received a shock from which
 it will not recover in
 genera tions it is because
 of a craven spirit on
 the part of this great
 Government Let it put itself
 in a position to be
 respected and obeyed and it
 wiil have the respect of
 the world and the obedience
 of its citizens I am
 also charcred with thc presentation
 of another petition from John
 Van Cleve William Cliffe and
 N Hawlcy citizens of the
 United States who were appointed
 at a meeting of the
 Southern Illinois Conference of the
 Methodist Episcopal Chu rch to
 rnemorialize Congress which they have
 done setting forth various grievances
 to which members of that
 religious persuasion have been subjected
 and arnong other things they
 state that a conference of
 tlheir Church in Texas presided
 over by a bishop was
 broken up by a mob
 on the Lord s day
 and II mt a gentle
 Inan by the name of
 Anthony Bewley was hung at
 Fort Worth his only critne
 beii g his connec tion
 with our church as one
 of its ministers They go
 on to ask that in
 any corn pron iise which
 ma y bc made for
 the preservation of the Union
 opinion which seriously involve the
 peace of the it may
 be adopted as a part
 of the basis of such
 compromise that no person shall
 be proscribed country The Senator
 says very justly that Vir
 I hat together with the
 telegraphic report which I saw
 in the newspapers signed by
 the illustrious ainia only claims
 her constitutional rights that for
 his religious opinions and that
 when violent Senator from Illinois
 no disparaoement to my she
 asks no concession The Senator
 knows that persccutions for opinion
 s sake shall be prae
 ticed the person or persons
 so offending shall be friend
 yonder Mr TRUMBULL I and
 the venerable there are differences
 of opinion as to what
 those Ser atot from Kentncky
 no disparagement to my constitutional
 rights are I ho other
 side of the punished and
 they ask that their rights
 may be young friend yonder
 MI rne Chamber claim the
 right to interdict slavery in
 protected as welfasthc rights ofthe
 Church which think there is
 somethinginthcannounccmcnct he y the Territorics
 Virgihians clain l that they
 have have made that there
 is a good prospect of
 union a constitutional right to
 go into the Territories and
 protection throughout the United States
 and take their slaves with
 them That is the point
 move that these petitions lie
 on the table upon this
 subject when I hear the
 remarks that have just becn
 made by the honorable Senator
 fl of difFercnce and I
 suppose that when Senators The
 motion was agreed to Thc
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr POLK in
 from Virginia They express in
 better language i talk about
 concessions in the pressino exigencies
 which surround us they mean
 that they yield the chair
 fl he motion made by
 the Senator than I cöuld
 possibly utter because however correctly
 I may think the Senator
 is more fluent a portion
 of their own peculiar opinions
 not only from Pennsylvania Mr
 BIGLER to print the mc
 636 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 30 morial that was presented
 by himself has not been
 put to the Senate and
 inasmuch as a good deal
 that has been said by
 Senators has been on other
 topics the Chair submits that
 it would be better to
 put that motion Mr COLLAMER
 I believe the Senate has
 not printed a memorial since

 INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL Mr PEARCE
 I wish to give notice
 that to morrow I shall
 ask the Senate to take
 up the Indian appropriation bill
 Mr FESSENDEN At what hour
 Mr PEARCE At o clock
 F M DEAUCIIAMP AND BETSY
 D TOWNSEND Mr POWELL I
 move to takc up the
 bill for the reliefofF M
 Beauchamp and Betsy D Town
 send The motion was agreed
 to and the bill H
 R No 919 for the
 relief of F M Beauchamp
 and Betsy D Townsend was
 considered as in Com It
 proposes to release F tucky
 district and his father went
 his security in a bail
 bond in the penalty of
 4 000 The boy did
 not make the bail bond
 was forfeited and judgment was
 entered against the fatheF for
 the penalty of 4 000
 Execution is sued upon the
 judgment and it was replevied
 by his mother in law
 Betsy Townsend going the security
 Execution I think has now
 issued upon that replevin bond
 and is levied upon all
 the property that is owned
 by this person The House
 of Representatives passed the bill
 unanimously and the Committee on
 the Post Offce and Post
 Roads of the Senate have
 recom mended its passage here
 if that bondis collected it
 will utterly beggar and bankrupt
 this old gen tleman who
 is a most worthy citizen
 In con sequence of the
 extreme youth of his son
 and the excessive bail I
 think it a most meritorious
 case The committee in the
 other House unani mously reported
 in favor of its passage
 the House unanimously passed it
 and the Committee on the
 Post Offce and Post Roads
 of the Senate recom mend
 its passacre Without further remark
 I hope the bill will
 be passed Mr TRUMBULL 1
 have listened to the Sen
 ator from Kentucky and if
 I understand the ground upon
 which he puts this case
 it will do away with
 the necessity of taking recoo
 nizances or bail bonds in
 the future It seems that
 a per son was indicted
 for a criminal offense he
 gave criminal offense he failed
 to comply he did not
 appear his recognizance was forfeited
 and now his security asks
 to be relieved upon what
 poor and it will be
 a hardship for him to
 pay the bond That is
 all except you may add
 one other offense or charged
 with the commission of the
 offense was a young maw
 and the son of the
 per son who gave the
 bail bond It seems to
 me it is a most
 extraordinary case I know the
 Sena tor from Kentucky said
 that the amount of the
 bond was large and hc
 proposes to release the party
 from the whole of it
 If there was any ex
 cessive bail required the most
 that could be done would
 be to reduce the amount
 to a reasonable sum if
 we were better capable of
 judging what a reasonable snm
 was than the court in
 Kentucky which fixed the amount
 It seems to mo there
 is no reason in the
 world given for releasing those
 securities except tho simplc one
 appealing to our sympathv and
 if securities arc to bc
 released on that grou nd
 there will be no use
 hereafter in tak ing bonds
 That is all there is
 in this case There are
 no spccial facts here I
 have sent for the pa
 pers but have not had
 time to read them all
 but I understand from the
 Senator from Kentucky who advocates
 the claim that that is
 all there is of it
 I wish to call the
 attention of the Senate to
 the casc without making an
 argument If they are prepared
 to vote to release parties
 from their bail bonds on
 the ground that it is
 a hardship for the securities
 to pay them when the
 principals escape be it so
 The presumption would be that
 this young man was within
 the control of his father
 and he can get a
 release from the bail bond
 by surrendering his son to
 answer the offense with which
 he is charged l he
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair feels
 it to be his duty
 to call up the special
 order at this hour Mr
 POWELL I move t hat
 the special order be postponed
 until this bill be disposed
 of It will take but
 a few minutes M Beauchamp
 and Betsy D Townsend from
 the Mr G WIN I
 am willing that the special
 payment of the sum of
 4 000 and all interest
 order shall go over infonually
 thereon being the principal ofa
 replevin bond ex Mr POWELL
 That is all I ask
 ecuted by Beauchamp as principal
 and Town send as his
 security on the 21st Of
 November MISSION OF PEACE FROM
 VIRGINIA 1860 payable to the
 United States Mr CLINGMAN What
 is the special order Mr
 TRUiVIBULL Is there a report
 in that I at this
 time case The PRESIDING OFFICER
 There are two Mr POWELL
 There is no report butl
 can special Orders One is
 the Pacific railroad bill state
 to the Senate in a
 very few words the merits
 which is the unfiliished business
 and has prece of this
 case A son of Mr
 Béauchamp for whose dence The
 other is the motion to
 print the Pres benefit this
 act is proposed n lad
 of sixteen and ident s
 message communicating the resolutions of
 a half years old was
 placed in a little country
 the Virginia Legislature on which
 the Senator store near the
 residence of his father in
 Kentucky from North Carolina is
 entitled to the floor league
 of the coast of Florida
 Under these cir I in
 which Store there was kept
 a post oihce This Mr
 CLINGMAN As I understand from
 the cumstances they ask the
 protection of thc Con boy
 was charged with having taken
 from a letter chair that
 the Pacific railroad bill now
 takes pre stitution and laws
 of the United States I
 move in tho post offce
 twenty six dollars He was
 cedence I do not wish
 to interfere with the anx
 I indicted in the United
 States court for the Ken
 I iety of Senator from
 California to dispose of that
 the petition together with the
 affdavitß ac 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GL E that important measure
 and I shall not make
 any motion by which it
 will lose its precedence if
 can have some other opportunity
 of being heard briefly on
 the questions involved in the
 mesgacc 1 do not know
 what is the wish of
 the Senator from California Mr
 G WIN All I have
 to say is that I
 sup pose the whole Senate
 want to dispose of the
 Pa cific railroad bill to
 day I shall be for
 one and I suppose the
 whole Senate will be greatly
 obliged to the Senator from
 North Carolina if he will
 postpone his remarks to a
 future day I think if
 we get at the railroad
 question at once we can
 I shall not interfere with
 dispose of it very soon
 him if hc wishes to
 go on to day but
 if he will name some
 other day I shall be
 greatly obliged to him Mr
 CLINGMAN I would suggest this
 If I can have an
 opportunity of being heard even
 on Monday I shall be
 willing to give way now
 I will either give way
 as is desired by the
 Senator from California or go
 on whenever I get an
 op portunity but I prefer
 knowing now when I can
 be heai d If I
 can be heard on Monday
 I shall be perfectly content
 Mr GWIN and others Certainly
 Mr LATHAM With the permission
 ofthe Senator from Nor th
 Carolina I will move to
 post pone the consideration of
 the President s message until
 to morrow at one o
 clock at which time if
 the Senator from North Carolina
 is not ready to go
 on I have a few
 remarks that I should like
 to submit to the consideration
 of the Senate Of course
 if he be prepared to
 proceed then I shall give
 way to him I will
 also state that if the
 Pa cific railroad bill or
 any other bill shall then
 be unfinished I will give
 way of course for I
 do not want to intcrfcrc
 with the rcgulat discharge of
 the business of this body
 Mr CLINGMAN 1 shall not
 interfere with the wishes of
 the Senator from California if
 he desires to bc heard
 to morrow but if it
 is agree able to tbc
 Senate I will move to
 postpone the President s messacye
 until Monday with the un
 derst anding that I shall
 then be heard Mr LA
 THAM 1 will state to
 the Senator that if he
 shall not be in a
 condition to speak to morrow
 when I conclude my remarks
 I will move to postpone
 the subject until Monday and
 give him an opportunity to
 be heard then Mr CLINGMAN
 1 do not wish to
 fere with the honorable Senator
 to morrow if he comes
 here prepared to speak then
 it there can be an
 understanding that I can occupy
 the floor on Monday If
 that will not interfere with
 any Senator I hope that
 will be the understanding and
 that on Monday at one
 o clock I may speak
 on the subject BEAUCHAMP AND
 TOWNSEND Mr CRITTENDEN Mr President
 there never was a case
 for charity or for benevolence
 or for softening the rigor
 of justice that did not
 admit of exactly the argument
 which my friend from Illinois
 has made here General principles
 and theories will cut down
 aH this beneficence on the
 part of society or on
 the part of legislation The
 general theory upon which thc
 gencfal rule is made of
 course is sustained theoretically upon
 all these grounds The application
 for par ticular redress or
 for particular indulgence is founded
 upon the particular circumstances of
 the I case and are
 not in conflict with the
 generarprin ciples It is easy
 to say If you grant
 the re quest here ou
 may set aside all your
 laws upon the subject There
 is no soundness in the
 argu ment at all Now
 sir here is an old
 man I know him an
 honest worthy plain old farmei
 whose ex perience in the
 world has been pretty much
 lim ited to his few
 acres of ground and the
 cultivation of them A son
 of his is unfortunately betrayed
 into crime The father by
 his natural feelings governing above
 and beyond all reason becomes
 his bail The son absconds
 The father is left to
 the penalty of his bond
 My friend says let the
 penalty of the Government be
 exacted If you exact it
 as the petition shows beside
 the mortification that has visited
 the honest household gular case
 I kndwrthai tinder Very similar
 Cir once pi ocured bail
 for a person named Hinton
 who fobbed the mail of
 some very large sum and
 ran away j and left
 his sureties under circumstances thatwould
 have ruined them utterly A
 petition was préSented here ånd
 that case went through and
 r the bail were released
 It was not a more
 equitable case than the present
 one This is just such
 a case that there is
 not a Senator on this
 floor if the amount of
 this penalty wag to go
 to him that would put
 it in his pocket I
 would not do it I
 do not believe there is
 a man here who would
 do it will not exact
 that for the Government which
 an honorable man Would not
 exact for himself I therefore
 think it is a case
 in Which we ought to
 grant relief I do not
 think it is a precedent
 that would be abused For
 one I would be willing
 in any other case as
 equitable as this appears to
 be to do just the
 same as I would here
 and I would treat every
 case according to its intrinsic
 merits 1 hope the bill
 will be passed The bill
 was reported to the Senate
 without amendment and ordered to
 third reading Mr TRUMBULL 1
 should like to have the
 yeas and nays on the
 bill I think it does
 set a précedent Mr G
 WIN Let us have them
 on its passage Mr TRUMBULL
 very well While 1 am
 up I Will say a
 word in reply to the
 Senator from of the old
 man for the crime of
 his son his wife Ohio
 He says he would not
 exact the collection and his
 other children are turned out
 of doors and he is
 reduced to povertv Sir what
 father under such circumstances of
 the char acter which I
 have described this old man
 to be could do otherwise
 Nature herself betrays him into
 it The criminality of the
 son renders doubly severe this
 penalty upon him The question
 is now whether you under
 these circumstances will not rather
 that this petty offense so
 far as regards this old
 man should go even unpunished
 than that he should be
 entirely and utterly ruined That
 is the question Let the
 Sentfte decide it Mr CLARK
 Will honorable Senator from Kentucky
 allow me to inquire whether
 the court had any power
 over this bail bond to
 relieve it Mr CRITTENDEN No
 sir The court had no
 power and the President has
 no power I was privy
 to the old man s
 visit all the way to
 this city He carne this
 winter all the way from
 the uttermost part of Kentucky
 to apply for mercy to
 the President of the United
 States He Tiade I can
 tell the gentleman the his
 appeal to him court had
 no power and I can
 say to him that the
 President declined to interfere because
 he was informed by the
 Attorney General that he had
 no It is for that
 reason that the subject is
 I brought before you Let
 the Senate decide it Mr
 LA n HAM I move
 then to postpone the messacre
 until to morrow at one
 o clock I Mr HALE
 I was on the comnlittec
 that re I will say
 to the Senator that if
 he does not feel ported
 this bill or rather I
 consented to the re I
 agree with the honorable Senator
 from f like speaking when
 finish I will move then
 Ilinois that there is no
 general principle upon of a
 claim of this character unless
 hc would put it in
 his own ocket Mr WAD
 I did not say that
 Mr TRUMBULL He asks whowould
 take it and put it
 in his own pocket None
 of us I suppose Can
 he ima ine a case
 where he would take the
 money from a security even
 of a mur derer or
 anybody else and put it
 in his own pocket But
 public justice has something to
 do x vith this question
 You may imagine the most
 infamous crimc possible and suppose
 the criminal has given security
 for his appearance at court
 are you go inc to
 release those securities If you
 are as a matter of
 course in every case where
 if the money was to
 be paid you would not
 take your self 1 think
 we had better repeal the
 laws under which security is
 taken in such cases I
 do not wish the yeas
 and nays to be taken
 more than once and I
 am entirely willing that they
 should be taken on the
 passage of the bill The
 bill was read the third
 time Tho PRESIDING OF FICER
 On the pas sage of
 the bill the yeas and
 nays are demanded by the
 Senator from Illinois The yeas
 and nays were ordered Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 state one other
 fact in connection r vith
 this sub ject There is
 no report whatever We are
 passing a bill on the
 statement of a Senatoz here
 that it is a hardship
 to the party I do
 not question the statement but
 no report has been read
 and there are no facts
 It seems to me the
 most extraor which this bill
 can be placed It is
 an exceptional in regard to
 it to postpone it until
 Monday at one o clock
 dinary case that I have
 ever seen passed in the
 Mr CRITTENDEN Now ifgentlemen have
 case and rests upon the
 same ground as another Senate
 made their private arranffements I
 wish to make 1 understand
 this man case that has
 been passed Mr POWELL I
 will say to the honorable
 a few remarks and they
 shall be very few on
 i has the sympathies and
 the recommendations of Senator that
 this bill has passed the
 lower House the bilk which
 was brought before the Senate
 upon the Governor of Kentucky
 and of the Legislature unanimously
 and that there was a
 report made the motion of
 mv colleague The PRESIDING OfrFICER
 The question now is on
 postponincruntil tormori ow the motion
 to print the President s
 messace Mr CLINGMAN 1 do
 not wish to lose the
 I do not desire to
 press myself on the Sen
 floor ate now 1 know
 the Senator from California desires
 to speak to morrow and
 I will give way to
 him but I hope there
 will be no objection to
 my occupying the floor on
 Monday at one o clock
 if i give way now
 Certainly not The motion to
 postpone was agreed to Mr
 CRITTENDEN Mr President 1 only
 wish to say a word
 or two in reply to
 my friend from Illinois The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator from
 Kentucky will allow the Chair
 a moment The Chair has
 not yet put the question
 to the Senate whether they
 will postpone the other or
 ders for the purpose of
 disposing of this bill There
 is another prior order to
 be disposed of Mr G
 WIN Letit be passed over
 informally It can be taken
 up when the bill is
 through The PRESIDING OFFICER That
 will be considered as the
 sense of the Senate unless
 ob jected to of Kentucky
 and he has the warin
 sympathies of by the committcc
 of the House of Representa
 both the venerable and the
 youthflil Senators from tives which
 is with the bill I
 havo stated sub Kentucky and
 they have made such representa
 stantially the facts however and
 thought it un tions to
 me not as have convinced
 my judgrnent necessary to call
 for the reading of the
 report I shall put it
 on the same i but
 curried my heart MG BAKER
 Allow me to ask the
 Senator ground that I should
 the case of an old
 man beg from Kentucky a
 question I see that it
 is a re ging for
 the pardon of his son
 who had been be plevin
 bond Is it according to
 the practice of trayed into
 crime except that in this
 case the con sequences of
 his iniquity if you insist
 upon this your State to
 take a recognizance or a
 bail bond Mr CRITTENDEN The
 had bond will be visited
 upon the head of the
 old man I sued upon
 the forfeited recoo nizance and
 the instead of the offender
 Therefore though I con property
 taken was replevied fess as
 a general principle it cannot
 be defénded MI BAKER There
 i s no foundation for
 the 1 shall put it
 as an exceptional case and
 give it debt as I
 understand it except the obligation
 of my vote and hope
 the Senate will pass it
 securityship on the criminal prosecution
 Mr POWELL 1 will the
 Governor of Kentucky has written
 a letter which is with
 thc papers in which he
 states that he has exam
 ined the whole case and
 were it within his juris
 I dict ion he would
 remit the whole of the
 fine I will further state
 that this old gentleman has
 paid i all the costs
 which were quite heavy Mr
 WADE I was on the
 committee that re l ported
 this bill and looked into
 this case a little Perhaps
 upon strict rigid leanl grounds
 we could not release this
 obligation but sir it is
 an ad I dress to
 the equity OF the Senate

 secure contracts and make provision
 for the safe certain and
 more speedy transportation by rail
 road of mails troops munitions
 of war military and nivai

 and those of the Pacific
 and for other purposes the
 pending question being on Concurri1P
 in the amendment made as
 in Committee of the Wholé
 in section four line forty
 seven after the word _States
 to insert And no mortgage
 or construction bonds shall cvcr
 be is sued Eby said
 company on said road or
 Inortgage or lien made in
 any way except to the
 United States Mr SIMMONS I
 would like to suggest to
 the Senator from Massachusetts to
 put in with out the
 consent of Congress I think
 that would improve it Let
 them make no lien or
 mortgage without the consent of
 Congress Mr WILSON 1 will
 say to the Rhode Island
 that I have reflected upon
 that point somewhat and I
 fear that if that should
 be Inserted Congress would be
 overrun with persons asking our
 consent to enable them to
 make such If it is
 to be amended if the
 Senate a mortgage believes that
 it ought not to stand
 in the form in which
 it is think that instead
 of bringing it to Congress
 it should provide that no
 mortgage shall be made without
 the consent of a majority
 of the stockholders in number
 and amount so that the
 matter will be after all
 in the hands of the
 masses of the stockholders I
 will move that amendment if
 nobody else will My object
 is not to put an
 in surmountable obstacle in the
 way of negotiating loans I
 believe a majority of the
 stockholders themselves would agree to
 a loan if it was
 neccs sary Mr CHANDLER The
 action of the board of
 directors is the action of
 the stockholders be cause the
 directors represent them and the
 lil cct ors are renewed
 from ycat to year The
 stock holders in this road
 will be scattered from Texas
 to Maine and from Catiförnia
 to New York almost a
 prohibition to re qui re
 it to be submitted to
 the stockholders themselves It seems
 to mc that this would
 be a useless obstacle in
 the way of negotiations I
 think the proposition had better
 be rejected fin I think
 a proviso of this kind
 wili bc u futa obstacle
 to the building of the
 road Mr SIMMONS i hope
 this proposition wiil not be
 rejected I do not want
 to havö a propo sition
 there that will embarrass the
 road at all What I
 desire is either that the
 consent of Con gress shall
 be had authorizing the issue
 of bonds and the giving
 of a mortgage 01 that
 a certain amount if money
 shall be actually paid in
 and expended by the stockholders
 on he road bcforc they
 can make a mortga ye
 At least clear money should
 be paid in and expended
 on this road before they
 should be allowed to make
 any cc Mr CHANDLER If
 the Senator will accept a
 proposition t bat twenty or
 thirty millions of their money
 shall be expended first will
 move it Mr SIMMONS Then
 propose that no loan shall
 be made by the directors
 of this company and secured
 by rnortgage on the road
 unless of private subscriptions of
 the stock have been actually
 paid in and expended on
 the road and then I
 vill agree to let them
 borrow Mr WILSON on each
 line Mr SIMLVIOLNS Yes on
 any one road If there
 are three to be built
 make that provision for all
 and then we have some
 security for the money we
 lend them The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question is on the
 amendrnent of the Senator from
 Califor nia to thc ameodment
 Mr SIMMONS I suppose the
 Senator from lassachusetts will accept
 the amendment I oftZ k
 Mr WILSON Certainly want the
 money paid in PRESIDINGOFFiCER Theamcndment
 of the Senator from California
 is to add to the
 ammodment made in Committee of

 Mr CHANDLER it should be

 per mile on each side
 of said railway line as
 said company may adopt to
 the Pfl cifie shore at

 to insert in lieu thereof
 the words l o the
 western termination of said road

 sections of land per mile
 on each side of such
 railroad line as said company
 may adopt from Lake Superior
 to the western border of
 Minnesota and from thence to
 the amount o ten alternate
 sections per mile on each
 side of such railway line
 as said company may adopt
 to the western termination of
 said road The amendment was
 agreed to The next amendment
 was in the next section
 of the amendment to strike
 out the words San Francisco
 and to insert Puget Sound
 and so that it will
 read Portland Oregon That whenever
 said company undertaking to construct
 said railway from Lake Superior
 to P uuet Sound and
 Port land Oregon shalt have
 fifty miles of said railroad
 and telegraph line ready for
 the service contemplated Ec The
 amendment v as agreed to
 fllhe amendments were ordered to
 be engrossed and the bill
 to be read a third
 time It was read the
 third time Mr WILSON I
 ask for the yeas and
 nays on the final passage
 of the bilL Ithe yeas
 and nays were ordered The
 Secretary proceeded to call the
 roll on the passage of
 the bill Mr BIGLER Mr
 President 1 desire to be
 indulged in a single remark
 before casting my vote on
 this bill It is well
 known that I have favored
 the construction of a railroad
 to the Pa cific am
 now in favor of any
 reasonable measure to accomplish that
 end but under all the
 circum stances and in the
 condition of the country cannot
 vote for a bill conternplating
 the construc tion of three
 roads I therefore vote in
 the nega tive Mr TEN
 EYCK Ido not know that
 it is usual but I
 ask to be excused from
 voting I am in favor
 as I have already said
 ofa Pacific rail road but
 I think it is improper
 to pass a bill to
 pledge the aid of the
 Governmerit to the construc lion
 of three roads Nor do
 i wish to have the
 appearance of avoiding voting upon
 it I there fore ask
 to be excused from votin
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 wish simply
 to say that I am
 in favor of one railroad
 to t he Pacific and
 am ready to vote for
 it at any time that
 a reason able bill can
 be presented I am not
 in favor at the present
 time of the Government engaging
 in the construction of two
 or thvee roads 1 think
 it is more than the
 Government can undertake in the
 present position of things and
 more than it ought to
 undertake consequently I shall vote
 in the negative Mr SEBASTIAN
 1 beg leave to say
 in explanation of my vote
 in favor of thc passaÜe
 of this bill that I
 do so in compliance with
 in structlons from the Legislature
 of rny State to which
 I always yield a respectful
 obedience Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 As I do not expect
 any appropriation to be rnade
 hereafter for the southern road
 and I do expect the
 northern road to be built
 I think there is good
 ground for changing my vote
 for the passage of the
 bill but as I am
 instructed by my Legislature to
 vote for the bill I
 shall vote for it simply
 for that reason E and
 no other Mr RICE I
 le is to do so

 The PRESIDINGOFFICER The Senator from

 proceed to the consideration of
 executive business Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas There a good many
 nominations that ought to be
 disposed of I know of
 at least one of importance
 that ought to bc referred
 promptly Mr GREEN The motion
 is not debatable Mr GREEN
 I move to take up

 say that I think yve
 can get through provide a
 temporary government for the Terrie
 with this bill in half
 an hour and there will
 be tory of Jefferson merely
 for the purpose of mak
 ing it a special order
 The motion was agreed to
 Mr GREEN There is a
 special order for to morrow
 private bills will come up
 on Friday perhaps the Senate
 will not sit on Saturday
 there IS a special order
 for Monday and therefore move
 to make this bill the
 special order for Tues day
 at one o clock Mr
 COLLAMER and Mr WILSON Why
 not go on with it
 now Mr GREEN If the
 Senate will indulge me five
 minutes I think they will
 take it up now Mr

 of Colorado is now before

 Committee of the Whole Several
 SENATORS That is not it
 Mr GREEN That was the
 way it was re ported
 last session This session seve
 agreed to change the name
 to Tefferson Now there is
 an intention to move a
 different name I care notll
 ing about the name Mr
 COLLAMER Will the gentleman allow
 me to move that change
 now Mr GREEN I wish
 to propose a substitute I
 offer what I hold In
 my hand as a to
 the bill substitute because I
 think it is more simple
 and I have made some
 little changes one in the
 boun dary and one in
 a clause which I will
 name to theSenate so that
 they may understand it Ilhis
 when admitted change is to
 strike out the words as
 a State they may come
 in with or without slavery
 Mr COLLAMER In all other
 respects is it I the
 same Mr GREEN I think
 it is but it may
 be read I think it
 ought to be read for
 and compared we ought to
 legislate understandingly I send to
 the Chair a substitute for
 the whole bill Mr COLLAMER
 1 desire to amend that
 substitute merely in the name
 I move at the no
 diffculty then in going into

 The question is on the
 motion of the Senator from
 Arkansas The motion was not

 the Senator from Missouri and
 upon that question the yeas

 sorry that any motion was
 If it had been Idaho
 made to change the name
 originally perhaps I should never
 have objected to it l
 hat is said to be
 an Indian word and to
 have a signification gem of

 believe it is an Indian
 word It is a corrup
 tion No Indian tribe in
 this nation has that word
 in Iny opinion Mr COLLAMER
 Ido Indian Mr LANE It
 is a corruption certainly a
 counterfOit and ought not to
 be adopted I vote nay

 OFFICER The question is on
 adopting the amendment as a
 substitute for the bill Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 should like to
 inquire if the substitute will
 be open to amendment after
 it has been adopted Mr
 GREEN It will in the
 Senate Mr DOUGLAS But not
 in committee Mr TRUMBULL It
 will in the Senate 1
 understand Mr GREEN Certainly Mr
 TRUMBULL If that is so
 1 will not obiect The
 amendment was agreed to The
 bill wasreported to the Senate
 as amended Mr TRUMBULL Ido
 not know that 1 have
 any objection to this bill
 but it seems to me
 we ought at least to
 have it read I have
 been try to get a
 copy of it and have
 sent twice for It If
 Vit is printed i am
 unable to get it Mr
 GREEN It has been read
 Mr TRUMBULL 1 should like
 to inquire if it is
 the same as the printed
 bill Mr GREEN It is
 not The boundaries were changed
 the name has been changed
 and there has been one
 proviso stricken out it can
 be read if the Senator
 wishes to hear it M
 TRUMBULL 1 do not wish
 to take up tim in
 asking it to be read
 at the Secretary s ta
 e I should like to
 see it It is a
 very im rtant bill and
 it seems to me is
 receiving very ttle consideration Mr
 DOUGLAS Mr President 1 will
 call e attention of the
 Senator from Missouri to a
 provision here that strikes me
 as being peculiar It is
 among the powers of the
 Legislature Nor shall any discrimination
 Me made in taxing different
 kinds of property I think
 it We all see what
 that is aiming at will
 be attended with consequences very
 incon I have never known
 of any legislature venient of
 any civilized country that would
 not discrim inate In taxation
 between different kinds of prop
 erty Usually property for schools
 and edu cational purposes and
 charitable purposes is exempted from
 taxation It is usual to
 exempt mechanics tools libraries cemeteries
 and various kinds of property
 from taxation Here is a
 pro vision that there shall
 be no discrimination and It
 strikes me it is that
 all must be taxed alike
 I do not think it
 is founded upon very peculiar
 principles of justice or upon
 sound public policy if these
 people are capable of self
 government and capable of levying
 taxes on property to sup
 port their government I presume
 they are just as capable
 of discriminating on those subjects
 as théy would be if
 they lived in a State
 I do not know why
 they should not be I
 suppose they were capable of
 self gove rnment before they
 went there and if they
 were I do not know
 why they are less so
 when they get there I
 am willing to have no
 provision on this subject but
 this is a peculiar provision
 that is introduced in the
 bill I only call attention
 to it No argument is
 made about it Mr GREEN
 The Senator misconstrues the provision
 Nearly every State constitution has
 a similar provision that all
 property subject to taxation shall
 be taxed in proportion to
 its value but that does
 not say what sort of
 property shall be subject to
 taxation You may tax one
 kind of property or one
 person s property Mr COLLAMER
 Let thatprovision be read Mr
 DOUGLAS 1 will call for
 the of the wholc sixth
 section and then the Senate
 will observe the bearing of
 it The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 sixth sec tion will be
 read The Secretary read it
 Mr GREEN My recollection is
 that that provision was in
 the Kansas Nebraska bill and
 I think this is copied
 from that It does not
 mean what the Senator from
 Illinois imagines All States say
 that property subject to taxation
 must be taxed according to
 its value This is intended
 to make no discrimination between
 different kinds of property You
 may exempt your school houses
 you may exempt various other
 pro_perty but whatever property is
 subjected to taxation must be
 taxed alike That is all
 it means Mr DOUGLAS 1
 think the Senator is mis
 taken in supposing that this
 was copied from the If
 it was I should not
 Kansas Nebraska bill have deemed
 it necessary to call the
 attention of the Senatc to
 it because it would not
 have been I think he
 will find that an unusual
 provision there are two provisions
 here that are not to
 be found in any other
 territorial bill One is nor
 shall any law be passed
 impairing the rights of private
 property and the other nor
 shall any discrimmation be made
 in taxing different kinds of
 property think he will find
 that these pro visions are
 peculiar and now proposed to
 be in troduced into the
 territorial system for the first
 time As to the first
 provision nor shall any law
 be passed impairing the rights
 of private prop I suppose
 there is no objection to
 it but I I Fßesume
 any court see no necessity
 for it would declare void
 a law impairing the rights
 of private property but it
 is to have a peculiar
 sW nificance from the connection
 that it has here We
 all see what it is
 aimed at I merely call
 attention to it and let
 the Senate vote upon it
 I have m own o
 inions on the question Mr
 REEN If anybody thinks that
 pro vision is w rong
 he may vote against it
 If any one wishes to
 invest them with authority to
 im I pair the rights
 of property let him move
 to strike THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
 PUBLISHED BY JOHN C RIVES
 WASHINGTON D C THIRTY SIXTH
 CONGRESS 20 SESSION it out
 and if the Senator from
 Illinois desires that he ought
 to vote against it For
 myself I think it just
 and proper The last clause
 I think was copied from
 his own bill with this
 additional pro vision The latter
 one to which he has
 called the attention of the
 Senate in my opinion is
 copied from his bill but
 I shall not be positive
 about it until the bill
 is brought here I have
 sent to the Library for
 it Mr DOUGLAS The answer
 of the Senator from Missouri
 it strikes rne does not
 meet the If anybody vant
 s to vote against such
 a point clause the Senator
 says let him move to
 strike it out I suppose
 that is a liberty we
 have on every provision but
 it is unusual to put
 it in I do not
 suppose you have got a
 limitation in the bill that
 there shall be no law
 passed impairing the obliga tion
 of contracts and still you
 might say if any body
 wanted to vote for such
 a provision let him vote
 against the bill There is
 no provision in the bill
 that there shall not be
 an established Church There is
 no provision that trial by
 jury shall pre vail There
 are a great many omissions
 to put in provisions on
 matters which the Constitution itself
 would regulate if they were
 not inserted I sup pose
 these words Nor shall any
 law be paséed Impairing the
 rights of private property have
 peculiar reference to some matters
 of dispute in do not
 party politics as to territorial
 power hold that a Territorial
 Legislature can impair any rights
 of property at all The
 question is what provisions do
 impair rights of property anci
 what the rights of property
 are What are rights of
 property I suppose the Constitution
 will protect I shall not
 object to those words for
 I think the courts would
 give them a reasonable construc
 tion the same construction I
 now give and I have
 no objection to that But
 when you come to the
 provision that they shall not
 discriminate in taxa ation in
 different kinds of property it
 is saying that all kinds
 of property shall bc taxed
 at the same rate and
 that there shall be no
 exemption from taxation of any
 description of property I do
 not know a legislative body
 in the world that does
 not discriminate Every one of
 the States discriminates they put
 low taxes upon some arti
 cles high taxes upon others
 and none at all upon
 others If that is a
 correct system in the States
 I 10 not know why
 we should not leave the
 Territo ries free to adopt
 it It strikes me that
 there are palpable necessities for
 it There are descriptions of
 property that require encouragement and
 that I should be 10th
 to sec the States do
 encouracrc them compelled to tax
 the property belonging to agricultural
 societies the fair grounds for
 in stance at the same
 ratc as other property I
 should be sorry to compel
 them to tax cemeteries churches
 school houses and school books
 at the same rate as
 other property But here you
 com pel them to say
 that all these shall be
 taxed and that asylums for
 the insane and for the
 unfortu nate shall be taxed
 that mechanics tools shall be
 taxed that these descriptions of
 property shall all be taxed
 the same as property m
 land and ill town lots
 the same as property ill
 ardent spirits and in other
 articles that we might think
 It not I think we
 ought to leave a wise
 to encourage Wisc and just
 discretion in every legislative body
 to discriminate between t he
 various kinds of prop erty
 I have always held that
 opinion These I merely call
 the attention of the are
 my ideas Senate to the
 matter Mr WILSON Mr President
 Mr COLLAMER I inquire vhat
 is the question 1 Mr
 MT i LSON I propose
 to make one propose to
 strike out all of the
 sixth section after the word
 residents in the ninth line
 Ido not see the necessity
 of having those words there
 I agree with the Senator
 from Illinois in regard to
 them I think thev are
 liable to misconstruction The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The words proposed to
 be stricken out will be
 read The Secretary read as
 follows Nor shall any law
 be passed ixnpairinc the rights
 of pri vate property nor
 shall any discrnnination be made
 in 41 FRIDAY FEBRUARY 1
 1861 taxing different kinds of
 property but all taxation shall
 bc in proportion to the
 value of the property taxed
 Mr DOUGLAS If those words
 be stricken out it will
 stand as the Kansas and
 Nebraska bill stood That section
 in the Kansas Nebraska bill
 stopped at the word residents
 By striking out this clause
 we leave it in the
 same words precisely and in
 that respect there was nothing
 peculiar in the Kansas Nebraska
 bill It was according to
 the acts of 1850 and
 the acts that preceded those
 of 1850 from the foundation
 of the Government Mr GREEN
 1 the design of the
 Senator from Illinois It is
 to introduce a subject of
 con troversy when there is
 no occasion for it Are
 these provisions right or are
 they wrong in the judgment
 of the Senate If they
 are wrong they should be
 stricken out if they arc
 right they should be retained
 Is there a Senator here
 who will say they are
 wrong Ouerllt the legislative power
 ofa Territory to be invested
 with author lty to impair
 the rights of private property
 I do not say what
 is property Ido not say
 that a slave is property
 in the Territory I do
 not touch the question of
 slavery in any respect whatever
 I purposely left it out
 to avoid controversy and I
 am sorry to see it
 introduced unadvisedly when llhe latter
 provision there is no occasion
 for it I am satisfied
 copied either from the Kansas
 Nebraska bill or some other
 territorial law on the I
 mean the clause prohibiting dis
 statute book crimination in the
 taxation of different kinds of
 property It simply establishes a
 rule that they shall not
 tax A at fifty per
 cent and B at one
 per but that property shall
 be taxed according cent to
 its value whether it be
 a mule a horse or
 real cstatc the ad valorcm
 system not per capita on
 the head nor does it
 prohibit them from having a
 cap itation tax it leaves
 them to assess that It
 sim ply says property shall
 be taxed alike but it
 docs not say all property
 shall be taxed it does
 not say school books shall
 be taxed it does not
 say school houses shall be
 taxed it does not say
 churches shall be taxed it
 does not say public property
 shall be taxed but it
 says that whatever property is
 taxed shall be taxed alike
 and there shall be no
 discrimination The same provision is
 in the constitution of the
 Slate of Missouri and yet
 we exempt churches for we
 are a church goincr people
 we exemptschool houses because we
 love learning and feel the
 need of it we exempt
 pub lic libraries because we
 Wish to encouracre read ing
 A provision is in the
 constitution of Mis souri that
 all property shall be taxed
 in proportion to its value
 no discriminations being rnade and
 yet wc make these exceptions
 Now sir if I had
 introduced ma clause saying they
 should protect slaves I should
 have expected controversy but when
 I have sirnply proposed a
 provision which secures the people
 and the whole people who
 may settle there in the
 enjoyment of their it seems
 to me that iL ought
 to l ss without uny
 controversy While 1 am up
 I will name another change
 which I have made to
 which I will call the
 atten I have struck tion
 of the Senator from Illinois
 out that proviso wphich says
 that wrhen admitted as a
 State they shall be admitted
 with or without slavery as
 their constitution at the time
 may NEW SERIES NO 41
 tice in the taxation of
 property and in tbc exer
 cise of the powers of
 the Territory If that be
 wrong then the provision should
 be stricken out Mc DOUGLAS
 It is entirely gratuitous on
 the part of the Senator
 from Missouri to talk about
 my having a design when
 simply called attention to an
 unusual provision in a territorial
 I do not know that
 I should have deemed that
 necessary but for the fact
 that he had stated that
 the bill was in the
 usual form and lan uage
 I happened by accident to
 let my eye fall upon
 two very unusual provisions that
 are not to be found
 in other bills and I
 thought it was due in
 fairness to call the attention
 of the Senate to those
 provisions and let them judge
 of them 1 did not
 intend to make any point
 upon the sub ject except
 that it might control my
 vote not object to the
 one that he argues about
 impair ing the rights of
 private property for I have
 no idea that a Territorial
 Legislature has any such power
 whether you thus restrict them
 or not but did call
 especial attention to the provision
 that they shall not discriminate
 between different kinds of property
 in taxation Now the Sena
 tor asks vv hether or
 not anybody objects to that
 provision that they shall not
 discriminate re peat there is
 nota legislative body on earth
 under the direction of Christian
 people so far as I
 know that does not discriminate
 Mr GREEN If the Senator
 will allow me for I
 do not desire to consume
 any time in reply I
 will read from the Washington
 territorial bill SEC 6 und
 be it further enacted That
 the legislative power of the

 Congress Mr DOUGLAS The Senator
 bas found in the whole
 range of territorial organization one
 instance of the kind The
 general rule is the other
 way I called attention to
 it because it was a
 de parturc frorn the general
 rule on that subject I
 I have shown that think
 an unwise departure I take
 that to be a truism
 too I take in a
 large class of cases it
 is usual in the States
 prescribe that to be a
 constitutional thing too and yet
 hc for wise purposes to
 discriminate between differ ent kinds
 of properly deemed it important
 to put that into the
 Kansas It it be a
 constitutionui right and T hc
 Senator has now in troduccd
 the subjcct of Nebraska bill
 the slavcry question and says
 that we want to in
 accordance with the practice of
 the Govern I propose to
 leave ment why put that
 in Tho question may be
 discriminate on that subject that
 so far as the power
 of taxation is concerned asked
 why strike it out I
 will tell you to avoid
 controversy Everybody knows that this
 is not where I leave
 every other kind of property
 but I must be permitted
 to tell that Sonator that
 in a a country adapted
 to slavery as perruanent in
 discrimination on that question if
 the Territorial stitution Everybody knows
 there never will bc Hence
 I deemed it unnecessary to
 Legislature saw fit to make
 it it would follow the

 nearly every slaveholding State in

 not every one It is
 not usual in Dhc provisions

 unnecessarily sen cordino to the

 there is that discrimination E
 le supposed that wras sitive
 on the subject striking at
 sorne peculiar dogma of hig

 sitnply to establish a rule

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 642 January

 one of the questions some
 times raised between eastern and
 western Vir ginia In North
 Carolina slave property is com
 It is not taxed parati
 vely exempt from taxation accordino
 to the same rule and
 the same manner as other
 property and the question of
 ad calorem that divided that
 State last year involved this
 very principle The Senator from
 Missouri is now zncorporating into
 this territorial bill the very
 principle that a majority of
 the people of North Carolina
 repudiated in the contest that
 took place last August in
 that State I understand this
 same discrimmation between slave property
 and other property is made
 in nearly évery slaveholding State
 if not in every one
 and now we are told
 that the Territories may not
 make that discrimi nation which
 the slaveholding States themselves make
 for the benefit ot that
 institution I föél no interest
 in this question I merely
 call attention to it to
 show that it is a
 departure from the pk inciples
 of legislation both in the
 frec States and the slaveholding
 States a restriction R vhieh
 neither class of States imposes
 upon their If the Senate
 then choosc to put this
 lature restriction on the power
 ot the Ilerrilorial Legis lature
 let it done Mr GREEN
 I undcrstand it is the
 part of the acre to
 procyress to improvc as we
 advance On the original territorial
 bills perhaps such a provision
 was not found but the
 Senator from Illinois while chairman
 of that committee made rapid
 strides and he was the
 first to introduce that identical
 provision I ask the Secretary
 to read the provision in
 the bill making distinctions between
 different kinds of property The
 Secretary read as follows Nor
 shall any law be passed
 nnpairing tho rights of pri
 vate property nor shall any
 discrimination bo naade in taxing
 different kinds of property Mr
 GREEN Now here in the
 Oregon bill is this provision
 SEC 6 nnd be it
 further enacted That the Legislative
 power of the Lten itocy

 not iljconsistent with the Constitution

 Statutes at I llirty Se
 eot1d Congress in the title
 second session p 175 In
 the Washington That is in
 the Oregon bill territorial bill
 there is the same provision
 which I read and the
 satnc principle precisely which is
 in this bill now and
 to which the Senator takes
 exception I followe l the
 Wisc example of my predecessor
 and if it be wrong
 now the tutor is I
 hold the prin to be
 l tamed and not the
 pupil It is in our
 State con ciple to be
 right and just that point
 was unnecessary for it was
 not dc was passed in
 1848 and no exception was
 taken to that provision signed
 as he will see by
 comparing it with his own
 bills to introduce any subject
 of controversy t Mr DOUGLAS
 I stated at the timé
 nthat it I can say
 on my honor it was
 not designed to xvas a
 House bill passed without being
 particu introduce any subject of
 controversy It was I larly
 scrutinized The question was not
 made But I do assert
 that every bill since 1850
 i copied from the Oregon
 bill and from the Wash
 It was designed simply to
 ington territorial bill carry out
 exactly the principles which the
 Senator had incorporated in those
 bills Mr DOUGLAS Thepledg eofthegentlcman
 s honor is abundantly suffcient
 do not impeach I had
 not attacked him nor attributed
 any it I think there
 is a better mode of
 design to him legislation than
 making a personal point on
 the consistency ofa Senator and
 talking about a de sign
 of a Senator when he
 calls the attention of the
 body to a peculiar provision
 in a bill Sup pose
 it was true that I
 wrote the Washington bill and
 that that provision was in
 it does that have anything
 to do with this question
 I do not charge the
 Senator with inconsistency Would that
 prove that this was wise
 lb so happens i did
 not write the Washington bill
 It so happens It sccnls
 that provision it was a
 House bill passed as we
 were about to pass this
 because we were told it
 is in the usual form
 These bills had not been
 so thoroughly matured and exam
 ined with regard to the
 powers of the Territorial Legislature
 until 1850 In that great
 controversy in which Mr Clay
 took the lead in this
 body there was substituted a
 new principle of legisla tion
 as applicable to the Territories
 in lieu of the geographical
 line that had been abandoned
 aml then the question arose
 specially as to what should
 be the powers of a
 Territorial Legislature From that time
 in every bill I havo
 written I have copied the
 compromise measures of 185 so
 far ns the powers of
 a Territorial Legislature were concerned
 The Kansas Nebraska bill I
 copied word word from those
 measures with the ex ception
 of the amondrncnt a flerwards
 in regard to the Missouri
 line which did not affect
 the terri torial powers any
 of these questions If thc
 Senate wish now to depart
 that prac tice and to
 put iR this provision f
 have no ob ever wrote
 or that originated in this
 body hag been upon this
 basis and that the only
 isolated Mr GREEN the Senator
 tell me wha t Territory
 has been organized since 1853
 Mr DOUGLAS I tell him
 I suppose Kansas has been
 organized I suppose Nebraska I
 las been organized since that
 time But I arh not
 referring tö precedents The Senator
 attributes to me a design
 because I point out an
 unusual provis ion In the
 territorial governments from the beginning
 of the Government down perhaps
 he I am willing the
 Senate can find two examples
 shall vote upon the question
 I take no interest in
 it only I want them
 to understand what they are
 on Mr GREEN Mr President
 1 do not like this
 way of the Senator taking
 the floor without my consent
 and without addi essing the
 Chair make that explanation in
 vindication of the propriety of
 retaining that provision in the
 bill becausc it is in
 accordance with usaoe and be
 cause it is just and
 proper in itself When the
 Senator said i had departed
 from the usual order put
 it in his own bill
 But he says he did
 not dråw the bill it
 had to undergo his supervision
 He l vas chair man
 of the Committee on Territories
 and it was his duty
 if it was not the
 duty of the Senate to
 read the whole bill to
 know what it contained know
 he generally dischm ges his
 duty and had a right
 to presume that hc did
 so in that instance Hence
 he is as much chargeable
 with undertak incr to make
 these discriminations and distinctions as
 arn But in point of
 fact he misapprehends the whole
 question when he says we
 cu mot discriminato in tyranting
 licenses for t he sale
 of spirituous liquors is a
 different question Taxation is one
 jection but I deny that
 it is a proper system
 of thing and the selling
 of a privilege to pursue
 a legislation that you shall
 not discrinlinate in tax I
 hold that it is proper
 that the people of vocation
 is another and an entirely
 different illing ation a Territory
 should put a Ilio her
 tax upon brandy You may
 tax a profession you may
 tax law yers whisky and
 other ardent spirits than they
 do and doctors you may
 tax retailers of spirits you
 upon school books or dry
 goods if they choose i
 may tax various other vocations
 in life consist It is
 proper for the people of
 a l errit ory to
 dis criminate with the view
 of improving agriculture and they
 may puta higher tax upon
 inferior breeds It is of
 cattle than they do upon
 blooded Cattie proper for Terntorial
 I Ntyislatures to exempt Importations
 of blooded stock with a
 view of im proving their
 breeds from taxation for a
 limited time It is proper
 to so exercise Lhe taxing
 power as to encouraee those
 branches of industry which arc
 for the good of the
 people and to the same
 extent restraining those that they
 believe arc not I hese
 are powers that a lte
 exercised by ail the States
 with reference to their local
 and dornestic I think it
 is a wise and just
 power to conccrrns be exercised
 in thc Territories There would
 be no difficulty on this
 question bu for slavery and
 in order to answer the
 objec on that point I
 have shown that in thc
 slave ti holdi lg States
 they make this same discrimma
 I do not believe there
 is a State in this
 tion Union frec or slave
 that does not make the
 iden tical discrimination that is
 authorized by this bill But
 I repeat I do not
 take interest enough in iL
 to occupy further the attention
 of tbc Senate thouo ht
 lt was proper without impeaching
 any gentleman s motive and
 without attributing any designs to
 call attention to it because
 it was not i a
 usual provision Mr GREEN one
 word only 1 hope the
 Sen Btltution whether it is
 in the constitution of Vir
 I do not intend to
 imitate a wrong ator does
 not suppose that I brought
 the subject ginia or not
 here in order to show
 any inconsistency in him simply
 because it may be fi
 und in the policy of
 had no such ob ect
 But when the Senator said
 it the State of Virginia
 I do not suppose that
 this provision will ever affect
 slavery in any manner was
 an unusua provision it became
 my duty to vindicate myself
 and thereföre referred to two
 whatever and when the Senator
 put it in the Washington
 bill and the Oregon bill
 it was not bills the
 Oregon bill and the Washington
 bill containin r exactly the
 same provisions But he to
 affect slavery but to protect
 the rights of the says
 the territorial question was discussed
 in 1850 people and not
 to exclude any species of
 prop t I erty by
 the law and Constitution gov
 L on the compromise measures
 and the great leader ernine
 the I erritory II is
 for that purpose to Mr
 Clay settled the great principlo
 upon which the Kansas Nebraska
 bilk was passed V cry
 well establish a rule of
 justice in taxation not to
 per mit an arbitrary power
 to build up one at
 the The Washington bill was
 passed iii 1853 and still
 That was after the ently
 with the principle which says
 whatever t_nopcrty is taxed must
 be taxed proportion to Its
 valuc I hat hos been
 determined by the Su preme
 Court that taxation is one
 thing and the selkinmof a
 privilege to pursne a vocation
 another and a different thing
 So it is in this
 ease They may put their
 licenses on tippling houses so
 high in the Territory of
 Idaho as to utterly exclude
 them notwitlistanding the existence of
 that pro vision but whatever
 property is klxed must be
 taxed according to its value
 That is the prin Oiple
 in the Oregon bill that
 is the principlc in the
 it is the principle of
 Washington territorial bill justice and
 ought to pervade the institutions
 of every State and every
 Territory If some States have
 departed from it that is
 no reason why we shall
 not detain should fi llow
 a bad example the Senate
 There is no rnotion to
 strike jt out I believe
 Mr DOUGLAS Yes there is
 As there is a mo
 Mr GREEN very well tion
 to strike out I shall
 rcsisl it aud shall con
 tend for following the example
 of the Washingtop bill and
 of the Oregon territorial bill
 Mr MASON Call for the
 yeas and nays on Mr
 GREEN The PRESIDING OFFICER Is
 the Senate ready for the
 question Mr MASON I ask
 for the yeas and nays
 The yeas and nays were
 ordered Mr FI I CH
 I hope the Secretary will
 read the proposed amendment Ido
 not know what it is
 The Secretary read it Mr
 RICE Is an amendment to
 the amend ment now in
 order The PRESIDING OFFICER Not
 after the yeas and nays
 have been ordered Mr DOUGLAS
 1 think it is as
 much in order after as
 before Mr RICE I think
 if the motion were changed
 so as to strike out
 all after the word property
 in the tenth line it
 would change the aspect of
 contains the same provision oxpense
 of another Hence I think
 the exccp tion or the
 at tention which the Senator
 called to compromise measures of
 1850 Oregon IJill II the
 vote that might be given
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 643
 Mr DOUGLAS 1 will suggest
 to the Sen ator from
 Massachusetts to strike out all
 after the word property in
 the tenth line instead of
 that which he has included
 in his motion The other
 portion is merely a judicial
 question Mr WILSON I make
 that modification Mr GREEN I
 will simply explain that the
 proposition as now made is
 to strike out the last
 clause which requires them to
 tax all property equally say
 that that is in the
 Washington it is in the
 Oregon bill it is just
 and proper and ought not
 to be stricken out The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The amend ment
 as modified will be read
 Ehe Secretary read it In
 line ten after the word
 property to strike out the
 followinff words Nor enall any
 discrimination be made in taxing
 differ ent kinds of property
 but all taxation shall be
 in propor Zion to the
 value of the property taxed
 Mr GREEN Now Mr President
 one word only Why should
 we permit them to tax
 prop erty not in proportion
 to its value The same
 provision is in all the
 new constitutions made 2n the
 most enlightened age The old
 constitu tions have overlooked it
 Whena necessity arose when favoritism
 was being indulged in it
 was found necessary to insert
 a provision like this in
 the fundamental law to prevent
 an accidental cor rupt Legislature
 from oppressing one class of
 peo plc for the benefit
 of another or themselves We
 ought to throw guards around
 the rights of the people
 and the property of the
 people and not permit a
 few who happen to be
 in office excr cising legislative
 power to make these discrim
 inations which will break down
 onc man to build Equality
 is the up another Make
 thern equal beauty of our
 institutions and when you onco
 turn the scale and destroy
 that principle of cqual ity
 the Government ceases to accomplish
 the great end for which
 it was instituted Mr DOUGLAS
 One word in reply Sen
 ator is now for equality
 Hc wants to havo every
 thing taxed alike yet he
 says under his pro vision
 they may exempt any property
 they have a mind to
 exempt but all they do
 tax is to be taxed
 alike What becomes of his
 beautiful equal ity They can
 leave out everything but slaves
 but must tax the slaves
 alike That is the way
 he applies the principle of
 equality You allow them to
 make a free list just
 as big as they please
 or just as littlc as
 they please but after making
 a free list big oi
 little the balance tnust bc
 taxed exactly alike That is
 his principle of equality Mr
 GREEN It is the ad
 tax is surprising the Senator
 does not understand that I
 say that under this provision
 it is cornpctent to exempt
 certain property belonging to religious
 associations and school houses because
 that is public property but
 whatever property is subject to
 taxation must be tuxed according
 to its value That is
 all Mr DOUGLAS Then according
 to his ex planation under
 his bilk the Territorial Legisla
 ture may exempt everything frorn
 taxation but negroes and then
 they must tax all slaves
 ad valorem whether they are
 under twelvc years of age
 or not That is the
 provision of the bill as
 he explains it Mr GREEN
 Under the Senator s Washing
 If mine is wrong ton
 bill the same thing exists
 he is guilty of setting
 the example Mr DOUGLAS Yes
 sir That explanation has been
 made before Mr FITCH It
 appears to mc this is
 simply an attempt to interject
 a little squatter sovereio nty
 into this bill is it
 not Mr DOUGLAS Yes sir
 and 1 want them all
 to have popular sovereignty Mr
 FITCH How else does this
 tion happen to be connected
 with a bill for the
 orcranization of a Territory where
 such a thing as a
 neæro in bondage probably never
 can be seen I that
 is all there is of
 the amendment of the It
 is more in regard per
 Senator from Illinois haps to
 the political bearing of the
 question than l as to
 its richt or wron ganization
 to the organization to which
 the Sen ator from Indiana
 and myself are both pledged
 by the compromise nrxeasures of
 1850 and the Kansas Nebraska
 bill Let us bring it
 back to I am not
 trying to introduce any new
 pro vision But sir i
 do not wish to introduce
 any politics on this subject
 I do not wish to
 revive the question touching slavery
 I only desire simply to
 leave the Territorial Legislature competent
 to discriminate as the States
 do if they sec fit
 Mr GREEN If this be
 a from the compromise measures
 of 1850 the Washington bill
 of 1853 was a departure
 Mr DOUGLAS 1 heard that
 six times Mr GREEN The
 Senator says he has heard
 that six times but he
 docs not seem to compre
 hend it Some minds are
 so dull when a thing
 conflicts with their feelings that
 they will not hear and
 when they do hear will
 not understan d repeat again
 it is no departure Iam
 introducing no new provision I
 am not sccking to innovate
 1 am only seeking to
 carry out a well recognized
 rule of taxation according to
 the value of the orop
 crty assessed I ought to
 make one other word of
 explanation When I said that
 this was in the usual
 form I remarked that I
 had shown the only cl
 anges made to the Senator
 from New York two weeks
 acro so that nobody should
 be surprised at them Mr
 HEMPHILL Is an amendment to
 the amendment in order The
 PRESIDING OFFICER TheChairwill hear it
 Mr HEMPHILL Let me hear
 the original amendment read The
 Secretary read it Mr HEMPHILL

 amendment to that and that
 250 of household and kitchen
 furniture and rnechanics tools and
 books of professional men shall
 be exeinpt from taxation Mr
 DOUGLAS That amendment will be
 in order when this clause
 is stricken out The PRESIDING

 an amendment to the amendment
 and then the question bc
 taken on striking out theamcndmcnt
 of coursc his amendment would
 be stricken out will thc
 original amehdment Mr HEMPHILL 1
 will not it now The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on the inotion of the
 Senator frotn Mussachu sctts to

 have been read The question

 So the amendment was rejected
 Mr HEMPHILL 1 offer as
 an amendment to insert at
 the cnd of the section
 thc following And that 250
 of household and kitchen furniture
 the tools of the Inechanic
 and the books of persons
 in any profUs sion be
 exernpt frotn taxation Mr DOOLITTLE
 1 will move to add
 as an amendrnctlt to the
 an lendment that any public
 houses erected for thc purpose
 of schools or for religious
 worship be also exempted Mr
 GREEN There no objection to
 that lature to leave these
 matters to them If they
 cannot legislate so as to
 promote their own inter I
 est why permit them to
 legislate at all If we
 are to go into these
 little matters we might as
 well do all the legislation
 for them at once I
 Mr HEMPHILL The provision which
 1 have offcrcd I know
 is inserted in the constitu
 I tion of Texas exempting
 household and kitchen furniture and
 I think m some other
 constitu tions where the taxation
 is ad valorcm as in
 that State Mr RICE That
 is a State matter and
 Con ffress has nothing to
 do with it Mr HEMPHILL
 This is the organic act
 of a Territory similar to
 the constitution of a State
 The amendment to thc amendment
 was agreed to and the
 question recurred on the amendment
 I as amended Mr PUGH
 I concur in what has
 been said by the Senator
 from Minnesota I think it
 is a very small business
 for us to bc interfering
 with the efcmptions from taxation
 in the Territories I he
 general proposition contained in the
 bill entirely approve establishing a
 general principle I for the
 equality of taxation and taxation
 accord incr to the true
 value of the property I
 regard that as a proper
 provision to be put in
 any funda mental law It
 is in the constitution of
 my State and I think
 it is the only just
 and proper rule of taxation
 but as to the particular
 exemptions of this or that
 article of properly it seems
 to me we i had
 better leave that to tho
 Territorial Legisla ture if we
 are going to have any
 Territorial Le gislature The Senator
 from Texas says that the
 constitution of his State contains
 a provision of this character
 That may be so but
 other con stitutions do not
 In rnost of the States
 these things are left to
 the wisdom of the Legislature
 from time to time It
 seems to me that we
 who are not the representatives
 of these people we who
 bour none of the burdens
 of their local taxa tion
 should at least bc very
 careful in dealing wi th
 thc subject matter of their
 revenue and therefore I rise
 to concur in tbc suggestion
 of my friend from Minnesota
 that this amendment ought to
 be defeated Let us stand
 upon the original bill which
 prescribes the fundamental principles which
 guve equality of taxation on
 all forms of p roperty
 Mr 13AYARD I am opposéd
 to thc amend ment because
 I think it is a
 useless interference with a inatter
 of purely local legislation think
 I the people of the
 I erritory can judge of
 the mat I ter a
 great deal better than ve
 can and I do not
 see any absolute neccssit y
 for it though it Inight
 I be that were I
 a citizen of the Territory
 should be in favor of
 exemptil g property to a
 greater i amount Perhaps I
 might carry the matter of
 ex cniption as regards the
 sale of property to a
 i greater extent than other
 gentlemen in this Cham ber
 but do not think it
 is appropriate for us to
 fetter a Territorial Legislature to
 that extent The only fetters
 I would underta ke to
 impose upon them would be
 general principles guarding arrainst any
 legislation which should affect the
 rights of the citizens of
 the States of this Union
 but as re gards their
 own local affairs their own
 purely local legislation as to
 whether they deem it ex
 pcdient to exempt certain property
 from taxation or not I
 think it is a matter
 which had better be left
 to themselves Mr DOUGLAS The
 Senator from Delaware is under
 a misapprehension in supposing that
 this amendment is to fetter
 the discretion of the Legis
 I suggest to the Senator
 to laturo I bc fettcr
 has already been imposed by
 Mr LATHAM refusing to vote
 for the amendment of the
 Senator houses ofa public nature
 for the benefit of schools
 from Massachusetts By that vote
 you have dc and churches
 Mr DOOLITTLE It was general
 in its terms that all
 houses for schools and for
 public religious worship be exempted
 Mr LATHAM verv well The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The amendment to
 the amendment will be read
 T lie Secretary read it
 as follows Insert at the
 6 and any public houses
 end of the amendment Mr
 DOÜGLAS I hat is not
 a just criticism erected for
 public schools public religious svor
 on the motion of the
 Senator from Massachu Mr RICE
 I have no objection to
 thesc amend setts to strike
 out this clause If we
 had attempted to insert new
 provisions it would have been
 a ments in themselves but
 it certainly seems to me
 that we should have confidence
 enough in the just criticism
 but the motion is to
 strike it out intelligeuce and
 honesty of the Territorial Legis
 so as to bring it
 back to the usual territorial
 or clared that they shall
 not exem pt mechanics tools
 that they shall not exempt
 the homestead from that they
 shall not exernpt schools and
 taxation churches and places of
 public worship that they shall
 not make any of thesc
 exemptions what ever of household
 furriiture or the necessaries of
 lite You have put on
 the fetter and declared that
 no such exern tion shall
 be made to 6bviate the
 hart bearino and injurious of
 that vote of the Senate
 the proposition is madc to
 say now they may do
 it to this extent The
 fetter is already imposed You
 must recon sider and strike
 out that restriction if you
 w ant to liberalize the
 bill and leave this matter
 to the discretion and wisdom
 of the people of the
 Terri 644 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 30 tory I hold
 that the ad calorem rule
 of taxation is correct but
 I hold that there must
 necessarily be exceptions to it
 and that those exceptions may
 be better left to the
 wisdom and virtue and discretion
 of the people to be
 affected by them than to
 the Congress of the United
 States Mr BAYARD I think
 that there is a fetter
 notwithstanding the remarks of the
 honorable If he will put
 the amendment in the Senator
 shape of an exception to
 the general principle which he
 objects to that is of
 leaving it at the discretion
 aft the Legislature as to
 whether they will or will
 not exempt this particular species
 of property so as to
 free them from the restriction
 which he supposes is embodied
 in the previous clause I
 have no objection to that
 but as I read the
 amendment it is mandatory they
 are com pelled to exempt
 these articles Mr DOUGLAS That
 is very true but you
 have already said in the
 bill that they shall not
 exempt any property My proposition
 is to leave the discretion
 Vith that people to exempt
 or not as they please
 The Senate has decided against
 that discretion the Senate has
 decided that this body is
 to determine what shall be
 the rule of taxation there
 and that there shall be
 no exemption from taxation no
 matter what the property may
 be and acting upon the
 principle that the Senate is
 to determine for these people
 instead of allowing them to
 determine for them Selves those
 favorable to exempting a homestead
 have proposed to put in
 that exemption very properly It
 would not be necessary to
 put in the amendment offered
 by the Senator from Texas
 if you were going to
 leave it discretionary with the
 people of the Territory Since
 you havc de prived them
 of all discretion if you
 vant them to have a
 homestead secure you must put
 in the exception Mr BAYARD
 I still cannot see the
 force of the honorable Senat
 or s argument I am
 in favor of general restrictions
 upon tlle grant of legisla
 tive powcrs to the people
 of a Territory on prin
 ciple but when you come
 to the question of de
 tall I am willing to
 leave the details to their
 discretion but not to make
 it mandatory upon them The
 amendment undertakes to with details
 and say they shali exempt
 from tax ation certain property
 That is a question of
 detail which I would rather
 Icavo to the local Le
 gislature though i arn not
 prepared to go to the
 extent of leaving them where
 they have no writ ten
 constitution us the States have
 unrestricted by any species of
 general principles Mr HEMPHILL 1
 think the provision con t
 ained in the bill requiring
 all property to bc as
 sesscd for taxation and for
 taxatton ad talorem has becn
 o enerally constrücd in constitutions
 and bills of this character
 to extend to ali property
 so as not to o
 ive the Legislature the power
 to ex crnpt any property
 frotn taxation and therefore in
 constitutions and in orryanic acts
 the rulc has been I
 think to make express cxception
 wherc the taxation by the
 ad talorcnn principle has been
 established if it is intended
 to allow any exemp tion
 For that reason I have
 oflt red an excep tion
 which I think is a
 very moderate one only exempts
 household and kitchen furliiture It
 might have tools of thc
 mechanic and so on been
 extended much further tions do
 provide that the Legislature shall
 have the power to except
 certain species of property from
 It seems to rne that
 these two provis taxation ions
 the one contained in the
 bill that there shall be
 a uniform system of taxation
 upon property and the exception
 which is proposed by the
 Sen ator from Texas in
 his amendment perfectly harmonize and
 harmonize with the constitutions of
 most of the States so
 far as I know Mr
 DOUGLAS I wish to move
 to amend the amendment of
 the gentleman from Texas as
 he has accepted the amendment
 of the Senator from Wisconsin
 providing only that the Legisla
 ture may exempt the homestead
 from taxation I and such
 other property as they wish
 to add shall think ought
 to be excepted Mr HEMPHILL
 1 will accept that also
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FOSTER
 in the chair That will
 be incorporated as apart of
 the amendment of the Senator
 from Texas Mr DOUGLAS Then
 as the amendment now stands
 taxes are to be ad
 calorem except that the Legislature
 may exempt from taxation such
 property as they may deem
 proper but all they do
 tax they must tax alike
 Mr DOOLITTLE Do 1 understand
 the Sen ator from Texas
 to accept that as an
 amendment I did accept it
 but I do Mr HEMPHILL
 not know that I ought
 to do so Mr DOOLITTLE
 1 object to that going
 in as part of the
 amendment Mr DOUGLAS 1 do
 not know what right the
 Senator from has to object
 to its in as a
 part of the amendment of
 the Sena tor from Texas
 Mr DOOLITTLDI I object to
 its going in as having
 been sanctioned by me I
 am morel y Mr DOUGLAS
 Of course getting the Senator
 from Texas to accept it
 The Senator from Wisconsin may
 vote as hc pleases after
 he has accepted it Mr
 HEMPHILL withdraw my acceptance Mr
 DOUGLAS Then i have something
 to say about it and
 I n ust object to
 the Senator s accepting the
 otbcr proposition His amendment having
 been amended by the vote
 of the Senate he has
 to accept an amendment to
 it un less by unanimous
 consent I interpose objection and
 I desire a vote upon
 it Now the question is
 whether you are going to
 prescribe the rule of tax
 ation for that people in
 their local affairs or will
 allow them prescribc it for
 themselves Mr CRYIVI ENDEIN Let
 them do it in their
 own way Mr DOUGLAS That
 is precisely what I am
 I agree with tlte venerable
 Senator from for Kentucky that
 they ought to do it
 in their own way r
 l hc Senator from Wisconsin
 is mistaken in supposin r
 it is a rule of
 taxation throughout this country that
 all taxes shall be according
 to thc value of thc
 property It is so in
 his State but Wisconsin is
 not the v hole world
 it is not I have
 shown that in nearly the
 entire Union cvcry State of
 this Union if not in
 every one there are exceptions
 there are exemptions and not
 only is particular property exempted
 from t axation but t
 herc are differcnt rules of
 taxation I for different kinds
 of property I have shown
 that in Virginia slaves under
 a certain age tw eive
 domestic and ocal institutions why
 give them a It is
 no argument to say that
 government at all in some
 States the rule of taxation
 ad catoo em has been
 adopted for it was adopted
 by the people I am
 willing to let the people
 of he I themselves Territory
 adopt the ad caloretn system
 if they I should be
 for the ad talorcan system
 prefer it with some slight
 exceptions I think it is
 a just Inasmuch however us
 this is a matter system
 affecting their pockets and not
 mine taxing their own property
 and not mine I am
 willing that they shall prescribe
 the rule instead of niy
 pre I know of no
 purpose for scribincy it Tor
 them which a territorial government
 is to be granted legislative
 power if you are not
 goiD2 to allow them to
 say whether their people shall
 be taxed or not and
 how much and in what
 manner Mr GRIMES This bill
 1 understand pro poses a
 territorial government for a remote
 Ter ritory some three thousand
 miles away from us A
 part of that Territory is
 an agricultural coun try a
 part of it is a
 mineral country and we men
 who have not been selected
 for this purpose as I
 apprehend for such a thing
 never was attempted to be
 incorporated into any territorial organization
 before we are sitting herc
 and gravely attempt ing to
 determine for the people of
 that remote r I erritm
 y three thousand miles away
 without knowing anything about the
 resources or reocrra phy ofthe
 country the method in which
 tlléy shall levy their taxes
 Now I undertake to say
 thai the Senator from Wisconsin
 is most egregiously mistaken when
 he says that in all
 the territorial bills before this
 or in many of them
 or indeed in any of
 them there have been any
 exceptions of this kind such
 as have been submitted by
 him I happen to and
 by the Senator from Tc
 kas have lived in three
 Territories Mr DOOLITTLE think the
 Senator from referred to the
 con Iowa misunderstood me stitutions
 of several States which contain
 this pro vision for uniform
 taxation and allowed the Le
 gislature the power to except
 certain species of property from
 taxation as school houses and
 rchcs Mr GRIMES 1 understood
 the Senator to include in
 his remarks not only t
 be States that had constit
 nt ions but the Territories
 that had or ganic laws
 and to speak of those
 organic laws as being tho
 constitutions of the Eerritories very
 well aware that no such
 exceptions have i know that
 the people of I hitherto
 been made the Territories are
 better able to judge as
 to the method in which
 their taxes should be laid
 and collected than we are
 here and I think that
 this therefore matter had better
 be left to them trust
 that the whole amendment which
 has been proposed by the
 Senator from Wisconsin and the
 Senator from Texas will be
 voted down and that we
 shall let the bill stand
 in this respect as it
 came from the committee We
 are not in a condiLion
 to determine this question so
 well as the people of
 the Terri tories Mr DOOLITTLE
 I suggest to the Senator
 I years I think arc
 exennpt and over that age
 are from Texas to amend
 his proposition so as to
 not taxed like other property
 In North Caro lina slaves
 under twelve years arc excqnpt
 and say that the Legislature
 of the Territory shall perhaps
 those over sixty are cxcmpt
 and be have power to
 exempt these articles tween thosc
 acres they are not taxed
 in the smne Mr HEMPHILL
 1 will accept that Mr
 DOOLITTLE And then allow me
 to say ratio as other
 property So it is in
 nearly every I have reasol
 l to know that in
 sonac one word I understand
 that we now in sub
 othcr State stance are forming
 the organic act for the
 people States slaves are taxed
 as persons and in others
 they are taxed as property
 in some pro rata and
 of this Territory which is
 to them a constitution They
 have not tormed any constitution
 we arc in some per
 capit a So it is
 with other kinds of it
 for them I am unwilling
 that the I property constitution
 which is to control the
 legislation of Now the simple
 question is will you allow
 the Tl errit ory shall
 give unlimited power to the
 the people of the Territory
 to tax themselves or Legislature
 We want constitutions for the
 pur I I do not
 know will you impose taxcs
 on them pose of binding
 the power of Legislatures and
 what you are going to
 give them a government not
 giving them unlimited discretion Therefore
 for if you are not
 going to allow them to
 prescribe it is that in
 the constitution of every State
 so their own taxation If
 there is any system of
 far as 1 know in
 this country there is a
 provis legislation Lhut affects the
 rights and feelings and ion
 which requires that property shall
 be sub excites the jealousics
 of any community on earth
 jectcd to a uniform system
 of taxation and that II
 more than all otilers it
 is the rate of taxation
 and the Legislature shall not
 have the discretionary the system
 of taxation and if the
 people of a power to
 tax this property or the
 other property Territory arc not
 capable of prescribing their own
 system of taxation for the
 support of their own at
 its pleasure At the same
 time those constitu Mr GREEN
 1 hope we shall take
 the vote I do not
 think it needs and get
 this bill through any further
 explanation I lie amei drnent
 was rejected Mr HALE I
 move that the Senate adjourn
 Mr GREEN 1 hope not
 The bill can be through
 in ten minutes The motion
 was not agreed to Mr
 DOUGLAS 1 dislike to prolong
 this de bate but I
 must call the attention of
 the Senate to the injustice
 which is being done these
 people by these restrictions in
 order to confirtn whut has
 been said by thc Senator
 froin Iowa Now what is
 to be taxed in this
 Territory of Jefferson or Idaho
 or whatever you call it
 r i he mines under
 the bill as it now
 stands cannot be taxed at
 all All mines are public
 property belongino to the United
 States and all your mining
 opera tions arc conducted on
 that public property The large
 m ners that go and
 erect their machinery for the
 purpose of grinding out quartz
 pock and sepa ratinff it
 are to be exempt The
 Territory can tax no land
 until the Indian title is
 extinguished is brought into market
 and sold It can then
 tax the homestead that the
 settler gets under the homestead
 bill Thus hc homestead of
 the miner is taxed while
 the machinery and property of
 the capitalist who constructs his
 works on the pub lic
 lands where he cannot buy
 the mine are ex empt
 l hat is going to
 be the effect Nearly all
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 645
 the mining operations in California
 are carried motion of the
 gentleman from Michigan can bc
 on upon Government lands The
 Goverbmen is the owner of
 those mines and under this
 syst tem of taxation the
 Territory cannot tax the men
 who have the wealth because
 it is required to tax
 in proportion to the value
 of the property and to
 make no discrimination atnong property
 and it cani10t tax the
 property of the United States
 The mining operations arc conducted
 on the property of the
 United States Whatever ma chinery
 is put upon the propert
 y of the IJnited States
 must be considered a part
 of the realty and exempt
 Then the only property which
 the Ter ritory can tax
 under this bili will be
 the horse the mule the
 shovel and the spade of
 the miner ex empting the
 capitalist that employs him because
 his machinery is on Government
 property Then they can tax
 the few farmers who may
 raise grain and tax the
 homesteads that they may got
 under the homestead law and
 sell them but they cannot
 tax the machinery and the
 large establishments that are conducting
 these Inining operations I hat
 is ooing to be the
 effect There never wasa sys
 tem of hardships so fft
 ievous as the one you
 would impose by the system
 of laxation provided for in
 this bill Mr GREEN and
 Mr HALE addressed the Chair

 I see that tho debate

 the selfish barriers of oriental
 nations and fly in triumph

 a Calhoun and others Oh
 to day some of those
 bright luminaries could raise their
 voices from the grave and
 speak to those they have
 left behind and tell them
 what their duty is If
 we had them with us
 to day prob ably ve
 might save this great and
 orlc e happy country by
 a settlement of these present
 diffi But they are not

 find others who if not
 equal in ability are as
 anxious to settle these unhappy
 difficulties and to restore peace

 find many such Sir you

 the depth of my feeling
 when I take my leave

 hour shall be occupied in
 this way The SPEAKER Is
 there any objection to the
 consideration of the bill of
 the gentleman from Vi rginia
 Mr SHERMAN I think we
 ought to settle Immediately after
 the Journal is this matter
 read it is the duty
 of thc Speaker I believe
 to announce the regular order
 of business and I It
 is very u k the
 morning hour commences pleasant to
 havc to make these objections
 POST ROUTE BILL The House
 then proceeded to the consideration
 of the regular order of
 business being the consid eration
 of the amendments of the
 Senate to the post route
 bill The SPEAKER stated the
 pending question to be on
 the amendment offered yesterday by
 Mr PHELPS to the twentieth
 section of the Senate amendment
 Mr PHELPS have availed myself
 of my right under the
 rule to modify my amcndmcnt
 I therefore desire that it
 be in some particulars read
 The Clerlc read the amendment
 as modified as follows After
 the word year in line
 five of section twenty of
 the Senate amendtncnts strike out
 the word i rescrving to
 the Govern ncnt the privilecc
 of annulling the contract after
 the comntencement ofthé overland service
 upon sixty days notice and
 insert which shall tcrminate on
 the tirst day of Augnst
 next but if the mail
 servicc in the last oree
 eding section shall not cotnmcncc
 on thc day above named
 then said contract shall be
 annulled and the Post master
 General may then provide for
 the continuance of said steamship
 service for another year Mr
 PHELPS 1 will state the
 object of the amendment The
 House has already decided to
 provide for the establishinent of
 a daily overland It is
 expected that the mail to
 the Pacific ocean service will
 commence by the 1st of
 July next My amendment provides
 that the service may commence
 by the 1st of Atæust
 and that if it does
 not commence at that time
 whatever con tract thc Postmaster
 General may have entered into
 shall be annulled by reason
 of the failure of the
 contractors to enter on the
 service at thatqime I have
 also provided in the amendmcnt
 that I sub mit that
 the present mail steamship service
 from New York to San
 Francisco shall be continued until
 the 1st of August next
 and in the event the
 daily mail service shall not
 commence on the 1st of
 August next then the contract
 beincr annulled the Postmaster General
 shall havc the right to
 cx tend his contract for
 twelve months will the mail
 steamship company for the performance
 of this ocean service In
 connection with this matter I
 desire to make all inquiry
 of the chairmafl of the
 Committee on thc Post Ofhce
 and Post Roads upon another
 branch o this subject There
 arc many interior post routes
 provided for in this bill
 besides the i desire to
 bc informed by ovcrland mail
 routes r hc gentleman frorn
 Indiana if he call Tive
 me the information what is
 the estimatc cost of the
 scr _ 7ice to be
 performed upon the new routes
 pro poscd to bc established
 Mr COLFAX I admire the
 pertinacity with which tho gentletnan
 from Missouri fightk this entire
 bill although my rule always
 is when out voted to
 give in as gracefully as
 possible He asks ine a
 question in regard to the
 interior post routes that have
 becn put into this bill
 at the request of members
 all over the country I
 do not know know that
 they cannot bc what they
 will cost put in oporation
 until Congress sees fit to
 appro priate money for them
 but take pleasure in tell
 ing tho gentleman that the
 most costly of the in
 terior mail routes are those
 which havc been put into
 the bill by the Committee
 on the Post Offce and
 Post Roads at his request
 Mr PHELPS am much obliged
 to the gen principally in
 my own State with one
 exception I which extends to
 a Territory But the gentleman
 is not very well posted
 as to the cost of
 the mail service of the
 country when he declares that
 tho cost of the mail
 service in Missouri pro rata
 ex ceeds that of the
 other States of the Confederacy
 on the contrary it is
 less routes which arc important
 and necessary where the country
 is noii r inhabited in
 order that this overland mail
 service may be established from
 the frontier States to the
 Pacific Such a state of
 things may exist that in
 thc anxiety of the Post
 master General to carry out
 the principles of the Chicago
 platform he rnay be willing
 to establish n daily overland
 mail route at the expense
 of 800 000 and that
 in consequence he will not
 be able to establish the
 inland routes now re quired
 Mr COLFAX Mr Speaker large
 portion of the remarks of
 my friend from Missouri were
 not very germane to his
 amendment which is in regard
 to the steamship service I
 can only say what he
 knows that the routes put
 in the last post route
 bill passed in 1858 vy
 erc not put into operation
 till 1860 Tho routes in
 this bill can not bc
 put into operation until Congress
 appro priates fbr them We
 perform our duty in cstab
 lishing routes Subsequently on asccrtaining
 the cost of the scrvicc
 from the Postmaster Gen oral
 Congress may make appropriations to
 put service upon them One
 word now in relation to
 the amendment offered by the
 gentleman from Missouri to which
 however his speech did not
 relate MI e provide in
 the section that the Post
 master General shall be authorized
 to provide temporary steamship service
 at a cost not ex
 cccdinff 350 000 which is
 to be stopped after sixty
 days notice upon thc commencement
 of the overland mail contract
 T hc gentleman did not
 yesterday quote that section exactly
 We say that the daily
 overland mail service shall com
 menc e on the Ist
 of Tuly or as soon
 thereafter as If the gentleman
 from Missouri would possible be
 consistent with the argument which
 he made ycstcrday the latest
 moment at which this daily
 overland service should go into
 operation even as late as
 October would be acceptable to
 him be cause that would
 effect a saving to the
 Govern ment He ought to
 endeavor to Ict the overland
 mail service go into operation
 at as latc a day
 as possible The gentleman s
 amendment of to day right
 in the teeth of his
 artFtunent of yesterday This explanation
 is I think suflicient MT
 ith it I move the
 previous question The previous question
 was seconded and thc main
 question ordered The question was
 first taken on Mr PHELPS
 S amendment to the amendment
 and it was not agreed
 to The question recurred on
 the Senate amend inent as
 amended and it was concurred
 in Mr COLFAX Inoved to
 reconsider the vote bv the
 amendment was concurred in and
 also moved to lay thc
 motion to reconsider on the
 table The latter motion was
 agreed to DEFTCIL NCY DILL
 Mr SHERMAN 1 am directed
 by the Com mittee of
 Ways and Afeans to report
 back the act to supply
 deficiencies in the appropriations for
 the service of the fiscal
 year ending Junc 30 ö61
 with the Senate amen lnents
 thereto and I to ask
 that it be printed and
 postponed till to morrow It
 was so ordered POST ROUTE
 BILL AGAIN am instructed by
 the committee Ito recommend Mr
 STEVENS of Washington 1 have
 been aware Mr Speaker that
 that would be the re
 port of the Committee on
 the Post Office and Post
 Roads but I would still
 urge on the Housethe importance
 of making this appropriation and
 of establishing this route Those
 who a rc in favor
 of the route have not
 objected to improving the car
 rying of the mails on
 the central route although that
 measure had much opposition in
 consequence of therc being an
 existincr route to wit the
 But terfield route It seems
 to me that idea ot
 providing mail service for the
 north of our coun try
 from Lake Superior to the
 western terminus proposed in this
 section by a road running
 four hundred miles south is
 not equal to the magni
 tude of thc subject nor
 does it show a proper
 appreciation of out growing interests
 in that quar ter But
 Mr Speaker granted that we
 have no northern mail route
 grant cd that the effort
 is made to supply Oregon
 and Washington and the country
 castward to Nebraska by the
 central I find that by
 that route It will require
 route some twenty nine or
 thirty days to reach Puget
 Sound while by the northern
 route proposed in this section
 it will require but from
 twenty _to twenty six days
 To supply the northern por
 tion of Oregon by the
 central route it will re
 quire twenty seven days by
 the northern route from twenty
 one to twenty seven days
 Take the large and flourishing
 settlements of the inte rior
 of Washington Territory By the
 central route it will require
 thirty ninc days while by
 the northern route it would
 but require twenty days to
 supply Colville The territory on
 the Walla Walla the center
 of army operations of the
 dc artment of Oregon would
 require by the centra route
 thirty four days and by
 the north ern route eighteen
 days But I call the
 attenti01 of the House to
 another fact When the mail
 matter exceeds onc thou sand
 pounds in weight thirty five
 days is allowed by the
 central route whereas by this
 section all the mail matter
 is required to be carried
 through in twenty days so
 that we could get mail
 rnatter to the several points
 of Washington and northern Oregon
 meritioned from fifteen to thirty
 days quicker by the northern
 than by the central route
 I call the attention of
 the House also to the
 fact that on this northern
 route we have large publ
 ic in terests in terests
 connected with the man agement
 of the Indian tribes intercsts
 connected We have along with
 the service of thc troops
 this routel m ge military
 posts There are posts on
 the Red River of the
 North at Colville and the
 Walla Walla There are several
 Indian res ervations in the
 interior in the immediate vicinity
 of the route besides many
 settlements If there fore you
 give the communications required to
 carry on the public service
 this northern mail route is
 of the greatest consequence But
 I call the attention of
 the House to another consideration
 By thc northern route mails
 can be sent to Colville
 in twenty days while by
 the central route it requires
 thirty nine days Coi ville
 is the great cent er
 of northern Washington connected with
 the growing regions of British
 It is a point whence
 men and sup Columbia plies
 for British Columbia arc sent
 and is a nat ural
 center of its trade and
 commerce By the northern overland
 mail route reaching to Puget
 Sound connection is made with
 Vancouver s Isl and and
 this is an additional reason
 showing the importance of thc
 northern overland mail The House
 again resumed the consideration of
 route the post route bill
 the question being on the
 fol I will briefly advert
 to another consideration lowing Senate
 amendment w o who are
 jiving on that route fccl
 that we can appeal x
 vith confidence to Congress for
 its estab Add thc following
 as an additional section SEC
 21 Jind be it further
 enactcd That the Postmaster I
 lishment as a measure simply
 of justice to us General
 be and hc is hereby
 authorized and directed to provide
 for the conveyance entire United
 States mail Every onc is
 perfectly well aware of the
 influence of overland mail routes
 in the way of developingy
 weekly from St Paul Minnesota
 via St Cloud and from
 Superior u isconsin via Crow
 Wing to the in the
 resources and cxtendinff the settlements
 of the Oregon with a
 branch to Seattle on Puøet
 Sound with the country On
 that idea in part these
 routes are usual preémption right
 not to exceed one quarter
 section of land for each
 station provided that this grant
 of pre supported and advocated
 in Congress TI IC refu
 i sal to the northern
 portion of the country ofa
 etnption shall not extend beyond
 six years from the pas
 sage of this act and
 said preetnption shall not exceed
 one is not only a
 refusal to assist us in
 the quarter section för each
 twenty milcs of said route
 Pro of our recrion of
 country l üt is ab
 exceeding 200 000 and tbc
 trip to be performed in
 twenty solutely an injury and
 oppression The granting I the
 northern overland mail route will
 lead to em days the
 service to expire on the
 1st lay of July 1866
 Mr COLFAX With the most
 earnest desire igration from the
 Lakes to Puget Sound and
 will on the part of
 the committee to accommodate our
 tend to develop the whole
 intermediate region friends in N
 linnesota and on the Pacific
 coast Deny us this route
 and emiøration will be diverted
 to the central route tending
 to the developmentof yet in
 the present condition of the
 Treasury I 648 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 30 that portion
 and to the discouragement of
 our section of country With
 one other consideration I will
 close will remind gentlemen that
 there is a growing interest
 on Lake Superior an interest
 that is rapidly extending westward
 The commerce on Lake Superior
 for last year amounted to
 the sum of The manufacture
 of iron in that region
 has more than doubled within
 the year thc mining of
 copper has nearly doubled It
 is a good country westward
 For these reasons as a
 matter of justice and as
 a matter of right i
 trust the House will concur
 in the amendment of the
 Senate I regret extremely that
 the Mr ALDRICEL Committee on
 the Post Offce and Post
 Roads should have fclt bound
 to report agai nst this
 amend mentofthe Senate tar the
 reason that I believe in
 fact I know that it
 is nothing more than we
 of the Northwest are entitled
 to at the hands of
 this Gov ernment For four
 successivc winters have the Senatc
 appropriated this amount of 200
 000 for the establishment of
 an overland mail from the
 Mississippi river to Puget Sound
 They havo done it because
 they thought it was duo
 to us live in that
 part of the country Mr
 Speaker I now make an
 earnest and anxiots appeal to
 this House to come forward
 and grant us this act
 of justice We ask for
 nothing morc than justice and
 we are not willing to
 submit to anythihg less Mr
 Speaker it may not be
 improper for to say to
 you whom I know to
 be a just and truc
 man it may not be
 improper fibr me to say
 to the honorable chairman of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means to the honorable chairman
 ofthe Com mittee on the
 Post Office and Post Roads
 and to thc honorable chairman
 of the sclecL committee on
 thc Pacific railroad that they
 must not pre sumc too
 much upon our loyalty Laughter
 Whenever gentlemen upon that Side
 of thc House ask anything
 at the hands of this
 Congress it would scem thut
 all that is necessary for
 ihenu to do is to
 threaten a little Now sir
 Ido not say that our
 peoplo will slough off go
 down t be Red River
 of the North and unite
 with the British possessions but
 I want gentlemen here to
 ponder over it Ido not
 say that they will do
 it but they may do
 it if they do not
 receivc ji lStice at your
 i do not throw this
 out as a threat hands
 Laughter T hry are true
 and loyal now I hope
 they may continue so We
 as I said before ask
 for nothing that we are
 not entitled to and I
 now respectfully ask that the
 umcndtnent of the Senate may
 be concurred in Mr COLFAX
 obtained the floor Mr Insk
 tleman from Indiana to permit
 unc for u mornent I
 am strongly in favor of
 this section and I desire
 to put it in the
 shape in which it will
 command I hope the clausc
 which pro the most strength
 vides for the branch mail
 from Superior Wiscon sill to
 Crow Wing vhich is entirely
 un necessary will not be
 adopted Mr WASHBURN of Wisconsin
 1 must 0b ject to
 that Wisconsin will havo something
 to sa on that sub
 ect K4r COLFAk Mr Speaker
 must now I desire to
 say to my friend from
 sume the floor Minnesota and
 my friend from MT ashington
 Tl er ritory that I
 regret as much as cither
 of them can that we
 did not feel at liberty
 to recommend a concurrence in
 this amendment of the Senate
 but we could not do
 it consistently with the present
 condition the Treasury We have
 provided for one daily overland
 mail by the central route
 to the Pacific T hc
 gentleman will recollect that in
 the last session of Congress
 we provided for a daily
 rnail along the Pacific coast
 so that the people of
 Oregon and Washington will now
 have by a somewhat circuitous
 route a daily mail from
 thc Atlantic States During the
 present session also we have
 at the request of the
 gentleman froin Washington Territory increased
 the ser vice on Puget
 Sound from a weekly to
 a semi weekly mail Now
 Mr Speaker I have briefly
 responded to the gentlemen from
 Washington and Minno line of
 forts it passes Fort Abercrombie
 it passes Tort Union it
 passes Fort Benton and will
 sup ply them all With
 mail matter And I will
 say further that the route
 is one of great importance
 to England to Europe and
 Canada It is im portant
 in this point of view
 that that portion of our
 country shall bc opened up
 The gentleman says he is
 very sorry they can not
 grant us this small pittance
 of 200 000 which we
 ask for the establishment of
 a mail service over the
 northern route to t he
 Pacific yet they succeeding section
 I send up the amendment
 and ask to have it
 read Mr COLFAX I have
 no oujection to hearing it
 read but I do not
 withdraw the demand for the
 previous question The amendment was
 read as follows And the
 Posunaster General is hereby directed
 to reex arniue the causes
 for discontinuance or curtailment of
 the postal service on inland
 routes since the 4th day
 of March 1859 and to
 restore all such parts of
 the said service as can
 be restored with due regard
 to the public interest and
 the circumstances of each case
 whether such discontinuance arc ready
 to grant to the Southwest
 1 or curtaihnent was upon
 contracts yet in force or
 have taken effect upon the
 making of new contracts Provided
 foe a railroad and they
 are ready to grant 800
 000 however l hat the
 or increase of servicc hereby
 for n mail over the
 central route M l én
 my friend i contmnplatetl shall
 be with the assent of
 the contractor in from Texas
 asks for to increase the
 mail each case or ill
 pursuance of his contract facilities
 of that State they reply
 Oh yes I demand yr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois no unanimous
 consent But when we the
 previous question on theamendment just
 read objection ask för the
 small pittancc of 200 000
 the gentle man says he
 is very sorry that he
 cannot recom mend it verv
 sorry indeed but in the
 present stutc of the Treasury
 this mail service cannot be
 i thought of Mr COLFAX
 I assure the gentleman that
 I regret to have to
 differ with him for I
 am for mail facilities the
 Nortbwcst to as large an
 extent as otu finances will
 justify r L he previous
 question was seconded and the

 House then rcsumcd the consideration
 of the special order being
 the report of the select
 committee of thirty three on
 which the gentleman from New
 York Mr CONKLING was entitled
 to the floor Mr CONKLING
 Mr Speaker from the set
 of this session I havo
 had little hope that any
 thing could be done here
 or in the otherend of
 the Capitol to arrest the
 revolution now prevailing in some
 portions of the country 1
 was long ago con vinced
 that the turbulence now festered
 to rebellion a101 g the
 Guifof Mexico had its origin
 in causes which Congress could
 not remove nor even di
 minish or retard Yet I
 have never doubted that a
 very numerous class of persons
 in thwslavehold ing States persons
 whose patriotism might safely challenge
 comparison with that of any
 other citi zens of the
 country were controlled in their
 polit ical sentiments and action
 by misapprehensions as to the
 designs of the masses of
 the non slave holding States
 misapprehensions which all good It
 would men would gladly unite
 in dispelling be strange indeed
 if this Were not so
 For years past gcntlemen representing
 slaveholding constit uencies on this
 floor have not hesitated to
 dignify with the language of
 solemn assertion aspersions upon the
 political integrity of the northern
 peo ple the wildest the
 most preposterous that have come
 out of the fury and
 licentiousness of partisan contests It
 has been ceaselessly proclaimed here
 that the Republican party had
 for its chief mission the
 intentional subversion of the acknowledged
 con stitutional rights of one
 portion of the country that
 Republicanism was but another name
 for abolition and that the
 accession to power of a
 Republican Administration would be signalized
 They have abounded sir in
 another thing which I do
 not want to forget infinitely
 rnore detrimental still They have
 bristled with scraps cut frorn
 northern newspapers newspapers which in
 assailing Republican principles and candidates
 have impeached the motives and
 character of their opponents have
 called us Abolitionists have urncd
 at us arrox vs of
 falsehood intended to take only
 local and temporary effect but
 which picked up where they
 frll have been brought here
 into Committee of the Whole
 feathered with the frank ingprivilege
 and shot iVit l i
 far reaching and wide spreading
 destructiveness Ten thousand springs of
 falsehood and perversion have filled
 the very atmosphere with noxious
 vapors and turned per sistently
 for years by politicians into
 one and the same channel
 have at length swollen into
 a cur rent so mighty
 as to bear away whole
 communi ties into utter disbelief
 in the patriotism of at
 least one great party in
 tho North and convince them
 that throughout the non slaveholding
 States the lovers of constitutional
 liberty are reduced to a
 minority so hopeless as to
 be almost utterly ex tinct
 To dispel this monstrous delusion
 and strike the scales of
 prejudice and misconception from every
 innocent and honest eye would
 be well worthy the best
 efforts of the best minds
 in any Congress But sir
 I am saddened to believe
 the task is hope lcss
 hopcless as regards the Gulf
 States at least I am
 constrained to believe that there
 the avenues to the public
 apprehension are closed closed to
 all save those who have
 misguided it and lashed Mexico
 had its origin Iin the
 compromise meas It covers a
 vast area of territory ures
 of 1850 theretofore free by
 the law of Mexico and
 by the law of nations
 and the North have not
 the nu merical power in
 this Congress or the next
 to repeal or disturb it
 These causes of complaint are
 frivolousj clearly and manifestly frivolous
 i Yet such are the
 considerations upon which apos tate
 Americans are plotting the ruin
 of their coun try such
 are the avowed reasons why
 this bright vision of constitutional
 liberty which fills Christ endom
 with light and hope should
 shrivel like a parched scroll
 such the apology for attempting
 to t into blind and
 boisterous excitement Even if the
 southern mind wrere accessikle and
 every man and woman could
 bc completely undeceived i be
 lieve that so far as
 regards the lower slaveholding States
 no cause would be subserved
 except the cause of abstract
 truth The cause of Union
 I do not bclievc would
 be perceptibly affected Dupes are
 never leaders The men in
 the South who have been
 imposed upon and become infat
 uated in rcgard to their
 brethren at the North are
 not the men who head
 rebellions or instigate re volt
 The men who ride on
 the whirlwind and direct the
 storm those who have succeeded
 to the powers of Bolus
 at least so far as
 to let loose the south
 wind are not the victims
 of any such delu sions
 They know better They know
 that thc party which has
 recently prevailed in the country
 medita tcs no innovation upon
 the Constitution of the United
 States nor any novel application
 of its principles _to slavery
 or to any other subject
 They know the mission and
 purpose of that party is
 simply to restore the ancicnt
 policy of the Re public
 the policy which began with
 Washington and carried the Government
 in safety down the stream
 of time for seventy years
 seventy pure prosperous aud peaceful
 years They know that if
 the fact were otherwise the
 newly elccted Pres ident wou
 d bc powerless to do
 wrong to the South as
 powerless as a child with
 a majority against him in
 both Houses of Congress if
 south ern Senators and Representatives
 remain faithful at their posts
 These brcedcrs of sedition under
 stand as well as any
 man who hears me the
 need lessncssofall these schemes of
 compromise They know how harmless
 a thing is a personal
 liberty bill if it conflicts
 with the Constitution of the
 United States They are lawyers
 some of them and they
 have tearncd ccrtainly they learned
 long ago in South Carolina
 how puny a t hing
 is legis lative usurpation in
 a State before the beak
 and claws of Federal power
 They know that no Re
 publican nor any political party
 mustering force enough to elect
 a constable in a town
 anywhere pretends to aright to
 interfere with slavery in the
 slaveholding States They know that
 by the i by attempts
 to liberate slaves by the
 arméd inter vention of the
 General Government Speeches declarations of
 all political parlies such a
 right is made up of
 these and other like allegations
 have repudiated and denounced They
 know that an been sent
 like snow storms or locusts
 to cover amendment to the
 Constitution to enable the Fed
 I the entirc South They
 have becn eked out with
 i cral Government to reach
 slavery in the States corroborationsmoreperniciousthanevcnthestate
 could never be effected within
 any period of time ments
 they contained They have been
 garnished whic li present prophecy
 can cover They cry out
 with rhetorical flourishes torn h
 cre and there from about
 territorial injustice and usurpation and
 yet the sayings of Republican
 politicians And sir they know
 that we havo but one
 Territory where there is not
 in this world a greater
 temptation to I slavery could
 thrive and there slavery exists
 men to exagerate and lie
 than ambition to excel in
 already not as was said
 the other day inadver rhetoric
 These speeches I say have
 abounded tently no doubt by
 the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee
 Mr NELSON e I by
 the law of with rhetorical
 flourishes of Republican politi cians
 severed from the context and
 represent Mexico but by tcrritorial
 laws adopted under an ing
 the original meaning aboutas truly
 as a thread i orffanic
 act passed here in this
 Capitol aml bury free institutions
 in the waves of revolution
 and leave the annals of
 self government like a bloody
 buoy on the sea of
 time warning the na tions
 of the earth to keep
 aloof from the mighty ruin
 Mr HINDMAN Will the gentleman
 yield a moment Mr CONKLING
 For what purpose Mr Eli
 NDMAN For the purpose of
 making a point of order
 upon the language which has
 been used by yourself Mr
 CONKLING That 1 must yield
 to of course Mr HINDMAN
 The gentleman from New York
 used the term apostate American
 I wish to inquire of
 the Chair if it is
 intended to allow now and
 hereafter the application of any
 such term as that to
 any members of this House
 or to any portion of
 their constituents who believe t
 hat the time has come
 for a dissolution of this
 Union and for a secession
 of the States of the
 South from it I ask
 if it is in order
 to stigmatize them by the
 application of the term c
 apostate Ameri I ask the
 Chair now to decide whether
 such a thing is in
 order Mr GROW Is a
 point of order debatable Mr
 HINDMAN making a point of
 order and it is statabie
 is it not The SPEAKER
 The Chair will merely say
 upon that subject that it
 is a matter which will
 be regulated he hus no
 doubt by every gentleman who
 speaks to the House The
 application of that term to
 any gentleman present or to
 any por Lion of his
 constituents Will not be correct
 but the application might be
 made without any refer cnce
 to any gentleman present or
 to any particu lar person
 he is interested in for
 all the Chair sees if
 the gentleman thinks proper to
 make it Mr HINDMAN Then
 1 ask the Chair if
 the qualifying remark should not
 go with the phrase itself
 when used Mr CONKLING 1
 desire no difficulty with the
 gentleman from Arkansas or with
 any other if that gentleman
 with regard to this debate
 gentleman knew me better hc
 would understand I that I
 would not select an occasion
 like this to say anything
 personally offensivc in the slightest
 de gree to any member
 of this House But this
 is a time which think
 imposes upon every man the
 duty as shall assume it
 gives me the privilege of
 speaking with absolute unreserve Mr
 HINDMAN The gentleman will allow
 I have no disposition to
 con me onc moment sume
 one minute of his time
 unnecessarily Mr CONKLING If these
 interruptions do not come out
 of my time I will
 give way Mr HINDMAN My
 point is this that while
 it is a period when
 every member Mr CASE I
 object to this interruption Mr
 HINDMAN Whether the gentleman object
 or not I intend to
 say Mr CONKLING 1 the
 gentleman will have regard to
 the fact that his interruption
 may come out of my
 time by the requirement of
 the House at the end
 of the hour Mr HINDMAN
 It does not come out
 of your time Mr CASE
 call the gentleman to order
 Mr HINDMAN gentleman s own
 friends arc compelling me to
 consume more of his time
 than would and they cannot
 prevent me from saying what
 I shall say at all
 events IVffr GROW I call
 the gentleman to order and
 I object in good faith
 Mr CONKLING 1 must decline
 to yield further and if
 the gentleman persists he must
 occupy the floor upon a
 point of order or my
 brief hour will be too
 far frittered away Mr HINDMAN
 The ican was applied by
 the gentleman from New of
 canvas raveled from a picture
 would present passed by the
 votes of men from the
 North as well as men
 from the South The slave
 code of New u York
 to some persons and all
 desire to know is the
 conception of a painter 650
 to hom the epithet was
 applied whether it was proper
 to apply it and v
 zhether it is the intention
 of the gentleman in the
 exercise of that right which
 he claims to belong to
 him to use the lan
 guage contained in the after
 part of his remarks as
 applicable to any portion of
 the southern peo If issues
 of that sort are to
 be raised they may as
 well be made now as
 rat any time Mr CONKLING
 I protest against any por
 tion of this interruption being
 taken out of my time
 The SPEAKER It must come
 out of the gentleman s
 time except by unanimous consent
 Mr VALLANDIGHAM Thequestionraised is a
 point of order and therefore
 it cannot comc out of
 the gentleman s time Mr
 HINDMAN It seems to me
 that a point of order
 raised upon the gentleman and
 all re marks connected therewith
 would not come out of
 the entleman s time Mr
 WicKEAN If it does not
 come out of the gentleman
 s time thc interruption might
 consume the whole day Mr
 SPINNER Is not the point
 of order settlcd Mr HINDMAN
 The decision of the Chair
 was thai such remarks werc
 not in order The SPEAKER
 The Chair stated that it
 would be the duty of
 the Chair to arrest any
 personal remarks but the particular
 language a speaker uses the
 Chair never can control Mr
 HINDMAN I shall continue to
 raise the point of order
 from time to time and
 I hope the gentleman from
 New York will bear that
 determ Ination in mind Mr
 GROW wc havc set hero
 tho whole session ourselves denounced
 as traitors and cvcrylhing else
 Froe speech ought to be
 tolerated upon this floor Mr
 CONKLING Mr Speaker 1 was
 pro cccding to say when
 interrupted that tl e alleged
 grievances I have enumerated are
 the avowed oc casion of
 this revolt and I say
 now that they are not
 reasons but excuses sad pitiful
 excuses of designing and dcspcratc
 men the subterfuges and make
 shifts of unholy and baffed
 ambition The true explanation lies
 deeper The true reason is
 that by the sentiment of
 an overwhelming major ity of
 the people of the Republic
 slaveholding as a moral proposition
 is outlawed and abhorred that
 assent to slavery as a
 policy to be fostered has
 förever ceased to bc national
 in this country It is
 charged upon the North sir
 and I am go ing
 to continue to speak with
 great frankness upon this subject
 it is charged upon the
 North that at tho fireside
 on the pavement in the
 school house slavery is held
 to be nioral social and
 political evil T lie charge
 is true sir every word
 of it A large majority
 of the people of the
 North no mutter of what
 political party look upon slavery
 as an insatiate master They
 do not see it in
 its patriarchal aspects but they
 see an iron heeled marble
 hcarted oppressor de mat ding
 always ree victims the slave
 the In this regard the
 people master and the land
 of the North agrcc exactly
 with the who c Chris
 tian world the slaveholding States
 of this blood bought liberty
 föun dcd Republic alone excepted
 W 11 y sir the
 jurisprudence of the world is
 against slavery thc literature of
 the world is against sla
 very the civilization of thc
 world is aøainst sla very
 Mr Webster once said speakmg
 of an othei subject The
 lightning is strong the tornado
 is strong the earth quake
 is strong but there is
 something stronger than all of
 these it is the enlightened
 judgment of mankind That too
 is against slavcry A grcat
 man has said Let mc
 write tho songs of a
 people and I care not
 who makes their laws and
 the songs the poetry and
 even the fine arts of
 the world are against slavery
 Is any free State to
 blame for that No sir
 it is one of the
 enactments of that hi Ther
 law which my gifted friend
 from Ohio Mr BINGHAM spoke
 of the other day and
 which he said was announced
 as a fact in legal
 and political science as fhr
 back as tho days of
 Madison He might have crone
 much further back certainly as
 far as Elizabeth s Attorney
 General that gifted jurist who
 at the age of twenty
 seven was the greatest conuncn
 lawyerin the world Sir Edward
 Coke proclaimed when the name
 of Coke bore great s
 way in Britain as it
 has done sincc in thc
 world l quote the substance
 of his language from rec
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 30 ollection
 that laws of Parliament conflicting
 with the laws of God
 were to be held utterly
 for naught I am not
 afirming or denying this doctrine
 now sir but I do
 affrm that the love of
 liberty the detestation of oppression
 the unquenchable ha tred of
 tyranny which lies at the
 foundation of the anti slavery
 sentiment of the North is
 a law which cannot be
 suspended by congressional compro mises
 nor repealed except by that
 great Legisla tor whose enactments
 quicken and still the pulses
 and grasp and regulate the
 subtile essences of hu I
 repeat sir that this anti
 slavery sen man life timent
 lies at the bottom of
 southern discontent not that had
 it lain dormant asleep like
 the passions in infancy s
 breast or found expression only
 in words it would have
 provoked this angry quarrel but
 it has found a voice
 in the politics of the
 country It is charged with
 havilp accomplished uncen stitutional ends
 or grasped at unconstitutional I
 deny it It has controlled
 popular powers there s the
 rub it has come elections
 ay sir like a chilling
 frost to nip in thebud
 darling schemes of personal ambition
 and far reaching plots of
 It has changed the sectional
 aggrandizemen t balance of political
 power in this country Its
 mission is not to do
 l ut to prevent and
 yet sir do not deny
 that it ushers in a
 mighty reform It calls a
 halt in a swift moving
 proces ation Sion of great
 cvents There shall be no
 more Mexican wars now that
 slavery or ambition may travel
 on the crimson wings of
 military conquest The armies of
 the Republic shall not now
 go forth to change realms
 to deserts nor even to
 sack cities or subduo Ilerritories
 in ordcr to people them
 with slaves and endow them
 with slave represent ation Ambassadors
 of the American R public
 ut the Courts of Europe
 will not dare assem ble
 at the tomb of Charlemagne
 and proclaim the Ostend manitosto
 Henceforth American slavery shall be
 no morc the favored pampered
 child of American destiny a
 thing for Government to fondle
 and caress but an interest
 havincr definite constitutional riThts and
 having nothing more All this
 sir was lonæ ago forcsccn
 by ihc pierc ing eyes
 of southern potiticians and the
 very year predicted in which
 it should come to pass
 In that same hour in
 which the horoscope foretold the
 political reverses of 1860 a
 child was born which has
 grown to armed rebellion From
 that hour revolution has been
 premeditated and prepared and that
 too by men who as
 officers of the Gov ernment
 had sworn to maintain it
 but who have at last
 torn off their masks and
 revealed them selves as conspirators
 tvainst it and spurned it
 in its own Capital with
 the very blasphemy of treason
 Mr SIMMS Will the gentleman
 allow mc to ask him
 a question Mr CONKLING only
 upon the condition that the
 interruption does not come out
 of my time Mr SIMMS
 concur with the gentleman that
 we should bc very frank
 in these times and I
 want to ask him a
 question Several MEMBERS objected Mr
 CONKLING Öbjection is made but
 not by me and I
 am sorry I cannot yield
 to the gen tleman The
 SPEAKER The Chair will state
 that if a gentleman yields
 for interruptions his time can
 not be extended except by
 unanimous consent Mr SIMMS Then
 do not press my request
 Mr CONKLING Mr Speaker with
 this view of our predicament
 its ori Tin its history
 and its authors I saw
 little from the outset that
 we could do except tb
 abide the issue On the
 Prcsi dentof the United States
 and his Cabinet grave re
 sponsibilities were cast responsibilities for
 which they will be held
 deeply answerable in more than
 one tribunal By the Constitution
 it was the duty of
 the President to sec that
 the wcrc faithfully executed but
 bc complains in his message
 that by the act of
 1795 giving effect to this
 provision his action is merelyauxiliary
 to that of the courts
 and that inasmuch as in
 South Carolina the judicial and
 ministerial officers had resigned his
 power to enforce the lasvs
 was practically paralyzed That sir
 would be a proposition worthy
 of more search ing discussion
 than it has yet received
 if it were not swallowed
 up in one of far
 vaster magnitude By the Constitution
 the President is commander in
 chief of the Army and
 Navy and is charged with
 the duty and vested with
 tho power of pre serving
 on the land and on
 the sea ournational de fenses
 For the completcexereise of this
 power he needed no courts
 to issue process and no
 marshal to execute it Nothing
 was needed but firmness and
 integrity Either one alone would
 have been suffcient buthe chose
 to leave the country naked
 to its enemies He chose
 to imperil the lives of
 brave men mewed up treason4jound
 in ungar risoned fortresses and
 to refuse them succor and
 If it be said that
 the movement reinforcement southward of
 ships or men would have
 precipi tated a bloody outbreak
 it is anssvcr enough to
 say that the forts should
 have bcen garrisoned before the
 first mutterings of storm It
 should have been done early
 done gradually done when sagacious
 and patriotic citizens of both
 sections advised and implored it
 But sir it wras not
 done and the President of
 this mighty Republic stood petrified
 by fear or Vacillating between
 determination an d doubt while
 rebels snatched from his nerveless
 grasp the ensign of the
 Republic and waved before his
 eyes the banner of sécession
 and rebellion With all this
 we had nothing to do
 W c were powerless to
 control it The Constitution oave
 us no such power and
 I wish with all my
 heart the vhole people of
 the country knew as well
 as we know how utterly
 impotent we wore we the
 Union party of this House
 to control and influ ence
 the course the Administration has
 seen fit to pursue or
 to trammel up the infinite
 rnischief which has resulted from
 it It was our duty
 to vole money to carry
 on the Government Besides this
 duty what had we I
 fear except share in the
 great Nothing issue of tho
 hour the ultimatum of this
 contro versy the question whether
 the people will con sent
 to a disintegration of the
 Government or unitcÖ maintain it
 That any State could go
 out of tlie Union at
 will I did not at
 all believe The history of
 the convention which framed the
 Con stitution shows that no
 such right exists I do
 not desire to be drawn
 into a discussion of it
 this hour rule denies me
 opportunity but I want to
 remind gentlemen of a fact
 which have not heard mentioned
 here and which should not
 be entirely forgotten An attempt
 was made in the convention
 to introduce into the Constitution
 a provision giving this very
 right of secession which now
 is claimed The proposition came
 from a distinguished quarter and
 was urged by the mover
 to protect men as he
 said from the halter who
 should do precisely what has
 been going on in the
 South for weeks past Tho
 provision was voted down voted
 down by men who thought
 that in launching a great
 Government upon the tide of
 time they were bringina into
 existence something with more longevity
 than a partner ship with
 more cohesion than a club
 of thirtecn members and more
 lasting durability than a sew
 inø society of women It
 was spurned by statcs men
 who believed they were making
 not a con tract to
 arrange a voluntary affliation of
 Statcs but a Constitution to
 solemnize an eternal wed lock
 of the people Mr Speaker
 since I have turned aside
 from my purpose to speak
 of thc subject I want
 to make another remark or
 two upon this nondescribt par
 adoxical thing called the riffht
 of secession A constitutional right
 to violate the Constitution A
 peaccab e right to put
 half the country onawar footing
 to arm men and plantcannon
 everywhere to sicze the Federal
 property expel the Govern ment
 and fire upon unarmed vessels
 bearirjff its I believe there
 arc throe ways in which
 the fla people ofa State
 can cut themselvcs loose from
 their Federal allcgiance The first
 is by an amend ment
 of the Constitution as provided
 for in the Constitution itself
 I he second is by
 the consent not of the
 remaining States but of the
 people to use a phrase
 of Mr Madison s by
 the uni versal acquiescence of
 the American people The third
 is by that right or
 power which as the gen
 tleman from Ohio well said
 inheres in men and not
 in States the option which
 all men have to defy
 their Government and if they
 succeed to live and live
 perhaps as patriots and heroes
 but if they fail to
 die and die as rebels
 and as trai tors We
 have heard a greal deal
 said about co ercing States
 I never heard of any
 one who pro posed to
 do it States do not
 commit murder nor rob nor
 steal nor take oaths and
 break them Men do such
 things and men are punishable
 not States 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 65t It was asked
 here the other day whether
 laws were to be enforced
 if the people of a
 dozen States resisted them Ah
 Mr Speaker that is the
 old puzzle which has been
 presented to all Govern ments
 That is the old problem
 which has been solved by
 every Government that ever existed
 long enough to demonstrate the
 pot ver of self per
 If one man comrmts murder
 in the peluation State of
 Virginia there is no difficulty
 in indicting and executing him
 But if ten thousand men
 par ticipate in that murder
 all are indictable and all
 are guilty but they are
 not all punishable practi cally
 because the wheels of justice
 would roll axle deep in
 blood and so would stop
 for very clogging The principle
 however remains the same In
 this connection there is one
 remark I want to make
 about war war whether it
 be waged in In resistance
 of laws or for any
 other purpose this material age
 war is a very humdrum
 thing The battles known to
 the crusaders and sung by
 the Troubadours have all been
 fought War is no longer
 a question of personal valor
 or indi vidual prowess buta
 mere question of money a
 question who can thro v
 the most projectiles who can
 indulge in the most iron
 and lea d It is
 no longer regulated by the
 laws of honor and chiv
 alry but entirely by the
 laws of trade But sir
 had I that bad heart
 that malevolence which is supposed
 to exist mnong the northern
 people toward their brothers in
 the South and which God
 knows I do not feel
 nor do those I represent
 did I desire to see
 secession drowned in its own
 blood or witherand famish I
 wouldcrown every discontented State with
 instantaneous inde pendence There w
 ould be no more rendition
 of fugitives then there would
 be no General Gov ernment
 to quell slave insurrections then
 there would be no morc
 Mom oedoctrine then no morc
 national views that European nationalities
 shall never interfere upon this
 continent but hostility to slavery
 death rather than cxpansion would
 become a leading policy of
 all nations whether transatlantic or
 adjacent A slaveholding con federacy
 would cast out its shoe
 at its peril over one
 foot of land beyond its
 present limits capable of yielding
 any product that man can
 eat or any fabric that
 man can wear I say
 beyond its pres ent limits
 I will come nearer home
 and say that whoever shall
 attempt to hold even the
 rnouth of the Mississippi or
 to control it even so
 far as to assume to
 dispense the right of free
 navigation may have reason to
 exclaim To be thus is
 nothing but to be safely
 thus The cotton statistics of
 the x vorld are full
 of instructive meaning to those
 who base their calcu iations
 on the supposition that American
 slave raised cotton is to
 be perpetually king The frrures
 point to a time when
 this restless monarch weird sis
 goaded to new usutpations by
 the avarice ambition and secession
 may havc tcrs reason to
 groan in the soliloquy of
 a guilty king Upon my
 head they placed a fruitless
 crown And put a barren
 scepter in my gripe Thence
 to be wrenched with an
 uniineal hand No son of
 mine succeedin r But Mr
 Speaker in consequence of interrup
 tions and of the crowd
 of topics which prcss upon
 me I have wandered far
 from the line I intended
 to pursue I desire to
 inquire what can be done
 what sve ought to do
 With the various propositions im
 mediatcly before us Bclicving as
 I do that a morc
 unjustifiable revolt and I must
 be permit ted to add
 one more perfidious so far
 as regards the relationships of
 men was never led against
 an established Government one difficulty
 has been all along to
 see how any branch of
 the Gov ernment could with
 safety or propriety enter upon
 negotiations at all To agree
 under a threat to what
 is right and just is
 a very humiliating and unmanly
 thing even in an individual
 But for a oreat Government
 to do it a Government
 that acknowledges no superior among
 the Powers of the earth
 what shall be said of
 that In such a casc
 it must be justified if
 justified at all either by
 a necessity entirely desperate or
 a magnanim ity entirely sublime
 Can there be a doubt
 that to change laws at
 the violent behest of those
 who are engaged in resisc
 ing them would demoralize and
 jeopard any Gov insurgents standing
 with arms in their hands
 would bc not only to
 confess impotency but to offer
 bounty for popular clamor and
 insubordina tion I have heard
 such concessions called tubs thrownto
 the whale I call them
 planks thrown to the mob
 and I never heard ofa
 mob less deserv ing to
 be dallied with according to
 my apprehen sion than that
 which has seized the possessions
 of the Government snatched its
 property and its money and
 fired upon its flag I
 have no desire to wound
 the feelings of any man
 but I must be permitted
 to say that if speaking
 with bated breath of such
 despicable marauders is any part
 of any body s compromise
 I want for one to
 be counted out all the
 way out to the last
 act in the drama No
 sir confining my view to
 the State execu tivcs who
 have become actors in treason
 and to the people be
 they many or few who
 havc raiscd the standard of
 rebellion I care not in
 what State I have no
 compromise to offer no terms
 to talk about none until
 they return to their allegiance
 haul down their palmettos and
 pelicans doff their cockades and
 wear as we wear the
 livery of treason but the
 garb of citizenship and submis
 Sion to the laws But
 sir fortunately there are true
 and loyal men in all
 the States and unfortunately public
 tranquillity in none of the
 States of the Confed eracy
 Distraction and excitement reign in
 States whose executives and a
 majority of whose peo ple
 are loyal to the Union
 and the Constitution These are
 the more northerly slaveholding States
 They are represent ed here
 in part at least by
 men whose patriotism and character
 entitle them and their opinions
 to the highest consideration The
 people of these States have
 obvious and pow erful incentives
 to launch upon the tide
 of seces sion They have
 the closest affinities political social
 geographical and commercial with regions
 and communities in which irreverence
 for the Con stitution and
 hostility to the Union has
 gone so far that fealty
 to the General Government has
 been made punishable With death
 In all of these States
 two parties exist one in
 favor of dis union the
 other persistently opposed to it
 Was this otherwise were the
 people of these States indiscriminately
 affected indiscriminately only hesitating halting
 between two conclusions not ready
 to declare themselves out of
 the Confeder acy but waiting
 to be induced to stay
 in was there an average
 public sentiment demanding to be
 addressed and persuaded not to
 disown the Government the case
 would be widely different If
 the people of any State
 were thus up to be
 rafHed for by the Government
 on one Side and traitors
 on the other I would
 decline the compe tition I
 would not see the Government
 a bid der at an
 auction where allegiance and patriotism
 were to bc sold I
 would rather commend to a
 sister thus to be coaxed
 into wedlock the assurancc which
 the poet says an old
 warrior gave his daughter A
 hero shall thy bridegroom be
 Since maids are best in
 battle wooed And won with
 shouts of victory But sir
 no such degeneracy exists in
 Dela ware Maryland Virginia North
 Carolina Ken tucky rrennessec and
 Missouri and I hope not
 In all these States at
 least public in other States
 virtue still livcs robust and
 unawed This debate will preserve
 brigh t and enduring traces
 of the patri otism the
 genius and the loyalty of
 their sons To these brave
 rnen struggling to maintain their
 own foothold in tho storiY
 and laboring to inspire others
 with thcir own spirit I
 will givc all the help
 I can to enable them
 to stem the current of
 revolution and roll back the
 tide of sectional mad ness
 and egotism Applause in the
 galleries Not that I believe
 it will avert the issue
 of dis union but still
 I will In ake concessions
 Conces sions which will show
 that wc do not as
 the gen tlcman from Virginia
 1M r GARNETT said the
 ment held out the last
 offer and resorted to the
 last expedient wc were warranted
 in employing Mr Speaker I
 see must be very brief
 qvhich I regret because my
 design was to discussthe differ
 ent propositions before us with
 some particular icy I will
 say hastily what for one
 I propose to do with
 regard to them Gentlemen complain
 that their constituents feel aggrieved
 with regard to our territorial
 policy and I will begin
 with that The line of
 360 30 long ago became
 a conse crated line upon
 the political chart of our
 country It was ruthlessly blotted
 out but it is the
 better remembered for the stupendous
 crime and folly which erased
 it Though not an isothermal
 line gentlemen all virtually start
 with the idea that north
 of it slavery cannot subsist
 On the south of it
 a distinguished Senator from Kentucky
 Mr CRITTENDEN has proposed to
 license and protect slavery by
 an amendment of the Constitution
 an amendment which shall embrace
 not only pres ent possessions
 butextend to future acquisitions The
 same proposition is here as
 an amendment to the pending
 rcpou t offered by the
 distinguished gentleman from the Wheeling
 district of Virginia Mr CLEMENS
 No matter in what guise
 or from what quarter it
 comes for one f cannot
 vote for it and for
 a number of reasons two
 of which In the first
 place I will not vote
 to I will state establish
 slavery anywhere Thc eighth section
 of the act admitting Missouri
 commonly called the Missouri compromise
 did not establish or even
 recognize slavery at all It
 merely fixed a certain bound
 and dedicated to perpetual free
 dom all territory north of
 it saying nothing about territory
 on the south In that
 respect there is a world
 wide difference between the old
 proposition and the new But
 sir passing over this objection
 as applied to territory now
 held who shall count the
 conse quences or compute the
 folly and disaster of guar
 antying to slavery all possessions
 hereafter to be acquired What
 calamity might not spring from
 making to slavery this golden
 promise ofa shad owy and
 eternal by and by Why
 sir it would amount to
 a perpetual covenant of war
 against every people tribe and
 State owning a foot of
 land between here and Terra
 del Fuego It would make
 the Government the armed missionary
 of slavery Eternal quarrels would
 be picked across the frontier
 lines tile Government must protect
 its citizens and demand indemnity
 for hostilities and thus for
 purposes of land stealing and
 slave planting we should be
 launched upon a shoreless and
 starless sea of war and
 fillibustering sired to make some
 further suggestions about this proposition
 but I pass iL by
 Of territory already acquired there
 is none below 360 30
 aside from that devoted to
 Indian tribes save New Mexico
 and Arizona Unfit as these
 Territories must be conccded to
 be I beg pardon of
 my friend the Delegate Mr
 OTERO to enter this Union
 as a State no matter
 what constitution they bring I
 will vote for the enabling
 act brought in by the
 distinguished gentleman at the head
 of thc committee of thirty
 three B t sir in
 supporting this bill I will
 practice no de ception cvcn
 by silence No suggestio fal
 si or even suppressio veri
 shall lurk about my vote
 will not hold out the
 idea to the South that
 New Mexico will come in
 as a slave State for
 I do not I believe
 that if she does not
 come believe it frec from
 the start slie will never
 be in any prac tical
 sense a slaveholding State I
 here are twelve slaves there
 now as I understand it
 and situa tion soil climate
 and surroundings will bufilc slavery
 now or hereafter This is
 my belief and I will
 vote to carry out the
 compromises of 1850 dcclaring as
 they do that Now Mexico
 may come in with or
 without slavery as her constitu
 tion shall provide will vote
 for all the resolutions appended
 to other day stand idle
 spectators while the ship the
 report of the chairman declaratory
 of the unconcerned observers of
 duty of everybody to observe
 constitutional obli drifts upon thc
 rocks the approach of the
 harpies of the shorc to
 pluck gations I would gladly
 vary the language of two
 of these resolutions but only
 to express morc un the
 eagle of the sea Concessions
 which if sus I tained
 on this side of the
 House will show the i
 mistakably if possible the meaning
 they are no doubt intended
 to ccnivey magnanxmous pco of
 the North that their Rep
 I will vote for the
 bill amendatory of the fugitive
 resentatives struck ands with Union
 men of all sections aud
 all parties and went in
 kindness slave law of 1850
 provided it can be amended
 in two particulars In the
 first place 1 would strike
 and conciliation to the very
 verge of debatable propositions concessi0Yis
 which will show that out
 the provision for a retrial
 upon the mere ipse we
 abandoned the effort to avert
 disunion and civil dicit of
 a judge of the freedom
 of the allcgcd fu crnment
 Can there be a IGubt
 that for civil I authorities
 to propose terni s of
 arrangement to ii war only
 when we had cxhausted the
 last argu gitivc after it
 has been once found by
 a jury If twelve men
 selected by lot from a
 slaveholding population in the vicinage
 where the claimant lives pronounce
 a negro free I would
 not simply because the judge
 is not satisfied with the
 verdict remand him to be
 put in peril a second
 time the jury to be
 met at the threshold by
 a certificate that the conclusion
 arrived ut by the preceding
 jury was not satisfactory to
 the court If the pro
 vision is intended for the
 benefit of the alleged fugitive
 and to give him second
 trial in case the first
 results adversely to him say
 so in the biH and
 Ict the provision follow the
 reasonable doubt infuoorem vitæ or
 if this is too much
 to ask then give both
 claimant and defendant the same
 rights of exception and review
 allowed in criminal cases Secondly
 would provide redress for those
 who after being arrested and
 transported for trial are found
 not to be fugitives at
 all nor to owe service
 to any one I would
 not invade cs tablished maxims
 so far as to subject
 men to ma licious or
 mistaken arrests and leave any
 doubt about their remedy The
 remedy in this case it
 seems to me is a
 right of action in the
 State where the arrest is
 made It should bc so
 guardcd that in case ofa
 false arrest by mistake and
 not from malice the bona
 Jules of those making it
 should avail them in mitigation
 of damages so as to
 confine the verdict to strict
 compensation and I prevent a
 recovery of smart money With
 these changes made the statute
 will not be very taste
 fui to gentlemen on this
 side of the House but
 I will vote for it
 and find my justification in
 the anxious earnest wish I
 feel in common with the
 people I represent to do
 everything which can bc fairly
 asked to preserve the Union
 and har mony of the
 States An act is reported
 transferring fron the Gov ernors
 of States to Federal judges
 the duty of surrenderiney upon
 requisition persons charged with crime
 It seems to me an
 importance has been given to
 this subject by gentlemen here
 which it docs not deserve
 A good deal of lasv
 respecting it has becn put
 forth on both sides of
 the Ilouse from which I
 respectfully dissent and it appears
 to me u great strain
 to drag the matter into
 tho vortex of sectional strife
 and slave agi tation The
 courts and Executives must be
 able to settle the practice
 for the rendition of criminals
 upon a basis as little
 obnoxious to one portion of
 the country as another and
 avoiding some at least of
 the practical objections applicable to
 this Thus Mr Speaker I
 have referred to every proposition
 proceeding from the committec of
 thirty three save one that
 one is to submit to
 the Legislatures of the States
 a constitutional amend an amendment
 placing it forever out of
 the ment power of any
 number of States less than
 the wholc nutnbcr to amend
 the Constitution respecting slavery in
 the slaveholding States I regret
 sir that such proposition is
 here 1 regret that it
 was deemed necessary especially after
 the resolution on the same
 point thc t hird of
 the series I think For
 the resolution I pre sumc
 every gentleman on this side
 of the I lousc will
 cordially vote the prot osai
 to amend thc Constitution presents
 very difl7u ent considera tions
 I have been unable to
 discover any adC quate motive
 for it or any object
 to bc gained Gentlemen of
 the South have heretofore rel
 clied the insinuation that the
 Constitution was not sat isfactory
 to them precisely as it
 is The coin plaint has
 been not that constitutional guaran
 tees were insufficient but that
 the people of the North
 did not or would not
 observe them This II is
 the sole complaint about tbc
 Constitution at present as I
 understand it If then we
 do not ob serve it
 now what hope is there
 that we shall ob serve
 it after it hus been
 altored I say none no
 I hope that any one
 will revere it as much
 then as they do now
 v hile it remains as
 our fathers made it is
 said however that the object
 of this amend I ment
 is so to rivet the
 fastenilps as to provide against
 our bad faith Passino over
 II te insult of this
 proposition he arcyument is bad
 bad bc cause atnendznents as
 dangerous to the South as
 that th sough t to
 guarded against will still re
 main accessibic to the Punic
 faith of the frec States
 when they shall multiply to
 thc needed number tle of
 to day to be brought
 forth of the throes of
 centuries themselves unborn But sir
 I cannot 652 those forty
 five free Slates conceived in
 the prat the gallant and
 men who signed the THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 30 reconcile
 myself to the idea of
 disturbing the Con stitution in
 the least of its particulars
 It may be a superstitious
 feeling but I fear you
 will unset tle the nation
 s faith on the day
 when you admit that a
 time has arrived when the
 Constitution is no longer equal
 to the emergency It came
 as it is now from
 the heroic age of the
 Republic its origin and its
 antiquity enhance its sacredness and
 supremacy Men do not think
 of it as a machine
 to be regulated but they
 trust to it as a
 benefi cent overruling provision having
 a providence in it to
 order all things well Let
 us keep the Constitution as
 it is and obey it
 as it is cvcn to
 the uttermost If degenerate Americans
 shall hawk at and tear
 it freedom will provide a
 Gibbon or better yet a
 Dante to im mortalize thc
 crime some limner with infernal
 pencil to group the assassins
 in a picture horrid with
 resemblance and hang it up
 to sicken and affright the
 gaze of those xxvho shall
 hereafter tread the corridors of
 time Now sir before the
 hammer falls one word of
 conclusion The people I represent
 are a gen crous bravc
 and peace loving people They
 cling to the institutions of
 their country with an earncstand
 almost idolatrous attachment So does
 the great State of New
 York with her four mil
 lion people So hcr Legislature
 has testified with impressive unanimity
 While Commonwcalths of the South
 are embracing thc pillars Of
 the Re public determined to
 destroy it New York offers
 men and money to assert
 the supremacy of the Government
 and defend il against all
 comers The people of the
 State of New York believc
 in this Government as their
 fathers made it They believe
 in it not as a
 mere commercial league whose material
 advantages they can calculate and
 whose value they can weigh
 in golden scales To them
 it is something more They
 cherish it for its memories
 of martyrs of heroes and
 of states men they cherish
 it for its wisdom grand
 with the revelations and pregnant
 with the experience of buried
 centuries and epochs they cherish
 it for the shelter it
 aflörds aoainst the tempest which
 without it would burst upon
 this continent in an hour
 above all they cherish it
 for its prom iscs unredeemed
 its mission uncompleted its des
 tiny unfulfilled In the world
 trod streets of our great
 metropolis sixty four languacres and
 dialects In this chaos of
 voices are breathed are spoken
 the prayers and muttered the
 curses of the exile the
 refugee the emancipated of all
 Governments and all climes Of
 this motley group of tongues
 there is not one no
 not one without an anath
 ema to blast the man
 who would overthrow free institutions
 in this continent of ours
 Among the vocabularies of them
 all in which shall be
 found the word whereby to
 call so infinite a crime
 It is a deed without
 a known name Mr STEVENSON

 throe Two tunendments to that

 The amendment of the gentleman
 from Virginia is what is
 known as the Crittenden resolutions
 and is the oneimme diately
 pending before the I louse
 The SPEAKER It is Mr
 STEVENSON then addr ssed the
 House His speech wil be
 published in for an hour
 the Appendix Mr HOWARD of
 Ohio Mr Speaker we have
 arrived at a period in
 the history of our country
 which was never even dreamed
 of by Declaration of Independence
 and the statesmen who frtuned
 thc national Constitution They never
 conceived the idea that in
 the short space of eighty
 four years our population would
 have increased from three to
 thirty million that our territory
 would have occupied a geographical
 area of three million three
 hundred thousand square miles and
 that the taxable property of
 our prosperous and industrious people
 would have increased to the
 enormous sum of that our
 foreign trade would have advanced
 from to 800 000 000
 annually that the States of
 the Union would have numbered
 thirty thrcc and that all
 civilized nations would have bowed
 in humble reverence before the
 supremacy of our power Such
 at this day is the
 position that the North American
 Republic occupies in the great
 family of nations Butcould they
 again have lifted the vail
 of that mysterious future and
 have seen that in 1860
 and 1861 in the very
 midst of such unparalleled pros
 perity we should have been
 falling to pieces and crushed
 out of existence by the
 weight of our own power
 they would have shrunk from
 the im portance and responsibility
 of their work and left
 us to struggle on in
 our oppression to a foreign
 yoke and their pens would
 have fallen powerless and paralyzed
 from their hands could they
 have imagined for a moment
 that at this day sur
 roulided by such exalted ad
 vantages commanding such profound respect
 we should for such light
 and trifling causes and by
 our own ovcrtacts have placed
 ourselves upon the very verge
 of destruc tion and dissolution
 could they have thought that
 at so early a period
 of our country s history
 we should have brought upon
 ourselves the contempt of other
 nations and that they would
 be laughing at our calamities
 and mocking when our fear
 cometh and that they would
 be smiling the de moniac
 smile of delight because our
 destruction is coming upon us
 like a whirlwind Even with
 ali the defects that can
 be traced out by the
 most fervid imagination do we
 not owe all that we
 are that we have been
 01 that we will be
 in all future time to
 the Union as we have
 received it from our noble
 ancestry W c sir are
 responsible for its safe transmission
 to our immediate successors and
 they tvrain to theirs until
 it reaches by lin cal
 and collateral descents the most
 distant futu rity We have
 in it no other title
 than a life es tate
 and have no right to
 lay upon it violent hands
 and break the chain that
 is to carry it to
 our children arid our children
 s children to the remotest
 period of time Mr Slocaker
 the day has rone by
 when we may manufhcture political
 capital from passing events for
 the time has fairly arrived
 when all true patriots must
 throw aside all political distinction
 and diflörence and meet together
 upon a common platforrn and
 exert our whole energies to
 the ut most tension to
 save our sinking country from
 utter ruin and desolation He
 who now r efuses fo
 do so is recreant in
 his duty to his country
 to his God and 0
 all posterity for the mysterious
 Mover of nature the universal
 Lord of being that God
 that in the immensity of
 his works di rects the
 movements of all nations will
 hold this people responsible for
 the preservation of our na
 tional privileges We pray God
 that in this case as
 in all others He Thay
 make the wrath of man
 to praise Him and that
 the remainder of wrath He
 may restrain and that future
 generations may be spared the
 pain of serious contemplation over
 the ruined splendor of our
 achievements and the mcmory of
 our fallen greatness We know
 that all human power cannot
 prevent the dictates of destiny
 which is the voice of
 Divinity Sir every lover of
 his country should humble himself
 in sackcloth and ashes that
 our doom which seemingly is
 scaled may be averted as
 was an cient Nineveh even
 after the prophet of God
 by his express commands had
 proclaimed her im mediate and
 terrible destruction If ve allow
 this nation to be destroyed
 when we have the power
 within our own hands to
 per petuate it history will
 hold us responsible and no
 argument that we can now
 place upon record will be
 sufficient to hush to silence
 the voice and judgment of
 an outraged and defrauded posterity
 And though under the heat
 and excitement of the hour
 we may think the cause
 sufficient to justify the effect
 yet in the estimation of
 a cool and col lected
 posterity the cause will be
 considered but as the dust
 of the balance and they
 will justly consign to perpetual
 infamy the memory not only
 of those who did the
 act but of all those
 who did THE QONGRESSIONA L
 GLOBE 653 not exert all
 the energies conferred upon them
 in its prevention Upon the
 members of the Thirty Sixth
 Congress of the United States
 rests the des tiny of
 this Republic and to you
 the future his torian will
 point perpetually either the finger
 of scorn and contempt or
 will deeply inscribe your names
 upon the dial plate of
 our country S records as
 the sure gnomon that is
 to indicate upon its face
 its perpetual motions through the
 annals of time You cannot
 scrccn yourselves behind the flimsy
 gauze ofa want of example
 for the last eighteen hundred
 years have borne down before
 them the wreck of empires
 kingdoms and republics They have
 risen culminated and fallen and
 can we close our eves
 against the causes which have
 brought about such fatal revolutions
 and can we fail to
 profit by their precept and
 evade the rock upon which
 they split And do they
 not stand as buoys and
 beacon lights even in their
 darkness and deso lation to
 point us toa surer harbor
 of safety Six stars of
 various magnitude have glided solemnly
 though certainly from our constellation
 where but a few days
 since they reposed in peaceful
 se curity in their places
 and nine others are sho
 v ing evident signs of
 the disturbance of the center
 of their system and yet
 we are merely disinterested and
 deliberate spectators of this disruption
 while the whole civilized world
 is looking with horror and
 astonishment upon our inactivity and
 indif ferencc And again sir
 heretofore the genius of the
 nation has always been suffcicnt
 for every emergency and this
 can be successfully met if
 we present before it but
 a bold front I have
 tried to study the destiny
 of the Republic I have
 tried to examine carefully and
 candidly the causes of the
 present discontent and distrust and
 I now believe that none
 that have yet transpired have
 been sufficient to justify secession
 and separation And believe the
 national Government possesses the inhcrent
 power by the laws and
 Constitution of the United States
 to prevent a State or
 States from seceding and to
 bring any State back into
 thc Union even after its
 separation But I be lieve
 also that every means should
 be resorted to within the
 grasp of our power to
 bring back the erring member
 into the family of States
 before an appeal to force
 It is the duty of
 the states man and patriot
 to examine thoroughly the causes
 of the existing evils whether
 they are either real or
 imaginary and to act at
 once without hesita tion or
 delay and remove and correct
 them I would understand that
 this Union is a con
 tract that no State can
 come into the Union with
 out the consent of t
 he other States and once
 she takes her stand as
 one of the parties of
 this Con federacy she cannot
 leave it without the consent
 of the other States and
 any attempt to do so
 is a violation of the
 contract And as we under
 stand it every wrong has
 its remedy and if that
 be so the only question
 is how that remedy shall
 be enforced Now I admit
 to the fullest extent the
 sovereignty of the people and
 the rizhts of the States
 yet when they come into
 thc Union and give in
 their adherence to the Federal
 Govern ment they yield up
 certain rights for the benefit
 of the whole and one
 of those rights given away
 is their right by their
 own consent to resolve themselves
 back into their original element
 at any time and at
 their own pleasure Then sir
 every individual yes every State
 should be held to strict
 obedience to the Constitution and
 laws of thc United States
 while the legislative enactments of
 the national Go vcl llruent
 are in accordance with hcr
 own Constitution Sir it would
 bc futile to attempt to
 close our eyes against the
 danger to which we are
 this day iious position MT
 hy are we this day
 standing as it were upon
 the very verge of our
 national ruin It can all
 be traced to the direct
 violation of the laws and
 Constitution of our national Union
 Now the Constitution of the
 United States makes express provision
 for Lhc recapture of fu
 gitives from labor and in
 pursuance of that pro vision
 of Ille Constitution the national
 Legisla ture in 1793 passed
 a fugitive slave law and
 that act for thc purpose
 of making it more effective
 to his Attorney General Mr
 Crittenden at that day as
 now one of the most
 masterly statesmen and best lawyers
 in the Union and he
 after due I reflection pronounced
 the act constitutional The Supreme
 Court of the United States
 have again and again pronounced
 the same judgment upon the
 same act Sir it is
 an undeniable fact that the
 execution of this law has
 been obstructed in every manner
 that could be devised by
 the most masterly intel lects
 in the Republican party And
 again sir twelve sovereign States
 of this Unioq have inter
 posed their legislative authority to
 prevent and obstruct the execution
 of that law Now this
 is nullification to the very
 fullest extent and these States
 are as guilty as wras
 South Carolina in 1833 They
 have set an example of
 the violation of law that
 is returning upon their own
 heads with an irresistible fury
 They have opened the flood
 gates of disobedience thgt is
 about to sweep before It
 to certain destruction all the
 elements of a well organized
 Government If a State reserved
 to herself the right to
 secede from the Confederacy the
 conditions upon which she intended
 to secede should have been
 clearly defined nt the time
 she entered the compact and
 then each State would unßerstand
 upon what con ditions each
 of the other members of
 the family occupied their positions
 within the common circle And
 if a State comes into
 the Union reservincr to herself
 thc tacit right to withdraw
 from the com pact whenever
 her rights in her own
 estimation it is a fraud
 upon the other have been
 violated contracting parties Now admit
 the right of a State
 to secede at pleasure or
 even allow her to be
 the judge of the causes
 suffcient to warrant her separation
 and it is the end
 of ail government and system
 and order are thrown into
 chaos and confusion The Constitution
 of the United Slates provides
 for the admission of new
 States into the compact but
 nowhere cither by word or
 even implication does that instrument
 make provision for the secession
 of a State or States
 and hence any attempt at
 the same is a direct
 violation of that article That
 instrument was intended to bind
 to gether the States and
 each one is an additional
 link in the great chain
 All civilized society is based
 upon strict obedience to law
 and hence the ne cessity
 of establishing proper tribunals to
 which individual citizens can resort
 to have their rights established
 and thcir wroncys redressed And
 no single individual can be
 allowed to avenge his own
 supposed injuries for in such
 a case society could have
 no guarantee for its safety
 a single day and courts
 and juries would become a
 nul lity If a State
 within the Confederacy supposes that
 the peace and safety of
 herself and the peace and
 safety of her institutions are
 endangered by remaining longer within
 the Union she should at
 least submit her causes of
 complaint before some disinterested umpire
 and leave it to the
 judgment important step was taken
 jointly We declared ourselVes a
 nation by a joint di0t
 by several acts and when
 the terms of our Confederation
 were reduced to form it
 was in that that they
 would collectively iOrm one nation
 for the pur pose oc
 conducting some certain domestic concerns
 and all relations in the
 instrument forming that Union is
 ibund an article which declares
 that evåry State shall abide
 by the determinations of Congress
 on all questions Vhich by
 that Confederation should be submitted
 to them But it is
 now too late to reason
 upon these im portant questions
 for I fear that the
 armless hand of destiny is
 tracing our inevitable destruction upon
 the wall in legible characters
 too plain to be misunderstood
 and that it will require
 no Daniel to be brought
 forth from his prison to
 the palace to give them
 their true interpretation But Mr
 Speaker let us examine the
 history of the past to
 see if we can discover
 the causes which have contributed
 to bring about the dan
 gers which now threaten to
 rmngle in one pro miscuous
 ruin our happy and prosperous
 coun try Let the question
 be seriously asked why it
 is that States are seceding
 from the Union and that
 this great Confederacy the masterpiece
 of the most illustrious men
 that ever graced or hon
 ored this or any other
 nation has been torn asun
 der These present diffculties are
 not the spon taneous production
 ofa day but of the
 unceasing and untiring threats taunts
 and insults of years I
 Bad faith disobedience of law
 and a host of other
 evils have brought upon us
 our present alarm ing and
 truly appalling condition In pursuance
 of that provision of the
 Constitution for the re capture
 of fugitives from labor Congress
 in 1793 defined the mode
 manner and means of recapture
 and in 1850 passed an
 act amendatory of that act
 making it more effective in
 its operations Then I ask
 has this law been obeyed
 and en forced in the
 northern States Every one who
 is acquainted with the history
 of the country is It
 is these acts ready to
 answer in the negative of
 disobedience upon the part of
 the northern States that are
 so rapidly alienating the two
 see tions from each other
 and digging an impassa ble
 gulf between people that should
 have always been one and
 which demands at the hands
 of all loyal and law
 abiding citizens an open condem
 nation and reproach I vvrelve
 of the northern States have
 not only refused to enforce
 its pro visions but have
 actually passed laws in direct
 violation of its spirit and
 letter and in h inderance
 of its execution When a
 State interposes its legislative authority
 to obstruct the due execution
 and enforcement of one of
 the constitutional acts of our
 National Legislature she is as
 guilty of nullification as was
 South Carolina in 1893 when
 she interposed her legislative authority
 in obstruc tion of the
 revenue laws of the United
 States However obnoxious a Paw
 may bc to our own
 sense of right and wrong
 we for the peace and
 safety of the nation should
 strictly obey until tl re
 of the same after full
 examination of ail the evi
 same is repealed or its
 obnoxious features are dcnce in
 thc case This Union under
 our Con If we in
 removed by the power that
 created it stitution and laws
 was intended to be perpetual
 tend to set at naught
 the laws of the State
 and and hence their silence
 upon all questions mvolv nation
 to which we look for
 protection and safety because they
 do not meet our preconceived
 and ing the right of
 separation Now sir it was
 the design of the framers
 of predetermined notions of justice
 let us cease to our
 national Government that we should
 live to condemn the pirates
 that infest our high seas
 plun gether in perfect peace
 and harmony And how our
 vessels murder the crews and
 unoffending passengers let us ccasc
 to condemn the midnight ever
 obnoxious the peculiar institutions of
 one section ilia y bc
 to the particular traininT and
 edu assassin that plunges his
 dagger to your heart cation
 of the others it is
 no just excuse for com
 merely to get possession of
 your purse let us cease
 plaint but upon thc other
 hand thev arc under I
 to condemn thc whole catalogue
 of crime for it is
 that tacit allegiance they owe
 to the laws and only
 a violation of law without
 which it would Government of
 the nation not only bound
 to tol cease to be
 criminal When we place ourselves
 erate their existence but to
 preserve and protect ii in
 such a situation we are
 upon a political sea them
 in their full use and
 occupation And had II without
 compass or polar star Listen
 to what exposed But what
 has led us to our
 present per l this idea
 been kept steadily before the
 public the hexo of New
 Orleans says upon that question
 mind and had it always
 becn faithfully and fer in
 the same proclamation ventlyobcyed and
 adhered to we should this
 day I consider then the
 power to annul a law
 of the Ini have been
 occupying that proud position which
 ineompatible with the I i
 ted States assunled by onc
 State has heretofore so cnu
 hatically characterized us as existence
 of the Union contradict ed
 expressly bv toe letter i
 of the Constitution unauthorized by
 its spirit inconsistent a nation
 and we would have still
 been livil ff in with
 every principle on which it
 xvas iOunded and destruc that
 harmonious union which was intended
 for i tiVe of the
 great object iOr which it
 was I onned us by
 our ancestors even before the
 foundation of Such was the
 opinion of Andrew Jackson at
 that our free and enlightened
 institutions That great day and
 that attempted nullification of the
 laws statesman Andrev r Jackson
 says in his cele brated
 proclamation in the case of
 South Carolina Of the United
 States he fearlessly and promptly
 suppressed and for that act
 more than any other was
 amended or reconstructed in 1850
 In every that In cur
 colonial state although dependent on
 another of his lifZ he
 has received the app ause
 and ap case in which
 t hat act has come
 before any court probation of
 the people of tho whole
 Union Powcr we very early
 considered ourselves as connected of
 competent jurisdiction they have always
 pro I Then sir in
 this case it is very

 Mr GOOCH Mr Speaker let
 mc say to my sition
 that any State can possibly

 that the reason why there
 are the war of 1812
 the whole New England States
 so many con victs in
 the State prison of Massa

 the British arms and chusctts
 is because all persons that
 ought to be again and

 Mr Speaker it is not
 my provincc to cover up
 the setts placed upon her

 evils of the people of
 any part of this Union
 for time which wo x
 vill not quote here for
 it was ex panged in
 1824 but which has placed
 upon her fair would warn
 these seceding southern States to
 escutchcona stain which cannotbe effaced
 throuoh be careful and thoroughly
 examine the whole question to
 see if the case will
 justify the effects the annals
 of time of posterity who
 is to be your judge
 for recol lect that Massachusetts
 and other disloyal States might
 have thought at the time
 that their injup es were
 suffcient and that they were
 suffering un bearable injustice at
 the hands of their country
 but they nov r feel
 that thev have placed upon
 themselves a stain that cannot
 bc effaced and washed out
 by time and a faithful
 repentance And such will be
 the fate of these seceding
 States and such will be
 the unputütion cast upon all
 who contribute the smallest iota
 in the break ing up
 of this glorious Union of
 States Look sir at their
 prosperity since the beginning of
 the trade has increased from
 Government to 350 000 000
 their wealth has ad vanced
 to 20 000 000 000
 their population frotn one and
 one halfto twelve million her
 geograph ical area is nine
 hundred thousand square miles and
 her prosperity has been unparalleled
 her na tionai position unequaled
 for natural advantages and her
 political greatness is unrivaled And
 howr has she thus swelled
 to such magnificent magnitude All
 undcr the benign influence of
 the national Government and all
 under the protec tion of
 the national flag and can
 she thus break up the
 one and insult Che other
 This is the best Governmentupon
 the face of the earth
 and we do not believe
 that any State can find
 a just and sufficient cause
 to separate herself from it
 South Carolina Alabama Mississippi Geor
 gia Leuisiana and Florida have
 recently in sol emn convention
 assembled passed ordinances of secession
 and no longer consider thcmsclvcs
 as part and parcel of
 this great Confederacy of States
 The whole nation seems to
 be agitated and appalled from
 center to circumference and a
 revolution solemnly though certainly seems
 to be making rapid strides
 in our midst Now sir
 what has either one of
 the se seceding States suffered
 at the hands of the
 Federal Government to thus with
 out cause or provocation break
 up a union of Slates
 that givcs protection not only
 to every State but every
 citizen of every State What
 is the reason assigned by
 each one cf those States
 for the fatal and important
 step so hastily taken The
 election of Lincoln to the
 Presidency of the United States
 who is a Repub lican
 And we must say that
 however much we regret the
 occurrence of that fact yet
 it is no just cause
 for the step thus taken
 Now no citlzen even of
 those States can deny that
 Mr Lincoln was legally and
 constitutionally elected to that high
 position and that being the
 case it is not Mr
 Speaker again at the time
 the great State not in
 theirown estimation but in tbc
 estimation I only the duty
 of every law abiding citizen
 to tacitly submit but to
 lend all aid in his
 solemn in according to the
 due forms of law and
 then to await patiently the
 development of his administration And
 then if it does not
 like the dews of heaven
 fall alike upon ali classes
 then and not till then
 let our voices be heard
 And if that is done
 and the President should over
 at tempt any overt act
 by which he should even
 attempt to interfere with the
 established institu tions of any
 section we pledge the sympathy
 and support of a half
 million of freemen to their
 pro tection and support from
 the Northwest We think that
 it is going a step
 too far to presume in
 the advance of taking his
 seat that the Executive will
 take any measures to apply
 to practice the il re
 pressible conflict doctrine and under
 that violent presumption to lay
 violent hands upon the Union
 of the States We regret
 sincerely the success of the
 Republican party in the recent
 presidential campaign but we must
 acknowledge that it has all
 the forms of law to
 support it W c belicve
 thc seceding States do not
 pretend to bc actincr upon
 anything which has already transpired
 but upon that which is
 to occur and they are
 only fearful that the incoming
 Admin istration will do something
 which will operate deleteriously upon
 their peculiar institution and which
 is to result in its
 final extinction President elect has
 said that slave and free
 States cannot exist together that
 they must ail become that
 they were incornpatiblc in one
 or the other principle and
 must one or the qther
 yield But sir every intelligent
 man must know that al
 though that assertion was made
 by Mr Lincoln and that
 upon that assertion the Republican
 party seized upon him and
 under the excitement of the
 hour elected him President of
 the IJnited States yet it
 is false and the whole
 experience of our constitutional existence
 proves it to be false
 for there are at this
 day more slave States than
 he 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 655 vhole Union contained both
 free and slave in its
 inception besides a greater number
 of free States even than
 slave Then sir no region
 of this nation whatever may
 be its peculiar insti tutions
 has anything to apprehend from
 a politi cal principle based
 upon an untruth I vlr
 Speaker I am truly rejoiced
 to know that my colleague
 Mr SHERMAN has at last
 come to the conclusion that
 for the safety and preserva
 tion of this Union the
 Constitution must be ob served
 and the laws must be
 enforced And I regret that
 the whole Republican party had
 not discovered that important fact
 long since for it would
 have saved this nation from
 its present per ilous crisis
 Then sir I cannot believe
 that any of these seceding
 States had a just or
 at least stifiicient cause for
 so hastily and abruptly break
 ing off their conncct ion
 with this Confederacy for we
 consider it as a self
 evident proposition that ours is
 the best system of Government
 ever produced by human ingenuit
 y for the happiness and
 prosperity of any people and
 all who cannot live within
 its pale and precincts do
 not deserve to have a
 Government And those who stand
 upon this floor and talk
 so loudly about its oppres
 sion its tyranny its corruption
 and its unequal working are
 only acting under the misguided
 and uncertain effects ofa heated
 imagination Condem n not our
 institutions for they offer equal
 rights to all and monopoly
 and opprcssion to none for
 by so doing you are
 casting an imputation upon your
 own ancestry and oftu ing
 an insult to the spirit
 that conceived and the genius
 that brought forth the most
 complete plan of popular rights
 that has ever been devised
 and which political earthquake is
 shaking the solid foun dation
 of European thrones Let our
 glorious sun be extinguished in
 the political firmament and i
 it will be succeeded by
 a long political night the
 darkness of which will only
 be dispelled by the splendid
 dawn of the Inorn of
 that grand millen nium that
 is to renovate the world
 Sir there are no conditions
 upon which I or the
 constituency which I have the
 honor to rep resent can
 give up this Union and
 I would be recreant to
 the duty which I owe
 to myself to them and
 to all posterity if I
 were in the slight est
 degree to favor such mn
 idea And in order that
 I may bc clearly understood
 I believe that this Government
 possesses the power within itself
 to perpetuate its own existence
 for if it docs not
 or if it never did
 or if the salt has
 lost its savor the sooner
 it the sooner it is
 known the better is thrown
 out and trodden undet foot
 of men of aspirants of
 demogogues the better We ought
 not for another day to
 be thus placing our exalted
 hopes of empire upon the
 baseless fabric of this VISIon
 What is our condition to
 day The credit of our
 nation sacrificed and destroyed by
 the spirit of faction and
 whereas but three we could
 have commanded the confidencc and
 coffers of Europe to the
 extent of at the very
 smallest rate of interest we
 cannot to day keep up
 our current expenses in loans
 from our own citizens at
 the heavy rate of twelve
 per cent Her trade is
 paralyzed her industry checked her
 citizens thrown out of employment
 her manufac turing establishments stopped
 her merchants and business men
 clamoring and her agricultural in
 terests the certain Source of
 her real wealth corn pletely
 prostrated Her States seceding hc
 r ports arsenals forts castles
 and dock yards seized her
 vessels takcn and fired into
 her flag torn from its
 place insulted and hurled to
 the dust and all by
 the madness of faction and
 our people seemingly bent upon
 their own ruin Mr Speaker
 are we thus suddenly to
 be cut off without hope
 and destroyed without remedy I
 believe for the present It
 is the duty of the
 Government to protect her property
 to keep open her ports
 and collect her revenue and
 if that is coercion we
 are for coercion to that
 cxtent My collearrue Mr PENDLETON
 in his masterly and eloquent
 spccch and his rnost ingenious
 and able aro ument mistook
 the whole cause of the
 Amer ican Revolution upon which
 he based his elegant and
 eloquent remarks Did the American
 people refusc to pay their
 taxes Did they refuse to
 pay the revenue Did they
 refuse to pay their duties
 Did they refuse these obligations
 to the English Government They
 did But what was the
 cause It was because these
 things were imposed upon them
 without their consent and it
 was taxation without representation They
 had laws put upon them
 which they had no say
 in making and the enforcement
 of which was undertaken against
 a free and independent people
 without their consent and they
 did just what they ought
 to have done they resisted
 and in that bold resistance
 they re ceived the sympathy
 of all civilized nations and
 the support of the empire
 of France But sir has
 not every State an equal
 represent ation in the national
 Legislature Is the people of
 any section taxed without representation
 and have not all the
 revenue laws found upon our
 statute books been passed by
 this Congress and received the
 sicnature of the Executive of
 the Union Why sir so
 jealous is this Government of
 the rights of the whole
 people that the Terri tories
 which in reality are our
 colonies and occupy about the
 same position to us that
 wc in our colorlial condition
 sustained to the English Government
 are exempt from the obligations
 of taxation and because they
 have not a full repre
 sentation upon this floor the
 whole expenses of the government
 of a Territory are defrayed
 by the national Govcrnment And
 with all duc deference to
 the opinions of my distinguished
 colleague I must consider it
 as unjust to this magnificent
 Government and to the constituents
 of every Representative upon this
 floor to even compare the
 workings of our free institutions
 to the tyranny and oppression
 of the English Gov ernment
 which aroused the outraged and
 insulted colonies to a successful
 resistance The Ameri can Revolution
 is the most brilliant and
 glorious in history simply because
 it was founded upon right
 and justice and resistance tyrants
 The present secession movemeut is
 beneath the dig nity of
 the American people because it
 presents the spectacle to tl
 te world of the bravest
 and Inost chivalrous people upon
 earth fleeing in the advance
 ofa mere ghost of tyranny
 a specter painted upon the
 imarinary map of a distant
 future Sir did the American
 colonies act upon the unreal
 imagery of fancy or the
 cer tain earnestness of a
 devoted truth Sir in the
 present position of the crisis
 I am opposed to coercing
 any of these seceding States
 because 1 believe the tramp
 and tread of hostile armies
 would in reality p14ce our
 people at a re turnless
 distance from each other And
 I believe that the wholc
 question ig yet within the
 reach and arrangements of the
 arts ot peace I believe
 that concession and comprolnise is
 now as it has been
 on many occasions heretofore potent
 in the full adjustment of
 every difficulty that now besets
 i he satisfactory adjustment of
 this whole us question is
 yet within the hands of
 the Republi can party they
 hold in their hands the
 destiny of this empire and
 it yet remains to be
 demonstrated to the country and
 to the world whether they
 will hold on to their
 platform at the expense of
 the Republic whether they will
 hold I on to the
 shadow at the expense of
 the substance The eagle eye
 of a distracted and disturbed
 na tion is upon them
 and will they pour oil
 upon its troubled waters And
 though the General Gov errnnent
 may possess the full right
 to coerce a State in
 the present disturbed condition of
 the southern mind it would
 be ruinous in its results
 for this seceding Inovcmcnt has
 the sympathy and in case
 of war would have the
 support of every southern State
 and it would be bringing
 twelve million determined and brave
 people in collision with eighteen
 and God only knows what
 would be the end of
 such a contest but there
 is it would be the
 end of the one thing
 certain American Republic Now sir
 there are propositions upon which
 thcsc questions can be fully
 settled and it is the
 duty of all parties to
 throw aside all platforms and
 conu_ forward to the rescue
 Let us resort to concession
 and compromise for in this
 we have the precept and
 example of Clav and Web
 ster Calhoun Cass and Jackson
 mid all others of the
 great statesmen who have graced
 our halls of legislation But
 sir we cannot pursue this
 all absorbing question any further
 but must turn out attention
 to the great West the
 revion which we more immediately
 represent we cannot have secession
 we cannot tolerate separation we
 can not listen to dissolution
 for in that event we
 are sippi river to go
 beyond their control without the
 utmost strife We are told
 here by gentlemen that the
 southern confederacy when formed do
 not design to close that
 natural highway against the greai
 West But stop gentlemen and
 listen to reason when that
 southern confederacy is formed it
 will be as much a
 foreign Power as far as
 we are concerned as France
 was at the time we
 made our purchase it was
 then closed against us and
 if it falls into the
 hands of a for eign
 Power it will be again
 But again we are told
 that the necessities of trade
 will keep it per petually
 open to the enterprising of
 all that mighty region which
 it drains That may do
 for the sun shme of
 peace but the clouds of
 war may over shadow and
 then will you allow the
 free naviga tion of the
 Mississippi river No sir our
 trade will be cut off
 our products will rot upon
 our hands and our whole
 commercial and agricul tural interests
 will be ruined Again we
 are asked if we doubt
 the honor and integrity of
 our southern brethren We do
 not while you remain part
 and parcel of us but
 as soon as you separate
 without cause or provoca tion
 from us wc will have
 to regard you as we
 regard all other foreicners enemies
 in war in peace friends
 And why are you this
 day refus lng to trust
 the Republican party upon a
 legal and constitutional election with
 the reins of this Government
 It is because it is
 sectional in its fi elings
 and forms and pledged to
 the doctrine of the irrepressible
 conflict and to the final
 pxterm ination of your own
 peculiar institution Now sir there
 is no power upon earth
 to which we will silently
 yield to take peaceable possession
 of that river for gentlemen
 at any hour with a
 very slight expense of blood
 and treasure you can close
 that stream against us and
 ruin our peculiar institutions Mr
 Speaker it was at the
 urgent demand of the people
 of the Northwest that the
 mouth of the Mississippi was
 purchased When we were but
 one half million people we
 soon discovered that the products
 of that vast region must
 find an outlet at some
 point and naturally turning our
 eyes upon the Mississippi we
 saw at once that that
 was the outlet to that
 whole productive coun try but
 it was in the hands
 of a foreign Power We
 demanded its acquisition at the
 hands of Mr Jef ferson
 who was then President of
 the United States He examined
 the Constitution and was led
 to the conclusion that that
 instrument did not vest the
 powerin the General Government to
 make such a purchase Sir
 he was told that there
 was a power above the
 Constitution and that was the
 voice of the people and
 he looked again to that
 article and he found that
 it was inserted there that
 all powers not delegated by
 this Constitu tion are rcscrved
 to the States and people
 finding nothing there prohibiting such
 an arrangc ment he concluded
 he had the authority and
 under that supposition he added
 to the Union that grand
 and fertile region and thereby
 ob tained for us the
 mouth the Mississippi and can
 it be imagined fora rrioment
 that at this day we
 will give it over to
 seceders to satisfy their in
 satiable thirst for power We
 are now nine mik lion
 people our wealth has amounted
 to the sum of 700
 000 000 we have advanced
 more rapidly than any other
 region we have the most
 loyal population in the country
 we are for the Urnon
 of these States the whole
 Union as it is we
 are for each and every
 right of each and every
 citizen And do they suppose
 that we will give up
 our I right to that
 mighty stream If they do
 they are miserably mistaken Then
 sir let these vexed questions
 be settled at every hazard
 for viewing them in their
 rnoet favorable light they will
 brincr upon thc nation all
 the terrible consequences of Civil
 war bloodshed and rapine And
 are you willing to day
 to have Lincoln like the
 ancient emperors of Mexico installed
 into the Chief Magistracy of
 the Ameri can Republic over
 a hecatomb of human sacri
 fic es Recollect that but
 a few months ago you
 were asserting that the election
 of your candidate would give
 peace and prosperity and happiness
 to the nation and that
 confidence would bc fully restored
 and in the short space
 of three months after that
 event are you demanding at
 the hands rained And I
 say here to day that
 there are of the nation
 the powers of the Al
 my and Navy eight million
 people loyal to the Constitution
 and not to repel foreign
 aggression but to butcher and
 faithful to the Union occupying
 that vast valley I destroy
 your own citizens Sir I
 do not believe who will
 nevor suffer the mouth of
 the Missis l that this
 can be I do not
 believe that the end of
 656 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 31 the Republic isyet but
 I believc there is yet
 suf II freemen who inhabit
 this great and growing coun
 ficient moral force to repel
 all physical force and that
 the nation will again be
 restwed to its ori ginal
 exalted position among the nations
 of the earth and yet
 remain as an evidence of
 the capa city of this
 people for self government There
 are men yet livmg who
 were present at the birth
 of the Republic and shall
 they survive as mourners around
 its grave Shall the soldiers
 I of the Revolution survive
 to see the splendid fab
 ric erected by themselves totter
 to its fall for a
 few of them remain as
 the last rays of the
 set ting sun upon the
 loftiest mountain peak I be
 lieve that the nations demand
 at our hand to set
 tle this question in harmony
 and peace and he who
 fails to do it or
 determines to do otherwise will
 bring upon himself the perpetual
 infamy of an injured and
 outraged people The question is
 not shall we adhere to
 our own political notions but
 the question is shall we
 be plunged in a civil
 war or shall our nation
 still continue to shed forth
 the benign influences of peace
 Recollect that from the smallest
 causes some times flow the
 mightiest results A princess of
 the house of Austria once
 carelessly remarked that kings and
 potentates should pay no morc
 attention to the voice of
 the people than to the
 barking of dogs and this
 single observation so inflamed the
 public mind in France that
 that same princess in the
 short space ofa few years
 saw the heads of kings
 and princes rolling from be
 neath the ax of the
 guillotine like autumn leaves after
 a desolate storm and that
 storm did not ceasc till
 it had driven religion from
 its sanctuary virtue from her
 empire and government from existence
 and finally brought about those
 terrible campaigns that desolated every
 division of Europe and one
 million one hundrcd thousand men
 were at one tirne arrayed
 in hostile combat against each
 other Then I believe that
 this day this national Legis
 lature holds within its control
 the destiny of thirty million
 people Allow it to slip
 unimproved bc yond your power
 allow the American people an
 appeal to arms in the
 udjustmej t of their imagined
 rights and you will be
 responsible for its results for
 you hold in your hands
 the olive branch of What
 American citizen does not feel
 a glow of pride thrili
 his very soul to see
 the present Exec utive in
 the declimng days of his
 administration standing by the Constitution
 and Union enforcing the national
 laws elevating our flag and
 showing a determination at all
 hazards to preserve and per
 petuate our national honor Who
 docs not ud mire the
 brave and chivalrous Major Anderson
 who in the integrity of
 his heart with an iron
 wikl a patriotic spirit and
 a firm resolution is standing
 by his own and his
 nation s glory He will
 never allow that flag that
 he has been sent to
 protect to trail in the
 dust Let him as a
 gallant soldier be firm and
 unwavcrino in the discharge of
 his duty for the burning
 focus of the nation s
 cyc is upon him as
 one of her noblest sons
 The indelible expression of hutnan
 crratitudc is comincr up from
 every part of an injured
 nation and the ceaseless homage
 of all posterity will identify
 his name with the history
 of his country f am
 willing 10 go for the
 Crittenden proposition not that it
 meets my own political views
 for thcy are in direct
 opposition to many of my
 notions of policy but I
 believe that it will settle
 the present diffculties more fully
 and satisfactorily than any other
 before this body and the
 country It comes from a
 statesman whose experience reaches through
 three fourths of ocu constitutional
 exist ence and who certainly
 understands as well as any
 other man living the spirit
 of our institutions It comes
 and the theory of our
 Government from a statesman who
 is not ultra but conserva
 live in his whole political
 policy and in favor of
 the Constitution and Union and
 the enforcement it comes frorn
 a patriot who like of
 the iaw myself does not
 believe that there is any
 question upon which he could
 consent to give up this
 Union but who believes that
 all ntdionul questions are within
 the reach and adjustment of
 the arts of try it
 would fall like thunder tones
 on this Con gress commanding
 it to arrange this detestable
 question for it is only
 uselessly disturbing t he peace
 of a people that should
 live together in har monious
 unison 1f we could listen
 to the two hundred million
 oppressed and downtrodden Eu ropeans
 they would say to us
 perpetuate the American Republic in
 peace for it is a
 terrible example to trembling tyrants
 upon their crum bling thrones
 If we could hear the
 language of the opprcssed of
 the whole civilized earth they
 would say to this Congress
 keep the Amcrican flag wavino
 in triumph over your whole
 nation for among whatever people
 it is seen over whatever
 ocean it is flying in
 whatever port it makes its
 appearance all people are pointing
 tout and cx claiming Behold
 the flag of liberty that
 is taking away the slavery
 and oppression of the world
 Mr ADAMS of Massachusetts obtained
 the floor Mr MORRIS of
 Pennsylvania If the gen tleman
 from Massachusetts does not desire
 to go on this evening
 desire to submit some remarks
 I am afraid I shall
 have no other to the
 House opportunity and if the
 House will permit me I
 will take advantage of the
 present occasion I will very
 Mr ADAMS of Massachusetts cheerfully
 yield to the gentleman from
 Pennsyl vania if it be
 understood that I shall have
 the floor to morrow Mr
 LOGAN I object to any
 such under standing Mr MAYNARD
 I desire for reasons to
 ad dress the I louse
 and through the House my
 I applied to the constituents
 upon this subject Speaker last
 week and I was assured
 by him that his poliey
 would be first coine first
 served I therefore have not
 negotiated for the floor or
 made any arrangement relying upon
 the promise I re ceivcd
 in reference to the order
 which would be observed in
 assigning the floor Mr MORRIS
 of Pennsylvania The gentle man
 from Massachusetts has the floor
 and if he yields it
 I claim it Mr MAYNARD
 If that is not to
 be observed there should be
 some understanding between those gentlemen
 who desire to speak and
 the Speaker so that we
 may know when we can
 speak or know the fact
 that we cannot speak I
 yield thc Mr ADAMS of
 Massachusetts floor to the gentleman
 frorn Pennsylvania Mr FARNSWORTH 1
 object to any ar Ifthe
 gentle ranoement in reference to
 the floor man yields the
 floor he must yield it
 uncondi tionaily Mr VALLANDIGHAM would
 propose that by unanimous consent
 to night and to mor
 row we take a recess
 from half past four to
 seven o clock Objection was
 made Mi MORRIS of Pennsylvania
 I will take advantage of
 this opportunlty unfavorable as it
 is to present such views
 as I desire to the
 House upon the questions before
 it Mr LOGAN Will the
 gentleman Mr MORRIS of Pennsylvania
 The gentlc man cannot be
 heard now because I am
 upon the floor Mr LOGAN
 Then I rise to a
 point of order The gentleman
 from Massachusetts obtained the floor
 but yielded it to the
 gentleman from Penn sylvania to
 go on to night with
 the understanding that he should
 have the floor to morrow
 mornino I objected to that
 arranaement Mr MORRIS of Pennsylvania
 The gentle man from Massachuset
 ts yielded the floor to
 me Mr LOGAN If the
 gentleman from Penn sylvania vilk
 not allow me to ask
 a single ques tion I
 shall insist upon mv objection
 Mr MORRIS of do not
 see why the gentleman sliould
 object to my going on
 to nicrh t Mr LOGAN
 I have rcnlåined here with
 other entlemen several evenings for
 the purpose of obtaining the
 floor and I want the
 Speaker now to tell me
 how man v names are
 registered as en peace Mr
 Speaker we believe that if
 the patriots who I lived
 in the pasl could speak
 from their last rest ing
 place they would say to
 the national Legis jature settle
 that all absorbing question for
 it is incompatible in principle
 for people of the same
 blood to bc disputing over
 a mere abstraction If we
 could listen to the voice
 of the thirty million titled
 in order to the floor
 to speak so that I
 may know on what evening
 I shall come here to
 obtain the floor by acting
 decently and respect fully to
 the Speaker SPEAKER pro tempore
 Mr BINGHAM in the chair
 The present occupant of the
 chair cannot answer that question
 Mr LOGAN I desire to
 say that this practice of
 farming out the floor in
 advance is infamous and ought
 not to be tolerated in
 any body I vant the
 country to know that such
 perfidy as this is practiced
 by the Speaker of this
 House to the ex I
 now withdraw my clusion of
 other mernbers I objection Mr
 COLFAX The Speaker is absent
 and 1 feel it due
 to him to say that
 during this discus sion two
 members from Illinois have had
 the floor upon that side
 and only one from this
 side i Mr LOGAN I
 am not speaking for Illinois
 but for myself I Mr
 McCLERNAND The Speaker of the
 House did not give me
 the floor and I doubt
 whether he would have given
 it to me had he
 been in the chair And
 besides that I did not
 get the floor upon this
 question buL upon another Mr
 LOGAN I do not object
 to the gentle man from
 Pennsylvania on All I wanted
 was to denounce this practice
 as detestable and abominable Mr
 MORRIS of Penns ia then
 add ressed His speech will
 be the House for an
 hour published in the Appendix
 Mr FARNSWORTH obtained the floor

 am charged to pre public
 T lic interest of commerce
 is but one The interest
 ofarrricult ure manufactures and mining
 each of them is anot
 her Each is entitled to
 and each secures equal respect
 and the consideration which they
 obtain is due not to
 tl leir n umber not
 to their wealth but is
 due to the circmnstances under
 which they lend their advice
 to the Govern ment But
 I do not hesitate to
 say that the char acter
 of these p tibioners entitles
 theill 10 the re spcctCul
 attenl en and consideration of
 Congress 1 hcy havc asked
 ine to support this petition
 I have not yot found
 though I have anxiously waited
 for and hoped for that
 mnniföst ation of tempet on
 the part of the people
 of the country and their
 representatives which would justify mc
 in saving that the seceding
 States or those w 110
 them have made propositions i
 sympathizé xvith which the citizens
 of the adhering States could
 accept or as I desire
 to speak with impartiality I
 upon this as all other
 occasions to put the proposiLi0
 l in another form that
 this or any other of
 the various propositions which have
 conw from citizens of the
 adhering States or those who
 de sire to adhere to
 tho Union won d not
 bc accept able and satisfactory
 to the other party I
 have thought it my duty
 to hold myselfopeT1 and ready
 for the best adiüstmcnt which
 could bc practi cally maele
 anil I have therefore been
 obliged to I ask this
 connnittee to bc content with
 the assur ance that I
 would express to the public
 und 10 the Senate that
 the spirit in wl iich
 they comc is perfectly commendable
 and i evfcctly satisfactory lb
 is gratifying to rne to
 sec that the proper spirit
 the spirit of fraternal kindness
 of conciliation and affection is
 adopted by so large a
 portion of my fellow citizens
 of the State to which
 I belong also in return
 for perform I have asked
 them incr my du ty
 on this occasion that when
 they have arrived at home
 they will act in the
 same spirit and manifest their
 devotion to the Union above
 all other in terests and
 all other scut mt llts
 speak ing for the Union
 by voting for the Union
 and if it should be
 demanded by lend ina and
 oven giv intr their rnoney
 the Union and fiohting in
 the last resort for the
 Union taking care always that
 speaking o oes before votincr
 volin r goes bcfore riving
 n oney and all go
 before a battle which I
 i i sl ould regard
 as hazardous and dangerous and
 nercforc the last as it
 won d be the most
 painful measure to be resorted
 to for the salvation of
 the NEW SERIES NO 42
 settled for the Union I
 have not been so rash
 as to expect that in
 sixty days which have been
 allowed to us since the
 meeting of Congress and i
 will be frank sir in
 saying that I have not
 expected that in the ninety
 days which are the allotted
 term of Congress this great
 controversy would certainly bé adjusted
 peace restored and the Union
 firmly reéstablished knew sir that
 sixty days or ninety days
 was the torm that was
 fixed Witb definite objects and
 purposes by that portion of
 my fellow citizens who have
 thought that it would consult
 the interests of the States
 to which they belonged to
 dissever the Union I have
 not expected that reason and
 judgment would come back to
 the people and become so
 pervading so universal as that
 they would ap preciate the
 danger and bc able to
 agree on the have been
 willing that it should remedies
 Still be tried though unsuccessfully
 but my confi dence has
 remained the same for this
 simple rea son that as
 I have not believed that
 the passion and frenzy of
 the hour could overturn this
 great fabric of constitu tional
 liberty and empire in ninety
 days so I have felt
 sure that there would be
 t ime even after the
 expiration of ninety days for
 the restoration of all that
 had been lost and for
 the rcéstablislnncnt of all that
 vvas in danger A great
 Inany and very various interests
 and elcmonts are brought into
 conflict in this sudden cusis
 a a reat rnanv personal
 ambitions a great many sectional
 interests and it would be
 strange if they could all
 bc accommodated arid arranged and
 harmonized so as to admit
 and give full effect to
 the onc profoundest strongest and
 most en sentiment or passion
 of the United States that
 of devotion to the Union
 These whether call thct n
 soccssi011 or revolution on the
 one side or coercion or
 defiance on the other are
 all to subside and pass
 away before tho Union is
 to become the grand absorbi2
 lR object of interest afl
 ectinn and duty upon the
 part of the citizens of
 the United States A great
 many partisan in terests arc
 to be represscd suppressed and
 to give place partisan interests
 expressed by the Charleston platform
 by the Baltimore platform by
 the Chicago platform und by
 the popular sov creitrnty platform
 if indeed the Union is
 in dan ger and is
 to bc saved and with
 thesc interests and with these
 platforms everybody standing upon tncm
 or connected with them is
 to pass away if the
 Union is in danger and
 is to be saved beforc
 the Union can bc saved
 But it will require if
 this Union is in danger
 and a very short time
 does require to be saved
 f ör all these interests
 and all thcsc platforms and
 ali these men te dis
 and cvcrybody who shall appear
 You and I oppose resist
 stand in the way of
 the preserva tion of this
 Union will appear but as
 moths on a surnrncr eve
 when the whirlwind of popular
 indignation arises that shall bc
 excited nt the full discovery
 that this Union is endangered
 through faction or even impracticability
 on our part I have
 hope confidence that all this
 is t come around just
 as I have said and
 quite soon enough bccausc I
 perceive although we may shut
 our eyes to it that
 the country and mankind cannot
 shut their eyes to the
 true naturc of this crisis
 has been a real a
 vital question in this There
 country for twc vc years
 at least a question of
 slavc ry in the Territories
 of the United States It
 was stroneest in its development
 in 1850 when ail the
 Pacific coast and ali the
 territory interven and the Louisiana
 purchase was ing between it
 thrown upon our hands all
 of a sudden for the
 purpose of our org anizing
 in them free and inde
 pendent repuk tica n governments
 as a basis of future
 States It has been an
 earnest and I regret to
 say an an rry controvcrsv
 but the admission of Kansas
 into Union yesterday settled at
 Icast all that vas vital
 01 important in the question
 Union This is the spirit
 in which I have determined
 leaving behind nothing but the
 passions which Kansas is in
 the or mvself to c
 0kne up to this great
 question and the contest had
 engendered as i sincerely believe
 we shall Union California and
 Oregon are in the Union
 to pass through it and
 now the same contest divides
 and distracts although this great
 con this Union for freedom
 and slavery in the Terri
 troversy has not been already
 settled I do not tories
 of the United States just
 as before therefore any the
 less calculate upon and hope
 MT hat is the extent
 of ihe Territories which and
 expect that it will be
 pcacefully settled and 658 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 31 remain
 after thc admission of Minnesota
 of Ore gon of California
 and of Kansas One million
 sixty three thousand five hundred
 and seven square miles an
 area twenty four times that
 of the State of New
 York the largest of the
 old and fully developed States
 rmventv four such States as
 this of New York are
 yei to be organized within
 the remaining Territories of the
 United States Now under what
 is accepted by the Administration
 of the Government as u
 judicial degree upheld by it
 put in practical operation by
 it every inch of that
 territory is slave territory I
 speak of that decision not
 as I accept it but
 as it is accepted and
 enforced by Ihe existing Administration
 every foot of it slave
 territory as much as South
 Carolina Over a considerable portion
 of ita slave code made
 by a government created by
 the Congress of the United
 States is enforced so that
 accordinff to the claims of
 those who insist upon a
 right In the territory of
 the United States for slavery
 the whole of this one
 million sixty thrce thousand square
 miles is slave territory How
 many slaves arc there in
 it How many have been
 brought into it during these
 twelve years in which it
 has been not only relinquished
 to slavery but in which
 the court and the Legislature
 and the Administration have maintained
 protected defended and guar antied
 slavery there Twenty four African
 slaves one slave for every
 forty four thousand square miles
 one slave for every one
 of the twenty four States
 which supposing them each to
 be of the dimensions of
 New York or Pennsylvania or
 In diana are to cover
 that portion of the area
 of our Republic Sir I
 have followed this thing in
 good faith with zeal and
 energy but I confess that
 i havc no fears of
 slavery now where in the
 pecu liar of things which
 has existed slavery has succeeded
 in planting only one slave
 upon every forty four thousand
 square miles of terri This
 then has ceased to be
 a practical ques In lieu
 of it counts up a
 great and vital and tion
 fearful question tho qqestion of
 Union or ofdis solut ion
 of the Union the question
 of country or of no
 country the question of hope
 the question of greatness the
 question of sinking forevcr under
 the contempt of mankind Why
 then that a great people
 of thirty should I despair
 million will be able to
 meet t his crisis have
 no fear This is a
 Confi deracy It is not
 an imperial Government nor the
 governrnent of a single Stute
 it is u Confederacy and
 it is as it ought
 to be dependent upon the
 continued assent of ull the
 members of the Confi deracy
 to its ex istence and
 subject to dissolution by their
 action but that assent IS
 to be always taken by
 virtuc of the original assent
 and held until in the
 form pre scribed by the
 Constitution itself and in the
 time and in the man
 ner and with all lhc
 condi lions whicl i the
 Constitution prescribes those who constitute
 the Union shall declare that
 it shall bc no longer
 I l C thirty days
 uncl sixty days an l
 ninety days given us by
 the disunionists nay not be
 enough I hope ai d
 fi t their policy and
 their purposes trust that it
 may be time enough for
 the policy and purposes of
 the lovers of he Union
 God gralll that it may
 be so But if this
 term shall turn out not
 to be enough then see
 how and when all these
 great controversies will be settled
 just as our forefathers foresaw
 when they framed the Constitution
 They provided seventy years ago
 that this present controversy this
 whole con trovers y shall
 be subrnitted to the people
 of the United States in
 convention called accordincy to the
 forms of the Constitution and
 acting in the manner prescribed
 by it Then sir this
 coun try will find sudden
 relief in the prompt and
 l_tnnn imous adoption of the
 measures necessary its salvation and
 the wm ld will see
 how well and how wisely

 four sovereiffn States can adjust

 Chair The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 in tbc chair What disposition
 will the Senator make of
 the petition Mr FESSENDEN 1
 should like to know who
 has the floor The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Virginia
 The motion to print will
 neces sarily go to the
 Committee on Printing Mr MASON
 I move that the petition
 be printed a motion that
 I shall probably withdraw after
 I have concluded the very
 few remarks that I desire
 to make The petition as
 I understand Mr President has
 not been read and so
 far as I heard the
 hon orable Senator who introduced
 it Iam not aware that
 he stated what the substance
 of the petition was We
 have been told however through
 the public journals that such
 a petition was to be
 pre sented the substance being
 to recommend to the Congress
 of thc United States such
 amendments to the Constitution as
 might preserve the Union or
 restore it somewhat upon the
 basis of those offered by
 the Senator from Kentucky In
 the remarks made by the
 honorable Senator who in troduced
 it if 1 am wrong
 he will correct me he
 did not advert to these
 recommendations of the petitioners Mr
 SEWARD lthink honorable Senator was
 not in his place when
 rose to present the I
 sent it to the Cierk
 s desk and the petition
 Clerk read a paper which
 was submitted by the committee
 who have charge of the
 memorial in which they recommended
 witli some modifica tions what
 are called the border State
 proposi tions Mr MASON 1
 was not in the Chamber
 at the moment tl 1C
 petition was presented but I
 in quired of one near
 me whether the petition had
 been rcad It seems I
 was not at fault the
 res olutions I understand that
 xvcre adopted at the meeting
 of the committee were read
 But what I was about
 to remark Mr Presi dent
 was that at this time
 when the Govern ment is
 in process of disintecn ation
 when there are six States
 which have separated themselves from
 the Union as they say
 finally and forever when other
 States not yet separated are
 arnuno thernselves arming upon a
 largo scale when my own
 State appropriated twelve months a
 yo in expectation of what
 seems now to be occurrin
 F the very large sum
 from a State treasury in
 ad vance of 500 000
 to purchase arms to arm
 her people when here within
 a few days another appropriation
 was made of 1 for
 the same pcople when we
 find that purpose to arrn
 her other States have done
 the same thing when we
 find in my own State
 and in other States also
 that the people are arming
 themselves that the counties and
 the towns exercising their mnnicipal
 authority are raising money upon
 the credit of the counties
 and the towns to arm
 the people when that state
 of things is goin Y
 on and the pub lic
 mind is engaged in those
 of the slave States that
 have not yet separated and
 in some of the free
 States in devising a possible
 mode by which the American
 mind can acrain be united
 in a com mon Government
 what do we hear from
 the hon orable Senator from
 New York What do wc
 hcat from that Senator who
 occupies the osition before the
 country which is occupied that
 Senator acknowledged at the head
 of the political combinations which
 are to bring into power
 the incomincr Administration said through
 the news paper press to
 be the probable right hand
 of the new Administration What
 do Twve hear from that
 honorable Senator Any suggestions from
 such a quarter a quarter
 of such weight as to
 what he will recommend to
 thc majority of the States
 in order to meet the
 demands be they just or
 unjust of the slave States
 None Any re mark approvino
 or disapproving of propositions that
 arc before the country and
 arc before Con gress for
 amending the Constitution in this
 re gard None W c
 know what his opinions are
 upon the resolution offered by
 the venerable oent eman from
 Kentucky Mr CRITTENDEN who sits
 before rne not by his
 declarations but by his votes
 his votes unifbrm and W
 c know what his views
 arc In the negative What
 are his views in the
 affn xnative We know them
 He gave an affi rmat
 ive vote a few days
 since in this Chamber rejecting
 the propositions of the honorable
 Senator from Kentucky and Mr
 SEWARD I move that the
 petition be substituting in their
 place those presented by the
 honorable Senator from New Hampshire
 Mr laid on the table
 Mr MASON I move t
 hat it be printed I
 CLARK and what vere they
 Propositions de believe I have
 the floor claring in substance
 that the Constitution needed no
 amendment that the demands of
 the southern States were in
 the language of the resolution
 unreasonable and that the only
 remedy for the condition of
 things in the country was
 to en force the Constitution
 and the laws i hat
 is thc affrmative view of
 the honorable Senator from New
 York Now sir how is
 it elaborated Why the hon
 orable Senator amidst the mazc
 of generalities which marked his
 speech and it was a
 maze and a misty one
 in that general haze of
 generalities did march up to
 the Ime and tell us
 what his pol icy was
 and I assume it is
 to be the policy of
 those whom he has so
 aided to bring into power
 What was it His recommendation
 to those gen tlemen who
 have sent this enormous petition
 here notadopting their views not
 looking to any amend ment
 to the Constitution whatsoever is
 given in four distinct propositions
 of what is to be
 the pol icy of those
 whom he is to lead
 if history docs not misuniform
 us after the 4th of
 March next What is it
 Hc recommends them when they
 go home to employ themselves
 in the great work of
 restoring the breaches that have
 been madc in How Why
 said he speak the Government
 for the Union That is
 the first Next vote for
 the Union That is the
 second great measure What is
 the tl fird Give money
 for the Union And the
 last Fioht for the Union
 These are the four measures
 proposed by the honorable Sen
 ator from New York to
 heal this gaping breach in
 the Government I can understand
 Mr President what theUSeh ator
 means when he recommends to
 his constitu ents to speak
 for the Union we have
 had a great deal of
 that 1 can understand what
 he means when he recommends
 them to vote for the
 Union because he coupled it
 with a recommendation that they
 should go into State convention
 but I de mand to
 know what he means by
 their contrib uting money for
 the Union Mr SEWARD explain
 to the honorable Senator if
 he wishes During the present
 ses Sion of Congress the
 Government of this Union has
 seen a sudden depreciation of
 its credit From one condition
 of things which existed a
 year or two ago when
 all the stocks of the
 Union were at a pre
 mium they have fallen until
 recently at one time the
 credit of the Union was
 at a discount of thirty
 per cent while the credit
 of the State of New
 York on her six per
 cent stock all the while
 commands a premium The commercial
 com munity who to day
 petition Congress have the treasure
 of the commercial city in
 their keeping I have recommended
 to these gentlemen here pub
 licly as I have heretofore
 recommended to them privately that
 they should advance to the
 Union money on loans and
 on Treasury notes as they
 are now furnishing in that
 way to the Union the
 funds with which the President
 of the United States the
 Departments the Congress the courts
 yourself and myself the Senator
 from Virginia the Army Navy
 and every other branch of
 the Government is actually sustained
 I have rec onunended to
 them in this crisis that
 they sus tnin tl ie
 Government of their country with
 the credit to which it
 is entitled at their hands
 MI MASON I presumed that
 that was the use intended
 to be madc of the
 money which the Senator advised
 his constituents to contribute to
 I did not in my
 own mind do the the
 Union honorable Senator the injustice
 to believe that he proposed
 with the Inoney which was
 to be con tributed to
 subsidize or to debauch the
 southern I had no such
 view I took it for
 granted States that the rnoncy
 was to sustain the Army
 which was to conduct the
 ficrht that he recommends to
 his people Mr SEWARD Mr
 President the honorable Senator I
 am sure doesnotmean to do
 me injustice Mr MASON Certainly
 not and if the hon
 orable Senator wishes to correct
 me I yield with great
 pleasure Mr SEWARD I contemplated
 sir after the expiration of
 all the multitudinous trials that
 are making to save this
 Union by compromise a con
 vention of the people of
 the United States called in
 constitutional form and when that
 shall have be IAeld or
 refused to be held and
 found to be im ossible
 to obtain ifthen this Union
 is to stand or fall
 by the force of arms
 1 have advised my peoplc
 to do as I shall
 be ready to do myself
 stand in the breach and
 stand with it or perish
 with it Applause in the
 galleries 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 659 Mr MASON Then we
 have it definite Mr I
 want to bring the honorable
 Sena President tor the exponent
 of the ncw Administration to
 the policy which is to
 be adopted I understand from
 him now that remedies failing
 th rough the Constitution by
 the conventions of the Stat
 his recornmendation is battle and
 bloodshed to pre serve the
 Union and his recommendation to
 his people is that they
 shall contribute the money which
 shall march the Army upon
 the South for what To
 preserve the Union It is
 gone it is broken there
 is no Union now in
 this country Those States that
 are out of the Union
 have broken it as completely
 as if instead of six
 or seven there were now
 all the fifteen slave States
 with them and if this
 battlc is to bc fought
 it is to be fought
 against them upon their own
 soil for the purpose of
 reducing them to colonics and
 depend encies It cannot mean
 else The hon orable Senator
 is too wise and experienced
 a statesman the honorable Senator
 knows too weli the construction
 and theory of this Government
 to think for one moment
 that when you havc sub
 jagated the people of the
 States you have restored the
 Union No sir The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr in the chair
 The hour of one having
 arrived it becomes the duty
 of the Chair to announce
 the special order Mr MASON
 I hope it will be
 postponed a few minutes to
 allow mc to proceed PRESIDING
 OFFICER It requires No objection
 unanimous consent Mr MASON I
 want to speak of that
 I want to Ict my
 people in Virginia who have
 offered themselves as mediators to
 restore if they could this
 broken Union know what they
 are to expect from the
 councils of those with vvhom
 the Sena tor from New
 York acts as now developed
 Mr SEWARD Mr The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Docs the Sen ator
 frorn Virginia yield Mr MASON
 Certainly Mr SEWARD 1 look
 sir to no tingency as
 seceded States and n dissevered
 Union I look to no
 such condition of things The
 hon orable Senator and I
 differ in regard to the
 future He with an earnest
 will and ardent imagination sees
 this country hereafter rent and
 dissevered and then recombined into
 separate confederacies I see no
 such thing in the future
 but I do sec through
 the return of reason and
 judgment to t he A
 Inerican pcopEe a return of
 l jublic and the consolidation
 of the Union firmer than
 ever before The Ilonorable Senator
 from Vir ginia can very
 easily see that we may
 differ in our anticipations and
 expectations of the future be
 cause we differ so much
 in regard to the actual
 in the Unioil of living
 prcsent Here am sir the
 United States this same blessed
 glorious nobly inherited God given
 Union in the Senate Chamber
 of the United States pleading
 for it maintaining it and
 it The honorable Senator from
 Virginia says it is cone
 there is no Union and
 yet he is here on
 this same floor with me
 Where then is he In
 the Union 01 out of
 the Union He is actually
 present here and in spite
 of himself I hold him
 to be still with myself
 in this glorious old Union
 I will not strain the
 remark which he means to
 assume that he infers that
 because some other Senators were
 here a short time ago
 his asso ciates and minc
 and are not here now
 but have withdrax vn under
 circumstances known to the world
 and which for obvious reasons
 I refrained from commentinø on
 therefore their Stutes arc gone
 and the Union is gone
 with them Sir the Senate
 Chamber is here the Statcs
 are herc the Union is
 here still Herc they will
 all be and I expect
 that they will be in
 the exercise of public t
 h esc reason the frec
 choice of these States places
 all filled If I contemplate
 in an case that nion
 it is it nyty be
 necessary to fv rht for
 this because treason and sedition
 noay arise not alone or
 only in a State of
 the South but in States
 of the North anywhere and
 everywhere be excited and armed
 so as to assail the
 Union and when ever it
 shall come to that whether
 it is in my own
 in the last resort is
 necessarily as well as lawfully
 met Mr MASON Mr President
 giving the hon orablc Senator
 the full advantage of his
 present commentary upon the speech
 that preceded it I yet
 place before the American people
 the fact that he proposes
 but one remedy either to
 preserve this Union or to
 restore it and that is
 the ultima ratio recrum Mr
 SE WARD Not to restore
 preserve Mr MASON I will
 take his own language Let
 the facts be what they
 may he presents but one
 remedy the argument of the
 tyrant force compulsion power This
 is the only resort that
 the honorable Senator has evinced
 either in his speech or
 in his commentary He says
 he is for punishing sedition
 and treason whether it is
 found In the South or
 in the North That is
 the only remedy that he
 proposes upon the existing facts
 He takes no account of
 there being organized political communities
 claiming to be sovereign claiming
 to have resumed all sovereign
 power that they had once
 delegated to this Confederacy now
 out ot the Union actually
 completely outside with not a
 Federal officer within their limits
 with all Federal authority denied
 abrog ted with laws punishing
 as trettson at home any
 obedience to authority abroad and
 the honorable Senator still It
 is the pur says we
 know nothing of all that
 pose of the Government as
 I understand him to wnore
 all that as though it
 did not exist and bc
 it one man or a
 local combination that are resist
 ing the laws or be
 it three or five or
 tcn mil lion people who
 are resisting the law still
 it is treason and sedition
 and he knows of no
 remedy but force I Sir
 I wrantcd to bring him
 to that point wanted o
 all others that the people
 of my hon ored State
 of Virginia should know it
 that the scales should fall
 from their eyes if any
 there are I am aware
 of the miserable puny pusil
 lanimcnas attempt to hoodwink the
 minds and judgment of that
 people by crying Peace peace
 when thcrc is no peace
 I point them now to
 the remedies proposed by the
 most potent in the councils
 of the now Government when
 it is to I point
 thetn to the four great
 remedies come in that arc
 to heal these breaches in
 the Union and l reserve
 it to use tl he
 language of the honorable Senator
 Speaking it will not do
 voting will not do because
 those men who nrc to
 bc parties to the voting
 are outside of the Union
 and will not vote Money
 money How is money to
 do it The I honorable
 Senator has disclosed it Not
 by demoralizing and subsidizing bribery
 but using it as the
 sinews of war Money is
 to do it and is
 to be contributed by the
 great coili mercial city of
 NC w York under the
 counsels of the honorable Senator
 who represents them Mon ey
 is to be contributed as
 the sinews of war be
 cause the very next in
 the four acts of the
 drama that is to be
 enacted is battle battle If
 Now sir let my people
 understand this there be any
 among them so puny as
 to be de luded by
 the idle efforts tocirculate papersamonc
 them stating that there are
 propositions for con stitutional amendment
 which will be carried propositions
 that will secure your rights
 in the Ünion be patient
 like good children and wait
 if there bc any among
 the man your time New
 York I shall look to
 their good sense their humanity
 their civilization to interpose the
 broad cegis of the popular
 will to avoid the only
 resort that the honorable Senator
 looks to that of force
 and subjugation Sir 1 have
 told gentlemen whom I have
 met here from other States
 honored and honorable men who
 have come as volunteers really
 upon a mission of peace
 and tranquillity that it was
 man ifest in the state
 of facts now existing there
 was great and imminent danger
 ofa collision between the sections
 and that all those who
 desired to preserve the Union
 in my judgment should make
 It the first and great
 work to avoid that collision
 and to avoid the civil
 war that must ensue when
 men s minds really are
 heated to madness when passion
 usurps the throne of reason
 and when negotiation and deliberation
 are ended Those have been
 my counsels What are those
 of the honorable Senator from
 New York Here with hostile
 fleets and armies arrayed against
 each other in two of
 the southern States here when
 we are in momentary expectation
 of hearing of a collis
 ion between them what are
 the counsels of the honorable
 Senator from New York Speak
 for the Union vote for
 the Union contributc money for
 the Union and last of
 all fight for the Union
 repeat it sir I trust
 the good sense the wis
 dom the civilization the humanity
 of tho age will rescue
 this country from the counsels
 of the honorable Senator from
 New York But Mr President
 they will have this effect
 at least if that potency
 vvhich is ascribed to the
 opinions of that honorable Senator
 delivered and pronounced in his
 place here as a Senator
 belong to him it will
 admonish the people now rucetintr
 in their sovereien capacity m
 convention in all the southern
 States to let the delu
 sion pass the idle delusion
 that they are to have
 any security in this Government
 by amendments to the Con
 stitution They are not only
 not proposed but they are
 denied and derided We have
 now for the first time
 distinctly shadowed forth that which
 confZiss among others 1 had
 seriously apprc hended that the
 counsels of the leaders would
 be force force We have
 it now avowed openly avowed
 l trust the scales will
 fall from their eyes I
 trust that in the free
 States the non slavehold ing
 States there is n body
 of good men of wise
 and enlightened patriotism freed sufficiently
 from the shackles of party
 obligations to sec sequences to
 which such counsels must lead
 a war to restore this
 Union or to preserve it
 and that they men of
 sense in their generation shall
 be deluded into a war
 under the idle pretext that
 they are only enforcing the
 laws and punishing treason and
 sedition I appeal to the
 free States thc non slaveholding
 States to repudiate tho coun
 sels of the Senator from
 New York and disown them
 If in the providence of
 God it is to result
 that we are to separate
 into two confederacies I trust
 that not the counsels of
 the honorable Sen ator from
 New York but the counsels
 of peace will prevail as
 the only counsels which can
 avert that greatest of all
 calamities a war between brother
 and brother a war which
 could conquer a peace only
 in oceans of blood and
 countless rnil lions of treasure
 When the peace came would
 you find a free people
 Would you find a people
 capable of reconstructing the Government
 No hood of the whole
 South puny enough to be
 de You would find a
 people subjugated and crouchiiP ceived
 by such contrivances as those
 I point them under the
 tread of the despot and
 you would fina to the
 words of the honorable Senator
 showing the warrior clad in
 arms with the money contrib
 that money and vv ar
 are looked to to reduce
 them uted under the counsels
 of the honorable Scrmtor I
 from New York That would
 be the result of and
 these alone war and that
 is the only result to
 which such I know Mr
 President it is perhaps an
 in firmity of my temperament
 to appear to exhibit counsels
 would lead Mr Pesident I
 earnestly trust if in despite
 of something like ancrry einotion
 when 1 do not feel
 those counsels and those efforts
 that are now mak none
 Men who are upon I
 have none sir it thc
 eve of measurin T swords
 conduct themselves ing under the
 mediation of the honored State
 which I am herc to
 represent to restore harmony in
 a gentle mood to cach
 other and use no lan
 gaage of menace or of
 threat far less terms of
 and to restore a government
 should fail that therc is
 an enlightened patriotism in this
 country and indignity in all
 thc States that iVill agree
 to a separation in Sir
 trust x ve may avoid
 the ratio of the peace
 and repudiate the counsels of
 the Senator If it be
 in the provi Senator frolü
 Ncw York from New York
 dence of the speedy future
 that these slave States are
 to confederate and to form
 an independent Mr DOUGLAS Mr
 President i Mr SEWARD hope
 the honorable Sena Government with
 a nationality and a flag
 an or tor wili indulge
 me in one word ganization
 and an ariny and a
 navy and credit The PRESIDING
 OFFICER It is the Stato
 or in any other State
 of the Union then ifthatbe
 reserved in the unspoken specdy
 future I trust that the
 good sense the humanity the
 of the Chair to call
 up the special order at
 this I expect that whatever
 can be done as I
 have hour being the message
 of the President trans already
 indicated that all shall be
 done which civilization the regard
 for unborn posterity will mitting
 to the Senate certain resolutions
 of the reason can do
 then I expect that what
 is right to lead the
 people both North and South
 to repu be done shall
 be done in the way
 in which treason diate the
 counsels of the honorable Senator
 from I State of Virginia
 660 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 31 Mr DOUGLAS 1 understood
 that that sub ject was
 to go over by common
 consent until this petition was
 disposed of The PRESIDING OFFICER
 on this special order the
 Senator from California Mr LATHAM
 has the floor Does the
 Senator from Illinois make a
 motion in regard to it
 Mr LATHAM 1 will certainly
 yield any right I have
 to the floor butl wish
 it understood that i do
 waive the right to speak
 after this debate shall have
 been concluded Mr SEWARD Certainly
 not Mr DOUGLAS 1 yield
 to the Senator from New
 York Mr SEWARD 1 shall
 detain the Senate but a
 moment Mr DOUGLAS very well
 Mr SEWARD Mr President 1
 have been surprised at the
 delusion which the honorable Senator
 from Virginia has been able
 to practice upon himself and
 to make out ofa speech
 peace ful fraternal cordial such
 as I have made a
 dec I cap not account
 for it howr it larati01
 of war is that while
 his sense of honor rernains
 so clear and bright as
 I confess with pleasure it
 does he avoids bv design
 personalities which might irritate his
 judgment is somehovv or other
 so under tl ie influence
 of his passion that he
 can see nothing but war
 in a spaech which proposes
 sim ply this that since
 t hié Union is in
 danger every other question shall
 be subordinate to the consid
 eration and the removal of
 that danger by the pacific
 constitutional action of the American
 people by speech first by
 vote by consi dtation by
 supplying and maintaining the credit
 of the Government and in
 the last alternative after having
 exhausted all the existino means
 of set tlcment and all
 others that might be suggested
 finally after a constitutional convention
 of the United States called
 in the of the Con
 stitution then to stand by
 this good old flag and
 if it is to tall
 from its eminence be wrapped
 in its folds Sir that
 honorable Senator could have recol
 lected that I came into
 the committee of thi rteen
 tl rat I listened to
 every proposition that was rnade
 that I gave it deiiberatc
 wikl any onc say it
 was not fraternal Will any
 one say that offered no
 prejudices no concessions to pro
 pitiate nn arran renncnt Which
 one of all the prop
 ositions that have been made
 have I refused to consider
 None When I have voted
 to substi tute a coustitutional
 provision for the settlement of
 this question such as that
 which was offered by the
 honorable Senator from New Hampshire
 Mr CLARK in preference to
 the proposition which reqi_lires us
 to take in an unconstitutional
 and ineffectual way the sentiments
 of the people on the
 yn oposition of the honorable
 Senator from Kentucky did I
 do it in spirit otherwise
 than that which I clongs
 to a representat ive of
 the pco ple who seeks
 concessions In regard to this
 very proceeding of the honorable
 Spnat or s State w
 h hc so proudly connn
 lends and in terzns to
 which have I not reconunended
 to own State and is
 it not acting in sending
 cornnus sioncrs to rneet the
 other States in that conven
 tion Docs not the honorable
 Senator know that the State
 of New York stands ready
 to hear and consider every
 plan whether will iu the
 forms of the Constitution or
 wilhout thmn to settle this
 question peacefully and without resort
 to the sword and thal
 I tun with the State
 of New York in that
 action It is simply because
 I have learned fronx the
 interest in which the honorable
 Senator l understood him to
 will excuse me for saying
 speak that neither any suggestion
 that has been made yet
 and considered nor any that
 that con vcntion can make
 and consider and submit or
 any other that has yet
 been projected wiil be satis
 factory to that interest of
 secession or disunion in which
 interest he speaks I then
 have submitted alone that further
 one that when all these
 have failed then the States
 of this Union according to
 the forrns of the Constitution
 und in the spirit in
 which it was made shall
 take up this contro versy
 about twenty four ne rro
 slaves scattered over a territory
 of one million fifty thousand
 squar Iniles and say whether
 with the honor able Senator
 frorn Virginia they are N
 viiling to Mr MASON I
 will yield the floor in
 an in vote and one
 only the State of R
 hode Island and stant to
 the Senator from Illinois I
 do not know the State
 of Delaware will each have
 one vote by what authority
 the Senator from New York
 That is the way the
 Constitution provides for amendment no
 popular vote and if the
 Senator says that I speak
 in a certain interest Mr
 SEWARD I certainly should be
 very understood me to say
 that I never would submit
 sorry if I have said
 anything unkind or diSt e
 an amendment to the Constitution
 to the popular spectful to
 the honorable Senator Mr IVIAsoN
 vote as mass he understood
 rne correctly I because the
 relations between him N lr
 President desired only to disclaim
 speak Notatall and myself cspccially
 his bearing on this occa
 ing for any interest or
 in any interest at all
 ex I understand the hon
 i i ceptin the interest
 of my State and with
 a know sion forbid me
 to do so orable Senator
 to speak in the interest
 that is in behalf of
 I will withdraw the word
 interest but in behalf of
 sympathy for those citizens in
 several oc the Statcs who
 have availed themselves of the
 power of the States to
 pass ordinances of secession with
 the intention not again to
 come into the Union of
 the United States if they
 can prevent it I beg
 the honorable Senator s pardon
 If I have misunderstood him
 I hope he will not
 be excited by that Mr
 MASON There is nothing at
 all to ex cite in
 what the honorable Senator meant
 or in I only wanted
 to know he his language
 ascribed to Ine tho position
 of speakiRg in any par
 ticultu interest Now the honorable
 Senator as I understand him
 means to assume that there
 are I those who desire
 as a prcferable condition of
 the country a separation of
 these States but the hon
 oral le Senator has no
 authority on earth to class
 me among them I am
 speaking sir in the in
 terests of the State of
 Virginia as I understand them
 as her Senator and I
 am speaking upon that class
 of opinions which know belong
 to Virginia and certainly belong
 to me that we will
 never re main as const
 iluents of this Confederacy unless
 there are provided in some
 mode guarantees that shall bc
 effectual beyond doubt for the
 preser vatiot n of those
 rights that arc necessary to
 our safety and to our
 honor the honorable Senator knows
 that Why sir the State
 of Virginia upon a great
 and most dis turbing cause
 of difference between the States
 has Inade n distinct proposition
 and has said in lan
 o uacre repudiating anything like
 diplon nacy that it is
 one which Virginia would accept
 her language She has Inade
 a distinct proposi tion upon
 this question of slavery in
 the Territo rics so that
 Senators are not uninformed of
 what one of thc States
 at least would be satisfied
 with in reft rence to
 this disputed question of slavery
 in the Territories Mr CAMERON
 Will the Senator from Vir
 ginia allow rne to ask
 what proposition they have put
 forward to settle this question
 Mr MASON Why sir it
 is in the resolu Lions
 suhtnitt ed hero the other
 day with the Pres ident
 s message of the General
 Assembly of Vir ledge of
 her opinions which I arn
 here to uphold aud those
 undoubtedly are that u nless
 those righ ts pertaining to
 this condition of slavery which
 she is entitled to under
 this Constitution which she knows
 lave been violated and outraged
 unless I those rights are
 guarantied under securities that cannot
 be doubled she will not
 remain in the ginia so
 far as they can speak
 the sentiments of Virginia in
 the present crisis Virginia has
 said in reference to this
 question of dispute and of
 difference in the Territories that
 she would accept ot guarantees
 in some proper form providing
 for lil ie east and
 west of 360 30 to
 n this dividing through all
 Ilerritories now possessed and all
 sub sequently acquired and would
 agree and think it is
 a very great concession on
 her pat t that in
 voluntary servitude should be prohibited
 north of the line upon
 condition that slavery should be
 recognized south of thal line
 and protected by Federal law
 That is her proposition with
 another that persons from the
 slaveholding condition States should have
 the right of transit through
 the i States not holding
 slaves under guarantees of se
 curity their property while in
 them Those are d istinct
 propositions Mr CAMERON 1 think
 1 understood the honorable Senator
 to say the other day
 he would not accel t
 the propositions of the honorable
 Sen ator from Kentucky with
 a proviso that they I
 should be submitted to the
 people Mr MASON I do
 not know what the hon
 orable Senator understood me to
 say but I will tell
 you sir what I did
 say that I should be
 truant to my duty were
 I to accept any proposi
 tion to be submitted to
 the American people as a
 Union That is the interest
 in which I speak Mr
 DOUGLAS Mr President The PRESIDING
 OFF CER The Chair an
 nounced the special order at
 one o clock the un
 finished business of yesterday however
 takes precedence of it which
 is bill to create a
 terri torial government for the
 Territory of Jefferson Mr FOOT
 Let that go over by
 common consent Mr DOUGLAS 1
 have but a word to
 say and then Senators may
 arrange the order of busi
 ness to suit themselves Mr
 GREEN 1 move that it
 be informally passed over The
 PRESIDING OFFICER That will be
 considered the sense of the
 Senate unless ob jected to
 Mr DOUGLAS 1 do not
 rise to address the Senate
 on this subject of debate
 any furlhet than to notice
 one or two points that
 I feel bound to say
 a word upon Ithe Senator
 from Virginia has spoken of
 the puny efforts of persons
 express ing the hope while
 sending communications into Stitc that
 the Union might be saved
 Of course cannot fail to
 take c Fnizance of what
 that might be construed to
 mean IVIr MASON allow 1
 will I rneant only in
 the perhaps used the wrono
 word that they were efforts
 that were unsuited and unfitted
 for the tilne and would
 I certainly rneant nothing of
 dis be ineffectual paragemcnt to
 the Senator Mr DOUGLAS 1
 comment upon them in that
 I suppose he did not
 rnean anything dis partwing when
 I bad the ik ustrious
 Senator from Kentuckv associated with
 me in s vhiltever was
 i havo sent no conn
 nunication into Vir ffinia upon
 this subject now acritafin the
 coun try except to reply
 to individual citizens of that
 State when they Iyad written
 to me to know whether
 there was hope NV hen
 that inquiry was put to
 kne I pronounced my belief
 that tilere was hope and
 1 have not yct abandoned
 the hope that this Union
 may be saved This very
 morn ing I replied to
 a citizen of Virginia who
 made that inquiry of roe
 by saying that I entertained
 strong hope that this matter
 might bc satisfactorily adjusted peace
 preserved and the Union main
 tained I said t o
 him also that in my
 opinion all depended upon the
 action of Virginia avul the
 border States that if the
 friends of the Union could
 save Virginia we could save
 the Union I should not
 have even said this rnue
 h but for the remarks
 of the Senator from Virginia
 I think it is very
 clear that that Senator has
 one object in view and
 I a very different one
 I desire to see peace
 naintained and the Union preserved
 by an honorable fair adjustmcnt
 of tbc questions in dispute
 I have failed to see
 anything in the action of
 that Senator which encouraged me
 to hope that he had
 the same desire The other
 day wbcn tlle Senator from
 Pennsylvania 1M CAM ERONI made
 a very large advance towards
 concil iation and intimated his
 wiilingness to accept the substance
 of the proposition of the
 Senator from Kentucky or any
 other fair adjustment I was
 pained that his advances seemed
 io be repelled by the
 Senator froin Virginia and I
 was amazed homogeneous mass for
 amendment of tbc Con yesterday
 when a question arose here
 about con stitution in any
 way either as recornmendatory I
 ciliation and concession and compromise
 that or as final The
 Constitution reco nizes no Amer
 the Senator from Virginia said
 We want no It reco
 rnizes the people of the
 i ican people concession and
 it was applauded by the
 Sena States as separate independent
 sovereign polit r tor from
 New Hampshire Mr HALF and
 those sacrifice all this liberty
 all this greatness all this
 ical communities and when you
 come to amend who I
 understand to be uncompromising on
 the I the Constitution doul
 tless the honorable Senator other
 side of the Chamber happincss
 and all this hope because
 they have not He thought
 it an intelligence wisdom und
 virtue enough to adjust from
 Pennsylvania knows that the State
 of Penn admirable speech he
 was delighted to get the
 a controversy so frivolous and
 contemptible sylvania l vith all
 her population will have one
 admission of the Senator fror
 n Virginia that he 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 661 wanted
 no concession It presented to
 me a pain ful arjd
 yet not unusual illustration of
 the fact th t extremes
 often meet Extremes North and
 South often meet and unite
 in resisting the efforts of
 the friends of Union of
 concession of concil iation arjd
 of harmony when their joint
 efforts though prompted by different
 motives lead to the same
 end inevitable disunion now and
 forever i was pained again
 this morning when the hon
 orable Senator from New York
 rnade a speech conciliatory and
 patriotic showinT every desire to
 have thesc matters amicabiy arranged
 if pos sible that instead
 of being rnet in the
 spirit in whicb it was
 offered his advance was affain
 re peiled as if there
 was alarrn and fear lest
 reason moderation and iustice might
 return and the north and
 south the conservative Union men
 might possibly agree upon somc
 basis of meu I have
 not been able to conceal
 from settlement eyes Ithac there
 are gentlemen on this side
 of the Chamber who do
 not want anv settlement 1
 saw it the other day
 when the vote was taken
 on su bstllucing tbc proposition
 ofthe Senator from New Hampshire
 Mr CLARRI for that of
 the Sen ator ftorn Kentuc
 kv i he extremists on
 the other side recto ved
 scjlYie aid frorn extreme men
 on this side by affirmative
 votes and still mote assist

 refusing vote t hus perrnitting
 the proposition of the Senator
 from New Harnpstiire to be
 adopted in consequence oi their
 refusal to vote a rainst
 it tables and and instant
 y sittino down at their
 wri incr and sending off
 telegraphic dispatches that there was
 no hope because the Black
 Republicans I had voted down
 the propositi011 of the Senator
 from Kentucky I have witnessed
 these things here with pain
 but it is no longer
 worth while to conceal fi
 om ourselves tl le fact
 that the extremists on t
 iis side arid on the
 other side are in concert
 from diflkn elit motives to
 defeat a settlemcnt Mr MASON
 YVili the Senator me to
 ask whether when he says
 G concert he means Mr
 DOUGLAS Not at all 1
 mean that both desire to
 defeat an adiustmcnt and in
 my opin ion each side
 know or believe that if
 they defeat an adjustment disumon
 is inevit al le and
 both desire disunion in preförence
 to a compromisc and hence
 when one sees that he
 can accomplish his obiect by
 acting auxiliary to the other
 we perceive un ited action
 although thev are øoverned by
 diffin ent motives and act
 without express con I impugn
 no saltation That is what
 I mean man motives Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas Will the
 Sen ID ask him a
 question ator allow Mr DOUGLAS
 Certainly r think IM r
 JOHNSC N of Senator is
 egn egiously misrepresenting those Sen

 vote upon that proposition and
 I am not disfjosed to
 sit herc an l listen
 to what hc savs without
 astone another explan Senator himself
 when a ber of the
 ittee ot h teen was
 one of those who in

 there con cert of action
 there The Senator says there
 was concert of action on
 the part of those Senators

 CLARK the public mind and
 do it under the plea
 of at tacking four or
 five Senators here who declined
 to vote ahd declined for
 the distinct reasön that they
 intended to know t he
 sentiment of the other side
 and as that sentiment could
 be triumphant out side to
 permit them to take the
 consequences of success inside of
 this Chamber Does not the
 Senator know that And does
 the Senator give a fair
 consideration to this side in
 the view which he is
 now submittirv He does not
 Mr DOUGLAS Mr President 1
 did not know of course
 I had no means of
 knowing what may have been
 the motives of each individ
 ual Senator who retained his
 scat and declined to vote
 but I did know and
 was bound to take cog
 nizance of the fact that
 their declining to vote caused
 the proposition of the Senator
 from New Hampshire to be
 adopted bv the Senate asa
 sub stitute for that of
 the Senator from Kentucky uncl
 that it never could have
 passed but by their refusal
 to vote and do know
 that the substitu tion of
 that amendment was telegraphed all
 over the country as evidence
 that there was no hope
 of concession or of settlement
 in this body Mr JOHNSON
 of Arkansas Will the sen
 ator ao ain allow me
 Mr DOUGLAS Certainly Mr JOHNSON
 of Arkansas There can have
 been no deception there I
 hun lbly submit Mr DOUGLAS
 I am not charging deception
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas No
 deception was there practiced T
 hc impression that there is
 no hope of an adjustment
 has been derived from the
 action in this Chamber and
 there is not a man
 here who is not conscious
 of the fact Mr DOUGLAS
 The Senator is entirely mis
 taken if he thinks there
 is no hope arising from
 this Chamber Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas None sir Mr DOUGLAS
 may none I have hope
 and I trust that hope
 will never de sert my
 heart I never intend to
 give up the hopc of
 saving this Union as long
 as there is a ray
 left I believe that I
 see indications now which are
 be coming stronger every day
 of a desire to preserve
 the peace of this country
 and thereby save the I
 think no man proposes to
 save it by Union I
 suppose that every Senator fccls
 that war war matter how
 long it ruay continue or
 how brief it may be
 must result whenever the war
 ceases in disunion and in
 final separation Now sir why
 should we not settle this
 ques tion rl he Senator
 from New York bas shown
 us that thc contest has
 one on for twelve years
 he has assumed that durit
 lg those twelve years the
 South have had control of
 the Government and given every
 possible protection to slavery in
 the r l erritories and
 yet they have only succeeded
 in plantins_r twenty four slaves
 in all the Terri tories
 Territories twenty four times as
 largc as the State of
 New York Do not these
 facts show the utter fallacy
 of this GovernmenL attemptil g
 to plant slavery where the
 climate is ad verse and
 the people do not vvant
 it and the utter folly
 of the other Sidc of
 the harnbcr brin ying this
 country to the very verge
 of disunion in order to
 prohibit slavery where the power
 of the Government could not
 make it exist This statement
 of facts shows conclusively that
 there is nothing practical in
 the question that the demand
 for prohibition is unnecessary for
 the par poses for which
 it is set forth that
 the demand for protection by
 this Government is utterly un
 availing even Vyrnen you have
 the power in vour own
 hands to carry it to
 the extreme Ai Vhy break
 up the Union upon an
 absl raction that has no
 practical re snlts in it
 Why cannot thc one side
 give up its demand for
 prohibition and the other for
 protection and adopt an amendment

 will be the so far
 as the sla Senator appears

 question is concerned and this

 place no one in a
 false position The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The last forever the Senator
 himself goinz to pass this
 over under Mr President I
 will not occupy thc time
 of the dent s message
 transmitting the Virginia resolu this
 and throw a deceptive view
 and a de tions ceptive
 conception of the whole matter
 out upon Senate but I
 ask the unanimous consent of
 the Senate to lay on
 the table an amendment which
 I shall hereafter propose to
 the territorial bill which t
 he Senator from Missouri Mr
 GREbN called up yesterday and
 that an order be made
 to presume there will be
 no objection to print it
 that The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 bill to which the Senator
 from Illinois offers an amend

 business Mr DOUGLAS ask unanimous
 consent to have the amendment
 printed The PRESIDING OFFICER Is
 unanimous consent given Yes l
 What disposition will the Senate
 make of the bill Mr
 GREEN Let it ass over
 The PRESIDING OBFiCER It will
 be passed over informally Mr

 New Hampshire yield to the
 Senator from California Mr LATHAM
 I want to make a
 motion Mr HALE I am
 willing to give it up
 for a minute Mr LATHAM
 Yesterday I made a motion
 to make the President s
 special message on the Virginia
 resolutions the special order for
 to day at one o
 clock on which I was
 entitled to the floor Of
 course I gave way cheerfully
 to hear the distinguished Senators
 who have addressed this body
 to day I now move
 because see that this diseussion
 is going to be protracted
 the Sen ator from New
 Hampshire Mr HALE and the
 Senator from Texas MT WIGFALL
 both want to address the
 Senate in immediate connection with
 what has been said that
 the special order on which
 I expected to address the
 Senate be postponed until to
 morrow at one o clock
 I think it is proper
 that I should I lave
 that courtesy ex tended to

 is private bill day Mr
 LATHAM Then say Saturday at
 one o clock The PRESIDING
 OFFICER It is moved that
 the President s message transmitting

 General Assembly of Virginia be
 Mr LATHAM 1 withdraw that
 motion Senators around me think
 had better go on to
 day and I may as
 well speak to day as
 to mor row Mr DOUGLAS
 1 must then make the
 point whether the Senator from
 California is notentitled to the
 floor He yielded to me
 I was called to order
 and the floor refused to
 me until he yielded it
 He yielded to me only
 and if the Chair was
 rio ht in dcnyincr the
 floor to me without his
 con sent hc wilfbl right
 in denying it to the
 Senator from New Hampshire without
 the consent of the Senator
 from California The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Chair will state that
 he announced the special order
 as was his duty at
 one o clock Thcre was
 unfinished business which took precedence
 and unless some motion was
 made and carried to postpone
 the uu finished business that
 of course was before the
 Senate No such motion was
 made The Sen ator from
 California could not therefore take
 the floor upon the special
 order without a motion to
 postpone the unfinished business Mr
 GR EEN I suggested that
 the unfinished business The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Chairwill state further
 that he understands by unanimous
 consent the unfinished business has
 been inform ally passed by
 The special order therefore is
 now before the Senate and
 upon that the Senator frorn
 California has t he floor
 The Chair how ever recocynized
 the Senator from New Hamp

 HALE I would as lief
 speak on that as on
 anything Laughter The PRESIDING OFFICER
 On that tion the Senator
 from California has the floor
 Mr MASON I hope both
 the Senators will allow me
 to repair an error into
 which I fell by I

 the inadvertence motion to print
 the petition presented by the
 Sen ator from New York
 I ask leave to withdraw
 that motion i promised to
 do so The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The motion is withdrawn Mr
 HALE Mr The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Unless the Scnator from New
 Hampshire has some motion to
 make the Chair will again
 announce that the Senator from
 California is entitled to the

 Mr LATHAM 1 desire to
 say sir that the Senator
 from New Hampshire and other
 Sena tors who want to
 claim the floor arc more
 imme diately connected with this
 question than the con el
 stituency whom I represent and
 I do not feel that
 it is proper for me
 to submit what I have
 to say against what they
 wish to lay before the
 coun try and thcrefore I
 renew the motion which I
 previously made that I may
 be allowed to speak Yes
 So far as to morrow
 at one o clock the
 Private Calendar is concerned I
 wilt state to the Senate
 that I do not expect

 the Sen ator from New
 Hampshire yield to the Scnator
 frorn Massachusetts Mr HALE No
 1 do not The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from New
 Hampshire is entitled to the
 floor Mr HALE Mr President
 1 confess that 1 was
 good deal surprised at a
 remark which fell frorn the
 honorable Senator from Illinois Mr
 I OUGI AS in relation
 to a little passage that
 took place between the honorable
 Senator from Vir ginia Mr
 MASON and myself yesterday He
 said he was pained at
 the announcement notide by thc
 Senator from Virginia and hc
 was pained at the approbation
 expressed by the Scnator from
 New Hampshire at the utterance
 of th C senti ments
 that the Senator from Virginia
 pronounced Now Mr President I
 desire to call the attention
 of the Senate and of
 that portion of the country
 that cares anything about what
 we say here to what
 did take place yesterday because
 stand by it and I
 think if I could induce
 every member of this body
 and cvery voter in this
 country to stand by it
 the diffculties that now envelop
 and surround us and the
 country would vanish like mist
 before the mornitv sun I
 do not know sir what
 private interpretation the Senator from
 Vir ginia may have had
 if he had any upol
 the sen timent which he
 expressed but the sentiment which
 lie di l express and
 to which I gave my
 cordial assent was that with
 the Constitution of thc United
 States he and the people
 that he rep resented were
 satisfied that they asked no
 con I do not remember
 his precise phrase cession ology
 but I think he said
 it would bc dishonora ble
 in thorn to ask and
 degrading in us to make
 any concession what they wanted
 was the Con stitution Mr
 MASON Will the Senator allow
 me an instant Mr HALE
 Yes sir Mr MASON What
 1 said Mr President wus
 not what was repeated by
 the Senator from Illi I
 understood the Senator from Illinois
 to nois say tbut I
 had disclaimed any demand on
 the part of thesouthern States
 for conciliation or conces Mr
 DOU LAS For concession Mr
 MASON It was limited to
 the word con cession Mr
 HALE So it was Mr
 MASON And it was because
 that was the only term
 that had been used by
 either of the Senators from
 Pennsylvahia and it was a
 term said that had become
 familiar as a household word
 The newspapers and letter writers
 speak of the non slaveholdino
 States or some of them
 being ready t o make
 concessions What I meant to
 say was this applied to
 that term which has its
 own specific meaning so far
 as I know the South
 ask no concession because a
 concession wouid imply a gratuity
 or a benevolencc to which
 they were not entitled I
 said that tho South were
 satisfied with the Constitution as
 it stood if its guarantees
 had bccn respected but not
 being re spected we should
 demand such securities in place
 of cxistino cyuarantees as would
 be beyond dispute Now I
 will instance one one of
 the class prescntcd in the
 speech of my honorable colleague
 There isa security leaving to
 the mi nority section its
 own protection by a concurrent
 votc on all questions affecting
 its interests I in stance
 that only as one ofa
 class which might be resorted
 to but my remarks were
 confined to that word concession
 and I did say that
 if we could ask concessions
 it would be humifiating in
 us to ask them and
 derogatory to the other side
 to grant them Mr HALE
 My recollection and the record
 concur entirely with the exposition
 which the honorable Senator from
 Virginia has now given of
 what he said with a
 single exception I will read
 what the Senator said We
 would never ask for concessions
 in any form It has
 been the unilOnn language of
 tuc southern States here through
 their representatives so far as
 I know that they are
 pec eetly satisfied Witb the
 Constitution they have no cotnplaint
 to Inake ot the Constitution
 Their cornpl tint is that
 thc x onstitution has been
 violatcd and disregarded to the
 prejudice of the rights secured
 to them by thé Con
 stitution That is what the
 Senator said He was satis
 fied with the Constitution yesterday
 without an if and I
 am sorry perhaps it was
 owing to the hurry with
 which the Senator spoke that
 hc put in the if
 to day Again he said
 YVe ask for 110 concession
 should be humiliated it we
 did ask it and they
 would he litnniliated if they
 ratited it We ask for
 no concession ask only for
 right Wo are asking for
 no new provisions whatever That
 is what pleased nw yesterday
 it pleases me to day
 and I think the honorable
 Senator from Illinois cannot have
 his moral and physical nature
 in a normal condition if
 it gives him pain to
 hear this expression of reverence
 for thc Con stitution and
 of satisfaction with its provisions
 pronounced by the honorable Senator
 from Vir ginia and accorded
 to by myself Sir from
 the very announc mnent of
 this con troversy onc thing
 has struck me and I
 will now state it to
 the Senate We meet together
 here and it is am
 oed upon all hands that
 something is I have been
 met by volunteer cotn out
 of joint mittees on the
 street that teli they come
 to appeal to mc and
 to ask that I will
 give my hum ble aid
 to settle the question Well
 I say my friends if
 you will tell me what
 the ques tion is I
 will help you with all
 Iny heart and I ask
 what the question is now
 ft is not dis satisfaction
 with the Constitution The honor
 able Scnator from Missouri Mr
 GREEN made the sarne avo
 wal some days possibly some
 weeks since The Constitution is
 well enough and yet sir
 this Congress meets t he
 country is distracted and you
 all go to work to
 patch up amendments to that
 which you agree is now
 perfect Mr DOUGLAS If the
 Senator will allow me many
 people are finding fault We
 come together and men want
 to cure the evil by
 mending and patching that which
 they all agree needs no
 mend nog and which is
 in itself perfect Again sir
 of what do you complain
 For what are you going
 to break up this Government
 I Do you complain of
 its administration here by the
 two Houses of Congress and
 the Federal President Why sir
 it was the declaration of
 one of the representatives of
 the seceding States Mr TOOMBS
 on this floor last session
 that in the main from
 the time of the adoption
 of the Federal Constitution to
 the present time the Fed
 eral Government had been honestly
 administert d according to the
 purposes of the Constitution and
 never more so than at
 the present time Then sir
 you have got a perfect
 Constitution and a perfect administration
 of it by its organs
 How is its judiciary Do
 you find any fault with
 them Has there been any
 exposition of the Federal Constitution
 by the chosen arbiters that
 arc to decide what the
 Constitution is that dis pleases
 you Is there any fault
 found with that None that
 I have ever heard of
 Well then sir the Constitution
 perfect the legislation perfect and
 the judiciary perfect what do
 you find fault with Is
 there anything in the constitution
 of any one of the
 States I have not heard
 it sug It was stated
 by the same authority to
 gested which I have just
 referred that the judiciary of
 all the States with the
 solitary exception of the State
 of Wisconsin had been sound
 and faithful in their construction
 of the fugitive slave law
 Then sir if you have
 got a perfect Constitu tion
 a perfect administration of it
 by the Federal Government and
 a perfect as you regard
 it con struction of it
 by the Federal and State
 judiciary what do you want
 If you want anything fur
 ther in a judicial line
 I have no doubt you
 can have it when you
 make a case The honorable
 Senator from Oregon Mr LANE
 the other day said he
 had no doubt I do
 not know whether he meant
 it as a compliment or
 a reproach to the Su
 prernc Court of the United
 States that if a proper
 case could be made out
 and submitted to that court
 they would decide that the
 election of Mr Lincoln was
 unconstitutional Mr LANE Or any
 other honest court IVIr HALE
 No matter about that 1
 am not dealing with any
 other honest court with one
 I speak of that only
 to show what the honorable
 Senator from hc gon thinks
 on this matter and no
 Senator rosc in his place
 to ques tion his statement
 It may have been meant
 for a compliment to that
 court I confess I think
 it a I remember hearing
 a piquant anec reproach dotc
 related by an honorable gentleman
 from New York once a
 member of this body f
 will give his name Mr
 Dickinson Mr Dickinson said that
 on a certain occasion there
 was a minister settled in
 one of the small towns
 of the State of Nesv
 York and the terms of
 his payrnent were so many
 bushels of rye provided his
 preaching suited He preached some
 time without getting any substantial
 evidence that his preaching was
 satisfactory and he went to
 some of the brethren and
 said Brethren does my preaching
 suit If it don t
 I can alter it for
 I am determined to have
 that rye anyhow Laughter well
 sir I think if you
 have not got any judicial
 decision that suits yet you
 can have it The Senator
 from Oregon thinks so We
 agree there Then what is
 the matter I know it
 is a very easy thing
 to repent of other men
 s sins and to make
 confessions for other men s
 faults and we have had
 a great deal of that
 piety on the other side
 of the Chamber Mr SAULSBURY
 1 ask the honorable Sen
 ator from New Hampshire how
 he knows that fact The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Does the Sen
 ator from New Hampshire yield
 the floor Mr HALE I
 do not yet I have
 yielded too often I have
 no morc concessions to make
 cm I will show the
 misapprehension he is laboring that
 subject Laughter I say Mr
 President under as to the
 point I Inade we have
 had a great many confessions
 made upon Mr HALE Show
 it after 1 get through
 the other side of the
 Chamber of moral and polit
 You will have the wholc
 ground to yourself and ical
 delinquencies that have been committed
 but can do it then
 they have been Democrats confessing
 Republican Mr DOUGLAS I supposed
 it would be more sins
 We havc not hcard a
 word of any of their
 agreeable to the Senator to
 be corrected than to be
 own shortcomings from their lips
 They have allowed to put
 me in a false position
 been all pointino out wherein
 we have erred and Mr
 HALE I say we present
 a curious spec sinned and
 have never given the slightest
 atten tacle butagreat tion nor
 made the least inquiry so
 far as any 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 663 public manifestation
 is concerned nor expressed the
 aeronaut found that his destinies
 vere linked a doubt as
 to the propriety the perfect
 propriety with those of a
 madman Sir that is our
 condi tion to day We
 are sailing over tempestuous of
 their own conduct Now in
 regard to this matter of
 amending the seas and all
 of human hope for ourselves
 for Constitution I appeal to
 you Senators I ask posterity
 or for the world is
 with us for the men
 you if in the present
 state of public opinion sur
 rounded as you are by
 all the excitements and passions
 of thc hour you believe
 that this Con gress this
 Senate constituted as it is
 made up as it is
 opcratcd upon by these e
 dvcrse and extra neous influences
 as it is is more
 competent and better able to
 build a Constitution t hat
 shall en dare and that
 shall promoto the interest the
 honor and the welfare of
 this great country than was
 thc convention that formed the
 Federal Con ask the wise
 men who sit around me
 stitution i that will destroy
 thc vessel in which so
 much is embarked are no
 betlet than the madman sailing
 in rnid air who would
 lose all direction and con
 trol the balloon which bore
 him But sir perhaps I
 ought not to speak I
 am havo no business to
 speak New trespassing Englal id
 is to be sloughed off
 anyhow she is a sore
 and even the kind and
 benignant Senator I from Missouri
 Mr GREEN I whose heart
 is all benevolence so full
 that it beams out in
 every expression of his countenance
 could not give utterance to
 his sentiments wi thout expressing
 the and whose patriot hearts
 are now beating with so
 lituch anxiety for the welfare
 of their country hopc that
 whatever reconstruction might take place
 New England would be left
 out anyhow how much do
 you think your wisdom exceeds
 that of the stves who
 formed this great charter of
 Well sir I will tell
 you this I never Will
 beg your Govcrnment under wphich
 you live How much wiser
 are you than Madison and
 Hamil ton and Jay or
 how much more patriotic than
 Washington and his compatriots that
 you under takc in your
 rnadness and folly to rebuild
 and reconstruct that great result
 of their piety and their
 wisdom which has come to
 us as the richest inheritance
 that we have enjoyed Sir
 I confess for myself that
 I am willing to abide
 with the old men of
 the Constitution I am willing
 to talcc In y 101
 with those who when the
 wounds of the Rev olnti01
 i were not yet hcalcd
 met in solemn coun cil
 with patriotic hearts and pious
 purposes came too ether to
 form a constitution for this
 country I verierate their wisdom
 above that of thie wisdom
 by which I am surrounded
 I have not yet be
 come a convert to the
 doctrine that we if we
 ever could are now in
 a situation to mend what
 they made And sir if
 this sentiment gives pain to
 atoybody I regret it but
 I tell you I think
 it is a wholesome pain
 that will work out a
 recrenera tion the body that
 feels it Mr President there
 is another mistake and it
 is a mistake Men speak
 of this Constitution and this
 Union as something separate from
 the I have battle by
 which our liberties were won
 heard it said on this
 floor this session that it
 is all a mistake to
 say that this Constitution cost
 I tell you sir the
 any blood ot any treasure
 Revolution itself was worth nothing
 without the constitutional Union that
 followed it at ld you
 can not separate the one
 from the other l hey
 are the necessary consequences all
 confiected by one great chain
 and the experiencc of the
 mcn ofthe Rovo lution between
 the peaco of 1783 and
 the adoption of the Constitution
 in 1789 the history of
 that time stands where all
 nations may read and all
 time cannot efface the eternal
 truth that they found that
 the Revolution itself was but
 a bootless effort unless its
 fruits were cemented and consolidated
 in u Federal Union and
 the Federal Union was the
 necessary complernent to the successful
 Revo lution and the man
 that raised a purvicidal hand
 acrainst the Constitution of his
 country aims it not at
 the Constitution alone but upon
 the revo and ante revolutionary
 spirit that pro ceded in
 the councils of the country
 years and years acro Sir
 the Constitution was no thing
 ofa day It was not
 a hot bed plant growing
 up like Jonah s gourd
 in the night but it
 was the result of infla
 ences that had been operating
 in nearly the two centuries
 of colonial history t hat
 preceded it and centuries back
 in the history of the
 country from which emigrated and
 to undertake to sepa the
 rate the Constitution from the
 Revolution for myself nor for
 my Statc nor for New
 Eng land fbr adtnission to
 any communion except the communion
 of the just madc perfect
 in Heaven and if there
 bc on this earth a
 Stale or a confed cracy
 now existing or hereafter to
 be formed that can dispense
 with New England I say
 God If you can afford
 it I thil lk we
 can bless you Why sir
 these gentlemen do not know
 anything about New England except
 chat there are ice and
 rocks l here that I
 think is the extent the
 prac tical extent of the
 knowledge of a great many
 of those rnen who talk
 about New England my colleao
 ucs from New England who
 sit all around me will
 forgive me if I say
 a word for history her
 Do you know anything of
 her Her cradle was thc
 bark rocked on the tempest
 that finally landed amid thc
 ice and rocks of Ply
 mouth harbor Her home was
 amid the savages and the
 rocks and the ice and
 when she ound the soil
 too sterile for sustenance she
 plowed the ocean and thence
 the means of support She
 has grown up acrainst opposition
 on her side she has
 had nothing but God The
 mother country from which she
 emigrated oppressed her she contended
 with savages with wild beasts
 with a sterile soil and
 severe climate death took half
 the numbers of the little
 company of emigrants that landed
 on that ice and rock
 bound shore yet amid all
 these discouragxemcnts and against all
 thcsc odds SIIC has gone
 on every day and evcry
 I year prosy crina and
 to prosper Cut her off
 throw her away and then
 she may look over t
 his nay sir she may
 go to your whole continent
 cotton fields and point to
 the means by which she
 has been instrumental in so
 highly elevating cot ton that
 from the giddy height you
 proclaino him She may tell
 you that without the genius
 king of New Eilgla ld
 King Cotton would bc a
 beggar She may point the
 continent over and with inore
 than poetic truth ask Qua
 rco io in tern is
 qt on nostri plena laboris
 What land is therc on
 this continent that has not
 been enlightened by her civilization
 What institution of learning is
 there that does not re
 ceive culture from her sons
 What is he great Nort
 hwost from which she is
 to be separated Nothing on
 carth but New England spread
 out I suppose sir that
 if you are to cut
 her off and send her
 home you will cast away
 every thing thatshc has done
 MT ell sir let the
 magician let him touch with
 his talismanic wand go forth
 let him touch this confederation
 this Union nay sir let
 him touch that other confederation
 I vho think they are
 beginning to see the lin
 ht I and let him
 make everything that New England
 genius and New England enterprise
 has done for them vanish
 from their and they Union
 from the independence whatever you
 rnay find themselves but little
 advanced from the sav say
 about it theoretically is a
 practical absurdity Sir the bcst
 hopes of mankind are freighted
 in age state You are
 aoin to cut us off
 from the this ship of
 the Constitution All that was
 se I Northwest Good by
 my friends but cre you
 cured by the war of
 the Revolution is periied by
 go give us back our
 jewels and when you take
 I Illinois into your embracc
 let us have the illus
 every blow that is aimed
 at the Constitution trious Senator
 Mr DOUGLAS and his m
 eat have sometimes thought when
 I have heard Che for
 he came from New England
 and recklessness with which nteu
 speak of breaking principle up
 this Confederacy of an incident
 that f have his colleague
 also Sir when you turn
 out Ohio l the empire
 of the West grive us
 back her thun seen recorded
 in some rnao azinc respecuog
 an aeronaut who ventured to
 rise to the blue ether
 derinø orator who sits betbre
 me Mr WADE above in
 a balloon When he had
 ascended to and her more
 than orator sage and patriot
 that is to be his
 colleague in the next Congress
 Mr where the earth faded
 in the distance to a
 mere point he found that
 his companion was a maniac
 Chase if such a Congress
 isto be You are to
 take Carried away by the
 giddy excitement of the Michigan
 too Sir I have been
 many years a when I
 declare myself to bc for
 thc Constitution member on this
 floor and I have always
 been able I speak it
 in no sense that would
 indicate that hour the unhappy
 man began to throw over
 the to recvnize a son
 of New I lampshire in
 thc reprc mean by that
 t o invoke or evoke
 its strolw arm ballast and
 cut the guys and the
 ropes by which the balloon
 was guided throuoh its course
 and sentætion of the State
 of Michigan Look all over
 to put clown by force
 any of the manifestations the
 West and I tell you
 sir until the sons of
 the West have forgotten to
 revcrence the graves of their
 fathers until they have forgotten
 to cherish with affection the
 memory of the mothers that
 nourished them you cannot sever
 New England from the West
 Build up us many confederacies
 as you Inay and I
 tell you sir that when
 the politicians come to deal
 with this matter they will
 find that the people of
 this country have got ahear
 which very few politicians have
 laughter and the great heart
 of the great West will
 be felt Now sir another
 word in this connection The
 honorable Senator from Virginia said
 the other day that this
 Union is already dissolved and
 we cannot help it I
 tell him the Union is
 not dis solved and he
 cannot dissolve it I am
 not going to discuss cither
 the right or the fact
 of secession The British empire
 existed after the American colonics
 were severed from it and
 when you have cut off
 from this Union every State
 that wants to go and
 everybody that is not satisfied
 with the Constitution forswears his
 allegiance to it and there
 will bc left then a
 Union stretch loaves it ing
 from thc Atlantic to the
 Pacific strong enough to bid
 defiance to the world in
 arms and deal with any
 question that presents itself just
 exactly as their own sense
 of patriotism and duty shall
 re quire of them A
 man that has his leg
 amputated is a man notwithstanding
 and the Union still I
 remains though some members of
 it may be cut off
 I have in my hand
 a document to which I
 want to call thc attention
 of some gentlemen It has
 been the constant effort of
 veFy many gentlemen who have
 spoken upon this subject to
 represent that there is a
 verv deep rooted hatrcd between
 the Nort l i and
 the South and that this
 manifests 1 hold in my
 itself on almost every occaszon
 hand a most significant report
 made by the city of
 Norfolk in the State of
 Virginia o iving the history
 of the pestilence that visited
 that unhappy city in the
 year 1855 I will not
 stop to read that report
 but in it the committee
 of the city of Nor
 folk say that when the
 terrible pcstilcncc visited Virginia and
 death was holding such a
 festival there as had rarely
 been witnessed on this conti
 nent or anywhere else the
 inhabitants of that stricken city
 made an appeal not to
 the South nor to the
 North but to tho country
 thc whole coun try and
 it was responded to in
 a manner most honorable to
 h umanity and most honorable
 to the charact er of
 the political institutions under which
 we live Physicians who knew
 that tl ey were traveling
 thc highway of death where
 pest ilence was to be
 their entertainment and death their
 reward flocked in numbers from
 the North to minister rcfief
 to the inhabitants of that
 city contributions came in from
 every quarter and they specially
 mention aniong those who had
 been foremost in their deeds
 of bchevolence Phil adelphia Boston
 and other places in the
 northern States whose people it
 has been said on this
 floor this session hatc thc
 South with a hatred deep
 as hell According to a
 table which i have herc
 of the contributi01 s which
 they received upon this appeal
 amounting to nearly ninety thousand
 dol I laps of whicliwas
 contributed by tbc Dis trictof
 Columbia of the remaining 80
 000 more littlf of it
 contributed by the citizens than
 one of thcsc very frec
 States who you say entertain
 such deep rooted hatred for
 you Sir when the angel
 of pestilence spread his wing
 over your land when the
 young rnen were falling and
 tbc Macedonian cry for help
 went up did the North
 hold back No sir but
 with a o enerosity and
 devotion uncalculating as the im
 pulses of humanity cvcr arc
 they went to the rescue
 of this very Virginia and
 left their ashes upon its
 soil eternal mementoes of the
 sympa thy the humanity and
 tho affection which they cherished
 for thc citizens of a
 common country And sir whenever
 an occasion hike that Shail
 come again whenever war pestilence
 or any thing else shall
 indicate to your fellow men
 and citizens of the northern
 States that a call is
 made upon them for sympathy
 for aid for money for
 lilö it will be poured
 out svith as uncalculating a
 devotion as cvey humanity laid
 its offering upon the altar
 of charity And now sir
 while I am up let
 me say that THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 31 of disaffection
 which have been exhibited in
 any quarter of this country
 No sir I am for
 it in the spirit in
 which it was formed I
 am for the whole of
 it in every part and
 let me here say a
 word or two in regard
 to those special matters which
 have obtruded themselves upon our
 atten What is it that
 you want You want a
 guar antec that this General
 Government never will in terfere
 in any manner with slavery
 in the States Sir it
 is not in human language
 to eive it to you
 stronger than you have it
 now You may makc it
 just as strong as you
 please and I defy tho
 phi ology of the most
 learned and the most astute
 to put any guarantee in
 the Constitution so strong ns
 you have it now in
 that provision which says that
 everything that is not given
 and granted by the Constitution
 is reserved to the pcoplc
 and the States The right
 to abolish slavery in the
 States not being given it
 is expressly reserved by this
 very provision And sir you
 want the Missouri restored That
 Missouri compromise is a very
 It saved the Union in
 1820 by curious measure being
 passed it saved it in
 1854 by being repealed and
 now it has to save
 it again by beino passed
 again How longit will be
 before it will have to
 be reversed I do not
 know but this Missouri com
 promise is the eternal unfailing
 medicine that is to cure
 all the diseases to which
 the body politic is subject
 I remembera quack doctor in
 my neigh borhood that had
 but one medicine and he
 used it just as you
 propose to use this Missouri
 com promise When he wanted
 a mcdicinc to produce one
 efl ect he scraped it
 down the tree and when
 he wanted it to produce
 another he scraped it up
 l hat is just exac
 tly the case in Laughter
 which you put this IVIissouri
 cornpromise Sorne timos the Union
 is in danger nnd you
 rnust pass VI len it
 is in danger turain and
 it must bc it repealed
 Six years hence it may
 be 1 aerain and you
 mast pass it How long
 do you suppose the Union
 will last patched ill iter
 if the Missouri compronuse first
 up and then down is
 the only medicine that it
 is cvcr to have Again
 sir I ask what do
 you want I o you
 want anything more than what
 you have rot You have
 got the whole and we
 have not asked you to
 give anything l mck I
 he Suprcune Court in the
 Dred Scott decision have dccidcd
 all that I wili tell
 you what they say per
 you want haps you have
 forgotten They say in so
 many wordN I do not
 know that I can read
 it but you will find
 it there that the only
 power that is con ferred
 on this Federal Government in
 relation to slavery in the
 Territories is the pov yer
 coupled with the duty to
 protect it in the Territories
 That is the supreme law
 of the land pronounced by
 the Suprerne Court of the
 United Slates for which you
 all have so much reverence
 Gentle men I appeal t
 o you Mr CLINGMAN Will
 the Senator allow me to
 ask him a single question
 in this connection Mr HALE
 Not now I hc Scnutor
 can oct the floor right
 after me Mr CLINGMAN the
 honorable Sen ator adopt that
 construction of the law and
 the Constitution Mr HALE Mr
 President 1 will say this
 there is a vacancy on
 the bcnch of the Supreme
 Court and if Mr Lincoln
 should nominate me to that
 place and tl ie Senate
 should confirm me then I
 will tell you laughter and
 then my opin ion will
 be worth something the opin
 ions of the Supreme Court
 do not depend on the
 question whether I adopt them
 or not and I think
 the honorable Senator from North
 Carolina never would go home
 and tell his people 1M
 y friends this is all
 a sham This Dred Scott
 decision is I not worth
 a straw It does not
 protect your prop erty worth
 acent for I myself putit
 to Mr H ALE in
 the Senate and hc would
 not tell whether he considered
 it binding or not Now
 sir that is the law
 I know that is the
 judgment pronounced and I tell
 you gentlemen I am talking
 plainly and I trust not
 unkindly you are not backing
 your friends as you ought
 to do by intimating that
 the decisions of the Supreme
 Court want any bolstering up
 here by acts of Congress
 If anv member of the
 bar of that Supreme Court
 shoulå be found in the
 court giving utterance to the
 ex pression of such an
 opinion as that that one
 of their decisions needed the
 sanction o this Con and
 bowed in humble submission to
 the foot of gress I
 am not sure that he
 would not be dealt the
 civil power I recognize all
 that and I know He
 certainly ought to be with
 or contempt that among the
 illustrious men whose further Then
 sir you do not want
 them Do you valor won
 and whose wisdom preserved by
 the want to give us
 anything We do not want
 it consolidation of the Constitution
 the liberties of Do you
 want to conc ede to
 as anything Do this country
 there is another honored name
 an you want to give
 anything that you have got
 ancestor of the honorable Senator
 from Virginia You have got
 the whole Keep it Make
 the Sir 1 wish as
 long as time lasts that
 the fame of most of
 it You have got it
 in the most solemn Virginia
 may be illustrated by no
 less illustrious form in which
 you ever can get it
 and if you are names
 than that which is worn
 by the distin to get
 it by an act of
 Congress on the top of
 that guished Senator from Virginia
 Mr MASON If decision of
 the Supreme Court I tell
 you you he does not
 always speak the scntimcnts which
 weaken rather than strengthen your
 title Then best accord with
 my own if his manner
 to an un you have
 got the General Government you
 have sophisticated man not accustomed
 to it some got Congress
 you have got the Supreme
 Court times savors n litile
 l wili say of plantation
 man you have got every
 State court except the court
 ncrs because I was on
 a plantation once and I
 of Wisconsin and you have
 got everything on know the
 kindness of their manner but
 if his earth that you
 want except one thing and
 that manner does sometimes indicate
 to an unsophis you are
 trying to get It has
 come to that at last
 ticated observer that Virginia is
 not a State but You
 are try ilk to bring
 the majority under the THE
 State of the Union I
 forgive it all because minority
 and do not know but
 you will do that I
 can nevo obliterate from my
 heart the recollec If you
 do it will be done
 by way of compromise let
 say that I think when
 I cx lion of that
 debt of gratitude which I
 in common Now sir press
 my reverence for the Constitution
 and my with all of
 us owe to Virginia But
 i tell you Senators from
 Virginia if I am willingncss
 to abide by it and
 the whole of it in
 not trespassing on the proprieties
 of this place every part
 and particle of it I
 do at least printa all
 the fame that your glorious
 ancestors have fac ie pive
 some evidence to the world
 that I am won for
 your glorious State all the
 glorious mem I tell the
 Senator from Illi a Union
 loving man ories of the
 great men that havc illustrated
 your nois he ought not
 to bc shocked and I
 think history will go out
 in that eternal darkness which
 does violence to his moral
 nature in allowing him shall
 shroud the liberties of this
 Republic if Vir self to
 be shocked when the honorable
 Senator I tell you ginia
 leads in this raid of
 secession from Virginia gets up
 and speaks in commenda the
 liberties of this country for
 weal or for lion of
 the Constitution and I give
 it my assent woe depend
 upon the conservation of this
 Union So fur from being
 shocked I was rejoiced at
 it I was rejoiced that
 the Senator from Virginia gave
 The very preservation of its
 liberties depends upon the conservation
 of this Union and that
 great utterance to those sentiments
 and I accord with sentiment
 so eloquently and so ably
 pronounced them to the fullest
 extent by a distinguished Senator
 from Massachusetts Rut now as
 I sce have what I
 do not often not now
 on this floor or among
 the living of have the
 ear of tbc honorable Senators
 from the Liberty and Union

 it be not arrogant speaking

 as true now as it
 was then it is true
 in the present and it
 will word to day to
 the great State of Virginia

 advice of some friends wit

 in the coming future I

 that he may be permitted

 that Virginia had not yet

 Do you prophet to proclaim

 Now sir let me say
 a word in behalf of
 my and our colleagues in
 the other House joined in
 self personally in regard to
 this matter an earnest recommendation
 to the Governor of I
 degree of personal responsibility in
 connection thc State New Hampshire
 asking him to send I
 with this subject I tu

 would bc sent thing that
 is consistent and if concede

 will use it 1 ion
 upon the best consultation we
 could have in am willing
 to do everything that is
 consistent the short time allowcd
 us that such a kneasure
 with my moral duty and
 with a patriotic desire as
 that would be salutary ill

 country and serve it faithfully
 but What effect that advice

 at issue in the this
 whole Union which a distinguished
 states discussions which are passim

 which now agitates this country
 it is the want to

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 665 Mr
 WIGFALL Mr President 1 desire
 to say a few words
 and but very few in
 reference to tho matters that
 have been under discussion this
 morning and I obtrude upon
 the Senate for the reason
 that I and my colleague
 I believe are the only
 remaining Senators from those States
 which have sccedcd or certainly
 will Two months have elapsed
 since the Congress of the
 United States met since it
 was proposed that the Union
 should be saved since committees
 were raised in both Houses
 since propositions were referred to
 them and we have not
 proffressed one hair s breadth
 The distinguished Senator from New
 York Mr SEWARD who is
 not pres ent who x
 vas advertised to make a
 Union speech some two weeks
 ago discussed matters and things
 generally and when he came
 to the practical ques tion
 said that as to the
 secession of these cotton States
 it was so trivial a
 matter that he really did
 not think it was worth
 I 1is while to stop
 and dis He passed that
 over as onc of thc
 inci cuss it dents that
 was worthy barely of an
 allusion but I did no
 t hear his speech to
 of nothing more day and
 therefore cannot speak as to
 that I am a plain
 blunt spoken man I usually
 say precisely what I mean
 and I always mean pre
 cisely what say I am
 for the Union and tbc
 Constitution of 1787 according to
 my under If this Government
 could be ad standing of
 it ministered in oc cordance
 witli the principles of the
 Union that was ratified by
 the old thirteen States that
 became binding between them as
 States and my advice could
 be heard in the State
 which 1 in part represent
 upon this floor Texas would
 not now be considering the
 question as to the propriety
 of withdrawing from this Confed
 they represent the majority party
 Without their to the people
 to vote What in _the
 name of God assent without
 their cordial aid and coöperation
 is it thåt the Crittenden
 resolutions propose It we know
 that the Constitution cannot be
 amended that no compromise can
 be made What then was
 the use of our stultifying
 ourselves What was the use
 of our sitting here and
 voting down resolutions which expressed
 the opinion of the dominant
 party of the country in
 order that the Senator from
 Illinois might write letters or
 tele graph to different States
 that the Union was about
 to be saved that tho
 Crittenden resolutions had been passed
 through the Senate I did
 not intend I to make
 myself a part y to
 the fraud and there fore
 when the question came up
 between the Crit tenden and
 Clark resolutions I for one
 forbore I knew that the
 Senators upon that side to
 vote of the Chamber had
 the majority We had ap
 pealed to them ve had
 begged them in God s
 rnercy and for the good
 of their own people and
 for the peace of the
 country to Interpose and to
 settle this question upon some
 safe basis The Senator from
 New York Mr SEWARD to
 my utter astonishment to day
 said that he had been
 for compromise all the time
 and defied any body to
 say that he had opposed
 any single one of the
 resolutions that wore referred to
 the com mittee of tl
 lirtcen Now I was not
 a member of that committee
 but it wras published in
 the news papers it was
 asserted upon this floor it
 was as serted in his
 presence time and again that
 he voted If the Senator
 acrainsl every single proposition l
 see him now in his
 seat desires to make an
 explanation of this if I
 have misunderstood I will give
 way with pleasure He does
 not wish to make the
 explanation and therefore it must
 go I low then the
 SenatorfromNewYork could eration But that
 is not so There is
 a radical say to day
 that he had not opposed
 these adjust difference of opinion
 as to the very forms
 of Gov The man ernment
 under which we are livinff
 who administers the Government differs
 from his party It is
 said that we have had
 the Govern nacr L in
 our hands that the Democratic
 party have it in their
 hands now Every one as
 this is a day in
 which platfonns are discussed who
 has ever read the platform
 of the Democratic party knows
 that the President of the
 United States does not stand
 upon it He denies flatly
 and unqualifiedly that the Constitution
 is a com pact binding
 between States So says the
 plat form upon which hc
 was elected and if he
 ever read the Kentucky and
 Virginia resolutions and uhderstood them
 I would say if it
 were an in dictablc offense
 to day that ho could
 bc indicted for obtaining offcc
 under false preoenscs He regards
 this as a consolidated Government
 in which the withdrawal of
 a State is a matter
 of I be considered the
 Pennsylvania Senator was one not
 the slightest consequence and that
 the only of the first
 men to vote against his
 own motion duty that devolves
 upon him is to enforce
 the i Therefore when my
 name was called I voted
 ments and yet had persistently
 voted in the com mittee
 of thirteen æ rainst every
 proposition of peace is one
 of the problems which I
 cannot solve What was his
 vote upon the floor of
 the Senate when the question
 camc up between the Critten
 den resolutions and the Clark
 resolutions He voted for the
 Clark resolutions as a substitute
 One of the Senators on
 that side the Senator from
 Pennsylvania Mr CAMERON moved to
 recon sider My name was
 one of the last that
 was called I listened and
 I heard the roll called
 through and from the first
 to the last from Alpha
 to Omega they answered no
 The Senator from Pennsylvania himself
 rnoved to reconsider and it
 v ras flashed upon the
 telearapllic wires over the the
 Senator from country all hope
 is not gone I Pennsylvania
 has relented he has moved
 to re consider and yet
 when his motion came up
 to is that the people
 of the United States as
 a single political community shall
 be allowed the przv liege
 of voting upon the proposition
 as to whether they would
 like to vote at some
 subsequent time upon some propositions
 If those resolutions be more
 or less than that then
 I have read them in
 vain The Senator from Kentucky
 himself does not pretend that
 they mean more than that
 He does not introduce resolutions
 here to amend the Constitution
 specifically and submit those amendments
 to the States for ratification
 If on the first day
 that Congress assembled some one
 who desired to save the
 Union had introduced propcr amendments
 in this Senate or in
 the other House and the
 Republican party had relented liad
 been willing to abandon then
 platform arpd their principles had
 voted for those resolutions had
 submitted them to their Legislatures
 and written private letters to
 their Governors to as semble
 their Legislatures and three fourths
 of those States had ratified
 them then we would have
 seen something like earnestness in
 the effort to save the
 Union Bat no such thing
 was done It is only
 last night that saw in
 a leading Repub iican paper
 what purported to be an
 extract from Mr Lincoln s
 own writing declaring that he
 was utterly and v holly
 opposed to any cornpromise Under
 thcse circurnstances what IS therc
 to be gained by this
 tampering with the question I
 It was hoped that the
 people will tell you what
 of the South would be
 amused that he action of
 the secession party would be
 defeated that Abra ham Lincoln
 would be inaugurated that the
 Pres ident of the United
 States would the forts and
 keep the artns and munitions
 of this Government that with
 a full Treasury with a
 well disciplined Army a well
 manned Navy Mr Abraham Lin
 coin would be inaugurated President
 of these United States and
 then we would be told
 you have to submit or
 be overrun But in the
 provi dene e of God
 the people took this thing
 in their owl hands South
 Carolina vas the first to
 move The Government pledged itself
 to non action The Government
 violated its pledge They saved
 one fort but they lost
 their honor South Car olina
 lost one fort but she
 saved her honor Un derst
 anding the party they were
 to deal with the flag
 of truce having been soiled
 the other States seized upon
 tbc forts and the arms
 within them and were prepared
 even before secession to de
 fend the right So stands
 the thing now What then
 is the use of getting
 up hero and making speeches
 about the Union Docs any
 Smoator on the other side
 intend to save it except
 with the bayonet let him
 get up and tell us
 how The Senator from Illinois
 has this mornincr acrain swrcrested
 tro us laws of the
 United States as well out
 of the Uni against reconsidering
 also and would do it
 again ted States as in
 it I hat is his
 high sworn duty I shall
 vote for no rcsolution that
 is brought here It is
 a specific for all things
 his principle and he is
 on that road rapidky driving
 us into war and the
 other I louse and those
 who sit in this Chamber
 arc sitting idly and listlessly
 oazino on when every man
 within the sound of my
 voice knows that thc very
 next news that may bc
 flashcd upon the licphtning from
 Pensacola Charleston may be that
 the Federal troops and the
 troops of Florida and South
 Carolino are in deadly conflict
 And yet Senators get up
 here and talk about the
 Union and desire that there
 should be peace and their
 wish to preserve it and
 they laugh and jest upon
 the subject I rose specially
 and particularly to reply to
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 DOUGLAS and to ex plain
 in perfect good temper that
 he has done me and
 those who voted with me
 the grossest injus tice He
 alluded to our vot e
 upon the Clark res olutions
 as they are called YVhat
 werc the Clark resolutions I
 hey wereresolutions asserting that no
 amendments to the Constitution neces
 sary and that t le
 only matter of importance was
 that coercion should be used
 upon the soverei n States
 that had declared themselves out
 of this Union When Lhose
 resolutions came up as a
 substitute for the resolutions of
 the Senator from Kentucky every
 single Senator who belongs to
 the dominant party the party
 that is to be in
 trusted with the reins of
 Government on the 4th of
 March next every single Senator
 from the Union loving Senator
 from New York Mr SEW
 ARID down to the most
 impracticable voted for the Clark
 resolutions as a substitute for
 the Crit I do not
 know whether he has a
 patent for it or to
 compromise which does not receive
 the sup port of the
 Republican party What use is
 there not but really Doctor
 Townsend s sarsaparilla what sense
 is there in voting to
 propose a question pales when
 it comes within the light
 of the ffreat to the
 peop c when the dominant
 party the party principle of
 non intervention That is the
 ques that is coming mto
 power will oppose the com
 i tion amend the Constitution
 so as to say that
 Congress shall not ever hereafter
 have the right promise which
 we propose to make I
 am not silly enough to
 suppose that those to interfere
 with slavery in any manner
 shai C Senators are not
 representative men I believe or
 form cither to abolish or
 to protect Why I none
 of this twaddle which I
 hear every day that tell
 the Senator that that great
 principle of his dis the
 Representatives are on one side
 and their II rupted the
 Democratic party and has now
 dis ruptcd the Union and
 but för him and his
 great I know that the
 vice of our people on
 the other Government is that
 men too closely represent principle
 this day a Democrat would
 havo been the passions the
 opinions and the prejudices of
 President of the United States
 and the Union their constituents
 and that it is only
 I lcre and saved That
 is the fact about the
 Inatter and there you finda
 man who can raise hilnsclf
 above when a Senator who
 has contributed more than any
 man in the Union according
 to his ability thc low
 demagoo uism of the country
 stand for himself think for
 himself speak for himself and
 to the destruction of the
 country comes here and charges
 me with complicity in dissolving
 the and trusting to their
 go back to his constituents
 wisdom to their intelligence and
 to their virtue i I
 Union and charges in terms
 that ex lrcunes n neet
 explain to them that he
 had voted against their and
 that I and my friends
 and the Free Soilers on
 instructions for their own good
 My experience II the other
 side are coöpcrating for the
 stune pur in life has
 been that those rnen who
 talk most pose that we
 are voting together and that
 we about the wisdom and
 the intelligence of the peo
 take great cornfort in all
 these exhibitions of the pie
 are those who least believe
 it Therefore I itnpossibility of
 saving the Union I tell
 him that say that I
 am myself entirely satisfied that
 those he is not the
 man to come here and
 preach to any Senators represent
 their constituents as I know
 body From my youth upwards
 I have been in favor
 and feel that I represent
 the fi2clings of thc people
 I am in favor of
 it now and be of
 this Union amon t whom
 1 live Under these circumstances
 I am not willing to
 cause I am in favor
 of it am to us
 e a paradox It is
 to preserve it that mislead
 those who have intrusted mc
 here as one in favor
 of disrupting it would destroy
 it The Constitution has been
 of theguardians of their safety
 and of their honor trampled
 under foot the principles of
 the Consti I therefore vote
 for no resolutions which do
 not receive the sanction of
 t hc Reoublican party I
 tution have been misunderstood and
 a Constitu tenden resolutions They
 happen temporarily 10 be in
 a minority but they have
 the Government vote for no
 unmeaning paper which is to
 be left li tion and
 Union have been substituted which
 were 666 never ordained and
 established A compact has been
 cntered into by individuals whiCh
 thö States never agreed to
 and as a party which
 disregards the Constitution which has
 a higher lavv than the
 oaths which they swear upon
 this floor has pos session
 of this Government as our
 rights our lives and our
 liberties are unsafe and because
 I believe this Union to
 be the best forrn of
 Govern ment that the ingenuity
 of man ever established I
 am in favor of the
 States withdrawing as they came
 into the Union one after
 the other each for itself
 and by itself and taking
 this same Consti tution and
 establishing it between partners who
 will observe their faith and
 their oaths When I talk
 about being for the Union
 I do not use senseless
 and meaningless terms I mean
 just what I say that
 I am fora Government that
 established not by individuals not
 by sociål compacts but by
 States or political communities in
 which each State or political
 community keeps control of its
 own domestic affairs but intrusts
 to a conunon Government or
 agency the manage ment of
 its foreign affairs That is
 the Govern ment that was
 formed in 1787 and that
 sort of government I am
 for now For that sort
 of Gov ernment I shall
 always hereafter be That sort
 of government I trust in
 God will be formed next
 Monday at Montgomery and I
 only regret that the State
 of Texas will not be
 in a condition on that
 day to become one of
 the parties to that com
 If that be treason if
 being in favor of the
 pact Union and wishing to
 preserve that Union be a
 sin then have I sinned
 most grievously But I do
 not bear with much patience
 that nrucn whose conduct politically
 whose votes and whose speeches
 have created most of the
 antagonism and irritation bctwccn thc
 two sections ofthe coun try
 shall come here and taunt
 me as being in favor
 of the destruction of the
 country which I am sworn
 to preserve as long as
 my State lives in it
 Now Ict us sec whether
 the Senator s specific whether
 his sarsaparilla will curc whatis
 the difii cult y I
 have ali vays understood that
 it was a well settled
 principle long bofbre the days
 of the Declaration of Independence
 that Governments were instituted for
 the benefit of the governed
 and that the purpose of
 organizing Governments was the protection
 of life liberty and property
 That I have understood to
 be the case The Sen
 atop from Illinois wishes us
 to establisl l a Federal
 Government that does not protect
 property I hat is the
 proposition after you have bolted
 it to the bran a
 Government that is not to
 protect prop erty If he
 would say that as to
 all species and kinds of
 property that when a cargo
 of goods left Massachusetts to
 sail for Louisiana and got
 three marine leagues upon the
 high seas any pirate cruiser
 sailing even under a regular
 flag could scize upon that
 vessel and confiscate the goods
 if he will Bay that
 then I understand that while
 his rule is a bud
 one it works equally to
 all sections But neither he
 nor any other man has
 ever proposed that It is
 on y onc species of
 property that is to have
 the ban put upon it
 That species of property is
 the scn t tl at
 we in the southern States
 property That is to be
 branded that is to be
 tabooed that is not to
 be protected and we are
 asked then to be satisfied
 1 say to the Senator
 ft mn Illinois I say
 to the Senator from New
 York and to the Senator
 from New Hampshire and to
 all those sitting upon that
 side that we will never
 be con tented with any
 such adjustment as that The
 Union IS now dissolved Six
 States are out of the
 Union One more is probably
 out or certainly will be
 within a few days Other
 States may or may not
 secede am no prophet nor
 the son ofa prophet But
 those States will never come
 back and with you except
 upon equal terms You have
 denounced us upon the stump
 you have denounced us in
 your pulpits you have following
 the instructions and sugges tions
 of thc Senator from Ncw
 York educated our children to
 hate us We have been
 tabooed e have been treated
 worse than that You have
 used savage practices and then
 brought in all the cruelties
 of the Church We have
 been marched with your Dominicans
 bcfore and behind us to
 the auto da fé You
 have gone back and you
 have unburied the dead and
 you have put the Father
 of his Country as you
 call him the immortal Washington
 in a coffin painted with
 devils and you have inarched
 us the livin F and
 the dead before thc civilized
 world thus branded and bc
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 30 cause
 of our institutions These are
 facts Wash inøton has been
 denounced in the northern States
 from one end to the
 other as a scoundrel by
 your froe negro free soiler
 You expect that we will
 come back under these circumstances
 because the great principle is
 to be carried out I
 say to you Senators on
 both sides so far as
 the State and the people
 which I in part represent
 arc concerned that they come
 back not upon any such
 terms as those We say
 that man has the right
 to own property in man
 We say that our slaves
 are our property We say
 that it is the duty
 of every Government to protect
 propert y everywhere While we
 refuse protection to your property
 nowhere claim protection to our
 property everywhere The hon orable
 Senator from Virginia spoke truly
 when he said we ask
 no concessions We ask nothing
 but that which is in
 the compact We ask nothing
 but that which is in
 the Constitution itself The Con
 stitution of the United States
 recognizes slaves as property I
 am not going to argue
 it You all know that
 the Constitution kept the slave
 trade open for twenty years
 The Constitution could not be
 altered during that period by
 the consent even of cvery
 State For twenty years the
 slave trade was kept open
 by the Constitution and if
 that was not a clear
 recognition of the right to
 traffic in human flesh and
 buy and sell men and
 women then I would like
 to know what would be
 The Declaration oflndcpendcncc acknowlcdgcs the
 ricrht of man to own
 property in man per vertea
 and misconstrued as it is
 and has been by you
 One of the gravest charges
 that is made against King
 George in the Declaration of
 Ini dependence that hc is
 a John Brown Wide Awake
 They charge as onc of
 their reasons for dissolving their
 connection with the British Gov
 ernmcnt that George Ill was
 stirring up insur rcction tunong
 their slaves And yet you
 say that the Declaration of
 Independence declares that all men
 aro free and equal It
 does use that gen eral
 phraseology but if they by
 all men negroes as woll
 as whites Indians as well
 as whites those who had
 no political rights as well
 as those who had if
 that was their mcanincy with
 what sort of consistency could
 they have stated as a
 ground for dissolving their connection
 with the British Government that
 the British Crown was stirring
 up insurrection among their slaves
 And yet that is what
 they say Why Senators you
 do not deceive yourselves You
 have been attempting to deceive
 your con stituents and you
 have reaped the reward You
 have dissolved the Union The
 Declaration of Independencc declares that
 when one people dis solve
 their connection with another people
 it is but proper that
 they should give the reasons
 for their separation It then
 indulges in some genera remark
 as to all men being
 created free and equal and
 having thc inalienable right to
 life liberty and thc pursuit
 of happiness It then declares
 specifically that inciting insurrection in
 the coun try was one
 of the causes of diffculty
 What is the fact as
 to Massachusetts I see one
 Of the Senators from that
 State Mr WILSON listening to
 me What is the fact
 as to Massachusetts Why on
 the 18th of July 1776
 they published the Declaration of
 h dependence in the Boston
 Gazette and before God they
 published an ad vertisemcnt for
 a runaway negro and offered
 another for sale Laughter can
 produce the record if you
 deny it If you doubt
 it on some other day
 I will Did the people
 of Massachu setts then believe
 that all men meant negroes
 and Subsequently to that time
 or abont simultaneously with that
 they passed a law by
 their Legislature fining and imprisoning
 any white man or woman
 who would intermarry with a
 negro imposing heavy pains and
 penalties upon those who would
 solemnize the marriage Was that
 treating negroes as their equals
 If a negro was one
 of that class of the
 human family spoken I of
 in the Declaration of Independence
 under the ceneral term all
 men and had his happiness
 involved in contracting marrive with
 one of the fair sex
 of another color were you
 permitting him the pursuit of
 his happiness by putting him
 in the pillory or penitentiary
 if with her consent he
 consummated the marriage The thing
 is too i absurd to
 talk about The men of
 the Revolution were white Inen
 They intended to assert that
 political communities had the right
 of self govern ment to
 live under such form of
 government as suited them They
 made that declaration and they
 made that declaration only It
 was all they meant it
 was all they intended it
 was all that was understood
 by any man then living
 to have It is what
 we uhderstand been intended by
 it now Then if you
 wish to settle this matter
 declare that slaves are property
 and like ali other prop
 erty entitled to be protected
 on every quarter of the
 globe on land and on
 sea Say that to us
 and then one diffculty is
 settled Then say to us
 that we are not to
 be enslaved that we have
 the right of self government
 we have within the last
 two months ceased to consider
 this ques tion of abolishing
 slavery a question of more
 vital importance has been presented
 to us and that is
 not whether our slaves Shall
 be freemen but whether freemen
 shall be made slaves Not
 whether you will liberate our
 slaves but whether you will
 enslave their masters I say
 we have a right to
 live under such a form
 of government as we see
 fit Six States have asserted
 that right You deny it
 and until you adrnit in
 unmistaka ble language the right
 ofa State to withdraw from
 this Union in otller words
 until you admit that white
 men living south of Mason
 and Dixon s line have
 the inalienable right o live
 under such government as they
 see fit until you admit
 that and withdraw your forces
 and cease your men aces
 we are not disposed to
 consider any other question When
 we are told that we
 have aright to live under
 such a form of government
 as we sec fit then
 we will counsel with you
 as to what sort of
 government will suit us hut
 not till then This is
 the programme as I understand
 it on the part of
 the seceding States I have
 spoken thus plainly and cxplicitly
 because my colleague and myself
 are the last representatives of
 those States upon this floor
 How long it will be
 be fore the offcc that
 we hold shall be abolished
 I know not I shall
 not resign my placc while
 State remains in the Union
 While therc is a Senatorship
 to be filled I shall
 fill it When she has
 repealed the law when she
 has abolished the office when
 it ceases to exist I
 shall take my departure and
 then you can call it
 a rcsignat_ion if you wish
 The honorable Senator from New
 Hampshire after felicitating himself and
 his section of the country
 upon having all the decency
 intelligence virtue and religion in
 the country tells us that
 our history will be written
 in the history of Mex
 ico I say to that
 Senator the history of Texas
 is already upon the pages
 of Mexican history It is
 written there in blood It
 was written therc in defense
 of liberty You have attempted
 to do what the I
 ictator in rexas did to
 trample upon the Constitution of
 your country to consolidate and
 centralize a Federal Republic to
 trample liberty in the dust
 Texas took arms in her
 hands and vindicated her right
 and she will do it
 again It has been written
 upon two pages of Mexican
 his tory It was written
 when we achieved our inde
 pendence and when this country
 becamc involved in a war
 with Mexico for wrongs unredressed
 of twenty years standing includihg
 the question of the Texas
 boundary When this country became
 involved in that war with
 Mexico I exas again wrote
 on another page of Mexican
 history hers in blood l
 he military achievements of New
 Eneland I believe the Senator
 did not say anything of
 It happens to be a
 singular fact that while New
 England has been claiming all
 the Territory she fbught for
 very little of it The
 entire New Englancl States had
 only about a thou sand
 men from first to last
 in the Mexican var out
 of sixty thousand General Cushing
 I be lievc managed to
 get a regiment of Irishmen
 out of Boston Texas upon
 the bloody fields of Mex
 ico carried seven thousand men
 all told That State with
 less than one hundred thousand
 in habitants carried into the
 battle fields of Mexico seven
 thousand men and all New
 England one But when it
 came to dividing the Territory
 you thanked God you were
 not like us poor publi
 cans and you said that
 freedom must be extended that
 you were entitled to the
 Territory which mtvith our blood
 we had won and because
 we are not satisfied you
 consider us very unreasonable These
 are the facts and I
 say to the Senator that
 having our history written upon
 two pages of Mexican history
 we are not emulous of
 hav ing further connection with
 that country He 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 667 will find
 that the men who live
 in these States That is
 known and yet Senators rise
 here and upon the Gulf
 are neither Indians nor negroes
 say they do not think
 the Union is in any
 danger nor mulattoes but they
 are white men wiih red
 Do you want Virginia to
 remain in the Union blood
 in their veins who draw
 their descent from God knows
 I do not want her
 to go out of it
 it the best Huguenot blood
 that was ever shed in
 Ill docs not concern me
 in the least If you
 want to definse of religious
 liberty in France and from
 carry Virginia and make her
 the tail end of a
 thc cavalier blood that never
 quailed in Ervkand Black ReÖublican
 confederation and the descend that
 those men do the voting
 and fighting that i thcv
 do the legislating that they
 ad Kllinister the lav s
 and sit on juries and
 that they are entirely capable
 of self government Whether you
 will be able to maintain
 your institutions is a matter
 that I forbear to discuss
 because it is a matter
 that concerns you and not
 me Having said thus much
 Mr Presidcnt and having been
 induced to say it because
 my vote and the VOtcs
 of Senators who are now
 not mem bers of this
 body were commented upon by
 the Senator from Illinois and
 havin r explained the principles
 by which I was actuated
 I have no disposition to
 trespass longer on the patience
 of the body If at
 the beginning of this session
 any one had really and
 sincerely desired to save the
 Union if any one here
 had risen and said there
 were States that were in
 all probability about to leave
 the Union that the right
 of self government was a
 great right which had been
 fought for and achieved by
 a seven years war and
 t herefore if any State
 withdrew from this Union the
 Federal Government had no power
 to coerce her had protcstcd
 and implored against the dissolution
 of thc Union of thc
 thirty three States and had
 pro posed that the Constitution
 should be so amended that
 slaves should be considered as
 property and bc entitled to
 its protection everywhere had these
 two simple propositions been introduced
 in this Chamber and been
 voted for by Senators on
 the other side all these
 difficulties would have becn settled
 the Union would have been
 safe and we again a
 band of brothers But instead
 of that one parcel of
 resolutions is brought in and
 another The Senator from Tenncssee
 whorn do not see Mr
 JOHNSON if they had brought
 in some resoiutions which been
 adopted would have dissolved the
 Union proposing to elect judges
 of the Supreme Court by
 the people and to destroy
 our form of Gov ernment
 by having Senators elected by
 a popu lar vote and
 havinff some Union savinc miscr
 able renegade and traitor who
 lived south of Mason and
 Dixon s line secured in
 perpetuity every other four years
 the Presidency These propositions of
 his would have been causc
 for a dissolution of the
 Union if they had been
 adopted but they have never
 been discussed or considered Tl
 hen there was the proposition
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 which as I said proposes
 sim ply to let the
 people vote as to whether
 they would like to vote
 Then there was a proposition
 to divide ali the territory
 by an imaginary line and
 admit two Statos into the
 Union onc with sla very
 and the other without it
 which proposition has been defeated
 now by adrnittino Kansas a
 portion of onc of thesc
 rycrritorics into the Union alrcady
 the other day These propositions
 were they were carried before
 a commit broacyht in tee
 t bat committee considered them
 every Re publican voted against
 every single proposition that was
 brought in and it was
 so announced From that time
 to this the distinguished Senator
 frotn Kentucky has morning aft
 cr morn ing raised his
 voice here and pleaded in
 vain to have his resolutions
 considered yet they have not
 been considered A Senator from
 one of thc New England
 States moves a substitute and
 eo instanti that is considered
 and voted upon and accepted
 as a substitute in preference
 to the resolutions of the
 Senator from Kentucky Then a
 motion is made to reconsider
 and the entire Republican party
 vote against that Now at
 this day within one month
 of the adjournment of this
 Congress not the first step
 has bcen made towards any
 rec onciliation any concession not
 the first step has been
 taken in that direction and
 yet persons are ants of
 liT11 t h orse Harry
 Liøh tfootLee of George Mason
 and the Pendletons and Randolphs
 and Washingtons of that day
 wish that position they certainly
 are cntitled to it it
 does not disturb us But
 is It fair for gentlemen
 is it honest I ask
 I do not use the
 tcrm in an offensive sense
 if it can be used
 in any other I certainly
 do not mean to be
 any more offensive than I
 can possibly avoid but c
 an they say that there
 is no danger or that
 there is any hope now
 of a compromise being made
 with the facts before them
 I do not know how
 men write I always mean
 what I say and say
 precisely what I mean and
 when I and another pcrson
 have a diffcalty and for
 two months we have been
 trying to adjust it and
 every time I talk to
 him ho says sir I
 have not one word to
 say I cannot in my
 conscience declare that I believe
 there is a prospect of
 that matter being adjusted amicably
 unless I back out What
 evidence of relenting has there
 been on the other side
 The Presidei t cloct has
 just pub lished under his
 own sitynature a declaration that
 he is utterly and wholly
 opposed to every com promise
 I will state my authority
 I saw it last night
 in the New York Tribune
 printed in quo tation marks
 from Abraham Lincoln that he
 is utterly and whollv opposed
 to comprcnnise He says he
 is entitled to the office
 of President it is inch
 would be buying his and
 to yield a single I
 have not the paper here
 what he already owns I
 do not carry Itin my
 pocket but that is the
 sub stance of what he
 stud Undcr these circumstances I
 chosc to vote against reconsidering
 the vote on Mr CLARK
 S resolution because the entire
 Republican party had voted against
 reconsidering because the Re publican
 who had moved a reconsideration
 himself voted against it because
 I saw not the slightest
 evidence of relenting because I
 had heard from that side
 nothing which looked to compromise
 or concession or a recognition
 of our rights noth ing
 that looked to anything that
 was practical Hence I voted
 in that way and because
 I so voted I arn
 held up here as one
 who is confed eratincr with
 free soilers in an cndcavor
 to dis I say that
 I would dissolve solve the
 Union this Union no not
 dissolve it but I would
 burst it I would fracture
 it splinter it into more
 frag ments than gunpowder would
 blow glass before I would
 live in a Government in
 which I was not the
 equal of any other wllue
 man in the country before
 I would have In y
 State confederated with States that
 declare that her institutions the
 con dition of her men
 and of the wives the
 mothers and the sisters of
 her is uroon a footing
 with the condition of the
 miscrablc wretches whom they herd
 like cattle in Utah when
 they say that polygamy and
 slavery are twin relics of
 barbar Ism That is the
 declaration of the Republican party
 It was the declaration in
 your platform In 1856 and
 above thirteen hundred thousand men
 voted that sentiment that our
 wives and our mothers and
 Brigham Young s women occupy
 socially and morally thc samc
 position Here a party in
 this country that is elected
 to power tells us that
 we shall live under their
 authority or be trampled with
 thc iron heel of svar
 I hat drop of blood
 that s cahn proclaizns us
 bastard Cries cuckoid to our
 father brands thc harlot Even
 herc between the chaste unsmirclred
 brows Of our true 1110thcrs
 You denounce us degrade us
 deride us tell us we
 shall live under a Government
 that ve say is not
 tasteful to us you tell
 us that we are do
 graded that we are not
 your equals That is If
 the Senator from Illinois wants
 a compro mise let him
 abandon his squatter sovereignty let
 him get up here and
 introduce a resolution de claring
 that slave are property aud
 that the Gov ernment is
 bound to protect them everywhere
 Say that let him say
 to us I will go
 home and advocate this doctrine
 before my people and try
 to induce the State of
 Illinois not the American people
 to elect delegates to a
 convention that will ratify this
 amendment to the Constitution let
 him go to his Black
 Republican friends and say to
 them You must declare that
 slaves are prop erty and
 that the Government shall protect
 this property everywhere that all
 white men shall have the
 right to live under such
 form of Govern ment as
 they see fit let him
 say that and get his
 Black Republican friends to get
 up and say it here
 and give us assurances that
 they will do that and
 in the mean time turn
 your guns to sea withdraw
 your troops cease insanely attempting
 to collect revenue outside of
 the United States tell us
 that we can live under
 such a form of Gove
 ernment as we see fit
 do these things and the
 country will have some peace
 repose and quiet to consider
 these matters an appeal to
 arms may be avoided and
 the Government and the Union
 may be reconstructed I do
 not know whether it can
 be or not I speak
 for nobody but myself I
 say that so far as
 I am concerned if these
 things were done if this
 was recognized and åcknowl edged
 to bc a Federal Government
 if we had our right
 to oovern ourselves recognized and
 acknowl edged and if the
 ban was removed from our
 prop crty i would advise
 a calm fair consideration of
 the propositions and a reconstruction
 of the Union I think
 the Union is a great
 blessinm Mr WILKINSON Mr President
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Does the
 Sen ator from Texas yield
 Mr WILKINSON 1 desire to
 ask the Sen ator from
 Texas if hc wishes to
 have the Gov ernment troops
 withdrawn from Texas Mr WIGFALL
 Just waita moment I can
 not hear you Mr WILKINSON
 understood the Senator to say
 that the Government should withdraw
 their troops 1 wish to
 ask him if he wants
 thc Gov ernment troops withdrawn
 from Texas Mr WIGFALL It
 is a matter of perfect
 in difference to us Probably
 we shall have the arms
 they havc there before your
 orders to withdraw them could
 be carried Mr DOUGLAS Mr
 President Mr WIGFALL Notjust this
 minute As to the matter
 of withdrawing the troops from
 Texas I say to the
 Senator from Minnesota that it
 is a matter of no
 sort of consequence to me
 or to the people I
 represent here whether they are
 with drawn or not They
 have never rendered any service
 there Our border has been
 devastated by war ever since
 and long before I took
 my seat on this floor
 Last year I asked in
 the name of mercy to
 save the lives of women
 and children that a regiment
 of rangers should be put
 in the field who could
 and who would defend that
 fron tier and the Senator
 who asks me the question
 voted against it I apprehend
 as almost every Senator on
 that side did The bill
 was voted down the women
 and children were left to
 the tender mercies of the
 scalping knife and toma the
 war has been hawk upon
 our entire border oin y
 on from that timo to
 this and we have artil

 Withdraw them when you please
 I trust in God that
 they will leave their guns
 though before their departure and
 if my advice is followed
 I have no hesitation in
 saying that they will Mr
 DOUGLAS I have but a
 very few words to say
 in reply to the Senator
 from Texas and as ho
 assurcd the Senate he was
 going to reply to me
 in very good temper I
 shall endcavor to what you
 tell us and when we
 say to you if we
 preserve my good temper as
 well as he I do
 not cannot live together in
 peace we will separate deem
 it necessary to take any
 notice of his very telegraphing
 and writing all over the
 country that you say we
 sha l not and then
 because I do not funny
 illustration about the sarsaparilla I
 was choose to make a
 ninny of myself because I
 do a member of the
 Senate when that vvas first
 used they have hopes that
 the Union is going to
 be saved Six States are
 out of the Union It
 is known to myself it
 is known to everybody that
 next Monday they mcet in
 solemn convention as the old
 thirteen originally met to form
 a new Fcderal It is
 known that they will do
 it Government I t is
 known that they will have
 a President a Vice President
 n Congrcss an Army a
 Navy a Treasury and treaties
 with foreign Govcrnmcnts in the
 body and I think it
 was so much better not
 choose to stultify myself and
 vote for reso lutions that
 mean nothing in order that
 Senators told by Colonel Benton
 wrhen he applied it to
 Mr may telegraph over the
 country that ali is peace
 Clay than the gentleman has
 told it to day that
 I let that stand for
 what it is worth and
 quiet bccausc I do not
 choose to do that or
 to be lod by the
 nose as tenderly as asses
 are I Then sir I
 come to the charge that
 he makes arn charged with
 a conspiracy with the Black
 ao ainst mc that I
 have done gross injustice to
 him Republicans to dissolve the
 Union to prevent and to
 othars by the reference that
 I have ma le to
 the vote and the omission
 to vote on the adop
 any compromise 668 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 31 tion of
 the Clark amendment to the
 Crittenden are in favor of
 intervention too They both agree
 these tvro extremes and save
 the Union certainly did not
 intend to do any that
 Congress must intervene and control
 the sla plausc in the
 Yalleries resolutions I hope that
 there is a injustice to
 him or any other Senator
 I merely very question They
 both agree as to the
 power Union sentiment left in
 the southern States recited thc
 facts Those are not denied
 The and duty of Congress
 to intervene and control the
 believe that if we shall
 do justice by facts are
 that when the vote was
 first taken it slave question
 He does not think that
 the Union ourselves of the
 power to commit those disclosed
 that the resolutions would be
 carried if is in danger
 in consequence of the Republicans
 sions on the slaveholding Statcs
 which we sav this side
 of the Chambor had voted
 against the asserting the right
 and duty of this Government
 I we do not intend
 to commit adopt a constitutional
 Clark amendment Some on the
 other side voted to prohibit
 slavery in the Territories and
 in the I amendment rendering
 it impossible for us to
 do at first against the
 amendment but changed their dock
 yards and navy yards and
 the District of what they
 think sve mean to do
 and what we say votes
 after they found that the
 Senators from the i Columbia
 He sees no danger from
 that and E we do
 not intend to do there
 will be Union noen cotton
 States would not accept the
 proposition none from the counter
 demand that the Federal I
 enough in Virgiliia in Maryland
 and North Car 1 also
 stated that telegraphic dispatches were
 sent Government shall interfere to
 maintain and pro i olina
 and in all the border
 States and in all the
 off immediately that there was
 no hope of pass tect
 slavery everywhere I do see
 that this whole cotton Statcs
 too svho will outvote the
 secession ing the Crittenden resolutions
 because they had f trouble
 arises from tho conflict between
 intervon ists and preserve this
 Union becn voted down That
 fact is not denied The
 tionists north and interventionists south
 The I desire sir to
 make my appeal to the
 Union excuse for that fact
 is that the Senator voted
 as he did on the
 reconsideration and refused to vote
 on the original proposition in
 order that i should not
 have an opportunity of send
 i ne Offa telegrap h
 ic dispatch to the country
 that the Union was safe
 I and that the Crittenden
 resolutions would be adopted What
 right had hc to assune
 that I would send any
 such dispatch Mr WIGFALL I
 not interrupt the cur rent
 of your arwument but that
 wc may under stand each
 other I just wish to
 ask the Senator if he
 has any information as to
 whether any dis whole trouble
 arises from the conflict men
 of the country North and
 South to the con those
 who demand that Congress shall
 intervene servative feeling of the
 country to the great pa
 for the purposc of prohibitino
 072 the onc side triotic
 hoart of the people and
 to ask them to arise
 and those vu rho demal
 d that Conkress Shall intcr
 ill their might and overthrow
 all v party that will
 vene for the purpose of
 protecting and rnaintain combine to
 destroy this Union for any
 purpose ing on the other
 side I do not desire
 any section or any State
 to give I lac Senator
 from Texas cannot vindicatc him
 up any right under the
 Constitution self and those that
 act with Ilin unless hc
 vin sense the remark of
 the Senator froin Vi rginla
 clicatcs the Republicans also and
 they cannot and the indorsement
 of the Senator from New
 _Hampshire was just The Senator
 fronn Vir vindicate their position
 without vindicating his Hence they
 unitc in denouncincr non intervention
 i ginia war ts no
 concessions he is satisfied with
 they turree in denouncing the
 great principle of patch was
 sent from the Senate as
 to that vote non interfercnce
 which alone can put a
 stop to and what the
 character of the dispatch was
 bc the slavery agitation Ehe
 Senator could not cause he
 asserted it broadly I want
 to put myself He has
 asse rted broadly that we
 voted in a certain way
 and that the Obiect of
 it was to send these
 dispatchcs and that the dispatcl
 ies w cro I have
 not seen any of those
 dispatches sent pu t lished
 myself and arn not awn
 rc of the fact I
 that the Senator frotn Georgia
 Mr IVERSON sent a dispatch
 and the only one that
 was sent I expect but
 I do not know I
 want to understand whether the
 Senator knc ws what was
 the character of those dispatches
 My reply about his sendin
 r d ispa tches was
 legitimate regarded it as a
 reply to that poil t
 Mr DOUGLAS In regard to
 that I will say that
 I saw gent len en
 here writing what I sup
 posed to be dispatchos but
 that of course not inquire
 into and in a day
 or two I sa w
 dis patches iVi southcrn papers
 purporting to be froin those
 Senators and I presurncd they
 were gen I think I
 have seen rce 01 fi
 tu notices of thetn in
 difTerent papers That is all
 the inform ation I had
 that subject Mr WIGlöALL Precisely
 Mr DOUGLAS Now sn 1
 have sent no dispatch upon
 this subject except one signed
 jointly by the Senator from
 Kentucky Mr CRIT TENDEN and
 HI yse l in reply
 to a cormnittee of very
 prominent and distinguished persons asking
 ion we simply ex pressed
 our opinion we said we
 have hope and added Don
 t gi ve up the
 shil don t despair t
 Repu blic r I llat
 was all I could not
 have sent dispatch i pro
 eosition had been defeat led
 efli ct that the CEIltcndcn
 proposition was ad opted it
 left that nacted upon r
 he effect of all the
 gentlemen on this side votin
 y in o p ositi0
 to the Republican side on
 that amend wou ld have
 been to leave the Crittenden
 vn oposit ion be the
 Senate to be acted upon
 wo uld have Ti ven
 it a chance to be
 and would have prived them
 of the opportunity of telegraphing
 to thc country that there
 was no hope in ordei
 to oxpcditc secession in the
 States where the vote was
 about to be taken Such
 use was made of that
 vole and it was i
 uritimatc therefore for me to
 refer to it as an
 evidence that there was an
 an willingness a some on
 this side of the Cham
 havo given a more striking
 illustration of tho jus tice
 of my first comments of
 the syrnpathy be tween the
 extremists north and tho extremists
 than this unity of purp
 ose to keep the slavery
 agitation in Congress and thus
 produce irrepressible conflict bet veen
 the two soc tions All
 I have ever asked was
 that tho Ro publicans 01
 their side should give up
 their al loqyed ri Fht
 to interfere a yainst slavery
 and that the extren o
 South should give up their
 claim to i E tertOrc
 for slavery Let the question
 alone and there will be
 peace in this country But
 the Senator says that to
 adopt the princi of non
 intervention on the subject of
 slavery would be equivalent to
 the abandonment of the right
 ot protection to property that
 every Gov ern nnent mast
 property everywhere I hat Sel
 ator had bet ter read
 the Constitution again and then
 let him tell where he
 finds the power riven to
 this Govern mcnt to protect
 horses or cat tle or
 merchandise or slaves or any
 species of prot erty in
 any State or Territory of
 this Union I do not
 propose to make a distinction
 betwecl them but I deny
 tbc right of this Federal
 Gov ernment to interfere with
 cither of them The Constitution
 gives no power to do
 so in the States and
 Ict I lin i show
 a clause of thc Constitution
 that gives greater power on
 domestic questions in the than
 in the States I repeat
 that I sco no ho
 je of peace except for
 the extremists north and the
 extremists south to yield to
 the adoption of tbc principle
 that the Government shall legislate
 upon the subject slavery anywhere
 This question can bo taken
 out of Congress can bc
 withdrawn from the arena of
 Federal politics in various ways
 One an equitable partition of
 the territory be twcen the
 two sections with clau so
 s in be Con stitution
 secu ring the enjoynent to
 thc North and to the
 South of the share of
 each Another is a provision
 that Congress shall not legislate
 on the subject an v
 where except in the t
 wo cases specifiéä Eitlier of
 these provisions takes it out
 of Congress and I arn
 willing as I have said
 to tnc et gentlemen half
 v ray acccnn tnodatin r
 1 do not ask t
 hcm to come to any
 the the Constitution as it
 is as he it The
 Senator from New I lampsbire
 wants chan re I Ie
 is satisfied with the Constitution
 as he understands it But
 il so happens that these
 two Senators do not uriderstand
 thc Constitution In the satne
 way and each of tl
 em wilt up the Union
 l efore he will the
 construc tion of the other
 In that is the trouble
 and how are you goinrr
 to reconcile it T hc
 Senator from Virginin can not
 a reue the Senator from
 New Illampshirc out of his
 construction nor can the I
 Senator Now I lanujsh ire
 argue the Senator from Virginia
 out of his How then
 is it to be sctt
 led Y ou rnu st
 cither adhere to your two
 extreme positions and dissolve t
 hc Union be cause you
 each think you are right
 or you must a cyree
 to such an amend Inent
 of the Constitution as will
 and fix the constraction of
 it in all I lence
 it comes to tho single
 point that either we must
 amend the Constitution so as
 to settle the points in
 dispute or prosecute the irrepressible
 conflict between the intervention ists
 north and t hc interventi01
 lists south destroy the Government
 and each charge it on
 the other Under these circumstances
 I do not understand how
 any Inan can be a
 friend of the Union who
 is opposed to such a
 compromise of the matters in
 dispute as will preserve it
 I hear the Repub licans
 thc cxtrcme men for there
 arc Union men I find
 on that side of the
 Chamber but the uncompromising men
 that side of the Chamber
 are loud in their professions
 of attachment to the Union
 just as loud in those
 professions as the Senator from
 Texas just as sincere just
 patri otic and yet rushing
 with the stu ne rapidity
 to the destruction of the
 very Union they profess to
 revere The man that will
 not compromise by settlinqy the
 construction on this disputed point
 hus no right to claim
 that he is a Union
 man I föar thcre are
 disunionists north and south in
 the sense in which I
 understand the term not in
 the sense in which the
 Senator from T exas or
 the gentlen u n on
 the other side understand it
 1 ear there are men
 in both sections of the
 Union t who think it
 is better for their section
 to have the Union dissolved
 fear there are in both
 sec tionsof the Union who
 for political reasons would like
 to have it dissolved I
 fear there are men in
 both sections who think that
 their party could or y
 of mine I think it
 is tile best one but
 I am control one half
 of the country when they
 could bcr as well as
 the other side to adjust
 and ii willil g for
 the sake of t he
 peaco of the country not
 hope to govern the whole
 I fear that these for
 the sake of this Union
 to meet gentlemen half considerations
 are restraining patriotic men from
 settle thesc questions t the
 Senator has to refer by
 way of ridi way accomtnodate
 this question as our fatli
 making those concessions which are
 essential to cule as hc
 supposes and it is very
 fine no ii ers did
 in the convention which framed
 the Con the salvation the
 peace and the perpetuity of
 doubt to my great principle
 of non interven stitution this
 Union It is not agreeable
 to me to express tic
 i by Congress with slavery
 in the States and But
 the Senator does not see
 how honest n men this
 conviction I have attempted to
 express it Territories Sir if
 that principle had been car
 can have any hope of
 this Union He must par
 in terms as mild and
 as little offensive as possible
 rit d out there would
 have been peace in this
 coun don me for clingino
 to the hope with as
 much but now say betöre
 high Heaven and let it
 go and yet the Senator
 says that it is the
 try now tenacity as I
 would to my lifö that
 this Union may upon the
 wires to the four corners
 of the Re principle of
 non intervention that has produced
 be maintained forever I do
 not expect to con public
 that in rny opinion there
 are disunionists these troubles in
 the land He says that
 the vinee that class of
 Union rnen who propose to
 on this side of the
 Chamber and on that disunion
 fault is that of t
 lie advocates of non intervention
 destroy the Union in order
 to preserve it to break
 i ists south and north
 and us mar y north
 as for bril 2 ing
 this disturbance not upon southern
 it up in order to
 maintain it I do not
 expect to south in both
 Halls of Congress and think
 it interventionists 110t upon northern
 intervention convince th osc northern
 Abolitionists who believe is time
 that the Union men of
 both Houses begin ists that
 the Republicans arc not at
 all to blame that the
 Constitution is a leogue with
 hen and I to come
 together and act in concert
 and let the and that
 the southern extremists are not
 at all to get them
 to meet us and save
 the Union f do I
 uncompromising men of both sections
 who pre blame The are
 in favor of inter hope
 that there is patriotism enough
 left in Sen fer the
 dissolution of thc Union to
 the dissolution vcntion with ski
 very I he Senator and
 his friends ators of various
 partics to unite and put
 down of their party who
 prefer the destruction of the
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 669
 Government to the destruction of
 their party or Mr TRUMBULL
 and others be done Mr
 DOUGLAS I do not choose
 to be eat ganization be
 separated from the Union men
 of Mr WIGFALL I hey
 will not be kept here
 echized categonca ly and have
 another gentle the country il
 much longer by me I
 asked the Senator from The
 people will understand these professions
 of love while the dagger
 is being used these pro
 fessi0hs of devotion to the
 Union while there is a
 refusal to meet the question
 to consider it in a
 spirit of conciliation and to
 adjust it upon terms of
 fair comproinise Nei her party
 is exclusively responsible for these
 disasters Neither can evade thö
 responfiibi ity if it does
 not meet this question the
 Union by compromise I ready
 with any man who will
 shovv his devotion to the
 Union by his willingness to
 make the con cessions of
 pride and of party policy
 which are necessarv to save
 it i will extend the
 right hand of fellow ship
 in this emergency to a
 personal en emy I would
 meet hiin m patriotic council
 as a brother even if
 I did not speak to
 him in the open I
 wilk make any concession that
 is just street and fair
 alike just to the North
 and the South to the
 free States and the slave
 States that will put an
 end to all this controversy
 and my confi dence in
 the patriotism of Senators is
 one of the chief sources
 of hope that some adjustment
 will yet be effected here
 If I fail in that
 expectation my confidence in the
 patriotism of the American people
 North and South even in
 New England and in the
 cotton States justifies mc in
 Ille hope that the spirit
 that animated the fathers has
 not yet become extinct in
 11Cir postern y I do
 hope and hope with Stout
 heart I believe that by
 thc expression of that hope
 I do an act of
 justice and certainly pay a
 high conoplhnent to those in
 w horn I repose that
 confide flee I did not
 expect to be called to
 account in these Halls for
 express ing a hope that
 this Government was not to
 be destroyed that this Union
 was not to be severed
 I have seer the time
 when men were expelled from
 the Halls of for introducing
 aboli Itlinois to give us
 the ground on which he
 pre dicated his hope He
 answers me that he predi
 cates it on the demonstrations
 made here every day I
 have not seen them I
 call for specifica tions What
 is it that has been
 proposed What Senator has proposed
 a practical measure which will
 be voted for by a
 single Republican Now give me
 the facts I ask for
 facts not for words want
 bread not stones Mr DOUGLAS
 1 do not ask the
 Senator what occurs in his
 consultations about Fort Sum ter
 or Pensacola and he does
 not ask me of course
 for the details of the
 consultations that we Union men
 are having with a view
 to save the Union Mr
 WIGFALL Ah Mr DOUGLAS If
 he will just wait till
 we bring in our proposition
 from day to day he
 will sce that therc is
 more hope than he now
 supposes Mr WIGFALL 1 am
 satisfied 1 have no objection
 to answerino as to any
 of my corre spondence as
 to Pensacola 01 Fort Sumter
 The Senator feels some hesitancy
 in disclosing There is no
 treason certainly in endeavorif g
 10 save the Union Mr
 DOUGLAS Nor in the other
 Mr WIGFALL There Inay bc
 soloe toryism in some Qi
 those States that have withdrawn
 If their c ltizens dare
 take up arms ao alnst
 their sov there inay be
 tney rnay calk it treason
 there but certainly there can
 be no treason in disclosincr
 a patriotic effort which the
 Senator from Hlinois is making
 I hope that he will
 not go off because L
 may want to ask t
 lit n I tnereiy want
 the Union saved something else
 i now and if the
 Sev ator from Illinois would
 on y II tell the
 country so that we could
 let it go on the
 tion petitions and now I
 have lived to see lheday
 vv ires what it is
 he predicates his hopes upon
 when a Senator is rebuked
 for expressing his own who
 it is Illat is relentii
 r w hut the propositic
 n is silent hope that
 the Union may still last
 that is goin y to
 be rnade who is going
 to vote fot Mt WIGFALL
 Mr President 1 have but
 if he would only do
 that the country would it
 verv few words to say
 in reply to the Senator
 from be greatly relieved but
 bis vague belief that some
 I did not object to
 his man hold tbe floor
 over me in a debate
 When the Senator gets through
 I shall reply to so
 much as I deem it
 necessary to reply to Mr
 WIGFALL It is usually considered
 1 believe a courtesy to
 give way and let a
 Senator explain himself Mr DOUGLAS
 It is when he asks
 it but it was never
 deemed the r courtesy of
 the Senate that you have
 the right to propound questions
 and demand catogorical answers by
 no means Mr WIGFALL Certainly
 not Mr DOUGLAS If you
 are misapprehending my position it
 is my privilege to ask
 you to give way for
 an explanation and when the
 Senator gets through if I
 deem it necessary to reply
 to his argumel t I
 shall do so MrrWiGFALL Then
 I am satisfied entirely perfectiv
 satisfied The Senator from Illinois
 can not find any power
 in the Gonstitution to protect
 property I ask if this
 is a Government If it
 IS what was it instituted
 for For the protection of
 life liberty and property What
 sort of prop crty and
 under what circumstances is this
 Gov ernment bound to protect
 life liberty and prop erty
 W Ilen within the jurisdiction
 of the Fed eral Governmcrn
 in the Yerritories in the
 navy yards or dock yards
 or in the District of
 Colum Lia a upon the
 high seas Nobody doubts that
 if cargo should sail to
 morrow from New York to
 New Orleans from an V
 port in the Uni ted
 States to any other port
 in the United States New
 Orleans is not now in
 the United States or if
 a cargo should sail under
 the flag of the Uni
 ted States from New York
 to Liverpool or any other
 foreign port and it were
 seized upon by any individual
 or Government on the earth
 it would be the duty
 of this Government to protect
 it say then that at
 the South we demand that
 slaves shall be considered as
 property and we ask no
 Inore protection for thern than
 ve do for any other
 species of property TV e
 simply insist that we Shail
 not be tabooed that our
 species of property shall not
 be the OF y onc
 which this Government that we
 have established does not protect
 That thing or other will
 be done after the Micawber
 is tbc posilion that we
 take If the Senator from
 hope nor to kli s
 being hopeful nor to his
 wish style will not do
 I do not know but
 that it was q Illinois
 wants to savc the Union
 by keepinz the ing that
 the Union might be preserved
 I was so General Cass
 that used the illustration about
 the sarsa parilla border States
 in it and inducing the
 cotton States unhapt jy in
 my remarks as to make
 myself cn It was not
 that he hoped I Mr
 DOUGLAS No It was Mr
 Benton or to come back
 let him introduce a resolution
 to tire y misunderstood tl
 lis glorious Union would bc
 preserved but he believed it
 would be and had reasons
 for be lievino it Now
 I say rnnn who believes
 that this Union is goincr
 to be preserved by z
 n y tunendmont beino made
 to tho Constitution Mr DOUGLAS
 Allow me Mr WIGFALL Certainly
 Mr DOUGLAS In each telegraphic
 dispatches to which he refers
 the word was used belief
 but I will say Mr
 Clay I amend the Constitution
 in that particular and let
 Mr WIGFALL to the Mi
 him his Republican friends vote
 for it and M caw
 ber principle which the Senator
 from Illinois it that I
 havc reasons satisfactory to Inyself
 upon which to predicate that
 firm hope that the will
 be preserved Applause in the
 gal Mr NvVIGFALL 1 will
 give way to the Sen
 ator to state and I
 am sure the country will
 be greatly obliøed to hirn
 for statino and the cause
 which he has so much
 at heart wili be greatly
 aided if hc will reason
 upon which this hope and
 belief is founded Mr DOUGLAS
 I will take great pleasure
 in l see indications every
 day Of dis doinæ so
 position to meet this question
 now and consider seems to
 be practicirjg hc hopes L
 hat someth ing will turn
 up at sotne time or
 other which the I really
 not one Union is croinø
 to be saved of those
 who have acted upon that
 it is the merest balderdash
 that is what it is
 it is tbc most unmitieyated
 fadge for any one get
 up hero and tell men
 wha havo sense who havc
 brains that therc is any
 prospect of two thirds of
 this Congress passin any proposition
 as an amendment to the
 Constitution that any twerity one
 years old and man who
 is white south of Mason
 and whose hair is straight
 I say it is Dixon
 s line will be content
 with balderdash an l the
 Sonntor cannot state sin gle
 proposition that will get a
 vote on the ot ller
 rive us any sort of
 assurance that it will be
 rat ified by the people
 and I have no idea
 that any other States will
 leave tbe Union and I
 think there is a st
 roncr proba bility that those
 that are out will back
 but nothing short of this
 isa remedy it does not
 do for the Senator to
 get up here and talk
 about saving the Ut ion
 He charges me and others
 with opposed to any amend
 ments to the Constitution Have
 I voted against any I
 lave I shown any indisposition
 to adopt Have not from
 the time that I came
 i to this Congress until
 the present moment said upon
 every occasion that if propositions
 that i vg erc practical
 were introduced to be carried
 out in good faith I
 would vote för them and
 urge side or that has
 the slightest prospect of being
 their adoption and urge upon
 the people whom I ratified
 by a northern State object
 to this sort represent that
 they should be satisiicd with
 them of fudgc beil R
 indulcrcd in for the purpose
 of mis It was the
 thing that i desired most
 heartily i but whilc I
 wanted mude voted for leading
 the people Now I come
 to the Senator s constitutional
 and proposed to the States
 as amendments to the He
 comp ains of rny not
 reading the Constitution the Senator
 from I has been a
 Inrument blatherskit ing about here
 on one side or the
 other what is necessary to
 save the Union and if
 those t Constitution and he
 wants Ine to read it
 atrain I havc read it
 and talking about the Unidi
 without going for advances in
 that directii n were met
 in a spirit of l
 Sir I do read the
 Constitution I have read the
 decisions upol l it and
 anything practical He proposes to
 day nothing kindness and courtesy
 instead of being repelled I
 often as an amendment to
 the Constitution we shou d
 see more and I believe
 that as apprehend that I
 ur derstand something about it
 the crisis approaches as the
 time of salvation be at
 least the construction that is
 put upon it in the

 all men will become convinced

 did he not two months
 acro intro their duty to

 to their God requires them
 to Inake concessions in order
 to save the country and
 see the evidences of it
 here evpry day If Senator

 that he could possibly have
 proposed to the non intervention
 tabooino our property and saying
 that the Federal Govern ment
 shall simply stay its hand
 leaving this prop eu ty
 to the tender mercies of
 anybody who attemnts t o

 position and what he pccpjoses

 of concil iatmon as a

 which they have declared was
 worse than Sewardism for it

 is just the truth about

 apple of discord is offered
 to us as the fruit
 of peace Now I am
 in the habit of saying
 just what I think and
 just what I choose to
 say and I do not
 choose to have this matter
 discussed in these general terms
 here any longer so far
 as I am con cerned
 and be held up as
 a disunionist and odious to
 the country when i know
 that men herc who have
 produced all thc difficulty have
 offered no means of reconciliation
 These are facts He says
 we do not want a
 settlement and will not join
 the patriotic men in settling
 the diffcultie s I say
 I will I say that
 I will vote for any
 prop osition to day will
 do it to morrow will
 do it until I leave
 the Senate provided it gives
 us what we arc entitled
 to under the Constitution and
 1 ask nothinff more and
 that I will advise the
 peo ple whom represent to
 stay their hands and to
 wait if there is a
 reasonable prospect of that prop
 osition being ratified by a
 suffcient number of States north
 of Mason and Dixon s
 linc to make it a
 part of the Constitution I
 am willing to do that
 You say that my proposition
 is impracti cable that I
 am demanding more than I
 am en titled to I
 answer that it is not
 so the Consti tution of
 the United States recognizes the
 right of man to own
 property in man the Constitution
 kept open the slave trade
 for twenty years pro hibitcd
 either Congress or the Stutcs
 themselves from stopping it during
 the first twenty years The
 first treaty we ever madc
 wit h England declared that
 slaves were property and provided
 for their boing delivered up
 So did the first treaty
 we ever made with an
 Indian nation with the Delasvares
 Even in treating with savage
 nations we stipulated cxprcssly that
 slaves should be dew livered
 up reco rnizing slaves as
 property By our treaties by
 our legislation by our Constitu
 tion slaves are recorrniz ed
 as property but this has
 been denied by the Republican
 party and the Senator from
 Illinois says am unwilling to
 say whether it is property
 or not all I ask
 is non intervention we will
 not protect it we will
 not confiscate it and you
 are mn impracticable dis unionist
 traitor if you do not
 agree to my com promise
 because it is a great
 principle and it was In
 the Nebraska Kansas bill Whatever
 was in the bill is
 a great principle and of
 course sve ou rht to
 bc satisfied with it Now
 sir I got hitn on
 the witness stand and bcgan
 examining him but heis hard
 to keep there you cannot
 hold that Senator to anything

 rcply ask now that the

 this act unicss the same
 be voluntarily consented to by
 said Republic Mr PHELPS Mr
 Chairman 1 am little astonished
 to find an amendment submitted
 by the gentleman from Maine
 forl supposed he was fa
 vorable to the propoéition contained
 in the urnend ment of
 the Senate And I expected
 from hirn to hear arguments
 adduced to this House why
 we should ratify the conditional
 contract which has been made
 by the Secretary of the
 Navy with the Chiriqui ImprovementCompany
 We have heard much of
 tlns contract for the last
 six months During thc last
 session of Congress there were
 per sons here urging upon
 the Congress of the Uniteed
 States the ratification of thc
 conditional contract made by the
 Secretary of the Navy If
 I mistake not that measure
 received the approval of the
 gentleman who is at the
 head of tho Committee on
 Naval Affairs of this House
 It was put on the
 naval appropriation bill by the
 Senate but was defeated in
 this House by the substitution
 of an amendment authorizing the
 President of the Uni ted
 States to send a commission
 to inquire into the Chiriqui
 grant and the advantages likely
 to accrue to the United
 States from the possession of
 whatever right was proposed to
 be conveyed The report of
 that commission has been trans
 it of the Union and
 made the special order mitted
 to this House and has
 been printed It The motion
 was agreed to is stated
 there is a lobby interest
 here to defeat Mr SHERMAN
 1 now move that the
 rules the appropriation have heard
 this charge made be suspended
 and that the House resolve
 itself But although I am

 II Senate THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 31 Mr Chairman it
 becomes necessary for us to
 ports to be a furtner
 grant of lands not exceed
 examine and ascertain first what
 is the nature of the
 c06tract made by the Secretary
 of the Navy with Ambrose
 W Thompson I concede that
 this contract was conditional that
 by its terms it was
 to be submitted to the
 approval of Congress and that
 if not approved it was
 not to be valid The
 attempt was made at the
 last session to obtain that
 approval The Secretary of the
 Navy rec ommended to Congress
 to confirm and ratify that
 contract but Congress did not
 ratify nor confirm the contract
 After the close of the
 last session of Congress a
 supplemental contract was made by
 the Secretary of the Navy
 with Ibis party ex tending
 the time for the ratification
 of the contract to the
 present session of Congress and
 algo pro posing to make
 an additional grant on behalf
 of the Chiriqui company of
 certain rights they alleged to
 have obtained from the Government
 of Costa Rica since the
 first contract was made with
 the I Secretary of the
 Navy I say then it
 becomes necessary to examine into
 the contract which is now
 before us and which ve
 are now asked to ratify
 so that we may ascertain
 whether the ad vantages to
 accrue from the contract to
 the Gov ernment are sufhcicnt
 to warrant us in making
 t le appropriation we are
 asked to make and for
 that purpose I propose to
 recite in the first place
 the reasons set forth in
 the preface of the contract
 It states that Whereas it
 is desirable that the United
 States on the one part
 should havc the right of
 transit over the roadway granted
 direct to said W l
 hompson through said province and
 extending from the Caribbean sea
 to the Pacific ocean and
 the further right to use
 as harbors the waters gulté
 bays or lagoons sheltered or
 partially sur rounded by thc
 lands of the said Ithompson
 or the said illi provement
 contpany and the further right
 to use toc coal contained
 in portions or said lands
 for naval purposes as also
 the right to es ablish
 coal depots and naval stations
 This is the recital Then
 there is the quest ion
 first whether it is desirable
 for the United States to
 have the right of transit
 over this roadway and the
 further right to use the
 harbors waters gulfs bays lagoons
 c in a foreicrt l
 As if individuals can grant
 the right LO use a
 harbor in any manner whatever
 Sir the right to use
 a har bor does not
 vest in the individual property
 hold ers bordering upo l
 that harbor The right 10
 use an arni of the
 sea deper ds not upon
 the consent of the owners
 of the lands adjacent aflöcting
 the commerce and navigation of
 the country and t his
 right was secured to us
 by the treaty with New
 Granada of 1846 I know
 that during the proøress of
 this debate it will be
 urged upon us that the
 isthmus t Pa nama does
 not embrace this roadway through
 the province of Chiriqui You
 will find the attempt madc
 to draw t he distinction
 that there is an Isthmus
 of Chiriqui as well as
 an Isthmus of Pa nama
 Now sir sny that by
 the action of our Govern
 nusrft and by the action
 of the New Gr a
 nadian Governrnent under the 1st
 Innus of deliniuon of the
 I hat defines it to
 extend to established thc southern
 border of the State of
 C osta Rica of way
 anc_l the grant I say
 further that the to construct
 a railroad across the Isthmus
 of Pa nama has been
 riven exclusively by the New
 Granadian Government to the Panama
 Raiiroad Company and that Govern
 lnent has t hus stri
 ppcd itself of t hc
 power to tyrant the right
 of way to any other
 party to construet a railroad
 across the Isth mus of
 Panama whether on the part
 of tho cen tral Government
 or any provincial Government Now
 Mr Chairrnt tn the contract
 with the Chiriqui company contains
 this stipulation that The United
 States shali have and enjoy
 a right of way or
 transit over said road which
 is hereby granted to them
 by the party the second
 part free fro n all
 toll or tn upon officers
 awents spa nen land srnen
 tnails rnunition stores troops or
 any direct property of the
 United States wlhie thc Governlnent
 there or Inay transport or
 ca use to be transported
 over thO said road during
 the continuance ing five thousand
 acres on each side of
 the prov ince or Isthmus
 of Chiriqui as may be
 necessary for said United States
 for coal depots and naval
 stations at the lagoon of
 Chiriqui and the harbor of
 Golfito the same to be
 located at such points as
 will secure good and sufficient
 depots and sta tions to
 the United States without impairing
 the general value of any
 site for city or Cities
 which may bc laid off
 by Thompson or the Chiriqui
 company on any of said
 lands The said lands to
 be selected and designated either
 on the main land or
 islands or both as the
 United States may determine and
 within twelvemonths from the date
 of the contract and there
 is also an obligation to
 convey a good and sufficient
 title to the Govern ment
 of the United States for
 the lands so granted The
 contract goes on to give
 the United States the right
 to use as harbors the
 waters of the lagoons bays
 or gulfs sheltered or partially
 sur rounded by the lands
 of the said Thompson or
 the said Chiriqui Improvcmcnt Company
 on thc Atlantic and Pacific
 sides of the Isthmus and
 in the bays and gulfs
 wherever the lands of the
 said Thompson or said compa
 ny may extend The fourth
 grant gives the United States
 the right to all coal
 for naval purposes at or
 near the points selected for
 coal depots and naval stations
 as aforesaid but if coal
 shall be found of superior
 quality for steam purposes in
 other places than those so
 selected then the United Slates
 shall have the right to
 use the same subject only
 to the tax of one
 dime per ton as provided
 to bc paid to the
 provincial authorities of Chiriqui in
 the grant afo resaid and
 the cost of miningand delivering
 the same The fifth provision
 of the contract is thc
 stipu lation to pay 300
 000 by the Government of
 the United States in consideration
 of these grants The supplemental
 article of the contract which
 has beeri added since the
 close of the last session
 ot Congress grants to the
 Government of the United Slates
 any rights which the Chiriqui
 Im provoment Company rnny have

 Having now recited the grants
 which have been made to
 different individuals I will for
 the sake of argument admit
 that they are all consolidated
 into the Chiriqui Improvement Company
 by virtue of the different
 conveyances made to it Whether
 they have been or not
 IS a matter really immaterial
 to the object I have
 in view My ob ject
 is to show that it
 would be wrong for the
 Government of the United States
 to ratify thig contract because
 the Governxnent will in fact
 obtain nothing in consideration of
 the which it is proposed
 to pay to this Chiriqui
 Im provement Company We are
 all aware of the 1
 may add the necessity of
 our importancc securing the right
 of transit across the various
 isthmus routes between the Atlantic
 and Pacific oceans I am
 willino to concede the vast
 import ance and the necessity
 of securing the control of
 one of tllesc isthmuses in
 order to shorten the distances
 between our Atlantic and Pacific
 pos sessions and I have
 ever been willino to achieve
 that result Whenever individuals have
 obtained o rants opening a
 transit route eUher by the
 Isthmus of Tehuantepec 01 the
 isthmus of Nic aragua or
 by any other isthmus so
 far as could consistently with
 my obligations and my duties
 to the Government I have
 been willing to protect the
 rights which they may have
 obtained from the Governrnents which
 have jurisdiction over these routes
 When the contract was made
 by the Secretary of tho
 Navy with the Chiriqui Improvement
 Com pan y that company
 had no grant for the

 E quote the above your
 better guidance and for what

 necessary PASTOR OSPINA Your obedient
 servant And in further proof
 of the correctness of the
 opinion 1 have expressed I
 read the following from the
 letter addressed by the Attorney
 General of the United States
 to the Secretary of the
 Navy It must also be
 remembered that this grant of
 a road way does not
 include any right to make
 a railroad Mr HARRIS of
 Maryland 1 wish to ask
 my friend from Missouri whether
 something is not said in
 the letf er from which
 he is reading about the
 right of Improving the road
 referred to for the use
 of wheelcd vehicles Mr PHELPS
 I have read the very
 words of the Attorney General
 of the United States Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland 1 would
 like to ask the gentleman
 at this point what he
 under stands to be included
 in the phrase010ffY wheeled vehicles
 in the grant Does it
 not cover railroads Mr PHELPS
 It does not cover railroads
 Such is my opinion and
 in that opinion I am
 fortified by the opinion as
 I have already said by
 the decision of the New
 Granadian Govern ment and the
 opinion of our late Attorney
 Gen era Judge Black The
 Government of New Granada has
 granted the exclusive right of
 way for a railroad across
 the Isthmus of Panama for
 the period of ninety nine
 years to another com pany
 This grant is made by
 the Republic of New Granada
 and not by a State
 or province of that Republic
 Mr SICKLES It is upon
 this point that 1 desire
 to call the attention of
 the gentleman froin Missouri to
 the authority which he himself
 cites I understand the gentleman
 to make the point that
 no railway grant was acquired
 from Chiriqui For that he
 cites the authority of the
 Attorney General on paøe 35
 of the report of the
 Committee on Naval Affan s
 That opinion is dated May
 11 1859 Mr PHELPS I
 have yielded merely to an
 in quiry by the gentleman
 but not for an argument
 Mr SICKLES 1 would have
 concluded by this time if
 the gentleman had not interrupted
 me I was about to
 state that the Att orney
 General in this same communication
 distinctly affirmed the existence ofa
 roadway grant instead of deny
 ing it He said that
 in March previous he was
 of opinion that there was
 none but that subsc qucntly
 he had revised his opinion
 upon addi tlonal evidence He
 now says Upon a reöxamination
 of this title in the
 light of new evidence which
 accompanies your letter I think
 that the first six objections
 i ormerly existing Ilia now
 be con sidered as disposed
 of The sixth objection of
 the Attorney General stated in
 his previous fetter ot March
 14 and re SATURDAY FEBRUARY
 2 1861 ernment of the
 Republic Then the Chiriqui Im
 provemcnt Company do not grant
 nor can they I grant
 though it is embraced in
 their contract the right to
 transport troops and implements of
 war across that road They
 have not the power to
 make any such contract What
 else If this contract should
 be con firmed the Government
 of the Ur iied States
 would perhaps contend that it
 had secured some such right
 in this grant Would not
 every one of you who
 may vote for this appropriation
 and confirmation of this contract
 contend that this Government have
 the right to use that
 road for the transportation of
 troops I desire to read
 the eighteenth article of the
 ordinance of the province of
 Chiriqui making a grant of
 certain privileges to Thompson It
 says ART 18 A W
 Thompson is fully authorized to
 trans fer the interests properties
 and privileges c which by
 this grant he receives to
 any pergon or persons company
 or companies with the sole
 condition that the road shall
 be improved but in no
 case can be transiOr it
 to any tor eign Government
 By a preceding article it
 is declared any infrac tion
 of the condition of the
 grant produces a rev ocation
 of the privileges granted to
 r Phompson In no case
 can he transför any right
 to any for eign Government
 Therefore I say that so
 much of this article as
 stipulates for the transportation of
 troops and munitions of war
 across that Isth mus from
 the Chiriqui lagoon to the
 Pacific ocean over the roadway
 which the Chiriqui Improve ment
 Company claim is v rithout
 any value to this Government
 The transfer of such a
 right to our Government works
 a forfeiture of the whole
 grant And is this a
 desirable grant for the Gov
 ernment to possess a grant
 which the moment we take
 it into our possession the
 moment we contract to obtain
 it crumbles into pieces and
 is good for nothing Furthermore
 there is a supplemental contract
 added by the Secretary of
 the Navy since the ad
 journment of the last session
 of Congress which It is
 as has not been published
 I will read it i
 follows It having been agreed
 during the last session of
 Con NEW SERIES NO 43
 tion of the enterprise shall
 forthwith work as coniplé i
 nullity and iOrfe1ture of the
 present contract in till and
 every one of its parts
 and the confiscation not only
 of such and munitions of
 war but also of the
 railroad and all its works
 and fixtures Again the eighteenth
 article provides that The grantees
 at no time shall be
 at liberty under pen alty
 of forfeiting ail the privileges
 of this contract to trans
 fer or to cede to
 any for eigu Government the
 grant of cou cessions and
 privileges made to them by
 virtue of the pres ent
 contract I have now shown
 you so far as the
 right of transit is concerned
 and so far as the
 power of those grantees to
 convey to the United States
 the right to transport troops
 and munitions of war either
 across their railway or their
 wagon road is concerned that
 such an act works a
 forfeiture of the grant made
 to them by the Government
 of Costa Rica and the
 province of Chiriqui Tl he
 next subject matter Of the
 contract is five thousand acres
 of land on each side
 of the prov ince of
 Chiriqui for coal depots and
 naval stations to be selected
 by this Governmcnt within twelve
 months after the date of
 the contract and with the
 obligation upon the part of
 tho grantor to vestin the
 Government of the United States
 a good and suff cient
 title I ask you whether
 the law of the Gov
 ernment of New Granada authorizes
 any forewu Power to obtain
 a title to any real
 estate within their territory Certainly
 not The right has been
 given by treaty of 1846
 to citizens of the United
 States to acquire a title
 to real estate in that
 coun try but no such
 right has been given to
 the Gov ernment of the
 United States And I lay
 it down as a general
 principle of intemational law that
 no country whatever can acquire
 title to real estate in
 any foreign nation except by
 the consent of that Government
 expressly given This doctrine does
 not admit of aigument But
 it is said we have
 the right to dig coal
 on the lands of the
 Chiriqui Improvement Company by paying
 a tax of one dilne
 per ton to the Gov
 18 this privilege worth ornment
 of Chiriqui 300 000 Is
 this great Government to be
 cn gaged in the business
 of mining If this coal
 be of good quality and
 is found in abundance in
 the province of Chiriqui if
 it be such coal as
 it is gress that thc
 tillie iiihited by this contract
 within which represented to be
 by those who have cxaminedit
 Congress should approve it and
 Inake the necessary appro priations
 therei0r should be extended to
 the end of the next
 II let the owners of
 the grant work the mines
 session it is now in
 fulfillment thereof agreed and indorsed
 themselves and whatever coal maybe
 needed by ferred to now
 is the one relied upon
 to show that on both
 parts of the originat contract
 that such e xtension shall
 take place and the time
 is hereby extended accord ingly
 And it is further agreed
 that the United States shall
 have the fuli benefit for
 the purposes of this contract
 of I any gt ant
 or contract which the said
 Ambrose W ithomp son or
 the said Chiriqui Improvement Company
 has 0b tained or shall
 obt ain from the Government
 of Costa Rica for a
 railroad between the Gulf of
 Golfito Dolce and the Chiriqui
 Lazoon or any part o
 the way between those places
 or between any 01her points

 AMBROSE W THOMPSON For himself
 and the Chiriqui Improvement Company
 ISAAC TOUCEY Secretary of the
 Navy no grant for a
 roadway across the Isthmus had
 In presence of CHARh asyW
 VVELC I been granted Therefore
 I say that this lotter
 of the Government for its
 vessels will be readily bought
 from them at the place
 where they find it In
 addition to this the commercial
 steam marine of the IJnited
 States employed in navigating the
 Gulf of Mexico or the
 Caribbean Sea would re sort
 to that point for facl
 if the coal was found
 to be of good quality
 and suited to the purpose
 of steamships Iam unwilling Mr
 Chairman that the Govei nment
 of the United States should
 en gage in the mining
 business in a foreign cöuntry
 I am unwilling that it
 ßhould own real estate in
 a province of the Government
 of New Granada We desire
 peacc and quiet with all
 nations and august 4 1860
 Mr PHELPS The gentleman has
 not read This grant for
 a railroad is entirely the
 particularly with the Spanish American
 States his document well The
 sixth objection of the jurisdiction
 of Costa Rica Its southern
 terminus mails and by travelers
 going to and from our
 is west of the line
 dividing the Governments of possessions
 on the Pacific lies within
 the juris Attorney General was
 stated as follows New Granada
 and Costa Rica Its northern
 ter li diction of the
 Government of New Granada and
 No copy of the constitution
 was produced nor any other
 authority shown to the provincial
 fegisiature of minus shall be
 on that dividing line This
 road is thus far with
 one exception everything has been
 Eiqui either to authorize a

 which will not have its

 peaceful and quiet I desire
 therefore that noth rights to
 concede the land or grant
 the privilege of a road
 in order to render this
 grant of Costa Rica I
 shall be done by the
 Government which could way across
 the Isthmus in the least
 disturb the friendly relations that
 And he concludes his answer
 by saying valid the parties
 were required to deposit the
 sum It must also be
 remembered that this grant of
 a road of 100 000
 with that Government within six
 does not include any right
 to make a railroad months
 after the date of the
 contract That con I was
 considering the rights which the
 Chiriqui tract is dated the
 24th of July 1860 and
 there is Improvement Cornpany have
 under the grant of I
 have shown that it il
 no evidence here that that
 has been yet the province
 of Chiriqui If it has
 not been then that neglect
 is only for the improvement
 of an old road for
 deposited works a forfeiture of
 that grant the improvement of
 an old highway and we
 also But there is another
 forfeiture The terms of have

 two Governments No meant has
 been made by the Government
 of New dranada to the
 Government of the United States
 by which we can hold
 any rights whatever within the
 province of Chiriqui or in
 any other portion of New
 Granada I am unwilling I
 re peat that the Government
 of the United w States
 should engage in the business
 of mining With just as
 much propriety might some person
 sell to the Secretary of
 the Navy a valuable farm
 adapted for the culture of
 wheat for the purpose of
 rais ing the wheat out
 of which shall be made
 the bread for the support
 of the seamen and marincs
 The Government of the United
 States did many years ago
 hold an interest in mining
 lands in the western country
 They did carry on a
 part 674 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 31 nership in the
 business of mining and found
 it very unprofitable Suppose the
 Government paid 300 000 for
 this grant for this privilege
 of dio ging coal and
 paying a dime tax to
 the Chiriqui Government consider what
 expenses must be in curred
 must erect buildings for our
 super intendent and employés we
 must build piers and wharves
 we must put up shelters
 for the protec tion of
 the coal These men must
 be employed at the expense
 of the Government of the
 United States the entire year
 while their labor will bc
 required only for a portion
 of the year L gay
 then that if these mines
 are valü ble the grantees
 themselves may go and work
 them and have the coal
 ready for vessels of the
 Navy of the United States
 and the Government will be
 ready I am for economy
 to buy it I do
 not believe in the propriety
 of this expend iture of
 money or in this attempt
 to establish a colony or
 dependency of the Governmen t
 of the Unitcd States in
 the province of Chiriqui it
 is it nproper for the
 Government to pursue that coarse
 it is II at f
 am opposed to the ratification
 of this contract and have
 been op posed to it
 from t l ie time
 I understood its nature If
 these men have a Trant
 for a and its terms
 roadway let then improve it
 Tl hey have a grant
 for a roadway under the
 New Granadian Gov et nmcnt
 but not for a railroad
 They have a grant for
 a railroad from the Costa
 Rica Govefn rnent but by
 the very terms of the
 contract the fact of transferring
 the right to the Government
 of the United States works
 a forfeiture of the grant
 In attempting to transfer their
 privilegcs to this Government they
 violate the terms of the
 contract and work a forfeiture
 of it The Gov et
 ntnent wil therefore obtain no
 rights under it and the
 money which it may pay
 fbr the privi leges will
 be thrown away I have
 submitted these views Mr Chairman
 being my reasons in part
 for opposing this I might
 offer mnendment of the Senate
 remarks on the subject but
 it sperns to rue that
 if the positions which I
 have taken and which are
 fortified by the testimony I
 have cited arc correct then
 this Goverl lment if it
 should pay for the grunt
 will have really purchased nothing
 Mr CORWIN The gentleman from

 SICKLES Mr Chairman I desire
 t o follow the gentleman

 possible to do so unless

 in part in restoring order
 in the Hall Mr SICKLES
 proceeded Mr Chaimnan I hope
 I sl kall not be

 for although i do not
 presume to com nmud the
 attention of all gentlemen it
 is only reasonable to ask
 for that deco urn which
 will en able those who
 tu e intereste the discussion
 to hear my aro umcnt
 cntleman from Mis E I
 propose to follow th souri
 somewhat closely in the line
 of argument that he pursued
 and to present some considera

 I think wili furnish an
 answer to his objections The
 gentleman from I Missouri set
 out with an expression of
 surprise at the amendment offered
 by the chairman of the
 Committee on Naval Affairs For
 myself I can see no
 reason for that surprise unless
 it be in the fact
 that that amendment disposed of
 nearly all the arguments so
 elaborately presented by the gentleman
 from Missouri against this appropri

 important in looking at a

 the advantages which are to

 No our Pacific possessions We
 know it has been a
 l with the sanction and
 aid of their Governments to
 obtain from the States of
 Central America the control of
 commerce and travel across the
 Isthmus which separates the Atlantic
 and Pacific ocean So far
 they have failed and the
 failure is attributable to the
 vigilance and address with which
 the Government of the United
 States th rough the administrations
 of Mr Fillmore Mr Pierce
 and Mr Buchanan and most
 especial lv the latter have
 uarded thie conspicuous and ilia
 estimable nationar interest The only
 route now open for t
 rade and travel across the
 f sthmus is the Panama
 railroad and the great questions
 now presented to this House
 are whether that powerful corporation
 shall have the entire monopoly
 of the railroad transit across
 the Isthmus and whether by
 the relinquishmentof the qpportunity now
 in our grasp of acquiring
 an auxiliary route we will
 enable England or France to
 supersede us and gain that
 which all or both the
 intrigues and resources o their
 diplomacy f employed for so
 many years have failed to

 papers wl iich have been
 laid on our tables if
 reliable provc incoi trovertibly that
 the privileges granted by New

 they are the best in
 that quarter of the world
 T be railroad privilege if
 it exists is of primary
 im portance to our commerce
 I shall not detain the
 House by reading pas sages
 which I might do without
 number from the message of
 the President of the United
 States communicated at this session
 givin us the high est
 official evidence which it is
 possible to have before us
 that the representations upon which
 this conditi01ial contract w as
 made have been nnorc than
 justified by the offcial survey
 we di rectod to bc
 made at the close of
 the last session Ilhe commander
 of the expedition Captain Engle
 T reports in general terms
 that all of the objects
 of the expedition xvvcre fulfilled
 that they found the harbors
 to spacious convenient and safe
 that they found the coal
 deposits accessible and inexhaustible and
 that thcy found a practicable
 route for a railroad And
 this report is fortified in
 detail by the offcers in
 charge of the particular I
 he topographical brat ches of
 the expedition survey and the
 geological survey especially fur nish
 abundant evidence confirming all tl
 le repre sen tations which
 the Government relied upon Now
 to pass to another point
 let us glance at the
 history of this measure because
 really it would seem to
 a stranger listening to our
 debates from the address of
 the gentleman from Missouri that
 this was a new proposition
 presented to the House of
 Representatives that it svas a
 new pro ject just about
 to be initiated without exaniina
 tion as to title and
 without investigation as to the
 value of the privileges to
 be acquired And yet I
 will show that no legislative
 measure to which the sanction
 of his committee could be
 asked has ever received more
 thorough investigation or has stood
 severer tests of examination than
 this measure against which the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 have now made their report
 Durino the past veat it
 received the careful considera tion
 of the Conmoittc e on
 Naval Affairs who In the
 last session you reported in
 its favor had in the
 coördinate branch of Congress a
 large majority in favor of
 the measure arid you bad
 in this House a vote
 which if it n eant
 anything meant this that this
 I louse aft et considering
 the subject with all the
 information that could then be
 obtained had determined that the
 contract ought to be confirmed
 provided that the result of
 the cxamination upon the spot
 conducted by per sons in
 the service of the Government
 should confirm the representations made
 by the parties Sir I
 ask if that examination has
 not estab lished the truth
 of all those representations Who
 will assert that the report
 of t hc commission is
 not clear full and conclusive
 I am entitled to assume
 that this House has by
 a decided vote 866j to
 supply deficiencies in the appropriations
 prominent feature in the policy
 of England and given its
 sanction to the appropriation upon
 the for the fiscal year
 ending June 30 1861 and
 had France to supplant us
 in the competition for these

 of the exoedi tion advantages

 that the saving chairman of

 leaveåt already pledged but sir
 I do not propose to
 stop repairing and refitting our
 ships of war one on
 to each gentleman s sense
 of propriety Ail wilt admit
 that it becomes the dignity
 of our delibera the Atlantic
 and the other on the
 Pacific side here I shall
 proceed to show that no
 valid ob jection to the
 measure has been advanced by
 the Undoubtedly the Government did
 anticipate t tions that there
 should be order and decorum
 in Committee of Ways and
 Means and I am con
 Ij another and contingent advantage
 to be secured II the
 body to the people of
 this country and especially to
 its Mr SICKLES I will
 proceed with my re fident
 with all deference to the
 ability of gentle men upon
 the other side that no
 good reason can commerce by
 means of this arrano ement
 The marks Iwas directing my
 attentiori to the point Government
 contemplated no doubt that under
 be assigned against the appropriation
 I should not omit to
 allude with reference to the
 legislative indorsement of this measure
 to what has already transpired
 in another place The chairman
 of the Committ ee on
 Finance Mr HUNTER with the
 approval of the committee moved
 the adoption of the amendment
 which embraces this proposition It
 was adopted by an overwhelmino
 vote and among the names
 recorded in the affirmative gentlemen
 will find some of the
 most acute critics of our
 legislative proceedings men before whom
 you cannot pass a bad
 title and whose sanction is
 never obtained to an appropriation
 thatis cxtravagan t unguarded or
 unnecessary The measure comes down
 to this House therefore commended
 not only bv the coördinate
 branch of Congress but by
 the action of this House
 itself on a former occasion
 In opposit ion to this
 array of legislative author ity
 in opposition to this accumulation
 of proof of the value
 of the large privileges to
 be secured to the Government
 we have only and sokely
 the disapproval of the Committee
 of Ways and Means I
 accord sir to their recommer
 dations uniformly the highest respect
 all the defcrcncc which the
 opinions of the leading committee
 of the House deserve Yet
 I venture to say that
 in this in stance their
 dissent without any reasons ren
 dered is deprived of its
 usual importance by the weight
 of authority which is so
 overwhelmincy against the conclusion to
 which they have arrived Mr
 Chairman it will faciiitate the
 elucidation of the merits of
 this question it we look
 svith some method and precision
 at the provisions of these
 several grants as they are
 presented to us upon the
 record First there is a
 o rant from Chiriqui and
 New Granada it may be
 found set out upon page
 62 of the documents accompany
 ing the message of the
 President of the United States
 on this subject it is
 authenticated by the New Granadian
 legation in this country Ac
 cording to General Herron the
 minister accred ited to us
 from New Granada the grant
 to Mr the grant of
 New Granada a railroad could
 and vould be constructed and
 thus we would aid incidentally
 in providing an additional transit
 route The importance of securinø
 an additional transit route I
 hope will be fully shown
 before this discussion is closed
 by some gentleman who is
 cornpetent to give tl le
 House the facts with ref
 erence to the enormous charges
 made by the Pan ama
 Railroad Company assert without risk
 of contradiction that the charges
 freights and passenøers made by
 the Panama Railroad Com pan
 y which now monopolizes the
 trade and travel across the
 Ist htnus exceed the charges
 for simi lar services imposed
 by any corporation in the
 world The power and position
 of this gigantic corpor ation
 give it absolute control of
 the trade and travel which
 passes across the Isthmus It
 charges nine dollars freight for
 every ton of coal which
 this Government sends to Panarna
 for its squadron in the
 Pacific Nine dollars a ton
 for the transport r i
 wenty ation of a ton
 of coal forty seven miles
 I five dollars for c
 very passenger that rides forty
 seven miles on that road
 a charge that has no
 parallel upon any other railroad
 in the world made by
 the gentleman from Missouri Mr
 PHELPS that the original grants
 from New Gra nada an
 Chiriqui did not include the
 privilege of a railway across
 the Isthmus It would be
 un I necessary for me
 to go into this branch
 of the i argument at
 all except for an objection
 unjustly I urged against the
 subsequent railway grant from Costa
 Rica obtained in July last
 l The contract with Costa
 Rica it is admitted provides
 for a railway but the
 point has been suggested that
 because the Bum of 100
 000 was to IJC paid
 to Costa Rica before its
 concession becomes absolute thcrcforc it
 is not safe to rely
 upon this Before I conclude
 I will prove that under
 both grants a railway transit
 is given to prove that
 railway privilege is Now sir
 by the original grant from
 New Granada I refer to
 the very authority which was
 read by the geritlernan frmn

 1859 he says ATTORNEY GENERAL

 they had not shown a

 676 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 31 by all the means
 in its powcr Can it
 be possible then exclude this
 province from the right which
 all others have ama raitroad
 precents it forthe exception in
 article seven is explicit aud
 applies directly to the preservation
 and im it being provmnent
 of the road Fl hat
 article reads thus nevertheless well
 understood that the privilege of
 N hich vent the con
 pletton preservation and impro Dement
 of roads which already exist
 or which are aetually being
 con structed on the said
 Isthmus And if such exception
 had not been made the
 executive power coufd not legally
 have approved o that contract
 The attorney general Sefior Gallego
 goes on to observe pages
 8 and 9 It is
 well known that persons interested
 in the Panama railroad have
 circulated tho idea that our
 roads may be improved but
 without changing their nature which
 is in ident from the
 envoy of New Granada in
 this city in which Mr
 Herran ignores the exclusive pretensions
 of the Panama company We
 are not to legislate in
 this House in affrmance of
 a perpetual monopoly in the
 Panama Company we may leave
 that corporation to settle its
 own questions with the Government
 from which it derived its
 grant Of course it will
 be the duty of our
 Government to see that no
 illegal encroach ment upon its
 property is permitted by New
 Granada But of this there
 can be no well founded
 apprehension The argument of the
 gentleman from Missouri amounts to
 this that inasmuch as the
 Panama Company asserts an exclusive
 right of railway transit over
 the Isthmus of Panama therefore
 good Spanish equivalent to saying
 that we must leave ncither
 New Granada nor Costa Rica
 can grant them with but
 a slight difference just as
 they existed bc and no
 citizen of the United States
 can acquire fore These are
 gratuitous and self prejudiccd interpreta
 Mons Article seven to which
 they does not unpose the
 privileges conceded to I hompson
 Morell thereto shall pass over
 the road without pennission of
 the General Government of the
 Republic Mr SICKLES Precisely sir
 That is the very point
 I am upon 1 was
 about to say Ihat it
 would be necessary at all
 times for the Gov ernment
 of the United States whenever
 it pro poses to carry
 troops or munitions of war
 through the territory of another
 Power to ask permission to
 do so In the absence
 of treaty stipulations I the
 comity of nations would not
 give us this right and
 this Goverrnnent would not attempt
 to exer cise it except
 in deference to the pleasure
 of Costa Rica Concede then
 that the Costa Rica grant
 pro hibits the transportation of
 munitions of war and troops
 and that New Granada makes
 her previous assent a condition
 it nevertheless reinains un doubtedly
 true that neither of those
 Governments while at peace with
 the United States and while
 its ainplitude and thoreföre this
 province may even if the
 Panamay ant extends this far
 improve its road of Bocas
 del l oro oven to
 the extent of M n
 KING A RAILROAD If it
 is not then let it
 be proved that to Unprovc
 onc thing is not to
 make it better than it
 svas in its wide ranae
 o Ineaning as it has
 been used is to carry
 one thing to its Iliahest
 dc ree of perlbetion So
 that if a road Inore
 pcrfcc_t than a railroad should
 be invented for a vvay
 of com municat ion then
 such invention could undoubtedly be
 adopted by this province for
 its road I affrm therefore
 Mr Chairman upon the authority
 of the highest law oflicer
 of Chiriqui who is certainly
 competent to explain the mean
 ing of terms used in
 the decrees of Iiis own
 prov ince and expressed in
 his own languac e that
 a full and perfect privilege
 to construct a railroad was
 covered by the original grant
 to the parties with whom
 we arc dealing Attorney General
 Rlack thought the word rond
 way did not include a
 railway privilege and he so
 states in his letter But
 his attention Iliad not been
 called to the cotemporaneous and
 local cx position of that
 word which I have read
 and which would have been
 conclusive to his us it
 must be to any fair
 judg ln nt Mr PHELPS
 Wilt the gentleman permit mc
 to read one section here
 I To this extreme proposition
 I will only say that
 if having friendly treaty relations
 Wilh us would ever refuse
 us permission to transport troops
 and New Granada Costa Rica
 and the United States concur
 in a limitat ion upon
 the power of tl C
 Pan ama Railroad Company it
 will be effectual the next
 instance the gentleman from Mis
 souri objects that we are
 to acquire the use of
 har bors in a forei
 rn nation Perhaps I ought
 to dividc the gentleman s
 argument into two divisions He
 enumerated some ten objections to
 this appropriat_ion Five or six
 of them prove if they
 prove anything that we get
 too much for our money
 and the rest of the
 objections prove if they prove
 anytl ling that we get
 nothing for our money At
 one moment he argues that
 we ought not to take
 this grant because it gives
 us munitions of war from
 our possessions on the Atlantic
 to our possessions the Pacific
 If we were at war
 with any of thc States
 of Central America if we
 were at war with any
 of their allies they would
 withhold permission but under no
 other circumstances would this act
 of comity be refused I
 desire now to bring more
 conspicuously to the attention of
 the House the broad and
 ample rail road grant made
 by the supplemental convention negotiated
 by Thomas Francis Meagher with
 Costa Rica It is full
 and complete in ail its
 parts and attests the ability
 and address of the accom
 resources and privileges and rights
 which we ought plishcd gentleman
 who represented the grantees not
 to enjoy in a foreign
 country And then not I
 hompson and his associates Bv
 the further con tract madein
 August 1860 Mr l hompson
 and his perceiving his inconsistency
 he denounces the appropriation because
 we arc to get nothing
 for associates enabled the United
 States to participate in all
 the benefits of his recent
 convention with the 300 000
 I might say t hat
 one half of his objections
 answer other half We might
 Costa Rica in addition to
 the privileges previously secured by
 the United States and which
 the strike an average and
 say the result is that
 we 300 000 now to
 be appropriated was the stipulated
 made a very good bargain
 I submit to thc committee
 that we do not by
 compensation So sir för this
 appropriation we get the benefit
 the arrangrement we propose to
 make with these parties acquire
 territorial jurisdiction over the of
 all these privileges It has
 bcen sugo ested that Mr
 SICKLER Certainly if it is
 I harbors or over the
 lands we would not the

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 31
 Early in the history of
 this territorial system the question
 of slavery became one of
 some inter est Yielding however
 to the natural laws des
 tined to a great extent
 to govern the question of
 slavery in this country at
 all times that is the
 laws of climate of soil
 and of production almost by
 common consent this institution was
 first dis couraged and its
 extension into the northwest ern
 Territories prohibited but it was
 encouraged and protected in its
 extension into the Territories on
 the southwest Thus in a
 friendly and fra ternal spirit
 means were provided by which
 both systems of labår in
 use under our Government had
 a natural outlet At that
 time therefore nothing more seemed
 to be demanded on either
 side i hus the policy
 ofdividing the common Ter ritories
 of the United States between
 the two BYS teme of
 labor seemed though informally to
 be tacitly acknowledged When Missouri
 applied for admission lying as
 Bhe does on both sides
 of what was regarded as
 the natural boundary between the
 free and the slave States
 though in my judgment clearly
 entitled to unconditional admission as
 a slave State by e
 terms of the Louisiana purchase
 a determined and even furious
 opposition was made to her
 admission because of her toleration
 of slavery Then for the
 first time was the question
 of sla very in the
 Territories presented in that angry
 and excited form which has
 since given us so much
 trouble and anxiety After much
 angry feeling and discussion on
 both sides as a preliminary
 measure it was enacted by
 Congress that north of a
 certain line since V known
 as the Missouri compromise line
 slavery or involuntary servitude shot
 dd thereafter be pro hibited
 With this much of the
 opposition to the application of
 Missouri v as withdrawn and
 provisions were made by which
 she was admitted as one
 of the States of this
 Confederacy These measures were acquiesced
 in and thus again was
 the slavery question disposed of
 by acting upon the idea
 of a division of territory
 bctween those who desired to
 tolerate and those who desired
 to prohibit slavery As one
 result of the Mexican war
 we acquired very large new
 district of country As prelim
 inary to this acquisition it
 was proposed in Con gress
 to forever exclude slavery from
 all territory to be thus
 acquired If I read the
 history of the country correctly
 this is the first time
 a proposi tion was ever
 seriously urged to exclude slave
 holders from all the I
 erritories of the United States
 Those who now contend that
 such a DOI icy is
 in accordance with the practices
 of the fahers of the
 Republic certainly do not read
 his tory impartially That many
 of then I entcrtained anti
 slavevy views I readily grant
 but they never vcnt so
 fur as to attempt either
 by constitutional provision or enactment
 to exclude slavery from all
 common Territories As before remarked
 theirs was rather a policy
 of division and not of
 total prohibitiqp or cxclusion The
 proposition thus tb exclude slavery
 from the proposed newly acquired
 territory failed After its acquisition
 a proposition was brought I
 forward to extend the Missouri
 line through this I territory
 to the Pacific ocean That
 also failed In 1850 as
 a part of the compromise
 measures of that year and
 us one of the necessities
 of the times a new
 policy in relation to slavery
 in the Territories was inaugurated
 It was prov ided that
 the people interested should determine
 whether Bearing upon this question
 of popular sover eignty as
 it is termed m opposition
 to the theory of congresSional
 sovereignty and of congressional intervention
 the decision of the Supreme
 Court of the United States
 in the Dred Scott case
 has played an important part
 Whatever differences of opinion may
 prevail either among my polik
 ical friends or my political
 opponents in relation to this
 decision it is frankness to
 say that I vas not
 taken by surprise by it
 and that from the first
 I very cheerfully acquiesced in
 it In the first place
 felt it my duty as
 a good citi zen to
 yield obedience to the tribunal
 which pro nounced this decision
 In the next place the
 reasons assigned by a majority
 of the judges who concurred
 in it were to me
 satisfactory as to the conclusions
 to which the court arrived
 I have not time to
 review that decision now but
 I will remark in passing
 that if it be conceded
 that the right of the
 master in the services of
 his slave be under any
 State law a vested property
 right then none but a
 sovereign power can divest this
 follows therefore that to enable
 any right legislative body to
 do this the power must
 be conferred by some grant
 of the Constitution under which
 it is held It no
 such grant has been given
 then the power does not
 exist in the Legislature This
 principle has been recognized thöugh
 in a different sort of
 case by the supreme court
 of my I refer to
 the case of Beebe cs
 the own State State 6
 Indiana Reports p 501 How
 far the Territorial Legislature may
 under its police and regulating
 powers or discourtwe any particular
 class of property without an
 unwar ranted infringement of vested
 rights I wilt not now
 stop to inquire This I
 regard as still an unsettled
 question Practically sir I do
 not regard the points in
 volved in this decision of
 as much importance to any
 scction as many seem to
 have done After all that
 may be said and done
 majority of the people in
 cach distinct and sovereign political
 com munity ultimately settle for
 themselves the kind of domestic
 institutions under which they will
 live But as a constitutional
 question and as an it
 progresses The great question of
 the time is can anything
 be done to arrest the
 revolution now upon us I
 believe sir that even yet
 it is in the power
 of the present Congress to
 initiate such measures as will
 arrest the movement in all
 the States yet in the
 Union and such as will
 sooner or later induce the
 return of those which have
 seceded To do this I
 regard it as para mount
 however that the public peace
 Shail be preserved Everything consistent
 with honor and patriotism should
 be done to prevent the
 shedding of fraternal blood To
 this high consideration all minor
 questions at least for the
 present in my judgment ought
 to remain subordinate It is
 the duty of the Chief
 Executive of the nation to
 take care that the laws
 be faithftilly executed and to
 this end it is clearly
 his duty to use all
 proper and reasonable efforts to
 enforce the laws and to
 pro tect the property belonging
 to the United States The
 extent to which he shall
 use the physical force of
 the Government for tl e
 se purposes how ever I
 regard as dependent upon the
 peculiar cir cumstances which shall
 attend each particular case as
 it may arise Each case
 of resistance calls for the
 exercise of a sound discretion
 on the part of the
 President or of Congress As
 a general rule as against
 cases of the attempted nullification
 of any particular statute or
 as against mere rnasses of
 individuals a mob or an
 armed resistance in any given
 case I am for a
 vifforous enforcclnent of the laws
 so long as the Government
 has the power The presentcondition
 of things however presents all
 these questions in an entire
 new aspect to the American
 people Nothing has ever occurred
 which affords a fair precedent
 for the emergency now upon
 us Iiisnotacase of nullification mere
 ly as in 1832 nor
 is it a case of
 ordinary armed resistance to any
 particular law We have now
 six States confessedly sovereicrn in
 many things claiming to have
 absolved themselves from au political
 allegiance to the Federal Government
 and to be now sovereign
 and independent in ali things
 They have gone even further
 and have organized governments defacto
 independently of the other States
 They are also the act
 of exposition of the law
 of the casc in t
 his territorial orøaniz ing a
 new confederation of States which
 other States may possibly soon
 join question I have frorn
 the first acceptcd this de
 I thil ll it is
 Macauley who l as said
 When cisi01 and havc only
 to regret that the country
 king or ruler confounds the
 deliberate revolution generally has not
 been willing to do so
 also I would much prefer
 even nowr as a common
 pla t ary uprising of
 a people with the irregular
 out form upon which all
 might stand the conservative break
 of an irresponsible mob he
 commits a fatal rrhere can
 be no question as to
 the doctrines contained in it
 Other theories how II mistake
 wisdom of this suggestion In
 these seceding ever prevailed in
 the contest through which we
 havc just passed Though by
 a minority vote I Statcs
 all the officers necessary to
 the ordinary execution of the
 Fedei ai laws have resigned
 So yet under the forms
 of the Constitution a Pres
 Ident has been elected on
 a platform denying to far
 as the ordinary Ineaus go
 sir the executive and judicial
 branches of this Government are
 in slaveholders any participation as
 such in the colu unon
 Territories and insisting upon the
 power I a state of
 entirc suspension in those States
 It is and duty of
 Congress to exclude slavery from
 all true that these offices
 might be filled by persons
 those Territories This is in
 direct conflict with appointed from
 other States and the omcers
 thus the decision to which
 have referred upon any appointed
 might repair to their posts
 of duty I supported by
 the Federal guns but in
 the pres construction placed upon
 it and in my opinion
 offensively unjust to the people
 of the southern ent temper
 of the times what good
 could come i here is
 no denying the fact that
 this from such a proceeding
 All must concede that States
 result whether well founded or
 not has filled the war
 would be the result Of
 a war thus inaugu southern
 mind with fielings of the
 deepest appre rated the end
 is beyond mortal vision but
 as one result of it
 all hope of a reunion
 or a reconstruc hcnsion and
 has already produced a most
 dis tion of the Government
 would in all human prob
 astrous effect in many of
 the southern States For myself
 sir I deeply regret thc
 course which ability be entirely
 destroyed In such a war
 the several of the southern
 States have taken As entire
 country would most surely become
 in an abstract proposition I
 do not concede the right
 voivod sooner or later and
 the waters of the of
 secession in the sense in
 which it is claimed ocean
 would not suflicc to wash
 out the stains of I
 the blood which would be
 shed during such a I
 can but regard their by
 the seceding States II proceedings
 as revolutionary and subversive of
 conflict Many things have occurred
 which upon they would have
 slavery or not without the
 in the impulse of the
 moment citizens loyal to the
 tervention of Congress thusabandoningthcoldcr policy
 of division This plan seemed
 to be so much in
 accordance with the genius of
 our Gov ernment and of
 such easy and universal applica
 tion to a ll Territories
 wherever situated that it was
 embraced by both of the
 leading political par I ties
 of the day It but
 remained to repeal the act
 which established the Missouri line
 to make this principle opplicable
 to ail then existing Territo
 ries and this was accordingly
 done in 1854 Notwithstanding the
 opposition which followed the repeal
 of the Missouri line I
 in common with thousands of
 other friends of that measure
 never the Constitution but it
 is of no usc now
 to arQ1c King George these
 abstract propositions thought that our
 fathers had no right to
 secede from l iln and
 technically according to the theo
 ries of his Government they
 had not But still In
 spite of British bayonets they
 thev did it claimed to
 be the exclusive judges of
 the extent of their grievances
 and of the mode of
 redress Many of tl w
 southern States are evidently intend
 ing to act on the
 same theories Their success is
 a question for the future
 to solve When a revolution
 is successful its heroes are
 voted patriots when it fäils
 its leaders are de doubted
 that the principle on which
 it was done dounced as
 rebels In this as in
 all other haz would be
 again sancti01 ied by the
 people Such ards success is
 everything I believe to be
 the opinion of a majority
 of the The secedinsr States
 are already out of the
 American people to day on
 tbe abstract question Union so
 far as any action they
 can take can place Union
 may feel inclined to resent
 but sir shall we not
 pause before we strike when
 it is our li brother
 who offends In a matter
 upon which so much depends
 the utmost cxcrcise of forbearance
 on all sides is im
 perativety demande d If however
 in spite of all I
 patriotic efforts a collision must
 ensue let us do nothing
 to precipitate it Let us
 first see who are to
 be our enemies let us
 not commence an indis criminate
 slaughter of friends and foes
 let us first exhaust every
 effort at a peaceful settlement
 of the impending troubles If
 unfortunately the time shall ever
 come when my allegiance to
 the existing Federal Government or
 to any in tegral i
 part of it shall require
 me to take up arms
 in its defense a ainst
 the seceding States or any
 a one But other questions
 have now overshad them out
 On their part at least
 secession and portion of the
 southern people desire it to
 be owed this one and
 it is with the exigencies
 of the disunion are accomplished

 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 679
 mere political dogma that I
 shall be found fight ing
 Higher and deeper and broader
 than this must be the
 motive which shall induce me
 to draw the sword in
 a civil war While a
 portion of our citizens of
 impartial minds and undoubted patriot
 ism incline to the opinion
 that the prompt and vigorous
 use of force would soonest
 restore har mony I must
 say of many of those
 who are now most desirous
 for the commencement of hostili
 ties that it will be
 the first war I ever
 knew them to bc in
 favor of When our gallant
 Army but a few years
 since was struggling against a
 for eign foe in a
 foreign and hostile jurisdiction these
 men were then decidedly for
 peace For peace sir even
 to the extent of withholding
 the ordi nary supplies for
 the support of that Army
 What has produced this change
 Can it be party pre
 judice or sectional hatred Truly
 I hope It is If
 in the end an appeal
 must be made neither to
 the God of battles will
 those who have so earnestly
 contended that there is an
 irrepressible conflict impelling us on
 ward who insist that there
 is some indefinable and hostile
 antagonism between the t vo
 sections and who have so
 often asserted that before we
 can have peace the power
 of the South must bc
 broken in this Confederacy step
 forward as volunteers in this
 war Will they say to
 those who have always counseled
 forbearance and peace Sirs this
 con flict is ours and
 we will bear the brunt
 of it or will they
 not rather say that the
 Government antees to be tendered
 It is conceded by all
 of those who are willing
 to make concession that additional
 amendments to the Constitution be
 pro posed and that whatever
 shall be finally agreed to
 shall be iocked up in
 the Constitution as a part
 of it and thus placed
 beyond the contingencies of an
 ordinary presidential canvass I believe
 now that some such plan
 is in every point of
 view the most desirable as
 it would be in practice
 the most efficient The Constitution
 as It is is good
 enough for me personally and
 I regret any sup posed
 necessity for amending it yet
 I cheerfully yield to what
 seem 10 be the emergencies
 of the hour We want
 peace we want a restoration
 of confidence and we want
 increased stability to the Government
 For these I am willing
 to concede everything which honor
 and patriotism will per mit
 All legislative and judicial compromises
 having failed to accomplish a
 withdrawal of this vexed question
 of slavery from the halls
 of Congress which all conservative
 men have so much and
 so long desired let us
 make one more and if
 need be last effort to
 this end by amending the
 Con stitution A portion of
 the proposeå amendments is objcctcd
 to by some because the
 word slave I appreciate sir
 the mo is contained in
 them tives which induced the
 omission of t hat word
 in the old Constitution buta
 crisis has arisen in our
 Government which requires us to
 look this whole question fully
 and squarely in the face
 when all needs their services
 in a civil capacity and
 that mere speculative theories ought
 to be abandoned when we
 ought to deal with it
 as becomes prac the honest
 masses who are in no
 way responsi ble for the
 distressed condition of the country
 tical men dealing with stubborn
 facts As has must do
 the fighting It was once
 jocosely but been well said
 elsewhere why cavil about the
 truly said I think by
 that mythical persona e il
 name in the Constitution when
 the thing itself is Major
 Jack Downing that many of
 those who so I clearly
 contained within it Many of
 our treaties with foreign nations
 together with numerous acts vehemen
 tly proclaimed their readiness to
 shed their last drop of
 blood are exceedingly careful about
 II of Congress all constituting
 apartof the supreme losing the
 first drop A little delay
 in the present emergency rnay
 suffce to verify the truth
 of the them Why not
 also call things by their
 proper names in the Constitution
 itself when by failing assertion
 Another very curious fact in
 this connection is to do
 so misconstructions and misunderstandings that
 very many of those now
 most belligerent to II are
 the result So far as
 the territorial branch of this
 contro wards the seceding States
 have long Veen noted Or
 their hostiiity to the admission
 of any more versy is
 concerned I would very much
 prefer of slave States Thus
 it seems that a State
 I course to adhere to
 and to act upon my
 own pe If no others
 be cannot get into this
 Union nor out of it
 Without culiar theories in relation
 to it adopted I presume
 I shall still adhere to
 them a fury of indignation
 and of epithcts from them
 as in principle I regard
 them as the fairest and
 Why sir if they hate
 slavery half as badly as
 i I would much prefer
 to see the common profess
 to I should think they
 would be gla to best
 get rid of the States
 in which it exists on
 almost Territories of the United
 States occupied and cn joyed
 in common by the people
 of all the States any
 terms Can it be that
 it is only for power
 to govern the slave States
 that they have been upon
 terms of equality and in
 the spirit of fra ternal
 harmony but sir so bitter
 and so determ all the
 time struggiiw But sir I
 will not pursue this branch
 of my ined has been
 the opposition of those who
 object remarks further With the
 great mass of the to
 this plan of settlement from
 the first that I now
 people of the State which
 I have the honor to
 despair of its being allowed
 to go into successful represent
 in part next after the
 preservation of operation with that
 promptness necessary to meet the
 rudest elements of liberty is
 the maintenance i the crisis
 I hold in yself ready
 therefore to cm of the
 American Union of States Differincr
 as brace any proposition which
 carries with it the we
 may as to the manner
 of accomplishing this appearance of
 justice and equality and 1
 will en deavor to accommodate
 myself to the view of
 result I presume there is
 little difference in agree ing
 that to effect this all
 reasonable efforts ought others in
 matters of detail So great
 sir is my w attachment
 to the present form of
 Government to be persistently made
 Whether the southern States are
 entitled to and so anxious
 I to preserve and perpetuate
 them or not a large
 portion of their people feel
 its blessings that if I
 canr10t save this Union upon
 In y own terms then
 I will be willing to
 accept that they ought to
 have some additional guaran tees
 They assure us that without
 them they no any other
 terms which will be effectual
 and not longer feel secure
 Concede for the sake of
 the in flagrant violation of
 the rights of those whom
 I have been as argument
 that they are all in
 the wrong and need I
 have the honor to represent
 much a partisan in matters
 within the legiti mate no
 new guarantees yet let us
 as generous men line the
 most serious objections to the
 old Mis souri line will
 be removed It follows therefore
 sir that I am inclined
 to favor the plan submitted
 by Mr CRITTENDEN in the
 Senate some time since or
 something simi_lar to it in
 preference to any other now
 pending be fore Congress First
 I think it more feasible
 and complete than any other
 and second I am dedto
 believe that it will be
 more effectual and command more
 real strength all over the
 country than any other If
 I cannot get that then
 I am willing to aid
 in supporting what may be
 next best So far as
 the report of the committee
 of thirty three is concerned
 there is much in it
 which I commend It seems
 to look in the right
 direction but as a whole
 sir I think it falls
 short of what the coun
 try had a right to
 expect under existing circum stances
 There are but few of
 the propositions It is no
 contained within it that I
 can sustain time for any
 mere temporizing policy If we
 con cede at all why
 not cover the whole ground
 in controversy and thus make
 final work of it if
 possible leave nothing more to
 mere inference Or construction in
 relation to slavery It is
 objected by many of our
 Republican op ponents to the
 plan of Mr CRITTENDEN or
 to any similar plan that
 it runs counter to the
 Chicago platform This sir to
 a certain extent I frankly
 admit but what of it
 Is not the preservation of
 the peace and integrity of
 the country of greater moment
 than all parly platforms Away
 with such consideralions in times
 like these This plan affords
 common middle ground why can
 not all the Uniön men
 come together upon it It
 is but a rctut n
 to the old idea of
 dividing what it seems we
 cannot enjoy in commons in
 peace This will still leave
 the new States to be
 formed on both sides of
 the proposed line free to
 adopt whatever domestic institutions they
 choose when the proposition to
 absolutely exclude the sir southern
 people or rather the slaveholders
 as such from all participation
 in the common Ter ritories
 of the United States has
 always seemed to me so
 manifestly unjust that I never
 could bring myself to believe
 that the great mass of
 the fair minded men of
 the Republic ån party have
 in tended rigorously to insist
 on the ultimate enforce ment
 of such a dogma have
 ever regarded it more as
 a device to carry an
 clection with than In this
 view of it it has
 already anything else served its
 purpose Whenever therefore any gentleman
 Insists upon a ricorous enforcement
 of this policy in the
 present temper of the country
 and is unwillingtoconccde anything on
 this point I cannot but
 regard him as a practical
 disuniomst I Sir if the
 southern people were a race
 of can nibals so longas
 we were in the Union
 with them and living undera
 common Constitution I would be
 willing to divide the common
 benefits and com mon property
 with them fairly and equally
 How much more strongly is
 this obligation Imposed when they
 are kindred our friends and
 our breth ren Whenever I
 shali determine that I will
 not consent to recognize any
 claim on thc part of
 the southern people including of
 course the slave holders to
 any of the Territories or
 other com mon property of
 all the States I will
 not then even claim to
 be a Union man To
 those who stand in this
 category 1 ask why not
 say at once to the
 people of the South Stand
 and deliver This Government is
 ours not yours Why do
 you offer something which will
 afford to those who range
 of party politics as perhaps
 any man cry Peace peace
 when there is no peace
 and have left a decent
 pretext for their return to
 us ought to be but
 sir am willing to yield
 all II when none is
 intended Why continually pro claim
 that you are for the
 Constitution and the They only
 desire that we will put
 in writing in mere party
 considerations and all thoughts of
 some solemn and irrevocable form
 that which we mere personal
 consistency in at least orle
 move I Union when you
 are not willing to concede
 anv thing to preserve them
 have so frequently assured them
 in our speeches earnest effort
 to do something to reunite
 the coun If sir by
 the exercise ofa wise forbearance
 a and at the hustings
 They want the questions now
 try I have been satisfied
 ever since I have had
 an i resort to arms
 can be avoided and a
 peucefu and so important to
 them since they have perma
 honorable settlement of existing troubles
 can be neatly become a
 minority section placed beyond opportunity
 of consultin r with persons
 from the different sections of
 the _ onfederacy after the
 efföcted nations will yet rise
 up to call us blessed
 the contingencies of mere construction
 or infer If however by
 any rash or reckless act
 of ours ence but so
 written that he who runs
 may read opening of the
 present session of Congress that
 this country shall be involved
 in a desolating civil Sir
 I believe it to be
 the interest of all sections
 sorne plan for a fair
 and equitable division of the
 that new guarantees be at
 once offered and that Territories
 of the United States as
 between the war then the
 sooner the curtain of oblivion
 is thrown over the present
 exciting and terrible chap some
 fair and honorable adjustment should
 be at sections accompanied with
 suitable guarantees once made I
 feel satisfied that the northern
 States II would command more
 strength and at the same
 ter in our history as
 a nation the better for
 us in l the eyes
 of postcritv can offerto theSouth
 such additional guaranteesas time be
 more efficient in the end
 than any other I am
 proud to be able to
 say that so far as
 my plan By this I
 mean the establishment of a
 line in the end satisfy
 the great mass of its
 peo something like the old
 Missouri line north of own
 my native State is concerned
 she has been ple without
 changing in the least the
 form of our Government or
 the principles upon which it
 was which slavery shall be
 prohibited and south of true
 to her constitutional obligations nothing
 which it shall be recognized
 and if necessary i vital
 can the southern people justly
 complain of founded The great
 question of the day is
 shall It is no use
 to deny the fact however
 that we try the experiment
 Most unhesitatingly I protected By
 making this constitutional by the
 her requisite amendments and by
 specifically defin towards some of
 the northern States the South
 has just cuuse of complaint
 Let those offending answer ves
 The next question is how
 are these new guar ing
 the rights of the parties
 on both sides of this
 680 States make the amende
 honorable as Rhode Island has
 done then let us tender
 some fair and hon örable
 mode of adjustment of the
 whole contro versy and if
 all overtures shall be rejected
 then new questions will arise
 and new responsibilities intervene I
 do not however fear such
 a result and will not
 discuss so remote a contingency
 Suffbiént unto the day is
 the evil thereof If nevertheless
 sir after all peaceful means
 shall be exhausted we find
 that a final and inex
 orable separation must take place
 I cånnot in any view
 of the case which I
 have been able to take
 see what good can result
 from a resort to arms
 W ar as between the
 different sections or the differéht
 States would be ipsofacto dissolu
 tioh States at war are
 necessarily foreign to each other
 While I would cling to
 the Union so long as
 there is a fragment of
 it left worth pre Serving
 yet if wc rnust part
 in the name of hu
 manity let us do so
 like Christian and reasonable men
 Let us say to those
 who will not remain with
 us as Abraham said to
 Lot Let therc be no
 strife I pray thoc between
 me and thee and between
 my herdmen and thy herdmen
 for we be brethren G
 Is not the whole land
 beforc thec Separate thyself I
 pray thee from me if
 thou wilt take the left
 hand then I iVill go
 to thå ri ht or
 i thou depart to the
 right hand then I will
 go to tße left Sir
 the theme is too mournful
 a one and I vy
 ill not dwell upon it
 May He who cöntrols the
 destiny of nations rule all
 things for the best Mr
 EDGERTON then addressed the House

 I thought that in accordance

 last week Friday of cach

 a mistake about it Perhaps
 it applied only to last

 That must be the subject
 ofa motion Mr BRAGG We
 have had but part of
 one day during the session
 devoted to private bills and
 that was only a portion
 of last Friday Un less
 some timo is devoted to

 of the claimants now before
 Congress will have no possible
 chance to get their claims
 al lowed and many of
 them are undoubtedly just In

 So th amendment was rejected
 and the ques tion r

 Mr PEARCE it was greed
 to RESOLUTIONS OF JERSEY everal
 SENATORS addressed the Chair The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Senator from
 New Jersey is entitled to
 the floor haviY g yielded
 it by unanimous consent for
 the proceedings that have just
 terminated Mr TEN EYCK 1
 should not persist in claiming
 the floor if it were
 not that I havc had
 the honor of presenting the
 resolutions of a State upon
 the ail absorbing matters filling
 the public mind and therefore
 think it proper to make
 motion that the resolutions be
 printed and upon that motion
 I bec leave to submit
 a few remarks Mr President
 these resolutions from New Jer
 sey attract my prompt attention
 command my high respect and
 claim my full consideration but
 they are not to stop
 my voice control my ac
 sir lion or manacle rny
 limbs Did I occupy a
 seat herc as an agent
 appointed to perform specific duties
 or as an em ba
 ssador from a distinct sovereign
 State as is claimed by
 some to be our truc
 position hero I should be
 bound to act in strict
 accordance with these instructions for
 such I do regard them
 in effect but a Senator
 in Congress from a State
 is a Senator of the
 United States The Constitution makes
 him so expressly and though
 called upon to advance the
 interests of tho State from
 which he comes ho is
 bound to the genera weal
 of at the States the
 general welfare of the Union
 of the Union in all
 its several parts in its
 frozen North its ardent South
 on the Atlantic coast on
 the Pacific slope and in
 the throbbing heart and center
 of it all I regard
 the Constitution of the United
 States as the suprerne law
 of tho land and do
 not hesi tate to say
 that when in my opinion
 the action of my State
 comes in conflict with its
 provisions although I dearly love
 her glory in her fame
 and reverence her voice I
 still shall yield obedience to
 that superior law I hold
 the ConstitutiDn of the Union
 to be a fundamental frame
 of govern ernment for all
 the people of all the
 States bind ing upon each
 on each one individual y
 su preme within the scope
 of its authority and not

 as follows they propose to

 in a way unconstitutional States
 which they may disregard and
 break or spoke as follows
 CThere is another tribunal before

 The Govern and his colleague
 Mr Frelinghuysen shall most il

 Ours are those ment of

 into three departrnents the executive
 the legisla and judgmellt which
 shall be rendered after the
 hearing so so to spe
 ak stand as sentinels Over
 it to Wiitdh tivc and
 the judicial The legislative branch
 is far as thcy shall
 affect us personally however we
 inay again dividcd into a
 Senate and a House of
 Rcp resent8tives with the power
 of approval and a negation
 in the President This const
 ilutes the whole legislative power
 of the Union but if
 the Legislature of a State
 have the right to instruct
 its Senators in Cong ss
 and is to be oboyed
 then the Legislatures of the
 sev era States become a
 portion of the Legislature of
 the Union and a power
 is added to this depart
 ment of the Government unknown
 and foreign to the Constitution
 the first article of which
 ex pressly says Jlll legislative
 powers herein Fran ted be
 vested ina Congress of the
 United St ates If a
 have the power to instruct
 her Sen ators in Congress
 then they become her agents
 simply to make known her
 wishes and to execute her
 will lthis cannot be Such
 a position makes them virtually
 a mere machine to record
 her ayes and noes and
 that might just as well
 bedone by I believe that
 modern mechanism as by a
 man skiii has contrived a
 mode for such a purpose
 for the laws and our
 country That tribunal all approaches
 to abd all attacks upon
 it and to is the
 people of New Jersey who
 we Inost solemnly be determine
 their true and real character
 whether lieve and think we
 have abuildant evidence for our
 belief thev come from real
 friends or secret foes were
 not correctly represented in those
 instructions I is it true
 that the Legislature has a
 right in disregaid of They
 are designed to secure stability
 and per I popular opinion
 and against the wishes of
 their own eon Étltuents to
 control the other agents of
 those constituents Is the power
 vested in the on tbts
 point inde pendent of the
 people ot tho State Are
 they in that the masters
 Dt the people had supposed
 that the people were the
 source of power and that
 their will was as con
 trolling in its action on
 t he nembers of the
 Legislat_ure on this subjectas on
 any other and that their
 connnands were only to bc
 regarded us valid when they
 confonn to the in Phis
 may structions and comrnands of
 their constituents be skepticism but
 beg to say that it
 is old Republicanism and Dcmocracy
 not tliat of modern day
 hicll secms to requirc that
 the will of a few
 who happen to be in
 the Le i gislature or
 are leaders of a party
 should be obeyed in despite
 of the opinions and wishes
 of the people Sit be
 lievil as f do that
 rny constituents disapprove the act
 of thc Execntive I should
 be guilty of treason towards
 them if I obeyed the
 orders of othcrs in approving
 that act against nw own
 judglnent I turn now to
 the remarks of a Senator
 also from New Jersey who
 in his day was good

 with whom hc acted a

 liberty of saying but I

 action A Government framed on
 mature deliberation by the very
 men who won their independence
 at the cannon s mouth
 for the protection of their
 rights and to secure freedom
 to themselves and their posterity
 should not be changed or
 altered except for the weightiest
 reasons and then only in
 the most solemn calm and
 unimpassioned man ner These were
 the motivos which actlia ted
 the framers of the Constitution
 when they in the fifth
 article specifically provided the two
 modes and only two for
 its amendment ohe by Con

 it necessary tl le other
 when the Legisla tares of
 two thirds of the several

 jection that i make to
 them and lying at the

 to a single glass of
 pure cold 682 least degree
 to hinder the performance of
 any I service which may
 be due from him who
 is held to labor to
 the person to whom such
 labor may be due ih
 any place or jurisdiction where
 the local law renders such
 service legal and obligatory I
 would leave that entirely to
 the local authority of the
 place and to the judgment
 and the consciences of those
 who may require it who
 are responsible for and ready
 to assume the consequences of
 it Nor do L see
 why Congress should hinder or
 by law prohibit the transportation
 of persons held to service
 from one State to another
 either by land or water
 provided no such transporta tion
 or any traffcking in slaves
 should be per mitted in
 the States now free or
 in the waters flowing through
 them but I would ever
 punish with the pains of
 death that execrable com met
 ce which Mr Jefferson in
 the original draft of the
 Declaration of Independence called with
 truth a piratical warfäre the
 opprobrium of in fidel Powers
 and the warfare of the
 Christian King of Great Britain
 determined to keep open a
 market where men should be
 boughtand sold know sir that
 there are men even in
 this our day who claim
 to view this traffic as
 a Christian blessing claiming that
 it opens Africa to religious
 influence and brings its sacred
 blaze to glow upon the
 heathen mind It does indeed
 upon those killed in wars
 incited for their capture it
 does indeed on those who
 die in transit and like
 dead I cats and dogs
 are cast into the sea
 it may in deed on
 those who reach a crowded
 mart and find their way
 at last to fields of
 endless toil They say our
 patriotic fathers were mistaken that
 they did not understand themselves
 But sir such unen as
 these to gain their selfish
 ends not only would denounce
 their words but hurl the
 idols of their former worship
 from their altars and creep
 ing up like insects on
 the sides presu n f_
 to take their places in
 their stead A nd so
 Mr Presidclit I might go
 on and state my views
 on all the several matters
 to in these resolutions but
 as the objection I enter
 Zain to the first article
 will preclude my voting for
 them in their present shape
 I will not trespass further
 on the patience of the
 Senate by a special reference
 to them M y objection
 to the first article as
 now amended is it does
 not restore the Missouri cotnpronlise
 merely as some suppose and
 claim it does provides that
 In all the territory south
 01 that line of latitude
 360 30 now held or
 to be hereafter acquired slavery
 of the African race iS
 hereby recoønized as exist intr
 aud shall not be interfered
 with by C ongress but
 shall be protected as property
 all tbc departments of the
 territorial govern ment during its
 eontinuauce Now sir this I
 cannot vote for In view
 of what I now believe
 to be a well established
 pur pose and design in
 certain quarters ns shown by
 past events to extend the
 power of this Gov ernlnent
 over Mexico Central Amcrica Cuba
 i and the islands of
 the sea such an amendmeilt
 to he Constitution would soon
 or late consign this continent
 south of us and north
 of I Darien to thc
 il fluences of slavery political
 and social This I claim
 would be unjust to the
 northern portion of this Union
 and wbuld through the operation
 of the three fifths rule
 on which the right of
 rep resentation is based in
 Congress extend this right beyond
 the lilY1its contemplated by the
 framers of the Constitution It
 would be unjust to the
 toil incr millions of free
 white men who labor for
 a living with their own
 hands and against the spirit
 of our institutions fran led
 to advance the inter est
 s _ f freemen everywhere
 within the shadow of their
 influence But sir Kansas having
 been admitted as a State
 and this act of tardy
 justice done at last could
 give my vote for the
 passage of an act enabling
 the people of so much
 of the Territory of New
 Mexico as lies south of
 the line t of 360
 30 to come into the
 Union as a State with
 such a constitution with regard
 to slavery or free dom
 as they might choose to
 frame provided involuntary servitude unless
 asa punishment for crime be
 forever prohibited in the Territories
 north of that line of
 latitude This would violate no
 provision of the Consti tution
 This Would be in accordance
 with former It would or
 ought to put an end
 to i precedent this unholy
 controversy and would or ought
 If II effL ctually to
 silencc all strife and agitation
 however no adjustment can be
 made if this Union Inust
 be destroyed it will be
 upon a theory on CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 1 the most
 miserpble abstraction in the world
 Sir the present status in
 the Territories is already I
 fthis Union be fixed is
 a fact accomplished dissolved the
 madness of the act will
 be equaled only by its
 stupendous folly The dissolution of
 the Union did I say
 No sir no It may
 bc attempted we may have
 strife and conflict we may
 have blows and bloodshed we
 may have war grim visaged
 war but this Union of
 our fathers this blessed Union
 this priceless heri tage cannot
 be destroyed without a struggle
 a struggle long protracted Nations
 spring not into being in
 a day nor do they
 vanish in an hour They
 do not die as infants
 do They feel by far
 a greater pang than when
 a giant dies They must
 protect themselves they must protect
 their pow they must preserve
 their limits they must maintain
 control The law of self
 defense applies as well to
 them as to individuals No
 this Union cannot be destroyed
 Man in his mad folly
 may attempt it but man

 These empty seats too plainiy
 tcll us that the evil
 is upon us and we
 must palliate or arrest it
 as we may It is
 impossible to deny that the
 ties of frater nity which
 once bound the States as
 a nation have been loosened
 if not altogether broken that
 men heretofore counted as patriots
 north and south are looking
 upon our Federal Government either
 as tyrannical and unjust or
 as too weak and powerlesé
 to afford them adequate protection
 of life and property and
 we have arrived at thal
 period in our brief national
 history when our free insti
 tutions instead of inspiring confidence
 torical sense speak of the
 causes and probable confide the
 drawing up of such an
 instrument to consequences of revolutions
 but the question of a
 mere plurality of votes We
 are already right depends on
 the issue of the trial
 and involves as a definite
 constitutional Goverhment as a confederate
 Republic and we are bound
 to nothing less than tbe
 success or defeat of those
 engaged and the respective positions
 of the ac preserve that
 Government in its true spirit
 and with all the checks

 of our Constitution no doubt

 encroachments of the arbi tended
 to establish a Government and
 for that rea trary will
 of the majority Nothing is
 more nat son they could

 very characteristic of our people

 of the situatön by affording
 us too little time for

 The South feel less indignant
 perhaps at the wrongs which
 have been actually committed than
 apprehensive of others which may
 be perpetrated at a time
 not far distant and they
 are as men re solved

 against the theory of wroncy

 some of whom no doubt
 secretly glad to behold them
 shorn of their former prestige

 out as the diminutives of
 former great ness living assurances
 of the future harmlessness and
 good behavior of those same
 Americans whose progress had once
 so alarmed Guizot with the

 shall be held to a
 terrible account by humanity even
 for having blasted all hopes
 of the success of republican

 national suicide forever destroying the
 popular faith in self government
 Whichever way we tdi n
 there is nothing but scorn
 and ob loquy for our
 fallen institutions while despotism itself
 would draw a long free
 breath from the ter rible

 our liberty Mr President this
 picture so much more graph
 ically drawn by other and
 abler Senators of the forlorn
 condition of our country in
 case of vio lent separation
 and disunion is far from
 being overcharged It is impossible
 to depict the ori ginal
 horrors desolation ruin and polit
 ical anni hilation which in
 the end would be the
 conse quence of so fatal
 a step Clay and Webster
 did not desire to lift
 the curtain which concealed from
 of our liberal institutions They
 rnayexistnom I their patriotic eyes
 the dark prospect of dissolu

 principles are rc inally for

 IS fled our quired to
 make a constitutional party of
 law and people will have
 lost all vital strength or
 moral I order at the
 North the potent shield and
 protec courage to cherish or
 uphold them The body tion
 of the South That party
 will stand by them in
 a peaceful solution of this
 whole question It will stand
 up for their just rights
 under the Con stitution in
 every State Legislature in every
 county city town village and
 hamlet through out the length
 and breadih of our land
 It will combat in their
 very strongholds and under God
 s providence crush the heresies
 and false idols which have
 been set up to misguide
 the peo pie teaching at
 their altars hatred and contempt
 of heart instead of fraternal
 love and attachment to our
 institutions and laws It seems
 to me but folly in
 the South to con sider
 all as lost and their
 condition in the Union may
 retain its warmth for an
 hour but the rigid and
 expressionless features tell the sad
 tale too surely And what
 would be the financial condition
 of our country North and
 South in case of violent
 separation The expenses of Government
 would bc doubled and as
 divisions ensue tripled quad rupled
 Each State confederacy or confedera
 cies would have its offcials
 its foreign and do mestic
 relations and in addition to
 these relations among themselves not
 always of the most ami
 cable and satisfactory nature The
 North would have its line
 of custom houses along the
 southern i frontier whilc the
 South acknowledging free trade tion
 and disunion They shrank from
 penetrating the future to behold
 the calamities which lay in
 that terrible vista but thousands
 of hands are now raised
 to lift the veil to
 calcll a sight of the
 gloomy perspective revealing a taste
 for tragedy in the country
 that is destined to grow
 amono us unless speedily corrected
 by tho substitution of something
 more congenial and healthy If
 we are to heal the
 breach which now seems almost
 inevitable and lasting between the
 North and the South the
 remedy must be applied at
 once Family quarrels must be
 made up quickly or they
 become chronic and exceed in
 virulence It is nat and

 men to hate most what
 they once most loved and
 cherished and their former affection

 There are those who believe
 that when a final separation

 to reconstruct the Government as
 it is called than to

 there is nothing to be
 hoped but final dis solution

 of the whole country into
 petty Republics breathing defiance at
 each other without retaining either
 weight or consideration in the
 affairs of the world Our
 sovereign people are not prepared
 for this They neither desire
 nor if you give them
 an oppor tunity will they
 permit it A martial people
 they may be but this

 how would the North enter

 could certainly not drag the

 Mr SEBASTIAN The Committee on
 Fi nance having now concluded

 postpone the further consideration of

 at one o clock in
 order to enable the Committee
 on Indian Affairs to offer
 the other amendments appropriate to
 this bill The motion was
 agreed to BILL Mr SIMMONS
 I am instructed by the
 select committee of the Senate
 to whom was referred the
 bill H R No 338
 10 provide for the pay
 mentof outstanding I reasury notes
 to authorize a loan to
 regulate and fix the duties
 on imports and for other
 purposes to report the bill
 back to the Senate with
 sundry amendments and I ask
 that the bill and aniendments
 be printed in the ordinary
 way and it would be
 desirable if the Senate would
 order some five hundred extra
 copies to be printed to
 be sent to different portionS
 of the country The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr F00T If there
 be no objection that order
 will be made Mr SUMNEi1
 1 would suggest to the
 sen ator that ho make
 the number one thousand Mr
 SIMMONS I think that is
 more than we can send
 around I would also propose
 that the bill be made
 the special order for Tuesday
 next at one o clock
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The motion
 to print must first bcdisposedof
 Ifthere be no objec tion
 the order will be made
 to print five hundred extra
 copies of the biil and
 amendments The Chair bears no
 objection and that order is
 made Mr SIMMONS There may
 perhaps be some little alterations
 yet needed in this bill
 butl have thought it better
 to have it printed and
 let our constituents understand the
 alterations now pro posed I
 move that the consideration of
 the bill be postponed until
 Tuesday next at one o
 clock and made the special
 order Mr G WIN I
 was a member of the
 select committee to yvhom this
 bill was referred and I
 i consider it due to
 myself as well as to
 the Senate to say that
 I am entirely opposed to
 the principle of the bilk
 The rnajority of the committee
 have reported it with amendments
 and in some re spects
 I think they have improved
 the House bill by making
 it more a revenue bill
 than it was originally but
 I give notice that when
 it comes tiong in California
 at fifty dollars per month
 for the half June 1861
 vear ending per aet of
 19th June 1860 l he
 ajnendlnent was agreed to The
 next amendment was to Insert

 The next was For p
 tY1nent for such permanent ilnprove
 nents as may have been
 made by claimants to laud
 on the reserve named in
 the second article of the
 treaty of 10th September 1853
 with the Rogue River Indians
 persecond and thh d articles
 of said treaty 2 000
 The amendment was agreed to
 up for consideration I shall
 endeavor to show that the
 present revenue systeurl is better
 than that proposed in this
 bill I only wish to
 say now that I do
 not agree with the majority
 in the prin ciple that
 is contained in this bill
 I believe it has been
 greatly improved by the action
 of the majority of the
 select committee in its revenue
 features and to that extent
 cordially unite with their action
 but as to the general
 princip e of the bill
 I am opposed to it
 as I sliall state more
 at large whey it comes
 up for consideration NIr PEARCE
 1 think the day which
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 proposes for the dis cussion
 of this bill is entirely
 too early The bill will
 not be printed and laid
 upon our tables I take
 it until Monday Mr BIGLER
 To morrow Mr PEARCE Suppose
 it were laid on our
 tables to morrow Every member
 of the Senate ought to
 have at least a few
 days to consider the multifarious
 subject matters contained in such
 a bilk as this which
 I understand proposes a thor
 ough and radical change in
 our system of duties on
 imports and besidcs it must
 be recollected that we are
 now in the month of
 February and that it is
 very important to the business
 of the Senate that sotne
 titne should be given to
 the con sideration of bills
 for the support of the
 Govern I believe but two
 of the general appro ment
 priation bills have yet passed
 the pension bill and the
 West Point Academy bill and
 there remain all the bills
 which make heavy appropria tions
 for the great disburserfients of
 the Govern ment to be
 considered Ithe Indian appropriation 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 687 Mr
 BRAGG That can be done
 at any other bill is
 not yet through and will
 occupy I sup pose to
 morrow if we sit to
 morrow the Navy time bill
 the Army bill the legislative
 and executive I Mr HALE
 I have a resolution on
 what I bill the miscellaneous
 bill all heavy bills con
 understand to be a question
 of privilege relating taining the
 great appropriations of the year
 are to the proceedings of
 the body I beg leave
 to I recurs on the
 motion of the Sehaför from
 North Carolina that the Senate
 proceed to the consid cratxon
 of the Private Calendar The
 question being put there were
 on a divis Ion ayes
 seven yet to be considered
 and if the Committee on
 Finance are not allowed to
 have scnne of their bills
 which they have reported and
 which are now lying on
 your table taken up in
 the early part of the
 next week I think it
 likely that you will not
 get through with them at
 a t or at least
 not creditably by the end
 of thessession I hope therefore
 the gentleman will postpone his
 motion and give us at
 least a week s time
 Let him name next Friday
 or Saturday week and then
 I shall have no objection
 to taking up the bill
 and dis cussmg it to
 the end Mr SIMMONS I
 have no purpose to em
 barrass thc Committee on Finance
 and do not know which
 we ought to do first
 provide the means to pay
 the appropriations and then make
 them or first make the
 appropriations and then provide the
 means to pay them I
 will agree to postpone the
 bill until Wednesday and that
 will leave us three days
 for the appropriation bills Mr
 PEARCE That is better but
 1 think you ought to
 say Thursday The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The qucstion is on the
 motion ofthe Senator from Rhode
 Island that this bill be
 postponed until Wednesday next and
 made the special order for
 that day at one o
 clock The motion was agreed
 to FRANCIS M MUNK S
 offer it If there be
 objection to its consideration of
 course it will lie over
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The resolu
 tion be received and read
 for information The Secretary read
 it as follows Resoleed That
 the reasons assigned by the
 Secretary of i the Senate
 for his neglect to obcv
 the order of the Senate
 Inade on the 20th of
 March last iir favor of
 Mrs E A Linn are
 insufficient and unsatisfactory and that
 he be in struet ed
 forthwith to execute tile same

 FESSENDEN 1 was by the

 frorn Pennsylvania took from me

 OFFICER Does the Sen ate

 27 So the motion was
 not agreed to CONSULAR AND
 DIPLOMATIC BILL Mr PEARCE I
 now move to take up
 the havcan opportunity of saying
 what I have to say
 and diplomatic appropriation bill before
 proceeding with the other business
 I I The Inotion was
 agreed to and the Senate
 as Mr BIGLEW to the
 in Committee of the Whole
 procccdcd to con Mr LANE
 1 desire to a report
 The floor sider the bill
 H R No 864 making
 appropri Committee on Military Affairs
 and Militia to whom was
 referred the petition of Francis
 M I Munks a white
 man and Susan his wife
 a Choc taw Indian praying
 damages for being deprived of
 the ad vantages of keeping
 a ferry under a grant
 from the Choctaw Council by
 the erection ofa free bridge
 by t ho Unit ed
 States ask to be discharo
 ed from its further consideration
 and that it be re
 ferred to the Committee on
 Indian Affairs Mr SEBASTIAN 1
 beg to suggest to the
 I Senator from Oregon that
 the Committee on ln dian
 Affairs according to my recollection
 have had that case before
 them for consideration here tofore
 and reported it back and
 asked to be dis charged
 from its consideration and that
 it be referred to the
 Committee on Military Affairs be
 cause the subject was deemed
 by the Indian Com mi
 tee appropriate for their consideration
 If Lhat is so it
 is hardly necessary to act
 on the motion the Senator
 has made If I am
 not mistaken the Mr FESSENDEN
 the motion made ations for
 the consular and diplomatic expenses
 of by the Senator from
 North Carolina will not pre
 the Govornment for the year
 ending the 30th o vail
 because it is the intention
 of the chairman June 1862
 which had been reported from
 the of the Committee on
 Finance to ask the Senate
 to Committee on Finance with
 various amendments take up another
 appropriation bill in a moment
 The first amendment of the
 Committee on Fi He has
 just stepped to the committee
 room t o get nance
 was in line twenty eight
 to strike out an amendment
 We want to Yet through
 with it if possible and
 I think we can get
 throueh with one of the
 bills to day as well
 as not It is very
 important to dispose of them
 I object to the Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas reception of
 any petitions at this time
 of the day The Senator
 from Pennsylvania will receive a
 great many more by the
 next day we meet and
 they can all come in
 together The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 pending motion is that of
 the Senator frorn North Caro
 lina that thc Senate proceed
 to the consideration It can
 only bc by unan of
 the Private Calendar i mous
 consent that other motions or
 the present case was once
 before the Indian Committee and
 I ation of petitions can
 be entertained while the at
 their instance referred to the
 committee of which i motion
 is pending the honorable Senator
 from Oregon isa member I
 must object Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas because of the eminent
 propriety there in i The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question having
 the question detennined by that
 commit is on the motion
 of the Senator from North
 Car tee rather than by
 the committee of which I
 am olina chairman 1 hope
 the Scnator will reflect on
 that Mr FESSENDEN If that
 motion shall not If the
 fact be fact before hc
 presses his motion succeed it
 is the intention of the
 chairman of the as I
 have stated I presume he
 will withdraw his i Finance
 Committee to call up the
 consular and motion and undertake
 the small labor of love
 di Iomatic appropriation bill Ir
 BRAGG The Senate can determine
 that which this case will
 impose upon him Mr RICE
 As I have had the
 honorof beinff I matter when
 the chairman comes in We
 can upon both of those
 committees I have examined go
 on with the Private Calendar
 until then the claim twice
 and 1 1710 ve to
 lay it on the table
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 shall move
 to take it The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question up immediatel
 if this motion does not
 prevail I is not yet
 disposed of upon the rnotion
 of the Mr BRAGG N

 been Senator from Oregon that
 the Committee on Mil I

 All Fridays itary Affairs bc
 discharged from the further con
 are usually devoted to that
 Calendar as late in sideration
 of the petition the session

 we ought to have E
 Mr LANE Let the sense
 of the Senate be part
 of the day at least
 for the Calendar taken upon
 that proposition and I have
 no objec CREDENTIALS tion to
 the petition lying on the
 table The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 first ques Mr CAMERON lam
 the tion is on the
 motion to discharge the Committee
 North Carolina will allow me
 to present a paper twenty
 and insert forty so that
 the clause will read For
 contingent expenses of ali the
 missions abroad 40 000 The
 amendment was agreed to The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The next amendment
 of the Committee on Finance
 will be Mr PEARCE I
 am authorized by the com
 mittee to withdraw the second
 amendment They reported in favor
 of illc reasing the appropriation
 for the continq ent expenses
 of Intercourse frorn in which
 form it passed the House
 to 50 000 which is
 the usual appropriation but there
 is a fund which will
 remain unexpended on the 30th
 of June next to the
 credit of that appro priation
 which makes it unnecessary to
 appro priate more than 40
 000 The PRESIDING OFFICER By
 general consent the amendment is
 withdrawn The next amendment of
 the committee was in lines
 eighty four and eighty five
 on page 4 to and
 insert four three thousand strike
 out so that the clause
 will thousand five hundred read
 For interpreters to the consulates
 in China 4 500 The
 amendment was agreed to The
 next amendment of the committee
 was to Insert at the

 of State The amendment was
 agreed to Mr PEARCE I
 am directed by the Commit

 in my hand and have
 had for several days I
 to insert at thc end
 of the bill on Military
 Affairs from its consideration I
 have pleasure in presenting the
 certificate of the pay the
 salary of the consul general
 at Simoda Japan The motion
 was agreed to The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question election of
 Hon EDGAR COWAN as United
 States frotn the time of
 his appointment to the of
 June 1861 now is on
 the motion of the Senator
 from Minne Lhat the petition
 lic on the table T
 hc xnotion was agreed to
 MRS E A LINN Mr
 BRAGG I move now that
 the Senate proceed to the
 consideration of the Private Calen
 they will be read Mr
 BIGLER I hope the Senator
 from North Carolina will allow
 me to present some memo
 rials Senator from Pennsylvania for
 six years from inclusive 2
 180 55 That amendment is
 introduced in consequence the 4th
 of March next and I
 move that the or dinary
 course be taken which I
 believe is to W of
 the Senate having recently confirmed
 the ap pointmellt of the
 gentlernan as consul general at
 read and file them The
 PRESIDINGOFFICL R The Chairwill Simoda
 This was held by Mr
 Harris receive the credentials as
 a privileged matter and our
 present minister to lapan When
 his suc cessful diplomacy had
 entitled him in the opin
 The credentials were read and
 ordered to be i ion
 of the President and the
 Senate to a mission he
 was made minister to Japan
 and thc place of filed
 PRIVATE CALENDAR consul genera was
 left vacant No provision The
 PRESIDING OFFICER T hc question
 was made for it at
 thc last session of Coygre
 ss 688 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 1 lam Of the
 opinion that it is entirely
 unnecessary to have a consul
 general t here though it
 would I be proper to
 have a consul As however
 the Senate have confirmed Mr
 Bradford as consul general to
 Simoda it seemed to be
 proper to carry out the
 act of the Senate to
 make the necessary appropriation for
 the balance of the fiscal
 year That sum is the
 sum contained in the amendment
 now presented to the Senate
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 concur entirely
 with the chairman of the
 committee in believing that this
 place of consul general at
 Simoda is entirely unnecessary Mr
 Harris who held it was
 raised to the position which
 he now holds of minister
 resident I believe and that
 fact rendered the con tinuance
 of the offce which he
 previously held unnecessary it is
 necessary undoubtedly to I think
 the better way is 10
 have a consul there meet
 this question at once M
 e have confirmed the offcer
 because thc of ice existed
 but he has not yet
 lcft the country we can
 therefore correct it very easily
 by striking out all that
 relates to a consul cencral
 at this l lace and
 inserting it amono the consulates
 and striking down the appropria
 tion 2 000 The amcndment
 of Mr FESSENDEN having been
 prepared the Secretary read it
 as follows line fifty two
 of hc bill page 3
 strike out Simoda after the
 word Alcxandt ia and insert
 Silnoda alter the word at
 in line fifty three so
 as to make the clause
 read For salaries of consuls

 Alex andria I lavaua Constantinople
 FrankfOrt on the Main consuls

 withdraws that The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Chair understands that to

 withdraw it to enable tbc

 Secretary read the remaining portions
 of the arncndment namely to
 strike out in li enly
 cight the word three and
 insert one so as 10
 reduce the total appropriation for
 salaries of c jnsois general
 and consuls frotn 273 75
 to 271 750 and at
 the end of linc seventy
 ninc to And the office
 of consul general at Simoda
 is hereby abolished and the
 salary C i tbc consul
 at Sinxoda fixed at 3
 000 Mr POLK I could
 not distinctly hear the reading
 of the amendrnent and wish
 to inquire wllether it will
 cut down the consulship at
 Simo da from a consul
 general to a simple consul
 but the Senate_is concerned abolished
 There is no consul appointed
 and it does not appear
 that there will be one
 before the beginning of the
 next fiscal year I doubt
 whether there will and therefore
 I proposed to reduce the
 appropriation by precisely the amount
 of the difference of salary
 calculating it only for the
 next year svpposing there would
 be no consul appointed up
 to that time The bill
 was reported to the Senate
 as amended the amcndments were
 concurred in and ordered to
 be en rossed and the
 bill to be read a
 third time The bill was
 read the third time and
 passed LEGISLATIVE ICTC APPROPRIATION BILL

 The bill will Mr PEARCE
 Unless it be desired by
 Senator that the bill shall
 be read as it is
 a very long onc I
 tnove to dispense with the
 read ing of it and
 take up the amendments The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The readin b
 of the bill will be
 dispensed with unless it be
 called for by a member
 The amendments of the Cornmittce
 on Finance will be read
 in their order T hc
 Secretary read the first amendment
 which was in line fourteen
 of page 2 to strike
 out the word ofliccrs and
 insert officer in the clause
 making an appropriation for the

 HALE I be mistaken I
 do not know whether the
 thing Ilkas been dono before

 in substance an increase of

 It is according to law
 The offtccr charged with the
 disbursement of tho con tingent
 fund of the Senate is
 allowed by law 480 for
 that business N r HALE
 And that business has always

 part of In y mcnt
 Mr POLK ithat is what
 I wished to inu I
 tun for the amendment down
 the amount Mr PEARCE would
 suugc st to the Sena
 f rorn iMa ne that
 consulships in that region usually
 havc attached to safarics of
 rather more than I think

 The amendment was agreed to
 Mr PEA RCE I will
 send another amendment to the
 Chair to come in as
 an additional section at the
 end of the bill ulnd
 be it further enacted That
 the provisions of the fifth
 section of chapter ninety seven
 of the act of Congress
 ap proved March 3 1853
 requiring the Secretary of the
 I reas ury to liniit
 the amount of refining at
 the Mint whenever private establishments
 shall be capable of refining
 bullion shall be extended to
 the several branches of the
 Nlint and to the United
 States assay office at New
 York in all cases where
 deposits of buliion are made
 ii r coiu or refined
 bars and that hereafter the
 charge tor converting refined bullion
 into coin shall not exceed
 one fifth of one per
 cent It was provided some
 years aoo in one of
 the appropriation bills that refined
 gold which had been refined
 at private establishments might be
 coined at the Mint and
 it was proposed at that
 time to make the alteration
 in the law applicable to
 all the branch mints but
 it was thought ad visable
 for various reasons to make
 the experi ment at the
 Mint at Philadelphia first No
 good MONDAY FEBRUARY 4 1861
 Mr HALE I move to
 amend the bill in the
 2d page by striking out
 in lines fourteen and fifteen
 these words Officer charged with
 disbursements of the Senate This
 is a small affair very
 small but it shows the
 way things are done here
 By law fora good many
 years the salary of our
 Secretary was 3 000 His
 friends and the Senate generally
 use to be in the
 habit and so the record
 will show of vot ing
 him at the end of
 the session a gratuity of
 four or five hundred dollars
 for the duties of dis
 bursing agent or disbursing omcer
 of the Senate and finally
 that sum got up to
 600 and I see that
 is the salary and suppose
 it has become so by
 law The only apology or
 excuse for raising tine salary
 from 3 000 to 3
 600 was to make permanent
 what we annually gave hirn
 in donations the 600 ad
 ditional for disbursing the fund
 of the Senate He now
 receives a regular salary of
 3 600 and in addition
 to that as disbursing officer
 480 more so that in
 fact he is now receiving
 a salary I suppose there
 is some statÜte for it
 of 4 080 but the
 last I can find in
 Brightly s Digest Mr PEARCE
 If the Senator will allowme
 I will state to him
 particularly Mr HALE very well
 Mr PEARCE The Senate will
 recollect that some years ago
 the Senator from Virginia Mr
 M A SON introauced a
 resolution under which a special
 committee was appointed who made
 a report on the subject
 of the salaries of all
 the ofhccrs and cm ployés
 of the Senate They were
 all raised they were fixed
 and the object was to
 do away with the annual
 gratuities of which the Senator
 speaks and they have been
 done away with under the
 operation of the resolutions of
 that committee which were submitted
 to the Senate and deliberately
 approved by them That report
 fixed the salary of the
 Secretary of the Senate at
 3 600 and allowed him
 as disburser of the funds
 of the Senate 480 and
 ever since that appro I
 priations have been made upon
 that basis i was mis
 stated before that it was
 by statute I recollect now
 my attention having been taken
 culled to it that the
 facts were as I have
 just stated because I was
 a member of that comrnittec
 was debated here in the
 Senate fully and the Scn
 ate having fixed by their
 own rule which is the
 law of this body at
 alk events if not the
 law of the land the
 salaries at this rate the
 committee have done nothin T
 but report precisely that which
 it was their duty to
 do It seenns to rne
 it would be a very
 indirect and improper mode of
 chang it lg the deliberate
 action of the Senate if
 we were now in an
 appropriation bill to seek to
 destroy that rule of the
 Senate Mr HALE I would
 ask if that was made
 by Mr PEARCE It was
 made by order of the
 Senate By resolution we fixed
 the salaries of our employés
 Each body does so The
 House of Representatives has done
 so always a fid the
 Senate never objects to any
 arrangement they make The Senate
 fixed the salary of their
 offi cers and employés and
 the other House assent 10
 it as a matter of
 course Mr HALE I think
 the Senator is mistaken because
 I have the book before
 me showing the payments that
 were made that year and
 this 400 was not paid
 as salary but was paid
 by the vote of the
 Senate out of the contingent
 fund Mr PEARCE Then it
 must have been be cause
 it vuras omitted in the
 bill Mr HALE well it
 ought to have been omitted
 because I know very well
 for I was here at
 the time that this paymcnt
 in addition to the Secretary
 s salary which up to
 that time had been 3
 000 this gratuity which had
 been given of 500 was
 for disbursing the funds The
 reason has been perceived why
 the same rulc It will
 be l object of that
 ccnnmittec of which the Senator
 should not apply to the
 other mints a reduction of
 expense to those who bring
 the l from Virginia was
 chairman was to fix these
 things and Inake them matt
 er of law instead of
 gold to places for refining
 and coinino and thc gratuity
 If I not mistaken and
 I have that reduction of
 the charge is to an
 amount which book before me
 but I do not know
 the page where the director
 of the Mint informs us
 is sufficient the report of
 the Senator from Virginia is
 the to indemnify the Government
 fer all expense committee made
 a recommendation that these The
 amendment was agreed to 44
 NEW SERIES NO 44 gratuities
 should be dispenséd with the
 sum paid which was then
 raised andi aiSéd up eqUal
 t o what the pay
 gratuity had been should be
 th e salary That was
 the tindevStäti ing according to
 my recollection and I think
 the Senator from Maryland will
 recölleet it the same The
 object of the Senate washtö
 gi e everything that was
 equitably due and to do
 it by law instead of
 doing it by gratuities nnd
 the excuSe the jus tification
 or whatever you may please
 to call it for this
 addition to thc Secretary S
 salary was because he was
 the disbursing officer and he
 now gets 3 600 salary
 and 480 additional fot dis
 item Mr GREEN As this
 payment only rests on a
 resolution of the Senate I
 think it just as com
 petent to abolish it by
 failing to make the app
 o priation as it is
 to abolish a consul general
 in Japan by failing t
 o make an appropriation and
 if we think it wron
 we ought to do so
 I shall therefore vote with
 the Senator from New Hamp
 Mr PEARCE I have sent
 for the rcport which was
 submitted by the Senator from
 Vir ginia and it has
 not yet come to hand
 but I arn sure that
 it will sustain what I
 have said on the subject
 The Senate gave the Secretary
 as Sec retary a salary
 of 3 600 and they
 gave the ad dilional sum
 of 480 for the trouble
 of disbursing the moneys of
 Senate In that I cannot
 be mistaken It is not
 a gratuity voted annually but
 it is in conformity to
 that resolution of the Senate
 adopted some five or six
 years ao o rais ing
 the salary of every emplové
 in the Senate I believe
 certainly of most of them
 Mr FOSTER As the Senator
 from New Hampshire has remarked
 Mr President this is a
 small matter and under the
 circumstances con sidering the precedence
 for this payment aud the
 length of time it has
 continued and as it is
 for the payment of an
 old omcer of the Senate
 I am not prepared now
 to strike it off and
 I think it is better
 and fairer as well as
 more liberal to let I
 shall vote to retain it
 it remain rvlr PEARCE I
 have now the report of
 the Senator from Virginia to
 which I alluded By it
 the salary of the Secretary
 of the Senate was fixed
 at pcr annum Now the
 Senator from New Hampshire may
 ask me why we have
 hap pened to put in
 3 600 Mr HALE I
 cannot hear a word that
 is said by the Senator
 1 Mr PEARCE 1 will
 speak a little louder have
 now the resolutions of the
 committee of which the Senator
 from Virginia was chairman I
 find that the first resolution
 was That the compensation of
 the offcers and persons in
 the employment of the Senate
 from and after the 30th
 of June 1859 be as
 fOklows namely ero the Secretary
 of the Senate 3 000
 per annum And here the
 Senator will probably ask me
 why sve have inserted The
 reason is that by law
 by a joint resolution sanctioned
 by both Houses of Congress
 we added twenty per cent
 to the salaries of the
 employés of both That makes
 it 3 600 The next
 provision was To the officer
 charged with the disbursements of
 the Senate 400 per annum
 And the twenty pcr cent
 added to that makes it
 4480 The Secretary has received
 just the same increase of
 salary under that joint resolution
 as every other officer and
 employé of the two bodies
 Mr FESSENDEN What year was
 that Mr PEARCE Eighteen hundred
 and fifty four Mr FESSENDEN
 And it has been appro
 printed regularly ever since Mr
 PEARCE Yes sir it has
 been appropri ated regularly ever
 since Mr HALE If that
 is so I withdraw the
 amendment The bill was reported
 to the Senate as amended
 and the amendments were concurred
 in and or dered to
 be engrossed and the bill
 to be read a third
 time The bill was read
 the third time and passed

 OF REPRESENTATIVES FRIDAY February 1
 186 The House met at
 twelve o cloc k m
 Prayer b the Chaplain Rev
 THOMAS H STOCKTON The Journal
 of yesterday was read and
 approved KANSAS Mr CONWAY Mr
 Speaker 1 rise toa ques
 tion of privilege I observe
 by the reading of the
 Journal this morning that a
 resolution was of fered yesterday
 during my absence by the
 hon orable gentleman from Arkansas
 Mr HiNDMAN J that the
 Committee on the Judiciary be
 and they are hereby instructed
 to inquire whether Hon MARTIN
 F CONWAY claiming to represent
 the State of Kansas has
 been legally and consti tutionally
 elected a Representative to the
 Congress of the United States
 from said State and that
 said committee report by bill
 or otherwise As this the
 first time sir that my
 right to seat in thig
 House has been doubted and
 ag I went to the
 Speaker s desk and received
 the oath of office without
 object ion beincr made by
 any member I deem it
 due to me and so
 think the honorable gentleman from
 Arkansas will conceive it to
 be that he should inform
 the House of the reason
 which has prompted him to
 so extraordinary a proceeding Mr
 I IINDMAN Mr Speaker it
 affords me pleasure in reply
 to the honorable gentleman from
 Kansas to siate the reasons
 prompting me in i vhat
 he denominates so extraordinary a
 pro It is right that
 I should say here that
 ceeding I have been actuated
 by no intention of showing
 disrespect to the gentleman himself
 and by no feeling of
 hostility towards his State My
 object has been and is
 simply to discharge a public
 The Constitution of the United
 States in arti cle one
 section two provides that the
 House of Representatives shall be
 composed of members chosen every
 second year by the people
 of the several States That
 Constitution is binding upon every
 member here We have all
 sworn to support it and
 must in all things conform
 our In respect to repre
 action to its requirements sentation
 in this body it is
 our duty to see that
 no person not constitutionally eligible
 and duly elected is admitted
 to scat TV c are
 bound to exclude such as
 have not been chosen by
 the people of the several
 States The late Territory of
 Kansas was admitted into the
 Union as a State on
 last Monday I believe the
 28th ultimo So soon as
 she thus became a State
 the right to choose one
 member of this Houbc rested
 in her people Prior to
 that time they had no
 such right for thcy did
 not consti tute a State
 and under the clause of
 the Consti tution which I
 have just quoted none except
 States arc cntitled to choose
 Representatives to Congress The gentleman
 from Kansas was elected long
 before Kansas was admitted He
 was not elected by the
 people of State but by
 the people of a Territory
 i he question raised by
 the resolution I offered is
 whether such election is valid
 Can the act of admission
 go back in its effect
 to the ti me when
 the W yandotte constitution was
 adopted by the people of
 Kansas and constitute Kansas a
 State of the Union from
 that time on so what
 becomes of thc various offcial
 acts of ter ritorial officers
 and tho acts of the
 territorial jn diciary especially in
 the interi1Y1 All arc nulli
 lied On the other hand
 if the act of admission
 is not retroactive if its
 effcacy began only when it
 was passed and became a
 law and did not reach
 back to cover previous events
 then the election of the
 gentlernan was invalid and has
 no right to a seat
 in this House Mr GROVV
 I wish to say one
 word Mr HINDMAN Allow me
 for a moment more I
 am sir that there are
 numerous in stances whore Senators
 and Represen tatives chosen by
 Territories before ndtnissron as States
 have bccn allowed to take
 their seats but the fact
 those cases havc occurred does
 vot settle the ques tion
 of right It matters not
 what the precedents have been
 a bad practice ought not
 further to be pursued The
 question for us to decide
 is is a Territory entitled
 under the Constitution to clcct
 a Representativc to the Congress
 of the United States At
 thc time the gentleman from
 Kansas was elected Kansas beyond
 doubt was a tory That
 is the issue my resolution
 presents and it is the
 only one it was designed
 to raise Mr GROW I
 desire to call the attention
 of the gentleman from Arkansas
 to the case of his
 own State Her Representatives in
 Congress were first elected when
 she was in a territorial
 condition Mr RUST I Ie
 has admitted not denied that
 therc wcrc such cases Mr
 GROW l hcre were very
 many like cases Territories before
 their admission into the Union
 as States have herctoforc done
 all that was ne cessary
 for them to do to
 complete their State gov ernments
 Mr Butler Attorney General under
 General Jackson decided that before
 the admis Sion of a
 State it was necessary to
 have oreanized by the Territory
 So that this case is
 like all others thqt have
 occurred and in the case
 of Arkansas the very question
 was adjudicated Mr HINDMAN 1
 do not controvert the facts
 I am aware that in
 which the gentleman states the
 case of Arkansas and many
 others which I referred to
 awhile ago without specifying any
 particular one in the cases
 of California Ore gon and
 divers others such admission has
 been allowed of Representatives and
 Senators alike prior to the
 passage of the act but
 as I said be fore
 that precedent does not demonstrate
 its own rightfulness The question
 is ought the prece dent
 to have been set or
 ought it now to be
 fol lowed And this question
 is not to be decided
 by saying that such thihgs
 have been done hereto fore
 but it must be determined
 by inquiry into the foundation
 of such action Was it
 right And if right it
 ought w to be followed
 and if not it should
 bc set asidc Mr GROW
 I do not wish the
 gentleman to understand me as
 making any objection upon that
 ground I only stated the
 facts COMPROMISE RESOLUTIONS I design
 at the Mr KELLOGG of
 Illinois proper time and before
 the final vote is taken
 upon the resolut ions reported
 by the select committee of
 thirty three in relation to
 the disturbed state of the
 country to offer a resolution
 as a substitute I desire
 for those reported from that
 committee sir now to present
 it to the House that
 it may be printed to
 enable me to offer it
 at the proper time No
 objection being made the resolution
 was received and ordered to
 be printed Mr McCLERNAND 1

 Mr PENDLETON lask the unanimous

 to say that I had
 attempted to gct the floor
 for the pur pose of

 of the names signed to

 himself state d in his

 not believe any such petition
 had been circulaled in the
 city or rather that if
 circulated ten thousand names had
 not been signed to it
 He is a Republican and
 was inclined to disbelieve that
 any such petition had been
 so generally signed and yet
 I find his name attached
 to it of course he
 never signed it I know
 not whether the petition was
 got up in the same
 way that the poll lists
 in Kansas were by the

 remarks just made by the
 gen tleman from Ohio Mr
 GURLEY I will say that
 this comes from such a
 source as that I feel
 at liberty to take the
 personal responsibility of assuring the
 House that there is neither
 ohffis paper nor on a
 similar one which was presented
 to the Senate yesterday containing
 more than thirty eight thousand
 names a single name that
 was not signed by the
 party whose signature it purports
 to be kwould repeat that
 this petition is similar to
 onc that came from the
 city of New York having
 been almost universally signed by
 the electors of that city
 to tbe extent of at
 least for both petitions forty
 thousand names I ask that
 the petition be read Mr

 ask whether it is in
 order to offer petitions of
 this kind to day The
 SPEAKER If objection be made
 it can not be received
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 hope
 the gentle man from Ohio
 will not make objection at
 this point of the proceedings
 Mr CA REY If you
 please let me get through
 what I was Toing to
 say Mr JOHN CÖCHRANE Very
 well 1 agree to that
 Mr CARE Y The reason
 why I object is this
 I have received petitions of
 a similar character and as
 I understood that the rules
 did mot permit such petitions
 to bc presented except on
 Mon I see days I
 have so stated to my
 constituents now that these petitions
 are getting in regularly and
 when my constituents see that
 they will be surprised at
 my letter Now I shall
 object un less I am
 allowed to put in mine
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 the
 gentle man from Ohio will
 be permitted to introduce all
 the petitions on this subject
 that he and his con
 stituents desire and may he
 inform that constit that this
 I louse is becoming more
 lib uoncy sir eral and
 more patriotic just as the
 country is I hope this
 getting more and more in
 danger petition will be read
 Mr CARE Y i should
 not have made oujec tion
 if I were not placcd
 in an awkward position I
 withdraw my objection about it
 The SPEAKER If there be
 no objection the petition will
 be read Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois I object Tho SPEAKER

 Add the end of the
 amendment as follows Provided That
 no part of the sum
 hereby appropriated shall be drawn
 from the Preasury until after
 such conditions and regulations have
 been established by the President
 in reference to supplying coal
 under satd eontract and for
 the performance of all the
 provisions of the same as
 will fully protect the United
 States against the failure or
 incapacity of said Thompson or
 said Chiriqui Improvement Company to
 fulfill its stipulations Provided further
 That the United States shall
 acquire no right of sovereignty
 over any terri tory in
 the Republic of New Granada
 or Costa Rica nor any
 right to transport troops or
 munitions of war over such
 territory under or by virtue
 of the contract recited in
 this act unless the same
 be voluntarily consented to by
 said Republic The Senate amendment
 boing as follows To enable
 the Secretary of the Navy
 to carry out the conditional
 contract made by him with
 the Chiriqui Im provement Company
 and Arnbrose W Thompson on
 the 21st day of May
 1859 för the purpose of
 securing to the United States
 certain valuable privileges and rights
 speci fied in said contract
 and which said contract is
 hereby approved 300 000 On
 which Mr POTTLE was entitled
 to the floor Mr POTTLE
 I send up the following
 amend ment which I offer
 as an amendment to the
 amend ment proposed by the
 gentleman from Maine Provided further
 That no part of the
 sum hereby appro priated shall
 be paid until a railway
 shall have been pleted and
 put in operation upon the
 roadway narned in the said
 cunditi01 lal contract Mr Chairman
 after the remarks of my
 col league Mr SICKLES on
 yesterday in reference to the
 indorsement which this proposed appro
 priation had received from the
 Committee on Na val Affairs
 in this House at the
 last session I feel it
 to be but justice to
 nyself and to the House
 to make a few remarks
 upon this question Mr HARRIS
 ofMaryland to a ques tion
 of order I understood that
 when the com mittee rose
 yesterday the gentleman from New
 York Mr SICKLES was still
 entitled to tt e floor
 upon the ame nd mcn
 t of the gentleman from
 Ma ine The CHAIRMAN The
 time gentleman from New York
 Mr SICKLES had expired be
 fore the committee rose yesterday
 The gentle man from New
 York Mr POTTLE is entitled
 to the floor Mr POTTLE
 It is true Mr Chairman
 that at the last session
 of Congress a reoort was
 made by the committee of
 which I am a member
 sub stantially concurring in the
 propriety of making this appropriation
 But there was a tacit
 under standing in the mutter
 that there was great pro
 priety before the House should
 finally act upon the question
 of sending out a commission
 to ob tain some of
 the facts connected with the
 advant ages to be derived
 from this aporopriation to the
 Chiriqui Improvement Company Such a
 motion was subsequently made in
 the House and the cornmission
 sent We have before us
 at length the result of
 their labors I was one
 of those on the committee
 who gave my assent to
 a report in favor of
 this appropria and I deetn
 it but justice to myself
 to say that that consent
 was obtained from upon a
 state of facts totally different
 from the facts as they
 ap pear from the report
 of this commission And I
 feel bound after carefully reading
 this report to provide at
 least some guard by which
 the Gov ernment shall be
 put in a possible position
 of re ceivilV some advantage
 from this appropriation As it
 stands now without some such
 guard as this which I
 have offered by way of
 amendment I can scarcely conceive
 that the Government can ever
 derive any advantage whatever from
 tills appropriation of 300 000
 We have listened sir to
 the eloquent remarks of the
 gentleman from New York on
 the other side of the
 House Mr SICKLES in regard
 to the great advan tages
 to be derived by the
 Govern ment from the ratification
 of this contract We have
 had dare say all or
 nearly ali the poetry that
 can be brought to bear
 upon this subject But any
 member who will take the
 trouble to read this report
 cannot fail to come to
 the conclusion that if there
 is poetry connecæd with the
 matter there are also some
 stubborn facts io bc sur
 I mounted before we C
 n in justice to the
 Govern ment we represent make
 this appropriation My colleague has
 spoken at great length of
 the advantages to be derived
 from the construction of the
 railway and the benefits the
 Government would derive from the
 right of transit across the
 Isthmus At this point Mr
 Chairman my col league seems
 to have entirely overlooked one
 fact of which I beg
 the committec to take notice
 and that is that the
 contract entered into by the
 Sec retary of the Navy
 with this Chiriqui Improve ment
 Company has no reference whatever
 to a railway and that
 none by the terms of
 that con tract was contemplated
 That contract simply provides for
 the right of transit over
 a roadway and not over
 a railway And it is
 this misunder standing tvhich has
 been persistently kept beibre the
 House not only in the
 debates but in the report
 of the commission which was
 sent out to make surveys
 in regard to this roadway
 By looking at their report
 you will sce that there
 is not a word or
 syllable in it about a
 roadway but the whole of
 these surveys have been made
 to establish the practicability of
 transit by railway All these
 reports set forth the great
 advantages to be derived by
 ihe Government if the right
 of transit by r ailway
 is secured Now that may
 be perfectly sure of being
 understood upon this point I
 beg leave to call the
 attention of the House to
 the contract made by the
 Secretary of the Navy with
 the Chiriqui Improvement Company It
 commences This indenture rnade this
 21st day of May A
 D 1859 between the United
 States acting by and through
 Isaac Touccy Secretary of the
 Navy of the United States
 of the first part and
 the Chiriqui Improvement Company and
 Ambrose W Thompson of the
 second part witnesseth That whereas
 the said Chiriqui Improvement Company
 and the said Thompson have
 become possessed of certain grant
 concessions privileges rights and properties
 at the Isthmus of ana
 in the province of Cliiriqui
 in the Republic of New
 Granada as appears by the
 original titles thereto copies of
 which ar_e hereto appended and
 whereas it is desirable that
 the United States on the
 one part should have the
 right of transit over the
 roadway granted direct to said
 Ambrosc W Thompson through said
 province c Over the roadway
 Now sir the papers which
 are printed with this contract
 contain among them a certified
 copy of the ordinance issued
 by tl 1C provincial Legislature
 of Chiriqui in 1854 granting
 the exclusive privilege of making
 im provcnlents c over the
 provincial road from David to
 the Chiriqui lagoon The copy
 of this ordinance is properly
 certified by the Granadian legation
 in the United States I
 do not propose to waste
 time upon this point because
 the whole ground was covered
 by the able argument made
 yesterday by the gentleman from
 Missouri Mr PHELPS I simply
 wish to call the attention
 of the House not to
 the fact that the Chiriqui
 Com pany had never obtained
 a right of railway th
 rough the province of Chiriqui
 but to the fäct that
 whether they have or not
 the contract made by the
 Secretary of the Navy with
 this Chiriqui Company imposes no
 obligation upon the com pan
 y to build a railroad
 It is simply a contract
 for the right of transit
 over a G roadway well
 sir what are the advantages
 that the Uni ted States
 arc to derive in return
 for this 300 000 They
 are stated in the contract
 to which have just referred
 The first is the right
 of transitovet this roadway second
 that the United States are
 to have the right to
 land not to exceed five
 thou sand acres at each
 end of the route for
 the pur poses ofa coal
 depot third they are to
 have the right to purchase
 of the company whatever coal
 t hey may need for
 naval purposes at the ordinary
 market price or to use
 the language of the con
 tract on payment of one
 dime per ton to the
 pro vinciai authorities of Chiriqui
 and the cost of excavation
 and transportation Sir let us
 look at these advantages for
 which it is proposed to
 pay 300 000 and I
 beg leave 10 lake them
 up not in the order
 in which they are named
 in the contract but to
 reserve for the last the
 provision in regard to the
 right of transit over the
 roadway or railway whichever way
 it ma_y be First in
 regard to the advantages to
 be derived from this grant
 often thousand acres of land
 The impression which has generally
 obtained amonc r members as
 evidenced by the debates in
 reference to it appears to
 be that the land selected
 for coal de Ots is
 to cover any conceivable amount
 of coal his is clearly
 an error forl take it
 upon my self to say
 that if év e are
 to be guided by the
 re 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 port of the Chiriqui commission
 not one bushel of coal
 will be found upon the
 lands selected for tbe purpose
 of a coal depot The
 grants to the Government were
 merely for the purposc of
 es tablishing coal depots rl
 he contract contemplates that the
 Government shall purchase its coal
 from the Chiriqui Improvement Company
 what ever company shall work
 the mines To show that
 I am not mistaken in
 reference to this matter I
 will read a portion of
 the report of Captain Engle
 He says To Frenchtnan s
 creek from Boca dei nrago
 is forty two miles You
 pass through the Boca del
 Tigre a finc wide open
 channel which only requires a
 fort on Water cay to
 command it and a light
 Or navigators to clear the
 Tigre breaker as well as
 lör a point to deiermine
 the course to be steered
 through the shoals to the
 southward of it Then you
 have twenty Illiles of slnooth
 harbor surface to steam before
 reaching Frenchman creek the now
 pro posed terminus of tbe
 road which would increase the
 steaming distance fY0in any of
 our ports via Cape San
 An tonio thirty miles cach
 way Examine the line for
 Shep herd s harbor Boca
 del Drago has Columbus island
 on its east and the
 main on its west On
 entering the channel you make
 a sharp angular turn and
 head Or the inain wlicre
 there should be a fort
 from this point you have
 two raking fires which no
 ship or ships can stand
 for you have to face
 the nuzzle to a distance
 of fitty yards then broad
 side and then stern to
 Near this point must be
 the great depot for the
 coal from the mines which
 must be brought there for
 shipment It is the most
 available point the dis tance
 to Chauguinola is six rni
 es Thus sir your five
 thousand acres when lo cated
 for the purpose of coal
 depots will still be six
 miles from the coal mines
 Those mines are entirely outsidc
 of any of the lands
 which will belong to the
 Government But I do not
 consider this very objectionable for
 if theGovernment had the right
 to locate their lands where
 coal abounds I am not
 of the opinion that the
 Government would gain anything by
 min I think if the
 Government mined incr its own
 coal its own coal that
 it would cost twice as
 much and it may be
 four times as much as
 if it were pur in
 open market However that may
 be still it is true
 there are no coal mines
 upon the land to belong
 to the Government and the
 Gov ernment will therefore be
 compelled to purchase tbe coal
 that it may need On
 this question of coal I
 beg now to call atlention
 to the fourth provision of
 the contract made between the
 Secretary of the Navy and
 A W Thompson the Chiriqui
 Improvement Company It is as
 follows 4 The United States
 shall have the right and
 the same is hereby conveyed
 to all coal for naval
 purposes at or near the
 point selected for coal depots
 and naval stations as ataresaid
 but if coal shall bc
 mund of superior quality fur
 stealli purposes in other places
 than thosc so selected then
 t hc United States shall
 have the right and the
 e atnc is hereby conveyed
 to use the same subject
 only to the tax of
 one dime per ton as
 provided to be paid to
 the pro vincial authorities of
 Chiriqui in the grant aforesaid
 and the cost of mining
 and delivering the same There
 is a good deal of
 verbiage here but when inembers
 Yet at the straiffhtforward meaning
 of that provision it will
 I think be found to
 be this that the Government
 of the United States shall
 pay 300 000 for tho
 privilege of purchasing coal of
 this company at tho same
 rate as all others who
 may want it Therefore the
 professed advant ages under this
 provision of the contract really
 amount to nothing It is
 so plain a thing that
 there is hardly any excuse
 for me to waste more
 words upon it Mr CAMPBELL
 1 hope the gentleman from
 New York will permit me
 to put a question to
 him in reference to the
 point on vhich he is
 now commenting Mr POTTLE 1
 yield for that purpose Mr
 CAMPBELL Was there any evidence
 before the Committee on Naval
 Affairs going to show that
 the coal in the neighborhood
 of the proposed naval depots
 of the Government is prop
 er and fit for the
 use of the United States
 steam marine If there be
 any evidence what is it
 Mr POTTLE Thcrc was very
 little evidence before the committee
 on any subject and what
 we had was rather a
 matter of faith e the
 evi dence of things unseen
 and the substance of things
 It is proper f should
 Laugh ter hoped for say
 another word for I want
 to do justice to all
 In reference to the coal
 found parties concerned in Chiriqui
 the report of the commission
 would that if it exists
 there there is no necessity
 for the Government of the
 United States paying a bonus
 for the right to purchase
 coal from this company upon
 the same terms all others
 can purchase it namely at
 the market price That is
 my point and it cannot
 be successfully refuted Mr MORSE
 I ask to state a
 piece of evi dencc upon
 which the committee relies Mr
 POTTLE 1 cannot yield to
 an argument but I will
 to a question Mr MORSE
 I ask the gentleman then
 whether Lieutenant Morton and the
 chief engi neer of the
 expedition do not report that
 they tried the coal and
 found it of good quality
 for the use of the
 United States steam marine Mr
 POTTLE I recollect very well
 that there was some evidence
 in reference to this Chiriqui
 coal before the committee but
 it was of an insuf
 ficient and unsatisfactory character In
 order however not to do
 injustice to the Chiriqui Im
 provement Company I have already
 stated that the report of
 the expedition appeared to show
 that there wyas an abundance
 of coal of good quality
 to be found on the
 Atlantic side of the Isthmus
 Mr CAMPBELL lunderstand the gentleman
 from New York to say
 further that the contem plated
 purchase us no right to
 mine coal there for our
 own use Mr POTTLE Yes
 sir and 1 have read
 that portion of the report
 of Captain Engle which shows
 that the nearest coal is
 SLX tnilcs from where the
 depot will have to be
 located Now sir I pass
 from that point to another
 to which I ask the
 attention of the House I
 mean the advantacres to be
 derived by the Government as
 stated in the contract by
 the right of transit over
 the roadway of said company
 In order that we may
 understand exactly whatkind of right
 it is I will read
 from the contract First The
 United States for thc consideration
 herein after named shall have
 and enjoy a right of
 way or transit over said
 road which is hereby granted
 to them by the party
 Lhe second part free froun
 all tolls or taxes upon
 offl cers aaent s seamen
 landsmen mails munitions stores troops
 or any direct property of
 tbc United States which the
 Government thereof Inay transport or
 cause to bc trans portcd
 over thc sai l road
 during the continuance of the
 present grant made by the
 said provincc of Chiriqui to
 the said Arnbrose W Thompson
 If we are dealing with
 the Chiriqui Improve ment Company
 in reference to t11C of
 travel over that old provincial
 road then it is hardly
 necessary for us to pay
 300 000 for that right
 because we can have it
 as well without Travel over
 that road if it shall
 over bc improved would be
 quite as much for tho
 interest of the cornpany as
 to any one else and
 they would doubtless be glad
 to have this and all
 other Governments cxcrcisc the right
 of using that road and
 thus afford a chance for
 the settlement and improvement of
 the lands of the company
 if howevcr it bc contended
 that the grant to the
 Chiriqui Improvement Company gives it
 a right to construct a
 railway over that road and
 that it is proposed to
 give the Government of the
 United States the benefit of
 transit on that rail way
 when constructed then we must
 look at thc rights of
 this company as set forth
 in their grant from Costa
 Rica First is itin a
 position to grant such aright
 to us and secondly If
 it is then is the
 route one upon which the
 company could construct a railway
 for the transportation of freight
 The first point can be
 disposed of briefly will read
 the language of the grant
 from Costa Rica to this
 company articles fourteen and eighteen
 which are us follows ART
 14 The grantees shall not
 at any tune be permit
 ted to disenibark or transport
 Ilor consent to the transport
 ation or disembarkation at any
 tilne whatsoever across the rai
 road of troops arrns rnunitions
 of war belonging to any
 foreign Governrnent or to individuals
 or private socicties conipauies The
 Republic of Costa Rica only
 shall possess this right The
 infraction of this article by
 the grantees their agents or
 those charged with the direction
 and admin istration of the
 enterprise shall forthwith work as
 a com plete nullity and
 forfeiture of the presentcontract in
 all and every one of
 its parts and the confiscation
 not only of such arms
 and munitions of war but
 also of the railroad and
 all its works and fixtures
 ART 18 Tile grantees at
 110 time shall be at
 liberty under penalty f fortöiting
 the privileges of this con
 tract to transfer or to
 cede to any fbreign Government
 the grant of concessiDns and
 priviieges Inade to heul by
 virtue of the present contract
 Thus we see the moment
 Congress ratifies the seem to
 establish the fact that there
 is abundance of coal on
 the Atlantic side of the
 Isthmus and contract between the
 Secretary of t he Navy
 and mako Ambrose W Thompson
 for this company that of
 good quality for shipping purposes
 very moment the grant of
 Costa Rica is forfeited no
 point on that part of
 the case The point f
 make is not that coal
 does not exist there but
 and the rights Of the
 Chiriqui Improvement Com pany a
 re lost togeth éiwith the
 300 0jO Which we had
 appropriated Thére Cin be no
 mistake ih It is perfectly
 regard to this point look
 at the grant as you
 will Costa Rica bas hot
 yielded the privilege of transporting
 troops land munitiöns of war
 No such privilege was con
 ferred upon this company and
 if it confer that power
 upon any foreign Government then
 its grant will become ut
 terly hull and void And
 yet we are grayely considering
 Whether we had not better
 in the present condition of
 the Treasury authorize the payment
 of 300 000 with a
 perfect certainty that by so
 doing we destio y the
 grant and the further certainty
 of the u ttér impossibility
 of the Chiriqui company carrying
 out its contract with this
 Government If there is still
 doubt on this point I
 bég leave to refer to
 the amendment now pending offered
 by the honorable chairman if
 the Committee On Naval Affairs
 which in terms provides that
 we shall have no right
 to use this accofding to
 the terms of the contract
 wliich we ate asked to
 tat ify namely for the
 purpoSe of transporting troops and
 munitions of war in oxthér
 words that shall have no
 right to use it for
 üny of the pur poses
 for which it vvas obtained
 until we first puh chase
 that right from the Government
 of Costa Rica Now it
 seems to me that the
 honorable chairman of the committee
 leaves off just where we
 should begin that if we
 are to obtain this right
 from that Government we should
 devote our money to the
 purchase of a right which
 we can rely upon There
 is little doubt butthat this
 Chir iqui company if it
 ever builds a road will
 accept any freight wllich may
 be offered which they are
 at liberty under this grant
 to transport Mr SHERMAN 1
 would like to ask thegen
 tleman a single que ion
 Suppose we grant this 300
 000 to Thompson and he
 should put it in his
 pocket what redress have we
 I have just Mr POTTLE
 None whatever stated there was
 no provision in this contract
 binding the Chiriqui company to
 build thiss road and their
 transfer to us ofa portion
 of their grant from Costa
 Rica would effectually prevent them
 from fulfilling any of the
 provisions of their con tract
 We have thc facts before
 our eyes and it was
 to that end that sent
 up my amendment I wanted
 to know whether the Governmentof
 Costa Rica would consent to
 this al rangement and 1
 wanted to know whether it
 was a roadway Or a
 railway intended by this contract
 and whether it I think
 it would be a railway
 vv hen it was built
 will bo ample time to
 vote this 300 000 froin
 the Treasury in the present
 condition of the country to
 pay for these privileges when
 it is ascertained that we
 arc to derive benefits worth
 paying for I have devoted
 too much time to this
 point I now proceed to
 another point the right to
 the use of the harbors
 c I read from that
 portion of the contract as
 follows And the further right
 to use as harbors the
 waters gulfs bays or lagoons
 sheltered or partially surrounded by
 the lartds of the said
 Thompson or the said Improve
 ment Company Sir is it
 possible that the House of
 Represent ativcs can gravely sit
 here and debate the question
 whether the waters of the
 ocean or gulfs are mat
 ters granted to the Chiriqui
 company or whether it can
 grant them to us Is
 there a possibility under the
 laws of nations that this
 company could have any right
 whatever to transfin these If
 there is no privileges to
 the United States possibility why
 was it put into the
 contract ex cept to mislead
 us as to the benefits
 under this It could have
 been put there for no
 contract other purpose The Secretary
 when he made this condition
 must have made it with
 a knowl edge that such
 rights were not the subjects
 of transfer Sir allow me
 to recapitulate the points I
 have endeavored to keep in
 view first the coal grant
 is simply nothing second the
 right to transport troops and
 munitions of war c is
 cut off by the very
 terms of the grant from
 Costa Rica third the sale
 to us of harbor rights
 is void by the law
 of nations and ought not
 to have been embraced in
 the contract Then we come
 down to the fourth considera
 tion left upon which this
 300 000 is to be
 paid and that is the
 possible benefits to result from
 the construction of this railroad
 I do not kriox v
 what my colleague over the
 way meaos when he says
 that inasmuch as we have
 sent out this com mission
 We are goöd Faith tb
 i atify 694 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 1 this contract
 I suppose that the sole
 object for ihiCh that commission
 was sent svas to ascertain
 whether the matter was practicable
 or important before we should
 ratify the contract Its object
 Was to see whether we
 should receive any ad Vantage
 from a ratification of tliß
 contract The contract was one
 which was made to depend
 upon its ratification by Congress
 and the only means Congress
 had to obtain information upon
 the sub ject was to
 send a commission there to
 make a survey and reportits
 conclusions Congress with held its
 judgment until that report came
 in and upon the facts
 thus furnished It will decide
 this question It is simply
 a matter of policy and
 not a question of good
 faith My colleague says that
 thlsconfmission has established beyond ques
 tion the practiCability of this
 route It may be but
 before that shall pass out
 of the mind of the
 committee I desire to call
 their attention to two or
 three important facts bearing upon
 this the only remaining branch
 of the subject to which
 I have already said in
 refer I intend to speak
 ence to the grant fi
 om the Government of Gra
 nada there nQ railroad contemplated
 therein It simply contains a
 right to improve an old
 pro vincial road I have
 shown that the only right
 to build a railroad is
 that which has been derived
 since OUi last session from
 Costa Rica and if you
 will look into that you
 will find that the grant
 Itself onky extends through a
 period of six ty years
 and that it is made
 to depend upon a provso
 that this road shall be
 built and put into operation
 with locomotives upon it within
 six years from last July
 A failure in this respect
 works a for feiture of
 the grant and there is
 a further condi tion that
 no part of that grant
 shall be trans ferred a
 transfer to work a forfeiture
 of au thc privileges therein
 named Now when tbc committee
 shall have sur mounted all
 these difhcult ies when they
 shall have become satisfied that
 this Chiriqui cmnpany will and
 can build this road within
 five years froin July when
 they shall be satisfied that
 they can inducc the Government
 ofCosta Rica to forego a
 forfeiture by rcason of the
 transfin of a portion of
 this grant to a I
 that thcy will still turn
 back with me for a
 nu ment and look at
 the practicability of the con
 struction of this road as
 established by this Stit vcy
 I do not say but
 that the report shows the
 construction of this road to
 be entirely practicable but I
 say this and bog the
 House to notc it that
 this report shows most conclusively
 that in vari ous places
 and in one instance for
 a distance of six and
 a half miles you cannot
 reduce the grade be10 i
 two hundred and seventy feet
 to the mile unless by
 turmeling through granite rock for
 a diStance of four and
 a half mites Unless you
 rc sortto tunneling tho averacre
 grade of the road is
 from two hundred and scveniy
 to three hundred feet per
 mile And tl his grade
 can only be ob tained
 by doubling or running back
 and A straight track would
 give a crrade of five
 hundred feet per mile T
 hc report sfiows that there
 is no chancc to lower
 the grade by increasing the
 length of the road I
 put the question to the
 very intelligent cn gineer who
 Inade this survey if he
 kneq r of a single
 road either in this country
 or Europe that was working
 upon such a grade And
 I under stood him to
 say he did not but
 he belioved that the working
 of such a road was
 practicable do not know but
 it is I do not
 put my opinion against the
 opinions of the gentlemen who
 make this report but put
 their opinions acrainst the practicc
 of the whole world and
 therefore 1 have added to
 the amendment of the chairman
 of the Committee on Naval
 Affairs a proviso to make
 sure that the experiment of
 overcominrr such grades shall be
 a successful one To show
 that I am not mistaken
 in regard to this thing
 the House will indulge me
 while I refer to the
 report because I desire to
 do justice to all parties
 in reference t o this
 matter The gentleman who had
 charge of this commission makes
 the point very strangely it
 appears to me that one
 of the grounds of the
 practicability of thiswroad is that
 there are some capital places
 for building forts and fortifications
 there And hc starts out
 at page 23 of this
 report as follows T hc
 mnuncr in which such road
 supposing it to be completed
 and its harbors fortified and
 garrisoned w ould add to
 the defensive strength of the
 United States and in crease
 the cohesion between its Pacific
 and eastern divis ions and
 the fzcilities för aggre ive
 warfare in either hemisphere that
 it would afford them and
 the general con trol over
 the entire western continent which
 they would be in a
 position to acquire are pOints
 which bear on the question
 of practicability It may be
 so f do not know
 how extensive If we are
 to buy the whole right
 this thing is of aggressive
 warfare and the entire control
 of the western continent with
 all the other advant ages
 of the Chiriqui company for
 300 000 I should consider
 it exceedingly cheap when we
 have fairly entered upon that
 kind of speculation But when
 our own Government is breaking
 under our feet and when
 the Treasury is bankrupt I
 submit Mr Chairman that these
 dreams are a little wild
 in regard to buying all
 the rest of crea tion
 unless we buy it for
 the purpose of moving out
 of this country into another
 Now sir in regard to
 the grade I shall dis
 miss from the di écussion
 this question of forts and
 fortifications I am unable to
 see how the ques tion
 of fortifications and of aggressivc
 warfare has anything to do
 vith the matter of grades
 and shall therefore procccd at
 onco to consider the character
 of the country through which
 this rail road is proposed
 to be built I read
 again from pages 6 and
 7 in the report In
 attempting to im part a
 general idea of the topograph
 ical features of tbc country
 I find it contributes to
 perspi i cuity to mingle
 with the description some theoretical
 views in regard to its
 fonnation It would 9ppear that
 at an epoch not very
 remote geologically speaking tbc chain
 of Inountains which forms the
 backbone of this point of
 Cen tral America was upheaved
 froin bcnaath tho water level
 and that the Isthmus of
 Cbiriqui at first consisted sirnply
 of tho great longitudinal ridge
 with its offshoots or spurs
 whose rocky sides rose out
 of the sea with no
 interveninø plain or swamp between
 their base and doep water
 central ridge has agencral direction
 of nearly east and west
 it seenis to bc formed
 of a succcssion of cones
 or peaks ft onu cach
 01 which radiate spu rs
 likewise furnished with their secondary
 offshoots IVhere these interitre witliO
 ach ot ber there results
 a complication of ravines and
 preci pices that defies description
 but at two or three
 points the systeln arranged with
 sonjc regularity aud thc country
 though wild not itnpracticable ridges
 are through out exceedingly sharp
 on those of the niain
 spurs there is seldmn more
 roorn than is needed fur
 The double track of a
 railroad svllile on the secondary
 ones there often hardly width
 cnougll for a pathway för
 Oot travelers I cite this
 ME Chairman for the purpose
 of showing the utter impossibility
 as appears the report of
 getting over the difficulty of
 these grades by increasing the
 length of your track You
 must either takc these grades
 as you find them on
 thc survey or you rn
 ust tunnel througl z the
 naoun tain or abandon the
 railroad scheme 1 hcre is
 no way to avoid hcsc
 lifiicultics Mr ALDRICH May ask
 a Mr POTTLE Mr ALDRICH
 The yesterday that the gentleman
 from Minnesota was out of
 I rise for the purpose
 of inquiring if it is
 i n order for the
 Chair to read vv hi
 e the gentleman from Newp
 York is addressing the committee
 The CHAIRMAN The Chair thinks
 it cer tainly is The
 gentleman from New York will
 Mr POTTLE ff gentleman from
 Min nesota will give mo
 his attention I will checrful
 y excuse the inattention of
 lhc Chair We have at
 the very starting point on
 the Pa cific side from
 twelve to twenty miles where
 the land is nacre oozy
 mud There the track would
 have to be on piles
 and any one who is
 even slightly acquainted with railroad
 opera tions knows how expensive
 such a track would be
 Passing from that the report
 says Froin this point the
 savanna has a natural average
 as cent of a bundred
 and ninety five foet to
 thc mile for threc and
 a quarter rnilcs namely to
 the stone wall bounding Dorl
 Lorenzo s larid marked station
 eight on the profile between
 the latter point and Illc
 hacienda anothcr distance of three
 and a qnm ter miles
 if the brink of the
 Caldera canon is I fölEowcd
 the rise is two hundred
 and sixty two feet per
 mile from the hacienda the
 line Wii be laid along
 the con tinuation of the
 savanna at the base of
 the volcano cross ing a
 ravine in its course a
 distance of four and a
 halt miles when it arrivcs
 opposite the foot of fhe
 valley which descends on the
 opposite side of the Caldera
 cation from the pass the
 grade on this division is
 a hundred and t orty
 two it et per Inilc
 It should be retnarked that
 as a higller level is
 reached on the savannas they
 becomc more undu lating and
 broken and t heir declivity
 the lesser grade on the
 last rneutioncd part of the
 line heinrr due to the
 fact of the savanna being
 crossed obliquely to its great
 est slope and rather in
 a trailsverse than longitudinal direc
 tion I herc is however
 no doubt as to the
 practicability of laying a track
 on any part of the
 savannas or in regard to
 the line reaching the Caldera
 crossint without any un tt
 sual dißicu tics the steepness
 of the grade between sta
 tion eight and the hacienda
 cannot bc avoided on account
 of the savanna being confined
 within the two cafions so
 as to prevent a development
 of the line but this
 grade is not higher than
 others which are etiually necOssit
 ted beyond and which it
 will be seen are to
 be regarded as not excess
 ive or beyond the limits
 of advantageous working From the
 Ia å mentioned station the
 line has to be crossed
 over the Caldera canon on
 a trestle work viaduct it
 then enters the valley at
 whose head is the pass
 and can not ascend to
 the latter on an average
 grade Icss than that of
 the axis of the valley
 which is two hundred and
 ninety one feet per mile
 uuless resort is had to
 some other expe dient to
 gain length of line than
 any geueraliy used in rafl
 roading Winding up the surnmit
 on ordinary grades is almost
 prccluded on account of the
 declivity not only JekylPs river
 which drains the valley but
 of all the streams in
 the tract between the canon
 and the summit being greater
 than the limit of such
 grades As this difficulty is
 n net with in a
 much greater degree beyond the
 summit in thc tract which
 is conrprenended between the watershed
 and the linc parallel to
 it ånd about twelve miles
 fron l it it will
 be well to discuss it
 in connection with both these
 portions of the road For
 the present it will suffice
 to state that the track
 on this the upper six
 and a half miles of
 the Pacific slope can be
 located on a grade of
 not over two hutldt ed
 and ninety feet to the
 1Mife and that such grade
 will con forrn to the
 higher grades on the other
 slope so that the same
 enøincs and trains can be
 worked without chan es over
 thc coutiguous portions of both
 slopes and that as it
 can be shown that sueh
 grade is within the limits
 of prac ticabillty and profitable
 working there is no necessity
 for rcsortin to any expediel
 ts much less unusual ones
 Or of doubtful advantage to
 gain length of line in
 order to dimin ish thc
 grade Here is a grade
 unknown to modern railroads which
 cannot possibly be avoided but
 it is stated in the
 report that there are other
 grades much higher The idea
 of building a road with
 such grades as a freight
 road I regard as the
 veriest cbimcra of the brain
 Yet the engineer says that
 that is nothing to the
 next grade and that he
 is to be considered as
 practicable and says within the
 line of advantageous working Well
 we will pass on from
 this What next There is
 a remarkable traasition between the
 upper por tion of the
 Pacific slope which subsides in
 the pass to a dead
 level and the contiouous part
 of the Atlantic slope The
 strearn which flows into Chiriqui
 lagoon aut of the swamp
 at the summit descends at
 first with a declivity which
 averages one thousand and fifty
 five feet per mile and
 nceting the chief branch of
 the Culebra continues down to
 the fbvks of that river
 with an average fall of
 three hun dred and Orty
 seven feet to the mile
 the whole descent in seven
 and a quarter miles being
 Our thousand two hun dred
 and nine fcct or five
 hundred and eighty feet per
 milo on an average on
 the shortest natural valley line
 between In this tract of
 country it would the sannni
 and the forks probably bc
 ncceesary in order to locate
 a linc of ordinary grade
 sav not over one hu
 n d red and eiaht
 y feet f o the
 mile to resort io the
 expedient which was originally I
 believe practiced by Mr Latrobc
 on the temporary track first
 laid on tho Balthnore and
 Ohio railroad namely of I
 he chief diflieulty of the
 linc on the sides of
 the valley this plan lics
 at the turns wherc it
 is proposed by European eurriuecrs
 to tunnel into the side
 slope on a short curve
 which sbail bring out the
 track at a higher level
 than it cntered Here the
 hammer fell Mr STANTON I
 may desire to say a
 word or two in regard
 to this subject before it
 is dis posed of but
 in the absence o the
 chairman of the special committcc
 of thirty three I desire
 now for the benefit of
 some gentlemen who wish to
 speak to the special order
 to day to move that
 the com mittec rise Mr
 POTTLE Will the gentleman way
 to me for a few
 minutes that I may conclude
 my remarks Mr STANTON Certainly
 Mr POTTLE 1 not trespass
 on the pa tience of
 the I louse more than
 a few minutes was entirely
 unaware of the length of
 time I had consurned by
 these rambling remarks I wish
 in conclusion to say that
 I had not reached the
 tunnel through the mountain of
 i QCk of four and
 a half miles I had
 just begun to con sider
 the difficulty of the grades
 w hon my time expired
 But I shall leave all
 this to be consid ered
 as I know it will
 be by those who ate
 much more competent to present
 these facts to tho House
 What I wish to say
 in conclusion is this and
 only this I have no
 disposition to do injus tice
 to this Ch iriqui company
 or to any person con
 cerned in this contract and
 still less have I as
 a Representative of this Government
 any disposi tion to do
 injustice to the Government whose
 in tcrests are in part
 placed in my charge lieve
 this railroad to be utterly
 Impracticable if tberc were any
 grant for it and I
 do not believe there isagrant
 and if there be a
 grant and if the road
 be practicab e I know
 that thc very tcrms of
 the grant preclude the transferring
 of any of its privileges
 to others I hope sir
 thåt however may différ on
 the general merits of this
 ease with the committee or
 the House when this ques
 tion shall come into the
 House members will at least
 feel disl osed to sustain
 the reasonable pra viso which
 have attached as an amendment
 to 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 the end that we shall
 have some of these benefits
 before we pay out this
 300 000 W c should
 10t make haste 10 pay
 to this Chiriqui company from
 an exhausted l reasury 300
 000 and leave it to
 them as a mere point
 othonor whether they will make
 any return to us for
 the money Mr STANTON 1
 understand the gentleman from Texas

 of enabling them to do
 so I move that the

 the Federal Union was the
 fruit of the experience furnished
 by the Articles of Confederation
 The Federal Constitution is the
 record of the contract entered
 into by the peo ple
 of the Unitcd States for
 purpose of mutual interest and
 domestic tranquillity This our matchless
 system of Governme t was
 established at much cost and
 large sacrifice It has come
 down to us baptized in
 the blood of our revolutionary
 ancestors and is associated with
 the proudest memories that belong
 to our history It has
 withstood the corroding touch of
 years the assaults of faction
 and the shock of war
 Mut uai interests and mutual
 obligations are the main pillars
 of the edifice and these
 will transmit it unimpaired to
 our latest postcrity It cannot
 expire until the power that
 breathed vital ity into its
 checks and balances is annihilated
 which was the American people
 The echoes of the thunder
 of the revolu tionary battle
 fields have not yet died
 away and tbc solemn pledges
 of life and fortunc and
 sacred honor to its mainte
 nance still whisper their inspiration
 Its author ity continues to
 be supreme on all subjects
 within the sphere of its
 jurisd iction and the range
 of its oranted powers it
 craves permission from no which
 will leave scarcq two in

 thing p össiblC sl i0iit
 Of arch y is the

 that the aet of secession

 that lerefore the laws and
 Constitåtidn of United States are
 no longer operative within her
 I im its I will
 not argue the entire insufbcicncy
 of An y plea for
 secession as a matter of
 constitutiondl right The concurring judgment
 df the great men who
 framed our institutions and illustrated
 thenar in lives of honorable
 uséfulness has pronounced its utter
 insuficiency Wa hington åhd Madisoh

 W Obster all denied any
 such right or remedy They

 the offspring of the popcilsu

 Constitu tion they enumerated its
 powers and they defined its
 authority It contains within itself
 the means of self protection
 and the power of decision
 on all controverted points subject
 like all popular Governments to

 which engages us goes to
 the very foundations of our
 political system and necessarily subordinates

 It involves the dissoluti01 and

 which requires an appeal to

 the present will guar_anty us
 no indemnity for the future
 The civilized world our own
 self respect our Fros perity
 and future stability are all
 interested in that preliminary question
 Assert your nation ality and
 Ict the Government show itself
 strong enough to resist insurrection
 at home as well defe
 nd itself against aggression frorn
 abroad Do these thiiogs as
 it is your sworn duty
 to do and I will
 meet the loyal men of
 the South in theif pro
 posed measures of adjustment fully
 half way To disloyal men
 have no terms Compromise to
 Offer They advance and I
 will not humiliate myself tö
 that degree They have richly
 earned Nth8 hälter and the
 gibbet and if they ever
 receive tbéir deserts they will
 be pun ished with the
 utmost rigor of the law
 It is far from my
 purpose to increase theirriiation pfevailing
 here and elsewhere It is
 not befitting the dignity of
 the argument nor the place
 in which I am privileged
 to speak Much of the
 peril which surrounds us grows
 out of exasperated feeling and
 while insisting Oh the maintenance
 of Fed eral authority and
 the enforcement of Federal laws
 I seek to inculcate moderation
 and to in vite the
 States and people who continue
 loyal to théir constitutional duties
 to measures of concil iation
 and peace The stubborn fact
 confronts us that disaffection is
 rapidly spreading in the border
 slave States and threatens to
 overwhelm otherwise loyal communities The
 practical ques tion regardless of
 inquiries into the causes of
 dif ficulty comes home to
 every public man who is
 charged with responsibility whether anything
 can and ought to be
 done and that speedily to
 stay the tide of rebellion
 and check the current of
 treason by strengthening the hands
 and nerv ing the hearts
 of the true and loyal
 men in those States The
 importancc of meeting this inquiry
 in a spirit of fairness
 and conciliation cannot be exaggerated
 On its decision may depend
 the destinies of the Republic
 On this subject my views
 have been formed with some
 deliberation and I cxprcss them
 with diffdenc e They differ
 in some respects from those
 held by political associates for
 whom per sonallyel have regard
 and for whose opinions I
 cherish respect The distmguished Senator
 from New York Mr SEWARD
 in his late able speech
 said with emphasis and propriety
 Republicanism De mocracy and every
 other political name orthing are
 all subordinate and ought to
 disappear in thc presence of
 the great question of the
 Union This counsel may be
 pondered with profit by such
 partisans as place party platforms
 above If I were disposed
 to treat constitutional duties this
 discussion simply in the way
 of partisan ship I would
 counsel an acquiescence in the
 policy here indicated for am
 persuaded that the people at
 large of all party attachments
 who have to bear the
 brunt of the distractions in
 the country who will be
 expected to carry thc musket
 in casc of actual collision
 and who are now unable
 to find employment for their
 willing hands will not hold
 that political party and those
 public njcn guiltless who arc
 obstinately bent on defeat ing
 all Peace hath her vic
 measures of adjustment tories no
 less renowned than war and
 if revo lution and civil
 vvar are indeed at our
 very doors let them not
 be precipitated ui on us
 until t he con viction
 is clear and justified before
 God and the civilized world
 that the necessity for it
 is inevi table Then our
 people will rneet it with
 reso lution and firmness as
 our fathers met the clash
 of resounding arms in the
 days that tried men s
 souls as in a furnace
 of consuming fire In that
 dread extremity those who bluster
 loudest now will prove themselves
 arrant cowards The brag gart
 will neither shoulder a musket
 nor wield a sword The
 Duke of Wellington in justification
 of the concessions which he
 was willing at one pe
 riod of his eventful lifö
 to make in order to
 avoid intestine cornmotions said If
 could avoid by any sacrifice
 whatever civil war in the
 coun try to which I
 am attached I would give
 my These noble sentiments commend
 them selves to truly brave
 men in this emergency n
 my jv dcrment the Republican
 party can well afford to
 meet the propositions submilted to
 this Congress bv the border
 State rnembers in a lib
 eral and conciliatory spirit These
 States are IXheir Representatives in
 good Union loving part are
 endeavoring by every honorable appli
 ance to resist the aims
 and purposes of the se
 cession movement They are loyål
 to the Con stitution and
 they are faithful to the
 Union Will we who represent
 the great North encour age
 them to stand by their
 present proud though critical position
 or will we by indifference
 if not actual opposition allow
 them to be submerged by
 the rolling wave of disunion
 reply to this inquiry I
 have been told by ublicans
 in and out of Congress
 that all com promises were
 finåliy ended and that the
 day for I do not
 subscribe to any concession was
 over such narrow and illiberal
 doctrine Our whole system of
 government was founded and continues
 to rest on the opposite
 theory If compromise established why
 may not compromise preserve the
 Constitution When Washington presented that
 matchless instrument to Congress he
 accom panied it with the
 remark that it was the
 result of a spirit of
 amity and of mutual concession
 which the peculiarity of our
 political situation rendered indispensable Arc
 wc wiser purer better than
 were the patriotic men who
 framed out institutions Widely different
 as the habits institutions and
 modes of life of the
 American people then were and
 continue to be it is
 evident that contrariety of opinion
 and differences of ail kinds
 must ever be expected to
 prevail through out the country
 The patriotic and prudent states
 man will accommodate his legislation
 to these in evitable necessities
 and view them from a
 stand point which will embrace
 all the States and havc
 regard to the common brotherhood
 of all the peo pie
 For seventy years avnd upwards
 this Gov ernment has maintained
 itself in the affections and
 respect of the people and
 although there have been stormy
 periods in our history there
 were in every peril patriotic
 men found who rose superior
 to the paltry instincts of
 locality and partisanship So I
 hope it may be again
 in this the darkest hour
 of our hisL0t y The
 instincts of Pennsylvania prompt to
 pacific counsels and moderation The
 foundations of the old Commonwealth
 were laid deep and enduring
 on the basis of peace
 arid good will Her whole
 history has been in keeping
 with the event which marked
 her treaty with the aborigines
 beneath the spreading elm at
 Shackamaxon As she is geographically
 central so is her policy
 con servative and just She
 will mediate with and be
 tween contending States and sentiments
 and will not sacrifice the
 great interests ofa common coun
 try to vain abstractions or
 idle theories I repeat we
 can afford to meet the
 border States in a conciliatory
 spirit The resources of our
 section arc far greater than
 are those of their sec
 tion The flood ofemigration from
 the free States joined to
 that from abroad is rapidly
 overflowing the broad territories which
 lie beyond the Mis sissippi
 and the question of territorial
 governe ment is practically settled
 in favor of free labor
 WV c arc about inaucruratincr
 an Administration which to say
 the least wiil sec that
 fair play is shown to
 frce Statc men in the
 organization and movcrnment of the
 Territories Washington and Nebraska and
 various others will soon knock
 at our doors for admission
 as free States Kan sas
 her garments dripping with the
 blood of her slaughtered rnartyrs
 and her constitution free from
 the blot of slavery long
 a suppliant has been admitted
 Her star now blazes on
 the na tiohal ensign and
 justice long defön ed has
 been done to her liberty
 loving yeomanry We are also
 on the threshold of the
 inauguration of the homestead policy
 which will secure the free
 labor incr men their proper
 advantages in their conflict with
 the privations of frontier life
 It carries on its face
 an ample guarantee that the
 prairies of the furthest West
 will soon be converted into
 smiling gardens in which happy
 homes will be reared and
 contentment will abound I he
 passage of the Pacific railroad
 bill cannot be delayed much
 longer and it witl prove
 the dawn of a new
 era the be inning of
 an advancing civilization which will
 strengthen with bands of iron
 the Federal Union build cities
 along its line delve in
 the mountains through which it
 will pass for mineral treasures
 and make vocal the whole
 land with its songs of
 labor and its hum of
 industry To crown ail and
 better than all the Morrill
 tariff bill is on the
 eve of its passage In
 its recognition of the principle
 l of protection to the
 suffering industrial interests of the
 country I look with confidence
 as a meas ure of
 peace Your Treasury is bankrupt
 and increased revenues are indispensable
 to the opera tions of
 the Government Your industry is
 pros trate and your operatives
 are out of employ This
 measure will bring relief and
 that speedily All these measures
 and prospects await us in
 the near uture Ait we
 need to make thern avail
 able for the prosperity of
 the country is the resto
 ration of peace and the
 continuance of the Federal Union
 Any party that sets itself
 up obstinately against any and
 all propositions which make for
 peace will go down before
 the indignation of an aroused
 people It is the duty
 of Republicans to give such
 propositions a candid consideration Not
 to do so is virtually
 to disband the Republican organi
 zation in Pennsylvania whatever may
 be its fate elsewhere Before
 Mr Lincoln is inaugurated this
 District will be the theater
 of commotion and it may
 be of violence unless before
 that time we can break
 the back of secession in
 Maryland and Virginia To encourage
 and sustain the Union loving
 men of those States seems
 to me to be a
 solemn duty a work of
 patriotism coun sel them to
 stand fast The loyal men
 of Penn sylvania will lock
 shields with them and the
 bor der States slave and
 free will say to the
 extreme North and the extreme
 South thus far and no
 further Sir I deprecate changes
 of any kind or for
 any purpose in the organic
 lawr of our country Nothing
 butan inevitable necessity will constrain
 mc to yield to them
 It is a dangerous expediency
 to tamper with the Constitution
 Once open the door and
 fools will speedily rush in
 where angels fear to tread
 Better far the gradual amendments
 of time and construction than
 sudden and great It is
 by this safe process of
 innovation changes that the British
 constitution has been graduaHy modified
 and molded to correspond to
 the growth of the kingdom
 and the expanded thought of
 the people and by this
 combined process of resistance and
 yielding to change it has
 preserved itself This country has
 been safe under the Constitution
 It and the Union I
 repeat are the only defense
 left for slavery in the
 civilized world Those who for
 the sake of slavery are
 now endeavoring to destroy the
 Union and the Constitution in
 my judgment have Eaten of
 the insane root That takes
 the reason prisoner And now
 to come to the apple
 of discord the territorial question
 Practically the border States can
 have small interest in its
 final settlement They have no
 population to spare and are
 more nearly concerned in the
 other aspects presented by the
 existence of slavery in their
 midst The Nort h claim
 the right to exclude slavery
 from the Territories It claims
 this right on constitutional and
 moral grounds because Congress has
 supreme power over the Territories
 and as slavery is an
 evil that power ought to
 be exerted to keep it
 forever out of any region
 over which the General Government
 has jurisdiction On the other
 hand the South says that
 thc Territories are thc national
 domain and as such belong
 equally to citizens North and
 South that southern men have
 prop erty in their slaves
 and therefore it is the
 duty of Congress to grant
 them the protection of the
 Gen era Government While it
 is an utter fallacy to
 recoffnize this right of protection
 inasmuch as sla very is
 simply a local institution relying
 solely upon the local law
 for its existence as well
 as its protection I do
 not propose to enter upon
 the ar gument in detail
 It is sumcient to say
 that these views are diametrically
 opposite In times of great
 peril arising from conflict of
 opinion and interest there is
 usually a happy medium in
 which all well disposed men
 can rneet The Missouri line
 was that happy medium and
 gave peace to the country
 It was a pledge of
 peace a compact of brotherhood
 a bond of Union It
 said to our fendw citizens
 North and South the country
 is vast and it is
 all ours Let us cultivate
 it render it habitable clothe
 its desert places with harvests
 and make its wilderness laugh
 with joy Let us build
 up here in these boundless
 regions a great empire of
 peace and of liberty for
 our own and our children
 s children for an example
 to struggling nationalities abroad for
 the honor of humanity and
 the glory of God No
 change has taken place in
 the condition of the Territories
 since the adjustment of 1850
 ex cept that passed at
 the instance of the slave
 States in 1854 which repealed
 the Missouri compromise 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Under the operation
 of that line the country
 had prospered and lived peacefully
 for upwards of thirty years
 It was canonized in the
 hearts and affections of the
 people and it was an
 act of polit ical madness
 to repeal it The dictum
 of the Su preme Court
 pronounced it unconstitutional and whenever
 the question comes up in
 a regular way there is
 no room for doubt but
 that it will be re
 iterated in regular form Under
 that decision the South contended
 for the right to carry
 slaves and have them protected
 into all the Territo fies
 of the United States A
 great party arose in 1854
 to contest that right and
 to hmit the South to
 the Territories south of 360
 30 and thus vir tually
 to restore the operation and
 to hold them to the
 compromise of the Missouri line
 Now if we in this
 exigency do what the Republican
 pasty in its origin proposed
 to do take the ex
 tension and renewal of that
 line as the basis of
 settlement in whose mouth does
 it lie to say nay
 What Territory is affected by
 such a basis of settlement
 All the territory north of
 the com promise line comprising
 nine hundred thousand square miles
 is already secured to free
 labor despite the dicttun of
 the Supreme Court the lasvs
 of Congress and the machinations
 of politi cians There isa
 broad expanse of territory lying
 west of Arkansas which is
 secured to certain ln dian
 tribes by treaty stipulations They
 have been removed there from
 their former homes east Of
 the Mississippi and are protected
 in its pos session It
 is all that is left
 to the descendants of the
 aborigines of North America and
 no man Will be base
 enough to disturb their right
 to it All that is
 left then about which there
 is room for dispute so
 long as wc retain our
 present bound aries is the
 rerritory lying south of Kansas
 and Utah extending to the
 Mexican frontier This is known
 as New Mexico It contains
 about two hundred thousand square
 miles The question upon which
 the permanence of our Government
 hlngcs to day seems to
 be what shall be the
 future condition of this Territory
 In his great speech in
 the Senate Mr SEWARD says
 I ifferent forms of labor
 if slavery is not perverted
 to purposes of political aml
 ition need not constitUte an
 ele ment of strife in
 the Confederacy The restoration of
 peace and the stability of
 our free institutions would then
 seem to present considerations of
 paramount importance to the sol
 u lion even of this
 question But in addition to
 the Senator s suggestion thc
 present status of New Mexico
 must be taken into consideration
 By the terms of her
 territorial act she is privileged
 to frame her domestic insti
 tutions in her own way
 so that they are not
 in consistent with the Constitution
 of the United States Whatever
 institutions therefore now exist there
 are there independent of any
 acti011 taken by us Nominally
 the Territory has sla very
 in existence and the census
 returns show that there were
 last year one neo ro
 man and Its eleven negro
 women held to service there
 spread seerns impossil le God
 and nature have placed barriers
 to its increase High mountain
 their summits covered with ranges
 traverse It perpetual Gnow Attificial
 irrigation will be re quired
 to cultivate the valleys for
 the rivers run dry in
 summer The committee of thirty
 three propose to cut the
 Gordian knot of our difficul
 ties by adrnitting this Territory
 as a State at once
 and allowing the inhabitants thereof
 in accordan ce with the
 letter and spirit of their
 territorial organ ization in 1850
 to form their constitutiofffree or
 I am not inclined to
 resist forever and to slave
 the extrerrjity of breaking up
 the Confederacy her admission if
 she comes in regular form
 with republican institutions simply bccause
 her peo ple in a
 legal and constitutional way indicate
 their preference for one kind
 of labor to another It
 is their business not mine
 To increase the diffculties in
 the way of an honorable
 adjustment of the perils which
 threaten us we have to
 combat that most hateful power
 in a free country a
 fanatical party spirit The madness
 of an irresponsible partisanship holds
 us in its grasp and
 this portentous sign hangs over
 us like a fiery sword
 in the heavens terrible to
 of being a compromise and
 settling the vexed behold Although
 not one member of the
 Illiirty question such a provision
 would prove a fount ain
 of bitter waters forever lead
 to fillibustering Sixth Congress was
 chosen to fill a seat
 here with reference to the
 exigency on which we have
 fallen Corays on neighboring territory
 and rcnew the warfare now
 raging so fiercely In 1810
 Mexico a sornewhat general feeling
 seems to pervade us that
 we must measure our words
 and square our abolished slavery
 and if it be our
 manifest destiny I undertake to
 say as some contend to
 absorb and annex that Coun
 action by party platforms try
 I will not a greeyin
 blighti With that if the
 people had an opportunity to
 act for themselves m this
 emergency the skies would at
 slavery once be found growing
 clear and bright above us
 If all efforts at compromise
 fail Ifeel inclined Their verdict
 would be overwhelmingly in favor
 of to support a proposition
 to its peaceful and speedy
 solution and any party or
 troversy to the people As
 have already gaid platform that
 stands in the way of
 such a settle we were
 not elected in view Of
 the present ment would sink
 to that lower deep whence
 no gency and if we
 fail to meet it let
 the people hand of resurrection
 would reach them But here
 the source of all power
 make the final decision is
 one source of the trouble
 The people cannot In this
 respect I adopt the language
 ofihe Pregn ident elect be
 heard and have no power
 to make themselves felt We
 arc bound hand and foot
 to the tyranny If the
 people desire to ball a
 conven ti01i toremove any of
 party All things are viewed
 from partisan grievances complained of
 or to give new guarantees
 for the permanence of vested
 rights it Is mot mine
 to Oppose stand points and
 through party optics The Honest
 and true his genial heart
 embraces hrs power of the
 people will not be felt
 until the ballot whole country
 And whatever the madness of
 boxes again open and send
 forth their loud thun the
 hour may suggest we may
 be assured that ders Then
 I predict that vengeance ample
 and having been inaugurated he
 will be President of sufficient
 will be taken on the
 public men and the United
 States and will sec that

 that assume the responsibility of

 R No 341 for the
 relief of Moses Meeker have
 instructed me to report in
 favor of the passage of
 the bill and I ask
 that it be put on
 its passage now I he
 report is very short or
 I can state in a
 few the bill is By
 unenimous consent the bill was
 considered as in Comtnitt ee
 of the Whole It proposes
 to instruct the Secretary of
 the Treasury to ascer tain
 as in the case of
 John P B and Henry
 Gratiot what amount if any
 of rent was exacted by
 the United States agents of
 lead mines from Moses Meeker
 for lead mined and smelted
 upon the lands of the
 Ottawa Pottavzatomie Chippewa Winnebago or
 other tribes of Indians prior
 to their purchase by the
 United States and to pay
 such amount as may be
 legally proved to have been
 actually paid by Moses Mecker
 Mr DOOLITTLE Before we purchased
 the Indian lands in Wisconsin
 this Moses Meeker as early
 as 1825 under some arrangement
 with the Indians went on
 the mineral lands and mined
 and smelted lead One of
 the agents of the United
 States assumed the authority to
 compel him to pay over
 a part of the lead
 as rent which hc had
 no authority to do Under
 this requirement he paid over
 to the Government of the
 United States one hundred and
 twenty five thousand pounds of
 lead before we ever purchased
 or owned the lands The
 committee recommend that it shall
 be repaid to him There
 were one hundred and twenty
 five thousand pounds of lead
 the value of which by
 the bill the Secretary of
 the Treasury is to ascer
 tain and pay The bill
 was reported to the Senate
 without amendment ordered to a
 third reading read the third
 time and passed APPEAL IN
 COPYRIGHT CASES Mr BAYARD I
 am instructed by the Com
 mittee on the Tudiciary to
 whom was referred the bill
 H R No 554 to
 extehd the right of appeal
 from decisions of circuit courts
 to the Supreme Court of
 the United States to report
 it back with amendments and
 I ask also for its
 present con sideration The Ämendments
 are very slight The passage
 of the bill is really
 of importance to the administration
 of justice The bill was
 considered as in Committee of
 the Whole It provides that
 from all judgments and decrees
 of nny circuit court rendered
 in any ac tion suit
 controversy or case at law
 or in equity under any
 law of the United States
 granting or confirming to authors
 the exclusive right to their
 respective writinøs a writ of
 error or appeal as the
 case may require shall lie
 to the Supreme Court of
 the United States in the
 same manner and under the
 same circumstances as is now
 pro vided by law in
 other judgments and decrees of
 the circuit courts and in
 all other cases in which
 an injunction is awarded or
 granted by the decree and
 also in all other cases
 in which the court shall
 deem it reasonable to allow
 the writ of error or
 appeal The Secretary read the
 amendments of the committee which
 arc in line five after
 the word equity to insert
 arising in lines eleven and
 twelve to strike out in
 all other cases in which
 an injunction is awarded or
 grunted by the decree and
 also and in lines thirteen
 and four teen to strike
 out the words writ of
 error or appeal and insert
 the word same so that
 the bill will read I
 hat from all judgments and
 decrees of any circuit court
 rendered in any action suit
 controversy or case at law
 or in equity arising under
 any law of the United
 States granting or confirming to
 authors the exclusive right to
 their respective writings a writ
 of error or appeal as
 the case may require shall
 lie to the Supreme Court
 of the United States in
 the same rnanner and under
 the saine cir cumstances as
 is now providod by law
 in other judgments and decrees
 of such circuit courts and
 in all other cases in
 which the court shall deem
 it reasonable to ailow the
 same Mr BAYARD The only
 object of the amend ments
 is simply to do what
 the House of Repre sentatives
 intended to do The object
 of the whole bill is
 to place parties who enjoy
 a copy right on any
 question arising under the laws
 of the Uni ted States
 in the same position as
 the holder of a patent
 right that is that he
 may take an appeal without
 to the amount in cases
 arising under any law of
 Congress granting a copy right
 That is the whole effect
 of the bill The amend
 ments are to limit it
 to that The amendments were
 agreed to The bill was
 reported to the Senate as
 amended and the amendments were
 concurred in and or 1861

 MRS E A LINN Mr
 HALE T laid upön the
 table yes erday a resolution
 in relation to the action
 of the Secre tary of
 the Senate and as it
 is a matte relating to
 the order of the proceedings
 of the body I move
 that it be taken up
 for disposition I will indicate
 to the Senate the disposition
 I propose to make of
 it at this time which
 is to refer it to
 the Commit tee to Audit
 and Control the Contingent Expenses
 of the Senate but I
 propose to occupy the atten
 tion of the Senate about
 five minutes in statin some
 facts The motion was agreed
 to and the Senate pro
 cccded to consider the following
 resolution Resolved That the reasons
 assigned by the Secretary of
 the Senate for his neglect
 to obey the ordor of
 the Senate made on the
 20th of March last in
 favor of Mrs E A
 Linn are insufficient and unsatisfactory
 and that he be in
 structed forthwith to execute the
 same Mr HALE I move
 that the resolution which I
 submitted and the report of
 the Secretary in cluding the
 letter of Mr Medill the
 Comptroller be reförredto the Committee
 to Audit and Con trol
 the Contingent Expenses of the
 Senate and upon that motion
 I wish to say a
 word or two Mr COLLAMER
 Allow me to suggest as
 it involves a question of
 law whether il should not
 go to the Judiciary Committee
 Mr HALE I prefer that
 it should take the usual
 course and that is my
 motion Ifthc Sen ate do
 not agree to it they
 can vote it down I
 want to state the history
 of the case This is
 an order peremptory on the
 face of it directing the
 Secretary of the Senate to
 pay from the contingent fund
 a certain sum to Mrs
 E A Linn widow of
 the late Dr Linn a
 member of this body Of
 the propriety or the impropriety
 of the passage of the
 resolution I do not propose
 to say a single word
 because it is a resolution
 imperative upon its face mandatory
 it its char acter directed
 to the disbursing officer of
 this Senate The reason for
 not paying the money is
 that subsequent to its passage
 the Secretary applied to Mr
 Medil to know whether if
 he obeyed the order of
 the Senate he could bc
 pro tected in it and
 Mr Medill answered that he
 could no and the Secretary
 prefers to obey Mr Medill
 instead of the Senate and
 this mandatory order of the
 Senate stands thcrc and is
 defied by your Secretary under
 the advice of IVTr MediH
 Mr Medill I do not
 know I know the Secre
 tary and have known bim
 more than half the time
 that he has been Secretary
 of this body Towards him
 I have no feelings but
 thosc of the utmost kindness
 and of the profoundest respcct
 say but i wish to
 say that the law of
 1858 un der which Mr
 Medill undertakes to justify what
 I consider his impertinent interference
 pre cisely the law which
 has existed for many years
 The law of 1844 to
 be found page 170 of
 Bright ly s Digest is
 in express terms the same
 as that of 1858 quoted
 in the letter from Mr
 Medill to the Secretary which
 is that NQ part of
 the sums appropriated for the
 contingent ex penses of either
 House of Congress shall be
 applied toany other than tbc
 ordinary expenditures of the Senate
 and House of Representatives nor
 as extra allowance to any
 clerk messenoer or other attendant
 of the said two Houses
 or either of them nor
 as payment or compensation to
 any clerk messenger or other
 attendant of the said two
 Houses or either of them
 unless such clerk _rnessenger or
 other attendant be so enlployed
 by a resolution or order
 of one of said Houses
 If Senators will take the
 trouble to look at it
 they will find that the
 law of 1858 quoted by
 Mr Medill is precisely the
 law that has prevailed here
 since 1844 and now wish
 to call the attention of
 the Senate to some of
 the disbursements which have been
 habitually made by the Senate
 out of its contingent fund
 Under resolutions of June 13
 and Deccmber 26 1844 both
 of them subse quent to
 the passage of the law
 that I have just read
 there was paid out of
 the contingent fund of this
 body the funeral expenses of
 Hon Abel P Upshur and
 five other persons killed on
 board the United States ship
 Princeton 839 55 and an
 equal surn wras paid by
 the House of Repre sentatives
 out of the contincycnt fund
 of that House Under a
 resolution of Mav 14 1846
 there was allowed and paid
 out of the continerent fund
 of the Senate 150 for
 the funeral expenses of James
 Timms a niesseno er of
 tho body his laity salary
 from the day of his
 death March 20 to the
 close of the session August
 10 1846 429 and extra
 compensation moiths after he had
 been in his grave of
 550 making in the whole
 a gross suin of 1
 129 I Under a resolution
 of June 12 1846 there
 was paid to the representatives
 of Lewis Saunders messenger out
 of the contingent fund of
 the Sen ate daily pay
 from the day of his
 death Mav 21 to the
 closc of thc session August
 10 1846 45162 and extra
 compensa tion at the close
 of the session 200 and
 150 for funeral expenses Under
 resolutions of December 18 1845
 and April 2 1846 there
 was paid to the representa
 tives of Edward Dyer latc
 Sergeant at Arms the sarne
 arnount that was paid to
 the representa lives Qf Stephen
 Haight late Sergeant at Arms
 1 875 Stephen Haightdicd in
 1840 and under a resolution
 of January 12 1841 the
 Secretary was directed to pay
 for transporting his body to
 Vermont and funeral expenses 500
 and also but I have
 a higher re spcct for
 the privileges of II his
 salary for the residue of
 the term for which he
 this body than I have
 for any of its ofüccrs
 was elected 1 375 making
 in all The question whether
 a direction to pay nM
 ney out of the contingent
 fund of the Senate should
 paid out of the contingent
 fund Under the resolution of
 March 15 1850 there be
 made was raised once in
 this bodv Mr was paid
 to Owen Connelly for inj
 uries sustained NV hiltlesey was
 Comptroller and it was upon
 in discharging his duties as
 onc of the Capitol this
 question of mileage at a
 called executive police a sum
 equal to the amount of
 his pay session Mr Whittlesey
 as Comptroller of the from
 the time of his removal
 from office 30th Treasury refused
 to allow payments made by
 the April 1849 to thc
 date of tho pusgage of
 the res Secretary after they
 had been made That being
 olution 956 38 the only
 tilno that the power of
 the Senate over Under a
 resolution of February 21 1856
 an its owli contincrentfund was
 ever interfered with anowance was
 made for the funeral expenses
 of for the House of
 Representatives had always re frained
 from doing so upon the
 motion of one of Michael
 Dooley late superintendent of the
 fold ing room and three
 months salary from thc day
 the best lawyers that cver
 had a scat upon the
 floor not now a member
 Hon Mr Badger of Of
 his death paid to his

 of January 14 1859 since
 North Carolina thig amendment was
 inserted in Mr Medill has

 the appropriation bill lowed to

 Morton late there was paid
 out of the contingen L
 fund md allowed b Elisha
 Whi tleseyj Hon D R
 Atchison 6 the between the
 amount he has already received
 as Ptesident pro tempore and
 the compensation of Vice Presi
 dent and under resolution of
 December 1851855 there was paid
 out of the contingent fund
 sand allowed by Mr Whittlesey
 as Comptroller to Hon JEssc
 D BRIGHT tbe difference between
 the amount now received by
 him and thecompen sation of
 Vice President I have read
 a few of these cases
 l will state further that
 from this very contingent fund
 since the passage of this
 law there has been pepeatedly
 paid to the Secretary himself
 and to his clerks under
 him donations amounting to as
 much as 500 and I
 have never heard nor has
 it been inti mated that
 in a single a question
 has been put to Mr
 Medill or anybody else on
 God s earth to know
 whether the Senate could protect
 its ox vn omcer in
 executing its own orders Sir
 if the resolution ordering this
 payment to be made is
 not right repeal it rescind
 it but do not let
 it stand upon your records
 as a mandate to your
 officer and then let Mr
 Medill or anybody else in
 any of thc Departments come
 up and tell your officer
 not to obey your order
 but to obey his And
 sir let me ask the
 Senato if they have been
 suddenly taken they or their
 officers with such a fib
 of constitutional scruple is this
 the case and the instance
 in which to apply it
 You have made such payments
 to your own members to
 your Presiding Oflicers to the
 families of your deceased members
 You have made them over
 and over again unquestioned by
 anybody and now sir when
 there is a solitary widow
 whose honored husband one of
 the most honored that ever
 had a seat on this
 floor of whom Mr Ben
 ton said an d I
 remember it and shall never
 for get his culogy that
 he was a man who
 never encountered a form of
 l uman wretchedness with oat
 melting into tenderness before it
 nor an ap parition pf
 earthly danger without bidding it
 de fiance Now sir when
 the widow of one of
 our colleagues on this floor
 comes to the Senate and
 the Senate under a sense
 of justice or an impulse
 of generosity it may be
 havc ordered that this money
 should be paid to her
 and the order stands peremptory
 I ask you if it
 is a time to bring
 your constitutional scruples to bear
 in the case of this
 lone widow whose husband and
 eight of her nine chi
 dren have preceded her to
 the grave Now in hcr
 old age in her loneliness
 and her desola tion she
 stands here in her poverty
 asking you to execute your
 own order in hcr behalf
 and you are taken with
 a fit of constitutional scruples
 and have to send up
 to the other end of
 the avenue to Mr Medill
 or somebody else God knows
 who I do not care
 and he tells you that
 your Secretary cannot execute your
 own orders or ders that
 you hayc been in the
 habit of making years and
 years and he tells you
 that if the pay ment
 is made he will not
 allow it Sir I believe
 that there was a day
 when if such a letter
 as that wvas sent to
 any officer df this body
 it would have been treated
 as I think it ought
 to be as a contempt
 a contempt of the body
 and the body ought to
 vindicato itself with all Its
 constitutional powcr against such an
 impertinent interference by this executive
 omcer Sir the House of
 Representatives have never questioned the
 propriety ofany disposition that we
 madc of our contingent fund
 and wenever have in regard
 to theirs and the Government
 has gone on It was
 supposed that this fund might
 be safely trusted to the
 judgment and discretion of the
 difl pretation of the third
 section 01 the act cntitled
 An Act a one quarter
 s salary and 150 for
 ferent bra lches and it
 is a new thing for
 an ex funeral cxpcnscs amountino

 coin pensat ion to the

 was paid to the widow
 i direct it Sir does
 the Secretary or anybody and
 to the I elegätes of
 tbc Territories and repealing all
 of Hon Chester Ashley of
 Arkansas from the I else
 suppose that this Senate and
 this Congress other laws on
 that subject approved 22d January
 1818 balance due at the
 time will not protect its
 executive offcers in carrying contingent

 I am not now to

 of December 7 1854 dill
 be referred to the Committee
 to Audit and Control the
 Contingent Expenses of the Senate
 Mr BAYARD i do not
 purpose now to enter into
 any detailed reply to the
 remarks of the hon too
 orable Senator from New Hampshire
 the sub ject was only
 brought to my notice this
 morning but his statementis so
 defective in my judgment that
 itis right and proper even
 before this reso lutiön is
 reförred that I should correct
 it in one respect The
 correction is due to the
 ofiicer of your body The
 Senate of the United States
 after making its order in
 this cage for the paymentof
 construct ive mileage that is
 all that it was had
 the grace not to violate
 the law too openly and
 placed as an amendment on
 an appropriation bill a clause
 providing forthe appropriation of the
 amount of the order The
 HouÉe of Representatives rejected that
 amendffént and the Senate receded
 from it That action called
 upon the offcer to be
 cautious nd he went before
 the Comptroller under those ei
 rcumstances and the Comptroller following
 the opinion of the Attorney
 General in a parallel case
 told him it was impossible
 for him to allow it
 The recession of the Senate
 from that amendment in my
 judgment shows that they did
 not intend that order to
 be executed without the assent
 of the House of Representatives
 and if they did intend
 it to be executed without
 the assent of the House
 of Representatives they intended to
 violate the law Of the
 land and if one portion
 of this legisla tive authority
 under the claim of the
 privileges of the body can
 violate the laws of the
 land on what basis is
 it that you are to
 expect the individual citizen to
 obey them Here is the
 law cited in the letter
 of Mr Medill We passed
 in conjunc tion with the
 House of Representatives this clause
 on the 30th of June
 1858 That no part of
 the appropriations whiCh may be
 at any titne made for
 contingent expenses of either House
 of Con gress shah be
 applied to any other than
 the ordinary ex penditures of
 the Senate and House of
 Representatives Mr President if onc
 branch of the Legislature in
 the face of that law
 passed by both and sanc
 tioncd by the President as
 part of thc law making
 power can mako an order
 of its own appropriat Ing
 money out of the Treasui
 y of the Unit cd
 States against law where is
 it to end Is that
 t11C priv ilege of this
 body Is it t he
 privilege of the House of
 Representatives Is it not rather
 truc that the object of
 the law was to correct
 that very loose ness which
 had often characterized our proceed
 ings here in passing many
 ofthe resolutions which the honorable
 Senator has cited and which
 may bc a subject of
 comment hereafter In other cases
 from abuses by either body
 of the existing law whether
 in relation to the distribution
 Of books or other things
 we have been calte l
 upon to pass statutes which
 would prevent those abuses Now
 sir I can see no
 ground for the censure which
 this resolution implies on the
 Secretary of the Senate nor
 on the Comptroller The Secre
 tary has been a faithful
 officer to you always The
 passage of this resolution will
 be a direct vote of
 censure upon your officer It
 does 110t toucl i the
 Comptroller the Comptroller has addressed
 no lettct to you rr
 he Sccretary found that the
 Senate receded from this amendment
 which it had placed on
 the appropriation bill for thc
 purpose of satisfying its own
 order to which the other
 House objected and under that
 state of things the Secretary
 inquired of the accounting offcer
 if hc could be at
 liberty under the existing law
 to pay thc money The
 accountino officer rcfcrred him to
 the law under which it
 vould be illegal for him
 to pay and impossible for
 the accounting omcer consistently with
 his duty to allow the
 I do not consider this
 as any broach payment of
 the privileges of the Senate
 in any respect know there
 is a great deal said
 here which is cal culated
 to excite sympathy It is
 not uncommon where case wili
 not bear a moment s
 investiga tion when you come
 to examine it to throw
 in a widow or halfa
 dozen children or somethingelse into
 the case in order to
 catch the kindly feelings of
 the Senate and so use
 the funds of the Gov
 ernment directly in the face
 of the law Such is
 not my judgment of what
 is tbG duty of a
 legis lator With a man
 s own private funds with
 that which belongs to him
 to dispose of at his
 will approve of benevolence charity
 and a due re gard
 for widows and orphans but
 standing here as a Senator
 of the United States cannot
 agree to trive away the
 money of the people of
 the United States in opposition
 to the laws of the
 United States on the ground
 of the claimant being a
 widow or having orphan children
 I hold the principle to
 be unsound In morals Well
 as in Iéglslätion CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 2 I hope the
 resolution will be referred and
 when the case comes up
 if the committee instead of
 reporting in of rescinding the
 resolution which the Senate could
 not pass of its own
 mo tion without the assent
 of the House of Repre
 sentatives should report in favor
 of enforcing this order to
 make the Secretary of the
 Senate pay out of his
 own pocket money which the
 Senate chooses to pay as
 a gratuity a strange kind
 of charity indeed if that
 should bé the report of
 the committee I shall beg
 leave to contest it at
 length It shall never pass
 without my protest and such
 comments and further investigation of
 the authorities as I think
 proper to make It is
 immaterial to me whether it
 is referred to one committee
 or another Mr HALE 1
 did not hear that the
 Sen ator from Delaware said
 but if he said what
 a friend reports him to
 me as having said he
 is laboring under a great
 mistake This was an order
 peremptory on the face of
 it Here is the resolution
 as it passed the Senate
 I understood the Senator to
 say it was not intended
 to be paid out of
 the contingent fund Resoloed That
 the Secretary of the Senate
 be directcd to pay out
 of the contingent fund of
 the Senate to Mrs E
 A Linn wridow of Hon
 Lewis F Linn late a
 Senator of the United States
 from the State of Missouri
 the amount of mileage at
 the speciai sessions in 1837
 and 1841 not received by
 the qe ceased I take
 it that is pretty clear
 as to what the Sen
 ate intended Now sir as
 to the legislation which has
 been referred to have a
 distinct recollection upon it though
 I have not the record
 before me When that resolution
 was passed the Secretary as
 I think he says in
 the letter which hc sent
 to the Senate which I
 now have before me declined
 to pay it solely on
 the ground that that portion
 of the fund out of
 which it had to come
 was ex hausted He says
 so now Phat was the
 reason and the only reason
 he assigned for not pay
 mg it then There was
 no question of the authority
 of the Senate to pass
 such an order but that
 was the reason assigned and
 assigned to me verbally for
 I went to thc Sccretary
 s offcc and saw him
 and hisclerk under him and
 they showed me that thc
 fund was exhausted Then an
 appropriation was added to the
 deficiency bill to supply this
 sum because that fund was
 exhausted The Sen ate put
 it on and the House
 stmxck it off and the
 Senate receded because as was
 stated in debate here and
 as the honorable gentleman who
 was then chairman of the
 Committee on Finance stated if
 I am notæxceedingly mistaken in
 my recollec tion of his
 remarks that a refusal to
 insert it in the appropriation
 bill had nothing to do
 with re scinding it or
 anything of that sort bat
 the pro priety of putting
 it into the deficiency bill
 was what was discussed and
 we refrained from put ling
 it into the deficiency bill
 While I am up I
 will say further in regard
 to that honorable Senator for
 whose opinion In mat tcrs
 of this sort I have
 so n mch respect that
 the ofiiccu in charge of
 this fund Mr Fitzpatrick wrote
 a letter to thc Secretary
 of the Senate tell ing
 him that it was the
 opinion of the honorable Senator
 from Virginia Mr HUNTERI that
 the order was imperative Mr
 HUNTER All 1 can say
 is that 1 do not
 recollect those facts I suppose
 I might have said that
 the Senate had a right
 if they chose to pay
 it out of the contingent
 fund but on the pro
 priety of the claim am
 very certain I expressed no
 opinion Mr HALE Of course
 I did not say the
 Sen ator did I have
 not expressed any opinion about
 it Mr HUNTER 1 may
 have expressed the opinion that
 the Senate had the right
 to do it but as
 to the propriety of it
 do not think I ever
 said I thought it proper
 Mr HALE I did not
 say you ever did sir
 nor do I suppose you
 ever did But the agree
 ment of the Senate to
 recede from their amend ment
 according to the suggestion of
 the House of Representatives was
 placed on this floor upon
 the express ground of the
 impropriety of putting it into
 the deficiency bill It was
 said in that de bate
 and so the Globe containing
 the record of the debate
 will show that it did
 not affect the order at
 all The question was not
 for legislative sanction or disapproval
 but upon the propriety of
 putting it into the deficiency
 bill that all Mr HUNTER
 As my name has i
 into this matter I will
 Bay that I hafe a
 very in distinct recollection of
 it but I find there
 is a positive law on
 the subject and if I
 gave such an opi n
 I could not have seen
 it My attention has st
 been called to it That
 no part of the appropriations
 which may be at any
 time madq for contingent expenses
 of either House of Con
 gress shall bc applied to
 any other than the ordinary
 ex penditures of the Senate
 and House of Representatives It
 seems to me that that
 law does cover the case
 I do not remember the
 opinion which 1 expressed then
 I think it probable that
 I did efpress such an
 opinion as is imputed to
 me but I had not
 adverted to that law Mr
 PUGH Mr President if the
 Senator from New Hampshire had
 simply permitted his resolution and
 the papers to go to
 either of the standing committees
 of the Senate I should
 not have trespassed on the
 patience of Senators at all
 This question has been frequently
 debated in thc Senato since
 I have been a member
 of it We have striven
 arain and again and again
 by solemn laws enacted by
 both Houses and signed by
 the President to prevent exactly
 what the Senator as now
 attempting to accomplish Sir I
 trust that I am as
 capable of sympathizing x vith
 the case of Mrs Linn
 or any other widow as
 any Senator on this floor
 but I will not allow
 an appeal to my generosity
 as an individual to lead
 me into a violation of
 the laws to which we
 have solemnly and upon deliberation
 agreed In the first place
 this matter itself was before
 the Sen ate at the
 last session The resolution passed
 the Senate in defiance of
 every safeguard of our It
 is provided in our rules
 that any res rules olution
 requiring a payment from the
 contingent fund shall first pass
 through the Committee to Anditand
 Control the Contiågent Expenses of
 the Senate and in the
 next place thatit shall be
 read three times as a
 bill Upon the sugge lion
 of a Senator that this
 mileage had been paid to
 every one else the Senate
 dispensed with the reference read
 the resolution three times and
 passed it without any debate
 or discussion It was after
 wards discovered that the statement
 was untrue in fact the
 Senate erred that no other
 Senator had received any of
 this mileage and our Secretary
 certifies to us in his
 letter that Mr Linn received
 all the mileage of any
 other Senator for both those
 sessions it was discovered last
 session and I offered a
 resolution then for the purpose
 of having it brought before
 the Committee to Audit and
 Control the Contingent Expenses of
 the Scn ate but never
 could get an opportunity to
 call it up for consideration
 Upon the representation of my
 honored friend from Kentucky Mr
 CRITTEN DEN that persons had
 advanced a portion of the
 money upon the faith of
 our resolution we at tempted
 to make good our blunder
 by appropri ating the money
 not as the Senator from
 New Hampshire says out of
 the contingent fund but as
 a direct appropriation of money
 in the defi cicncy bill
 x vith the distinct declaration
 all over that that should
 be the end of it
 The House of Representatives would
 not agree to it It
 was debated in the House
 It was said that the
 Senate had no right to
 go to the Treasury of
 the United States in order
 to cover up its own
 blunder The House refused to
 agree to it and it
 was not paid to the
 case of the Comptroller The
 Senator from New Hampshire three
 times re peated the expression
 that it was an impertinent
 interference Sir if there be
 any impertinence it is that
 of attacking a man behind
 his back What is his
 duty by the laws of
 the land To audit the
 accounts of the Secretary of
 the Senate He can not
 escape from it The Secretary
 applies to him to know
 whether if he pays the
 money under this resolu lion
 it shall be credited in
 his account What says the
 Comptroller Sir I cannot credit
 it under the law of
 the land I am forbidden
 to credit it Why sir
 a discussion arose between us
 and the House of Representatives
 in a precisely similar case
 when they undertook to charge
 upon their contingent fund an
 expenditure to which we had
 refused to asrree There were
 four confer ences between the
 Senate and the House on
 that question I knowl was
 put on the third one
 my self and I think
 my friend from Vermont and
 one of the Senators from
 Louisiana not present were with
 me I proposed asa compromise
 that we should increase the
 contin 5ént fund of the
 House and let them go
 in peace hut when we
 came back and reported that
 proposition to the Senate the
 Senate instructed its to go
 bae k mid 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBL refuse and it
 was refused and finally at
 the last hour I think
 within ten or fifteen minutes
 of the inauguration of MI
 Buchanan we agreed to pay
 the money provided the members
 of the House would deliver
 the books up to some
 library in their district We
 would not permit them to
 have it We defied the
 House for two years on
 that ques tion and now
 the House has wisely defied
 us on tbe same question
 We had a long debate
 on this subject m reference
 I think to auditing the
 account of the last C
 Ierk of the House of
 Rep resentatives Mr Cullom and
 we have put pro vision
 after provision since I havé
 been in the Senate into
 appropriation and other bills that
 neither House should charge upon
 its contingent fund any of
 these things and now there
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Senator
 from Ohio will pause The
 Chair must call up the
 special order at this hour
 Mr PUGH I shall be
 through if the Senate will
 permit me a few minutes
 longer Go on Here then
 is our own legislation designed
 to prevent these very things
 and because an exec utive
 officer obeys the law of
 the land and per forms
 his duty Senators rise up
 here to say of him
 behind his back what they
 would not dare to say
 to his face elsewhere JOHNSON
 of Tennessee Mr Presi The
 VICE PRESIDENT Byunanimouscon sent the
 Senator from Tennessee can proceed
 The hour has arrived for
 the consideration of the special
 order Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 1 shall only consume a
 few minutes Irise for the
 purpose of saying a word
 or two in _justification of
 the Sec retary of the
 Senate and of the pay
 clerk It seems to me
 that they have been unnecessarily
 attacked in the discussion upon
 this resolution It is always
 best to understand the facts
 as they are Now what
 are the facts in this
 case In the first place
 a resolution was passed here
 directing the payment ofa certain
 sum of money out of
 the contingent fund which was
 understood to be constructive mileage
 to Dr Linn s widow
 We all remember the circumstances
 under which that resolution passed
 without much investiga tion and
 in fact upon an Appeal
 to the sympathy of the
 Senate I shall not go
 into it now but I
 mnmber the circumstances The resolution
 was passed and went to
 the Secretary of the Senate
 He was anxious and more
 than willing if the law
 would permit to comply with
 the direction of the resolution
 but when the resolution passed
 there was no contingent fund
 out of which the money
 could have been paid even
 if the Iaq v had
 authorized it to be paid
 Before there was an appropriation
 the Secretary was desired to
 draw an acceptance of the
 amount and he mani fested
 every disposition to accommodate the
 parties to my own knowledge
 Both the Secretary of the
 Senate and the pay clerk
 Mr FitzpatMck put themselves to
 great trou bie and as
 chairman of the Committee to
 Audit and Control the Contingent
 Expenses of the Senate I
 put myself to trouble because
 111 y sympathies and feelings
 were with the parties I
 was anxious that they should
 have I went myself to
 the t the money if
 it was due Secretary and
 to the pay clerk and
 endeavored to have the matter
 arranged On examination however the
 conclusion was arrived at that
 the law did not authorize
 the Senate by a simple
 res olution to use the
 contingent fund for such a
 pay ment Upon reference to
 the law it was found
 that it specified the purposes
 to which thc contin gent
 fupd should be applied and
 appropriated For the purpose of
 getting around this difficulty the
 Secretary of the Senate in
 making up his es timate
 of the appropriations required for
 the ex penditures out of
 the contingent fund made out
 this item he submitted it
 to the Committee On Finance
 and that committee were willing
 that it should go inlo
 the appropriation bill and it
 was It went to the
 House of put in by
 the Senate Representatives for their
 concurrence and they struck it
 out of the bill and
 refused to appropri ate the
 money to carry out the
 order of the Senate Is
 not this clear and conclusive
 that Congress did not choose
 to appropriate the money I
 think he has done his
 duty knowebe was anxious more
 than anxious to accommodate the
 parties if the jaw would
 authorize it to be done
 I know what were the
 feelings of himself and the
 pay clerk My sympathies and
 my feelings were with them
 but I thought then and
 think now that the law
 authorized no such thing for
 the Constitu tion is clear
 that no money shall be
 drawn from the Treasury but
 in consequence of appropria tions
 made by law and here
 was an attempt to appropriate
 and Congress positively refused to
 Is it not appropriate the
 specific sum asked for clear
 t Congress did not intend
 to pay it I merely
 anted to say this much
 in justification of the Secretary
 of the Senate and of
 the pay clerk They did
 their duty and their whole
 duty as my personal knowledge
 and cognizance of the facts
 authorize me to say I
 have as much sympathy with
 the parties as anybody has
 and would go as far
 to oblige them but these
 gentlemen have discharged their duty
 and done it faithfully Mr
 CRITTENDEN Mr President 1 rec
 ollect something of what was
 said when the ap propriation
 was refused to be made
 at the last session It
 was supposed by all parties
 so far as I recollect
 that the resolution of the
 Senate was competent itself to
 entitle the grantee to the
 money if there had been
 any money in thc contingent
 fund but that was exhausted
 and when theappro priation was
 refused here and when it
 was under debatc it was
 said Mrs Linn must wait
 the oxler is good let
 her wait until there is
 money in the contingent fund
 and then it will be
 paid That x vas repeated
 over and often My recollec
 tion is distinct about that
 Whenever there is an appropriation
 made for the contingent fund
 and there is money there
 to pay it then she
 can obtain the money that
 is what was said and
 it was said often by
 those who resisted the put
 ting of that sum in
 the appropriation bill There are
 some things Mr President which
 we must do and do
 quiqkly and in order that
 we may repent afterwards we
 must go through with them
 when we begin You have
 granted to this old lady
 the payment of a certain
 sum of money out of
 the contingent fund She relying
 upon that order and all
 that passed here has encumbered
 herself by borrowing monev to
 the amount And now upon
 some scruples arising as to
 your authority to pass the
 order she is to be
 refused the money Your bounty
 if you please to call
 it so your decision on
 a matter of law if
 you choose to consider it
 so has been very ruinous
 to her indeed if she
 is to be dealt with
 and the resolution is to
 be dealt with in this
 way We have embarrassed instead
 of benefiting her VVhat was
 it that the Senate decided
 and what is the report
 of the Secretary of the
 Senate He says that Mr
 Linn had nothing due him
 He says that he received
 his pay all that any
 Sena tor received The Senate
 was perfectly apprised of that
 when they passed this order
 The Sena tors had not
 received the constructive mileage but
 a case having afterwards occurred
 in which Senators did receive
 it all of us pretty
 nearly upon a construction put
 by the Presidinz Offcer of
 tl is House it led
 the way to an application
 by Mrs Linn s friends
 that her husband then dead
 should be allowed constructive mileage
 for some anterior session and
 the Senate decided It was
 evasion then that she should
 have it it seems to
 me with great respect a
 mere eva Sion of thc
 order to say there was
 nothing due to Senator Linn
 There w as nothing due
 to him unless he should
 have constructive mileage and that
 the very thing that you
 intended to de cide thane
 should have This body ordered
 this payment of constructive mileage
 to Dr Linn s widow
 the Presiding Officer of the
 Senate having decided that a
 subsequent Senate was entitled to
 it and it having been
 paid you having enforced i
 the payment by law and
 thc Secretary who had paid
 it having been indemnified for
 it and the Sec retary
 would have been indemnified if
 he had paid this money
 Thore is no doubt of
 it The case Now sir
 I think we retreat from
 rour act in this way
 we cannot retreat from anetæO
 f which the parties have
 bad the ment and then
 leave them Lo all the
 consequences and embarrassments that will
 result from our error Money
 has been appropriated to the
 eon tingent fund as I
 understand kt is in the
 control of the Senate under
 this very law and your
 power in using and applying
 is only limited by the
 section which has been read
 but Lwill read it a
 Cam No part of the
 appropriations which maybe at anytime
 made for the contingent expenses
 of either House Of Con
 gress The appropriation is made
 for both Housesof Congress but
 neither House shall be allowed
 to apply it to any
 other than the ordinary expend
 itures of the Senate and
 Hause of Representatives nor as
 extra allowance to any clerk
 messenger c This is alirßitat_ion
 upon your power Oth erwise
 as soon as the appropriation
 had been made for the
 contingent expenses the Senate had
 the right to determine without
 limit how that money should
 bedpplied and w hat should
 be coh sidered as coming
 writdiinthe term contingent ex penses
 But hero isa limitation upon
 it it shall be applied
 to the expenses ot the
 one or th e other
 of the Houses of Cöngress
 the ordinary expend What are
 the ordinary expenditures of the
 Senate The payment of its
 members is the most take
 it and whether they shall
 be entitled for this session
 or that session to mileage
 or actual is a question
 for the Senate left by
 law Senators have not been
 in the habit ef taking
 this constructive mile aze but
 you to construe that law
 r anå if you this
 to be within the ordinary
 expenditures of the Senate the
 Senate had the right so
 to decidb and the Secretary
 was bound to pay it
 if there was money enough
 in the con tingent fund
 to pay it That is
 the plain reading of the
 law That is a course
 of practice consist ent with
 the dignity of the Senate
 If the Senate say it
 has beervapplied to objpcts within
 the limits of the law
 who shall question that We
 should have to gobefore the
 Comptroller and before our own
 offeer at this rate to
 argue andi to vindicate every
 application we make of the
 money All the appropriation yequired
 by law has already made
 that is an appropriation to
 the contingent fund and if
 N e should direct extra
 mileage or constructive mileage to
 be paid our order to
 that offect unlcss there is
 somebody who can question our
 decision on thåt point makes
 it become part of the
 ordinary expenses of the Senate
 The only question is this
 is the payment of extrae
 mileage within the construction of
 the Senate D oesåt depend
 upon their con struction May
 they decide it Unquestionably they
 may Who is there to
 questiom it one who preceded
 that it was the fair
 and proper construction An act
 of Congress has since said
 that that constructionu shall be
 given no more and think
 very jpstl r and properly
 but until that repealing clause
 It might have been given
 Now sir recurring undéra vious
 law Them Senate decided it
 the Senate resolved that this
 money shouldbe paidf and the
 person in you resolVed it
 shouid be paid relying om
 your order has borrowed the
 Inoney and is nCw a
 debtor iO unless this amount
 be actmlly paid by your
 offcer Is this the position
 for us Ito F we
 have com mitted an best
 w ay to get out
 of it Let us pay
 the money and repent of
 what have done and dO
 so That is the only
 way to escape like seems
 to me frorn i the
 error into whichiwe have got
 sand I thinkthut is an
 argument that wilk be conclusive
 vith my friend from PUGH
 Mr is ull L liavet
 to say 0m the do
 not appeal to gentlemen s
 subject thies I only facts
 of teh e case a
 venerable old l hd y
 to Ibe sure but L
 she would not dksii e
 any appeal to made fo
 carried up to the Comptroller
 has been an antici you
 on that scorem She has
 been very for pated case
 a moot question Now if
 I pay i the bountiful
 spirit no doubt in w

 that Congress this will you
 allow the account lution was
 first she will have occa
 not an actual did not
 recognize the act of the
 Senate as being case not
 a case of an actual
 payment and a pre Sion
 to regard it as a

 to be legal Now why
 should the Secretary of the

 be allÖwed credit for it
 kept ou t of the
 money because bem made Sénate
 be held up to censure
 before the country but a
 case mooted between the different
 officers a debtor for 3

 pay an amount which the

 is left in old age
 beyond the hope of other
 702 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 2 meåns I believe that
 is her situation told it
 iss by an authority upon
 whom I perfectly rely What
 we have done Ihay have
 been wrong but if it
 is Ithink we had better
 pay up and conclude this
 matter at once settle according
 to the error and be
 done With and do so
 no more Mr BAYARD I
 do not desire to continue
 the debate but simply to
 read an extract from th
 e Journal of the Senate
 which is very material in
 the view of the Senator
 from Kentucky as an evidence
 of the motives and reasons
 that influence legislative bodies I
 do not know whatwas said
 or commonly talked about I
 suppose the reports will show
 it if it was said
 publicly butl do know the
 story the Journal tells On
 page 488 of the Journal
 it appears that Mr FÉSSENDEN
 from the Committee on Finance
 to whom were referred the
 amendments of the Senate to
 the bill of the House
 of Rcprcsentativcs No 499 to
 supply de ficiencies ili the
 appropriations for the service of
 the fiscal year ending the
 30th of June 1860 disagreed
 to by the House and
 thc amendments of the House
 of Representä tives to other
 amendments of the Senate to
 the said bill reported thereon
 l he Senate proceeded to
 consider thc amendments of the
 Hbuse of Representatives to the
 second and third amendments of
 the Senate to the said
 bill and On motion by
 Mr FESSENDEN Resolved That the
 Senate concur in the said
 amend ments The Senate proceeded
 to consider its fourth amend
 ment to the said bill
 disagreed to by the House
 of Repre sentatives as follows
 insert To enable the Secretary
 of theu Senate to comply
 with the Senate s resolution
 of the 20th of March
 1860 in rela tion to
 mileage to be paid to
 Més A Linn widdw of
 the late Senator Lewis F
 Linn 2 672 On motion
 by Mr FESSENDEN that the
 Senate recede fröin its said
 amendment It Was determined in
 the affirmative yeas 37 nays
 8 It seems to me
 therefore that the action of
 the Senate appearino on its
 Journal shows that it intended
 that the money should be
 paid by a spe cific
 appropriation T te original resolution
 was passed as many are
 introduced without objcc tion by
 unanimous consent as it is
 called no at tention called
 to it and the day
 it was introduced it was
 passed by the Senate being
 a mere order of this
 body alone Subsequently thc Committee
 on Finance reported the amendment
 I have read being desirous
 of giving effect to the
 order ac cording to law
 The House of Representatives saw
 fit to reject the amendrncnt
 and when the question came
 to the Senate they assented
 to the decision of the
 Housc of Representatives on the
 yeas and nays b 37
 to 8 Mr HUNTEÆ As
 my name has been con
 nected with this matter will
 say a word I had
 a communication with Mr Fitzpatrick
 on the subject I wrote
 no letter about it but
 it seems I t old
 bim that I supposed it
 was compulsory on tl ie
 officers of tho Senate to
 comply with the or derg
 of the Senate but after
 an examination of the question
 the Committee on Finance thought
 differently nnd the anNl dment
 which has bccn rcferrcd to
 was introduced by the Finance
 Com mittce showing clearly that
 they thought it rc quircd
 an appropriation in order to
 legalize it 1 have not
 lookcd at the yeas and
 nays but I ex pect
 I was one of those
 who voted to tcccde even
 from tl 1Qt amendrnent Mr
 G WIN I hope the
 Senate will take up the
 Indian appropriation bill now It
 was made the special order
 for one Q clock The

 BILL The Senate as in
 Committee of the Whole resumcd
 the consideration of thc bill
 H R 865 making appropriations
 for the current and con
 tingent expenses of the Indian
 department and for fulfilling treaty
 stipulations with various In dian
 tribes for the year ending
 Junc 30 1862 Mr FITCH
 1 am directed by the
 Committee on Indian Affairs to
 offer the following amend ment
 to come in on page
 27 line six hundred and
 thirty three after the appropriations
 in the bill for the
 Pottawatomies For reappropriation of this
 amount due the Pottawato mies
 of Indiana the Pottawatomies of
 the Prairie the Pot tawatomics
 of Washbash included in tbc
 warrant No 19 of the
 War Department for the fiscal
 year ending June 30 1847
 being balances of appropriations to
 fulfill treaty stip ulations for
 paynent of annuities carried to
 the surpfus fund 60 to
 bg paid to the said
 Indians during the current iscai
 year It will be perceived
 by the Senate that this
 is a mere reappropriation of
 money which has been carried
 to the surplus fund from
 the ordinary an nuities payable
 to Indians The amendment was
 agreed to Mr SEBASTIAN followingamend
 ment recommended by the Department
 to be added to the
 bill For pay nent to
 A J Campbell son of
 Scott Campbell noxv deceased in
 filll consideration of the money
 stipulated to be paid and
 land confirlned to said Scott
 ill the original draft of
 the treaty with thc Sioux
 of the 29th o Septernber
 1837 the ninth clause of
 the sceond article c 10
 000 Mr PEARCE 1 should
 like to have a factory
 explanation of this As I
 understand by a treaty of
 ancient date there were two
 articles one for the payment
 of an annuity to Scott
 Camp bell and the other
 for a reservation of five
 hun dred acres of land
 but it seems that the
 Senate in the ratification of
 that treaty struck out these
 two items Now after the
 lapse of thirty four years
 we are asked t o
 appropriate 10 000 to satisfy
 the son of Scott Campbell
 That is as rnuch as
 know about it and on
 that statement of facts it
 seems to me there is
 hardly enough to authorize the
 payment of the amount Mr
 SEBASTIAN The Senator from Mary
 land is very widely mistaken
 as to the facts of
 the case and when I
 recapitulate them to the Sen
 ate they will see that
 it occupies a very differ
 ent attitude frorn that which
 he has ascribed to it
 The age of the claim
 so far from being th
 irty four yenrs is onlyfrom
 1837 to 1858 twcnty one
 years the claim bcing continually
 pressed all thc time by
 the Sioux Indians in all
 their different councils held with
 the United States In brief
 the history of hc claim
 is this in 1837 a
 pro vision was made for
 the personal benefit of an
 old settler trader and agent
 arnong the Sioux Scott Campbell
 by which lhc United States
 agreed to guaranty him an
 annuity of 450 payable for
 twenty years and to confirm
 him in a tract of
 five hundred acres of land
 This provision of tbc treaty
 was stricken out imagine under
 tlVoree of what was known
 as Mr Calhoun s resolution
 of that day by which
 all personal provisions were invariably
 stricken out of the Indian
 treaties Ilhe debt however remains
 the moral obligation and the
 consideration which prompted it remain
 although the Senate to adhere
 to its rules struck out
 these provisions in the treaty
 Then in 1858 only a
 little more than two years
 since when these same Indians
 came to treat with the
 United I States acyain they
 insisted upon this old debt
 this old stipulation of the
 treaty which they said had
 not been complied with by
 the United States and they
 alleoed that is x vas
 onc of the movine considerations
 for the formation of the
 treaty of 1837 and that
 when the Ül lited States
 Senate struck it out of
 the ratification of the treaty
 the conserj t or approbation
 of the Indians to this
 alter ation of the treaty
 was not given The alteration
 was made by the sole
 act of the United States
 having never been submitted to
 the India ns and they
 said it never had their
 assent Of course the debt
 stood just where it stood
 originally at the date of
 the treaty of 1837 forming
 a part of the consideration
 one of the prompting motives
 for the negotiation of that
 treaty In 1858 bv article
 nine of the treaty of
 that year they speak as
 follows of it and the
 Senato will see precisely the
 condition which this debt occupies
 now its legal position ART
 9 As the Senate strtlck
 from the treaty with the
 Mendawakanton band of Sioux of
 the 29th day of Septem
 her 1837 the ninth clause
 of the second article and
 the whole of the third
 article of said treaty which
 provided for the payment of
 four hundred and fifty 450
 dollars an nually for twenty
 years to Scott Campbell and
 confirmed to the said Scott
 Campbell a title to five
 hundred 500 acres of land
 which he then occupied said
 payment and land being deerned
 by said Indians to form
 a part of the consid
 eration tor whie h they
 ceded to the United States
 a ccrtain tract of land
 in said treaty specified which
 reduction in the consideration iör
 said land has never bccn
 sanctionöd by said Indians the
 said Mendawakanton and Wahpakoota bai
 ds now request that provision
 be made for the payment
 ofthc sunl often thousand 10
 000 dollars to A J
 Campbell the son of said
 Scott Calnpbell now decease i
 in fuli con sideration of
 the lnoney stipulated to be
 paid and land con finned
 to said Scott Campbell in
 the original draft of said
 treaty aforesaid which subject is
 hereby submitted to the Senate
 tor its favorable consideration This
 entire treaty with the recommendation
 at the close of it
 was confirmed in 1858 by
 the Uni ted States Senate
 without this article being qual
 ified amended or stricken out
 It is therefore a part
 of the law of the
 land for whatever it is
 worth It clearly acknowledges the
 facts upon which the debt
 is created it recites them
 and makes them conclusive and
 refers the question of its
 favor able consideration to the
 Senate of the United States
 Now sir when this question
 was being con sidered before
 the Committee on Finance if
 it is allowable in me
 to refer to my knowledge
 of its consideration there us
 well as before the Com
 lüittee on Indian Aflhirs the
 only question was not as
 to the validity of the
 debt but whether the past
 action of the United States
 Senate in ratifying this treaty
 had made it conclusive so
 that it should be considered
 as a subsisting debt under
 existing treaties of the United
 States It is recommended to
 the favorable consideration ofthc Senate
 This is an agreement between
 the President of the Uni
 ted States and the Indian
 tribe When therefore the Senate
 ratified the treaty with the
 stipulation in it did not
 objeet to it did not
 qualify it did not strike
 it out I consider that
 the subject is fairly before
 the Senate The form of
 the amendment which has been
 sent to the Secretary s
 table ob viateS all contrariety
 of opinion as to the
 question whether it isa debt
 or not for although I
 believe that ratification of the
 treaty by the Senate was
 a favorable action upon it
 an indorsement of its validity
 yet that amendment which was
 not read th rough because
 of the interruption of the
 Senator from Maryland provides for
 that very case that the
 decision of the Senate shall
 be regarded as a full
 compliance with the terms of
 the treaty and fu rthermore
 when the Senate votes upon
 that according to the last
 and the strictest letter of
 the treaty there will be
 the favorable action of the
 Senate I think it has
 received already the very highest
 sanction which the Senate could
 give it because if its
 reforence here refers to the
 Senate as a part of
 the executive department it has
 given a vote ratifyil g
 it by two thirds if
 it refers to it as
 a separate body of Congress
 or as a part of
 the legislative department of the
 Government then it can ffive
 its sanction now by a
 vote to which a majority
 only is necessary to give
 it validity so that it
 bas already received tl le
 very highest sanc tion Qfthe
 Senate in that form of
 proceeding which requires the highest
 majority and think it has
 complied literally with the terms
 of the treaty Mr G
 WIN Is not this a
 private claim It seems to
 me it is a private
 claim in favor of an
 individual and therefore the rule
 prohibits it Mr SEBASTIAN The
 Senator from cali fornia wiH
 allow me to say that
 the fact that an appropriation
 of money is proposed for
 an indi vidual alone or
 for an association or company
 of individuals does not constitute
 it a private claim where
 it is due under an
 existing treaty or an existing
 law A private claim has
 always been decided by the
 concurrent voice of different oc
 cupants of the chair to
 be a case where the
 bene 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 703 fits of it went
 to an individual or to
 a company of individuals and
 Avhere it required the acti0ß0f
 Congress to make that a
 debt which before vas only
 claim but where it is
 due under treaty or an
 existing law and is a
 clear debt it makes no
 difference ibis a debt of
 the Governmeot whether it goes
 to one individual or to
 a department of the Government
 to the Army or to
 thc Navy and those have
 always been ruled as coming
 within the rule of the
 Senate authorizing amendments to be
 inserted on money bills Mr
 PEARCE I think the objection
 made by the Senator from
 California is well taken This
 is not a debt established
 by law or by treaty
 The ninth article of the
 treaty of 1858 which the
 Senator read docs nothlng but
 provide that the subject matter
 of this claixn shall be
 referred to thc Senate for
 its adjudication Ifthe Senate had
 adjudged that thie was rightfully
 due to Scott Campbell or
 Scott Campbell s son the
 case would be brought within
 the rule as announced by
 t he If the Senate
 had af Senator from Arkansas
 firmed bv a separate resolution
 as is ordinarilt the case
 tinder such circumstances that this
 Siu of should be paid
 to Scott Campbell under the
 ninth article of the treaty
 thcn the ciaim would have
 been made certain but the
 Senate by the ratification of
 the treaty of 1818 has
 done noth ing more than
 this to agree t o
 the proposition of the ninth
 article which is that that
 claim shall be submitted to
 the Senate for its examination
 The Senate have never adjud
 ted it and until they
 have adjudged it it does
 not come under thc treaty
 or existing law I think
 therefore the point of order
 made by the Senator from
 California is welt taken and
 this is not such an
 amendment as can be madc
 in order The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr in the chair The
 Chair will ask that the
 amend ment be again read
 Mr SEBASTIAN That is just
 what 1 was goino to
 ask The Secretary read it

 Yes sir lthe PRESIDING OFFICER
 There is no question that
 it is a private claim
 in its nature to reflect
 upon the subject he feels
 obliged to rule other amendment

 out of order as not
 coming within report of the
 Secretary of the Interior and

 I Commissioner of Indian Affairs
 to be inserted existing law
 subject of course to the
 reversal of as a new
 section the Senate Mr RICE
 The clause of thc treaty
 of 1837 alluded to was
 stricken out by the Senate
 and never submitted to the
 Indians Now the ques tion
 is whether that clause in
 tho treaty of 1837 is
 in force or not The
 Senate ratified a portion of
 the treaty A portion they
 refused to ratify and never
 consulted the Indians in regard
 to it a bargain broken
 on It has often been
 said hero If the Gov
 one side is broken on
 both sides crnment can make
 treaties with the Indians and
 when they are brought here
 the Senate can ratify a
 portion and not the balance
 and not refer the portion
 stricken out back to the
 Indians where is I contend
 that this the use of
 making treaties is carrying out
 the treaty of 1837 and
 that only The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Unless an peal be taken
 from the decision of the
 Chair there is no question
 befbre the Senate Mr RICE
 I take an appeal v9nd
 bc it further enacted That
 for the relief Of destitute
 indians and with a view
 of preventing sunuri0g amopgtbe Indian
 tribes who have failed in
 raising crop from the drouth
 of the last sununer thére
 be appropriated the sum of
 50 000 provided That the
 amount shall pended if necessary
 within tile present fiscal year
 Mr PEARCE I should like
 to know what Indian tribes
 are to have the benefit
 of this appro priation The
 IRnguEve is very general Mr
 SEBASTIAN It is not any
 tribe specifically but to be
 applied to all those that
 come within the terms of
 the amendmén t that is
 destitute Indians likely to starve
 or suffer from the failure
 of the crops upon the
 extreme urestern frontier of the
 United States which fail ure
 I believe extends from Texas
 to the most northern tribes
 of the United States It
 is gen oral charitable fund
 which will be disposed of
 and appropriated by the conimissioner
 whenever the necessit ies and
 the exigencies of theuse may
 warrant its application The amount
 that was PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator asked for by the
 Commissioner of Indian Affairs from
 Minnesota appeals from the decision
 of the was 100 000
 The committee thought in conse

 the Commissioner with those conditions
 From this decision of the
 recommends an appropriation of this

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 2
 The PRESIDING OFFICER These are
 two separate aroundmen ts which
 at the request of the
 Senator from Arkansas will be
 considered to gether unless some
 Senator calls for their sepa
 rate consideration Mr PEARCE I
 would raise the question in
 regard to these amendments whether
 they arc within the rule
 of the Senate if they
 come within some general law
 which makes them an éxcep
 tion to the ruleof the
 Senate I would like it
 to be shown do not
 perceive by the reading of
 the amendments that they me
 so Mr SEBASTIAN They Come
 literally within the provisions of
 the sixteenth section the Sen
 has the volume before him
 of the act of the
 30th of June 1834 It
 is an act which is
 almost Éib e of the
 Committee on Indian Affairs and
 that department of the public
 service which has 10 ig
 since been construed and is
 well understood By the sixteenth
 section of that act it
 is provided that wherever any
 white person goes on an
 Jn dian reservation or in
 a part of territory reserved
 for Indian purposes and commits
 any depredation or trespass by
 stealing or destruction of their
 property the United States will
 become rcspon Sible or it
 in case the Indian does
 not seek any private revenge
 if they attempt to arrest
 the dep iedators and bring
 them to justice or else
 show cause why they have
 not done it The teStimony
 in this case the certificate
 of the United States agent
 shows clearly that it was
 ut terly impossible for them
 to bring the depreda tors
 of that day and place
 to public justice There was
 unfortunately a plentiful lack of
 both public aid private justice
 in Kansas at that day
 It was impossible for the
 Indian to enforce his own
 rights against the stroryr arm
 of violence that pervaded the
 whole Territory To show this
 fact conclu sively I will
 state that tho IJnited States
 marshal arrested ten or fifteen
 offenders and they were b
 ound over but finally escaped
 Many of the deprédators they
 were unable of course in
 con sequence of the character
 of the times to identify
 Some they pursued urid satisfied
 themsel vcs that the depredators
 belong to white hen but
 who they were could never
 be positively ascertained many of
 the cases but when they
 did ascertain it tho means
 for enforcing the law were
 so en feebled in consequence
 of the disturbed state of
 affairs that it would have
 becn idle to expect an
 Indian to show that alacrity
 and energy in pros ecuting
 a white man for depredations
 upon a weak and helpless
 tribe that would have been
 expected from other persons The
 Commissioner of Indian Affairs in
 his off Cial communication says
 that in view of all
 the circumstances he thinks they
 have exercised all the diligence
 and used all tl te
 energy which un der the
 circumstances could have been expected
 of them und thereforc the
 strict literal terms of this
 sixteenth section ought not to
 be enforced against them At
 thc last session of Congress
 in the case otethc Shawnees
 from the same consid eration
 precisely and for depredations committed
 upon Indians In the same
 way and under the same
 circumstances we passed without any
 diffi cult y here at
 all an act indemnifying them
 for depredations committed upon them
 and waived a strict compliance
 with the provision in the
 six teenth section Mr PEARCE
 The sixteenth section of the
 act provides That where fn
 the commission by a white
 person of any crilne offense
 or misdemeanor within the Indian
 coun try Lbe property any
 friendly Indian s taken injured
 or destroyed gud a conviction
 is had for such crime
 offense or misdemeanor Lbe person
 so convicted shall be sentenced
 10 pay c And then
 it further provides ti hat
 if such offender cannot be
 apprehended and brought to trial
 the amount of sue h
 property shall be paid out
 of the Treasury as aforesaid
 The only thing which appears
 to be definite in the
 statement of the Senator is
 that it has not been
 suffciently proven that any of
 these depro dations were c
 ommitted by white persons He
 says they have satisfied themselves
 Mr SEBASTIAN The Indian agent
 is sat and the office
 is satisfied me a moment
 The provision of the sixteenth
 section which has been read
 has two aspects one in
 case of the apprehension and
 convictidn of the offender or
 if that cannot be done
 in either case they are
 entitled to indemnity at the
 Treas ury In case of
 the apprehension and conviction of
 the offender of course that
 furnishes the high est evidence
 of the identity of the
 person but it naturally supposes
 that where they have not
 been apprehended and convicted there
 must be something eise than
 that evidence the character of
 which carries absolute certainty with
 it The evidence therefore in
 this case is all that
 is re quired and that
 they have furnished by their
 own affidavits and by the
 certificate of the United States
 Indian agent that it was
 utterly impossible to ascertain who
 the offenders were or to
 bring them to justice The
 act of course contemplatcs just
 such a state of facts
 as exists in the present
 case because the Indians are
 to be redressed v hether
 the depredator is convicted and
 punished or they were unable
 to procure his conviction Or
 course under the latter clause
 of the act it would
 be in vain that we
 should expect they could al
 ways identify the man because
 when they iden tified him
 they could use every exertion
 to bring him to juslice
 T hc act does not
 contemplate it as the Senator
 will sec Mr FESSENDEN I
 do not know anything about
 the merits of this amendment
 It may be all very
 just and right but I
 think the Senator does not
 get rid of the objection
 made as a ques tion
 of order in relation to
 it A very large num
 ber of our claims come
 under some general law There
 are a great many ut
 ider _the post omce law
 for services rendered There are
 a great many under otl
 er laws of d ifferen
 t descriptions but that is
 not what is meant by
 the rule because in that
 way you might put every
 claim against this Gov erpment
 for services performed under a
 general law upon the appropriatiorf
 bill That is not what
 is meant There must be
 a law applying to the
 particular subject and a law
 passed with reförence to fixing
 the particular debt itself and
 an appropriation for that individual
 otherwise you will bring everybody
 on these appropriation bills So
 it has been held by
 the Chair in decid ing
 this question I lere is
 a law to be sure
 that may cover a thousand
 cases but there is no
 as certainment no liquidation under
 this general law at all
 and therefore t his claim
 is not entitled to come
 in under that law and
 be Ult on an appro
 priation bill Mr SEBASTIAN The
 premises of the Sen ator
 are right hc is only
 mistaken as to the fact
 Ele says that every claim
 to come on an appro
 priation bill must arise under
 somc law That is true
 Every claim to go upon
 a money bill must arise
 under some existing law or
 treaty must also be definite
 in amount and I imagine
 us a general principle it
 must be nruade definite by
 the aut hority that lias
 a right to do so
 the agent ap pointed by
 law for that purpose That
 is pre ciscly the state
 of the facts which are
 involved in the question now
 before the Senate It belongs
 to the Indian department to
 ascertain and define the amount
 which is due upon proof
 under the law and it
 is under the estirnates of
 that very depart ment to
 which the law has confided
 this duty tha t we
 ask for a particular number
 of dollars and cents to
 fulfill the stipulations of the
 law It wants noth incr
 according to the proposition of
 the Senator to make it
 a complete and existing Mr
 BRAGG Is it estimated fot
 by the de pa rtrnent
 Mr SEBASTIAN Yes we reduced
 the estimate about seven hundred
 dollars The PRESIDING OFFICER These
 claims are undoubtedly of a
 private character but that would
 not exclude them under tbc
 rule neces sarily The question
 then arises are they in
 pur suance of the provisions
 of some existing law or
 treaty stipulation If so they
 are admissible under the rules
 The Chair has barely heard
 the reading of the treaty
 under which it is claimed
 that these amendments come in
 order and with out time
 for consideration the first impression
 and the prgsent impression of
 the Chair is that Mr
 SEBASTIAN lofferthefollowingamend memt to come
 in at the end of
 ghe bill For payment to
 the orphans and their heirs
 provided for in the first
 article of the treaty of
 1832 with the Creek In
 dians and to be in
 lieu of tbc invcstment of
 200 000 re quired to
 be made by the sixth
 article of the treaty of
 1856 with the same Indians
 the general council of the
 Creeks representing both the nation
 and the orphans having pro
 posed and agreed to substitute
 the present invested fund of
 the said orphans arising from
 the sale of their lands
 under the treaty of 1832
 for a nd in place
 of the investment of 200
 000 for purposes of education
 required by the sixth article
 of the treaty of 1856
 and that said amount shan
 be paid to said orphans
 and their heirs which arrangement
 has been sunctioned and approved
 by the Department of the
 Interior payment to be niade
 to the said orphans and
 their heirs under such regulations
 or instructions as the Secretary
 of the Interior Shail prescribe
 200 000 It is hardly
 necessary to explain the amend
 ment It involves no appropriation
 it isa mere exchange of
 one Creek fund for another
 which suits the convenience of
 the Creek tribe of ln
 dians and wrhich they ask
 for through their na ti
 al council he amendment was
 agreed to Mr SEBASTIAN 1
 omer one other amend ment
 which believe is the last
 that I have For carrying
 into effect the eleventh article
 of the treaty with the
 Ch6ctavv tribe of Indians Inade
 the 22d day of June
 1855 and the award of
 the Senate made pursuant thereto
 on the 9th of March
 1859 the siun 85 being
 the undisputed balance due them
 So much thereof as the
 proper authorities of the tribe
 shall determine to be necessary
 for the payment of the
 claims which by the twelfth
 article of the treaty the
 Choctaws have assurned to pay
 and of such other liabilities
 of the tribe as Lbey
 may ascertain and determine to
 be just shall be paid
 over on their requisition at
 such time and in such
 manner as they shall request
 and the residue remaining after
 satisfying such claims and liabilities
 shall be held in trust
 for the benefit of the
 Choctaws accord ng to the
 provisions of the thirteenth article
 of the said treaty In
 lieu of making such payments
 in money the Secretary of
 the Treasury may at his
 discretion issue to the Choctaws
 on their requisi tion as
 aforesaid certificates of stock in
 the natne of the United
 States bearing interest at the
 rate of six per cent
 per annul semi annually at
 the l reasury of the
 United States said certificates to
 be redeemable in ten years
 or sooner at the pleasure
 of the Pvsident if the
 Uni ted States and to
 be transferable by the proper
 authorities of the Choctaw nation
 in such form as the
 Secretary of the l reasury
 shall prescribe Provided l hat
 the question whether the undetermined
 balance not now appropriated or
 1 130 000 of the
 sum reported by the Committee
 of Indian Aflhirs as due
 to the Choctaws under the
 treaty and award aforesaid is
 a legitimate chargc against the
 Choctaws by the terms of
 said award be reserved for
 the future decision of the
 Senate This is an amendment
 with which the Senate is
 somewhat familiar which provides for
 the ful fillment of the
 treaty of 1855 with the
 Choctaws paying them the amount
 ascertained by the arbi trati01
 of the Senate on the
 9th of March 1859 It
 will be perceived by Senators
 who are familiar with this
 claim that the amendment abandons
 any proposed action now upon
 anything except what is the
 undisputed balance Tllis is done
 In order that nothing like
 a surprise or hasty action
 shall be had upon the
 whole amount of the claim
 The amount now asked for
 is undisputed every wl ere
 by all the departments of
 the Government and undisputed in
 any debate or criticism upon
 this claim which has ever
 taken place heretofore in the
 Senate It is precisely the
 amount which no one questions
 and which every one admits
 to be faithfülly fairly and
 honestly due to the Choctaws
 now It postpones the consideration
 of the balance of it
 to a futurc time when
 under changed circumstances of affåirg
 or when these matters being
 better understood it can receive
 a hearing which shall not
 be even suspected of being
 hasty or inconsiderate It obviates
 the dif ficulty arising out
 of the financial condition of
 the country now by proposing
 to take as cash at
 par the Government six per
 cent bonds payable in ten
 years As a financial operation
 to the Gov ernment that
 evidently would commend itself to
 our serious consideration because they
 take six per cent stock
 in lieu of money for
 which we are absolutely paying
 eleven or twelve per cent
 at this time The Government
 therefore saves this much and
 if there is any sacrifice
 an y de parture from
 what is strictly right the
 Indians are to be the
 sufferers of it and voluntarily
 make the concession now in
 consequence of their great need
 of the appropriation Mr PEARCE
 It is necessary that should
 these claims come equitably within
 the provisiong i The Choctaw
 nation is a large nation
 a civil be roade to
 appear satisfactorily to the Seriate
 or of that treaty and
 therefore are admissible as ized
 nation of more than twenty
 thousand inhab the right to
 reimburse them at the Treasury
 does amendinents to this bill
 That is the ruling of
 the itants and the misfortune
 of the last season the
 hot follow Chair The question
 ison agreeing to these amend
 great drought has operated with
 great hardship Mr FÉSSENDEN Mr

 they need a arge por

 CONGRESS 2D SESSION cal necessities
 and anticipating the wants which
 will evidently come upon them
 the ensuing sea son That
 is a reasork why I
 ask in somewhat an importunate
 manner that the undoubted amount
 due them shall be appropriated
 now leaving for future consideration
 all that has ever been
 ques tioned With this brief
 explanation arising out of con
 siderations which were not applicable
 to the case at the
 _last session I do not
 consider it necessary to go
 into the merits of the
 claim a kind of dis
 cussion which is more apt
 to complicate and mis lead
 than to enlighten the Senate
 Every Senator knows that what
 we ask for here is
 asked for to be paid
 in a mode least inconvenient
 to the Gov ernment by
 which the Choctaws alone lose
 and it is asked for
 as an amount that no
 one ques tions and no
 Senator has ever disputed The
 most strenuous opponents of the
 claim have al ways admitted
 that what is asked in
 the amend ment is strictly
 and legitimately duc Mr FESSENDEN
 1 suppose it will be
 of no use to raise
 a question of order on
 this amend ment as the
 chairrnan of the Committee on
 Fi nance Mr HUNTER last
 year did not deem that
 he could do it and
 I believe he was in
 the habit of raising questions
 of order on every thing
 which he thought did not
 come strictly within the rules
 Therefore 1 shall not attempt
 to do that bat I
 wish to say from the
 little examination and adnlil the
 somewhat inconsiderable examination L have
 given it I am opposed
 to paying anything in the
 present state of things undor
 this Choctaw treaty and the
 subsequent action of the Senate
 thereon The Senator from Arkansas
 says that this amendment only
 provides for so much as
 is un disputed Now sir
 taking the action of the
 Senate two years ago to
 have been an understanding sen
 Sible action supposing the Senate
 perfectly knew what it was
 about at that time and
 did not suffer itself by
 its own inattention to be
 misled into professing to do
 something which it did not
 do it might be very
 true that nobody could object
 to this amount of n
 loney being paid But sir
 last TUESDAY FEBRUARY 5 1861
 markable treaties but that is
 the ground on which it
 is put Under these circumsta
 nces that being so and
 it continuina alongfrom 1830 to
 1855 and there being undoubteäly
 soLne infract ions of the
 treaty I do not know
 how great in 1855 a
 new treaty was made by
 which it was agreed that
 the whole mat ter should
 be lcft to the Senate
 of the United States to
 settle whether they should receive
 the amount of these sales
 as claimed by them or
 a gross amount to be
 fixed by the Senate in
 full for what thoy alleged
 they had suffered by the
 infrnc tion of the treaties
 The Committee on Indian Affairs
 brought into the Senate under
 that pro vision a resolution
 reciting what had been agreed
 upon and providil g that
 the amount should be paid
 over It was brought into
 the Senate by the Senator
 from Arkansas Mr SEBASTIAN as
 chairman of the committee at
 the extra session and there
 were about a dozen words
 passed on the subject My
 friend from New York Mr
 K ING Inquired what it
 meant I have looked into
 the debate A very snort
 explanation was given It was
 said by the Senator from
 Arkansas that in reality it
 was talcii g nothing whatever
 from this because if it
 did not go in this
 way it would go out
 to pay for damages which
 l ad never been ascertail
 cd and never ex arnined
 by anybody in any clainns
 for injuries on account of
 the non perfonnance of cer
 l hat passed I was
 tain conditions of the treaties
 I do not prosume that
 in t he Senate at
 the time half a dozen
 Inembers of the Senate know
 any thing about it We
 knowhow these Indian treaties pass
 here and we know how
 these provisions they cotne in
 under Indian treaties pass here
 frotn tbc Comrnittec on Indian
 Affairs they are stated to
 be ali right and und0
 lbtedly believed to be all
 right I lad it been
 stated to me had I
 been given to understand at
 that tilne that this matter
 was to be left to
 rne to settle as one
 of thc arbi trators to
 examine to understand and to
 award it would not have
 passed writhout my upon it
 I o ivi11R at least
 enough attention to it to
 under sland what I was
 acting upon and I will
 venture year when the proposition
 came up it occasioned to
 say you put the question
 to ahnöst any a very
 considerable debate and the debate
 went nunlber of Senators and
 you will not find that
 there were half a dozen
 who ever knew or ever
 to the whole ma tter
 from the beginning to the
 end I then said in
 the debate after listening to
 it at dreamed that anythingr
 of that sort was done
 much tentively throughout knowing nothing
 about the less that so
 large an amount of Inoney
 was parted specific claim that
 it was evident to my
 mind thc li with as
 it sceni s vas parted
 with at that tirne Senate
 never had understood the question
 never II question put to

 mucll it would to had
 acted understandingly upon it at
 al l and ou Fht
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas Can
 Sen not to bc bound
 by its previous action remain
 ator tell anything about the
 circumstances of any of that
 opinion to this day treaty
 that has been passed and
 confirmed here The state of
 facts is a very simple
 one There and approved of
 four years standinff I have
 were certain treaties made with
 the Choctaw In dians providing
 for an exchange of territory
 east i never heard in
 my life of such a
 course of oppo sition taken
 towards anything as the Senator
 is of the Mississippi river
 for certain territory west In
 1820 and in 1830 the
 pursuing now I would ask
 him does he recorrnize of
 the Mississippi river ti vo
 treaties were made There were
 certain res f at all
 that there is ax y
 termination to any measure ervations
 and certain stipulations on the
 parl of that is ewer
 brought here that there is
 any obliga It may be
 tion that can be consummated
 and made perft ct the
 Government with these Indians true
 and very probably is true
 that smne of these upon
 us to discharge any duty
 by the legitimate stipulations were
 never performed and on the
 official approved actü n of
 both branches of Con strength
 of the non performance of
 these individ gress and the
 Executive And yet he is
 going stipulations the Indians through
 their agents behind the whole
 of that and demanding know
 whoever they might have been
 set up a claim to
 ledffe from cvery one when
 it is utterly impossi blc
 it seems to that it
 can be properly fur NEW
 0 45 If I read
 the debate things have crone
 through aright the Senator from
 Arkansas Mr SEBAS TEAN I
 when inquired of at the
 time by the Sen ator
 from New York Mr KING
 I said very frankly that
 it was a large claim
 that he could not undertake
 to say how much it
 vvas but he thought it
 would not exceed 800 000
 When it came in however
 it was nearly three million
 as re ported and it
 was afterwards struck down to
 or showing the fact that
 no sort of anderstanding was
 had with reference to it
 here in any shape or
 form MT hat is the
 ground upon which it is
 put is put upon the
 ground that it is a
 thing settled an award made
 that the Senate have awarded
 it and therefore we cannot
 go behind it and make
 any inquiry whatever NOW sir
 you cannot apply to t
 hc Senate thc rules of
 law of practice in the
 courts where there is power
 to make de crces and
 to enforce them There is
 nobody to compel the Senate
 to perform its award and
 there fore you cannot arcue
 in that way with regard
 to I he Senate cannot
 be compelled Congress it cannot
 be compelled because there is
 no power big enough to
 do it to perform this
 that is called an award
 and the only question is
 was the award understandingly made
 If it was not if
 we did not know what
 we were about and did
 not take sufficient pains to
 inquire what we vere about
 we have a ricrht to
 reéxamine the matter and in
 quire now what we did
 and it is not only
 a right but a duty
 We are not acting for
 ouFselves we are not the
 parties who pay the money
 The money does not come
 outof our individual pock If
 it wore so we might
 be argued with in I
 ets that way but we
 arc trusteesfbr the public Con
 arcss manages the public money
 as thc trustee of the
 people and because the Senate
 in thought lessl less and
 wilhout information and without consideration
 have made what is called
 an award so monstrous in
 ail its consequences and in
 its it is no reason
 why I should be bound
 amount down by a rule
 of law and be told
 if an award has been
 made against an individual it
 can be enforced by the
 court and therefore you Irrave
 nothing to say in regard
 to it I do not
 hold to the conclusive character
 of this It is my
 duty to award as it
 is called at all I
 am willing to do justice
 to look into it again
 these Indians and if they
 are entitled to the pro
 cceds of these sales on
 a fair and thorough under
 standing and examination of the
 subject I am wiliing that
 they Shaq have the proceeds
 I say however they are
 to them under those treaties
 unless am very much mistaken
 in the vicw take of
 the law with reference to
 the sub ject Moreover it
 being manifest to my mind
 speaking for myself as one
 and speaking fbr many others
 who have told me the
 same thing on the subject
 that that matter passed without
 sufficient examination I ask arc
 we to be told when
 we are act il lR
 for the country in relation
 to millions of dollars that
 because the Senate happened in
 that mode to arrive bt
 that conclusion therefore we must
 spend the money of thc
 public in carry ing that
 out and cannot review our
 own action By no manner
 of means in my judgment
 madc the objcction last year
 that this thing should be
 thoroughly examined by some competent
 tri be paid the whole
 amount of the proceeds of
 the bunal to find out
 ill L he first place
 what the sales of the
 lands which they had ceded
 east of nished or required
 by him Mr FESSENDEN The
 amount ofthcsc clairns was and
 then if the Sen the
 Mississippi river although they had
 a very sas undoubtediy has
 his views on the subject
 and ate should see fit
 on a full examination to
 repass iat ge portion of
 the territory and a muchl
 more It n vay bc
 surprising to him it is
 valuable one west of the
 Mississippi river ceded I have
 rnine to them in exchancre
 Now sir I have read
 theso not surprisin to mo
 I must claim t hc
 privileae apon it in Ibis
 as treaties carefully from becyinningto

 exercising In y own I
 am stat ng why I
 that I am unable to

 i i well as 1

 e shadow of foundation for
 the claim to the pro
 opposed to the w hoic
 of it slated N lr
 President the modc in which
 it ceeds of the sales
 of these lands anything in
 these treaties which gave color
 to the must have been
 passed and I inferred that
 it I pcsscd just as
 Indian treaties Iravc nassed wilh
 idea that the Indians are
 not only to have the
 Y_it 110tice on the part
 of Senators Unquestion lands which
 they received and which they
 re ill ode Ä Ve
 are respons ably it is
 a very ceived in fre
 if I am rightly informed
 west of il le for
 it ourselves feel rcsponsible for
 It the river but in
 addition to that to have
 all done do not undertake
 to find blanne nobody else
 itnd then to for them
 that the treaties prescribed have
 the proceeds of all the
 lands which they con fault
 anybody but yself in relation
 to the matt m so

 concerned and veyed east of

 their only speak from experxence
 as to hot v these
 pretension they would be very
 singular and re 45 fhe
 resolution whicl came from the
 committee last year on tae

 I arn ready to do
 it if it is just
 but I will not be

 knowing that when I act
 I act understandingly on the
 subject i disput that this
 of N our sip It
 may be for aurrht i
 know but I say there
 been no cxamiflation to ascertain
 the The chairman of the

 nor anv mortal man knew
 what the amount of the
 chain is on the part
 of nd there these Indiaiis
 was nor could they t

 at That is no way
 to sctile an I do
 not believe in account of
 this description idea that these
 Indians who I tun informed

 are really the best off
 of any people in the

 to have by the terms
 of this treaty lands by
 a subsequent treaty were to

 great and valuable territory that

 recollec veyed to them by
 the Government have t heir
 tion of it and this
 inquiry is as to the
 amount of expenses paid for
 moving several large reserva the
 sales of this reserved land
 in Mississippi An tions besides
 and then In addition to
 that the award has been
 made The Senator from Maine
 proceeds of every acre of
 land that was conveyed says
 ve are not bound by
 technical rules as indi to
 the Government as a consideration
 for what viduals would bc
 on an arbitrament that we
 can they got west of
 the river It does not
 strike me not be coerced
 That is true but there
 is a moral I do
 not believe it was ever
 intended as just Mr GREEN
 1 shall not undertake to
 violate obligation as strong upon
 the Senate as upon an
 individual and because the sheriff
 cannot come the injunctionofsecrecy by
 saying in what manner and
 take us and put us
 in jail till we obey
 the writ Indian treaties are
 generally ratified I think that
 is no reason why the
 moral obligation of honor is
 a sealed book and I
 shall not undertake to If
 we have provided a should
 not influcncc us penetrate it
 but I will say this
 mode for thc purpose of
 ascertaining the amount Mr FESSENDEN
 The had bettor due them
 and that mode has been
 followed up bring in vote
 of censure on me and
 the amount ascertained and laid
 before the Mr GREEN Not
 at all Department 1 think
 there is a moral obligation
 Mr FESSENDEN He should not
 censure upon us to see
 that that is paid Such
 I under me by implication
 stand to be the case
 in t his instance and
 I under Mr GREEN I
 am speaking for myself but
 stand further that the Department
 acknowledged I must protest against
 this idea that the condition
 it to the extent proposed
 by the amendment of the
 of the Treasury is to
 be a reason why we
 should Senator from Arkansas and
 I think therefore not vote
 this claim I think during
 this session we ought to
 allow it more contradictory positions
 have been taken Mr GWIN
 The Senator from Missouri has
 with regard to claims than
 ever heard before evidently fallen
 into some errors in connection
 Honest creditors of the Government
 who have with this claim
 He says that this claim
 arises expended their means in
 its service come and be
 r from certain lands which
 were reserved to the for
 justice and they cannot be
 heard When their Choctaw Indians
 in Mississippi the proceeds of
 clann is admitted to be
 just they are put off
 with which are to be
 paid over by this award
 The the plea that the
 Treasury is so empty that
 we Senator is entirely mistaken
 Now sir I suppose are
 not able to pay and
 when they have been kept
 therc is no member of
 this body who knows more
 here spending their money year
 after year for ten about
 this subject of the treaties
 in Mississippi or fifteen years
 and at length you allow
 thc claim than myself fbr
 I was fora long time
 resident you say we will
 not pay interest because the
 Gov there ernment is presumed
 at all times to be
 ready to Under thc treaty
 of 1820 the Choctaw nation
 pay it Now these are
 contradictory positions one conflicts with
 the other and I think
 there ccdcd a portion of
 their lands tb the United
 States alid received in consideration
 a large tract of land
 fore that the Senator from
 Maine is not right in
 west of the Mississippi river
 the country they this to
 interpose an objection becausc there
 is no now occupy but
 they only got a possessory
 money title to it such
 as the Indians had in
 other terri Mr FESSENDEN lhave
 not said a word tories
 of the United States which
 had created a about that
 great deal of difficulty In
 1830 a further treaty Mr
 GREEN Bat he is right
 in this we ought was
 made owing to the difficulty
 between thesc to go into
 the merits of the case
 Indians and the govcrnmcnt of
 Mississippi and Mr FESSENDEN The
 Senator could not it became
 a very serious question whether
 there have attended to what
 I said I have not
 said a would not be
 a collision between the United
 States word about there being
 no money in the Treasury
 and the State of Mississippi
 on the subject I confined
 myself entirely to the rnerits
 of the General Jackson sent
 his Secretary df MT ar
 to question make a treaty
 with these Indians Knowing the
 Mr GREEN 1 understood the
 Senator to difficulty between the
 United States and the people
 commence his remarks by saying
 he was opposed of Mississippi
 having shrewd and able men
 as to it in the
 regent condition of the country
 Mr FE ENDEN Not at
 nil their chiefs these Indians
 demanded for the ces Sion
 of the balance of their
 country not only Mr GREEN
 If you did not make
 thosc rc enormous grants for
 their chiefs but a title
 in fee to marks I
 am mistaken I think you
 will find them the magnificent
 cmpire a possessory title to
 which in the reporter s
 notes bcfore you Whether that
 had been given them in
 1820 They received a is
 so or not those remarks
 have bccn made fre patent
 and were thc first tribe
 of Indians that quently and
 I desirc at once to
 enter my protest against that
 process of reasoning We either
 over did so far as
 my knowledge extends for millions
 upon millions of acres of
 land morc than If we
 have have Governlnent or wc
 have not they ceded to
 the United States in 1830
 Not Governinent that Goverrnnent must
 do justicc only that Mr
 President but they have sold
 a If the Government is
 not ablo now to pay
 it does portion of this
 very land to the Chickasaws
 and not prevent them from
 Inaking the allowance received five
 hundred and forty or five
 hundred and it in a
 legal Corin so that vhen
 wc do and fifty tl
 ousand dollars for it Thcy
 have sold a Tet thc
 moncy they can draw it
 without coming portion to the
 United States and received 600
 000 here and petitioning and
 begging and prayincr it Under
 the treaty of 1820 there
 wcre rc Congress to do
 what Congress ought at once
 to scrved hundreds of thousands
 of acres to those do
 pay your debts acknowledge your
 debts ff a man is
 poor it does not prevent
 him from li who chose
 to remain on the laud
 which was then being honest
 Ifthe Government is without funds
 receded They were given the
 land they lived upon Magnificent
 provision was made for thc
 in the Treasury they can
 still make the appro priat
 ion and provide the ways
 and means for orphans The
 lands reserved for them were
 some It will raise the
 credit of your Gov of
 the best in Mississippi and
 gold for enormous paytnent crnment
 and if you have to
 go into market to sunris
 of money There never was
 a treaty undcr which the
 Indians received such benefits as
 the sell your bonds you
 will sell them higher show
 ing that you are determined
 to do justice to all
 Choctaws did under the treaty
 of 1820 Subse but if
 you turn off all and
 do justice to none quent
 disputes arose and numerous acts
 of Con you go into
 Wall street and undertake to
 nego gress have been passed
 proyiding for protecting t iato
 a loan you will fincrthat
 the money brokers the Indians
 in cases where their lands
 had been will be unwilling
 to trust you and they
 ought to I will vote
 taxes I will vote duties
 I will be vote a
 loan I want the Government
 to keep up its honor
 and its character and adequatc
 means for that purpose I
 am at all times ready
 to vote provided you will
 do justice but without that
 I Bhali not do it
 Now as respects this claim
 I can only say this
 the liltie attention I have
 paid to it is in
 conse quence of the remarks
 of the Senator from Ark
 I view it a little
 differently from the Sen ansas
 taken away from them and
 in those cases scrip wus
 issued to them under thc
 fourteenth and other articles of
 this treaty was for many
 years a citizen of Mississippi
 and I never heard it
 whispered by any man until
 very recently that there was
 a shadow of claim in
 the Choctaws for the proceeds
 of the sales of I
 those lands Enormous grants ivere
 given to I them Their
 chicfk were given principalities and
 I all the heads of
 families that chose to remain
 there were given land The
 years 1834 1835 1836 My
 recollection is that there 1837
 were a great speculative era
 in the history ator from
 Maine was a treilty Inade
 by which they relinquished cer
 of this country in the
 purchase of public lands and
 under that speculation in the
 public lands a vast amount
 of these lands was sold
 at 1 25 per acre
 The money was paid into
 the Treasury Of the United
 States and It was distributed
 out of the Treasury to
 the several States That money
 is not in the Treasury
 This is a claim for
 money that was paid into
 the Treasury more than a
 quai ter of a century
 ago and given away to
 the sev eral States in
 the Confederacy It is not
 in the Treasury now nor
 has it been there for
 a quarter ofa century This
 case is not similar to
 that of the Chicka saws
 who were allowed the whole
 proceeds of the sales of
 their lands The Chickasaws had
 no country to go to
 no magnificent empire as I
 may call it considering the
 number of persons that then
 composed the tribe as the
 Choctaws had The Chickasaws having
 no country to go to
 were given the whole proceeds
 of their lands in the
 State of Mississippi but an
 important provision was put in
 there for the benefit of
 the people of that State
 by which the lands were
 graduated and brought down to
 twelve and a half cents
 an acre while the Choctaw
 lands were kept up until
 the settle ments in the
 State should bring them into
 notice and sell them and
 they were held up until
 very recently at 1 25
 per acre The proceeds of
 those lands must be upwards
 of 7 or 8 000
 000 I have not looked
 into the figures at all
 butl am certain the proceeds
 of the sales of the
 Choc taw purchase made under
 the treaty of 1830 must
 be upwards of 7 000
 000 The claim is gradu
 ated Last vear it was
 2 300 000 this year
 it is 1 200 000
 but I am confident the
 returns will show that the
 net proceeds over all expenditures
 amounted to 3 000 000
 or in that neighborhood AIE
 the proceeds of the sales
 of the Chickasaw lands were
 given to them for the
 reason I have stated they
 had no country to go
 to They went and bought
 a portion of the lands
 of the and gave them
 for the privilege of living
 there These Chickasaws and Choctaws
 have since sold lands to
 the United States for which
 they have received for the
 Chactaws and for the Chicasaws
 The United States paid that
 sum to them in order
 to obtain the privilege for
 the Washita and other Indians
 to occupy a portion of
 their country Sir I undertake
 to say that you may
 take the treaty of 1820
 and the treaty of 1830
 and thei e is not
 a provision in cither of
 thosc treaties that gives them
 a shadow of a claim
 to the proceeds of the
 public lands within the cession
 of 1830 It is an
 enormous in the State of
 Mississippi claim It ought to
 be examined with a great
 deal of care and attention
 So far as I am
 concerned I never heard of
 any action of the Senate
 on the subject although I
 was a member of the
 body unfil this matter was
 brought before the Finance Committee
 a year ago I feel
 it my duty to make
 this statement in connection with
 this Inatter from the knowledge
 I have had of the
 affairs of those tribes of
 Indians heretofore and also to
 sustain the netion of the
 Finance Committee in opposi tion
 to this claim Mr JOHNSON
 of Arkansas The Senator from
 California says he feels it
 his duty to make this
 statement to the Senate in
 connection with this matter He
 also says that he has
 not looked into it at
 all and therefore think he
 throws a shadow over all
 that he says in that
 respect when he makes an
 assault upon what is undoubtedly
 and undeniably the action of
 this Government under all the
 highest sanctions that can be
 thrown around it That I
 knöw will not be disputed
 I The Senator from California
 carries us back to the
 treaties of 1820 and 1830
 What are we consid ering
 now It is proposed that
 we shall make an appropriation
 m accordance With the exact
 terms of a treaty entered
 into under the fult authority
 of this Government and maturely
 considered by this Senate in
 executive session after previous examination
 in the Committee on Indian
 Affairs after a reference of
 it to the Interior Department
 and full consideration of it
 there by as able an
 offcer as this Government has
 ever had at the head
 of that bureau After all
 this after the treaty has
 been confirmed by the Senate
 and the award made under
 the authority of this Government
 and the items and particulars
 all considered and re ported
 and the award acted upon
 objection is made to giving
 it the sanction of the
 Senate i will ask the
 chairman of the committee what
 is the amount of the
 whole award 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 707 Mr SEBASTIAN Two
 million three hun dred thousand
 dollars Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 Two million three hundred thousand
 dollars is the award and
 it is in pursuance of
 a treaty That treaty made
 in 1855 It is of
 recent date Can it be
 possible that there is any
 truth in the suspicion which
 is thrown around this matter
 that it is en tirely
 baseless The only construction you
 can give to the language
 of the Senator from Califor
 nia is that the whole
 thing is baseless that it
 is all unjust that it
 is all unfounded and you
 arc to bclievc that though
 the Senator says he has
 not examined the case I
 his subject was before Congress
 for a great many years
 until a treaty It was
 then continued was made recoffnizing
 it before one department of
 this Government and another first
 the executive and then the
 Senate until it has come
 to this pass that they
 have had a delegation here
 year tfter year I think
 ever since I have been
 in service in the city
 of Wash ington which has
 been somewhat lengthy After thus
 having the action of the
 Government in dif forent departments
 on this subject can we
 turn around and say we
 will not pay any part
 of this award You are
 not now asked to pay
 the whole amount of the
 old award That portion of
 it which was disputed When
 it was last under consideration
 in the Senate is left
 off You are not even
 asked to consider it Can
 Senators say they will not
 pay that portion of the
 award which no one objected
 to which was clearly ernbraccd
 by your treaty which was
 approved by the De partmcnt
 s and reported here for
 appropriation and which was undispu
 ted and is undispu ted
 upon these generalizations which come
 from the Sena tor from
 California and the Senator frolü
 Maine If the Senate were
 to agree to their argument
 it would seem to me
 to be unreasonable in this
 that it would declare tbc
 fac l that no action
 of this Government can ever
 be conclusive as to the
 payment of any sum of
 money for any purpose or
 to any quarter Neither of
 the Senators I am sure
 can disputc for an instant
 the confirmation of the treaty
 under which this claim arises
 No one I presume will
 dispute t he full consideration
 of the award No one
 will dispute that it was
 approved after a full examination
 by all the branches of
 the Executive Department of the
 Government where it was ne
 cessary prudent or wise that
 it should be exam inod
 or considered There is only
 one difficulty that exist d
 at the last time this
 subject was under consideration which
 was raised by tho Secretary
 of the Interior Mr Thompson
 in considerinq it and that
 was to a portion of
 the award He Kim self
 after going on most laboriously
 to hunt up and find
 every objection that could be
 arrayed could bring forward ol
 iection only to a pnrt
 and that part is not
 included in this appropriation If
 at the time this subject
 was under consideration by thc
 Senate before a proposition had
 been made towards tho close
 of that debate by the
 Commit tee on Indien Affairs
 w 110 had charge of
 it to this effect since
 the Chock taws earnestly pray
 the reccvynition and payrncnt of
 some part of tl lcit
 claims let us make an
 appropriation for tho pres entofthe
 amount which is not contested
 it would have passed at
 once I have thought it
 unfortunate at the present time
 that this measure should be
 brought in with this reduction
 rather than with the claim
 of all their rights not
 their rights as they are
 under stood in this body
 to be generally declared but
 their generally acknowledgcd ts under
 treaty stipulations confirrncd by the
 Senate under awards confirmed by
 the Senate under repeated examin
 ations of every branch of
 the Departrnent where we know
 there is integrity and where
 we thcrc have been hostility
 and opposition of the most
 rigid character brought to bear
 against the admission of any
 part of the claim Does
 not every Senator here know
 or if he does not
 know does he not feel
 that the opposition that is
 made to this matter is
 o eneral that it is
 not only gen eral but
 it comes from a repugnance
 to paying anything hear much
 talk about the neces sity
 before such sums are paid
 of mature and thorough investigation
 That would be nice lan
 guage to hold to these
 tribes who are have no
 question haunting this Hall now
 as they have been haunting
 Congress for many years humble
 petitioners to you reverend Senators
 for thirty years asking you
 to consider their claim and
 re licve them from bogging
 at your door and from
 narily resist those claims which
 are precluded tho expense incident
 to the constant maintenance l
 here from further investiffation by
 our previous of a delegation
 which eats up a decided
 portion action and particularly When
 it must be apparent of
 the means that they have
 in asking you to to
 him as it is to
 every one else that it
 IS idle to talk about
 going into a thorough examination
 now them justice You must
 have a thorough investigation Will
 on these subjects when the
 Senator from Maine the Senator
 from Maine make it No
 sir he admits that he
 has never made an investigation
 of it and when he
 frankly admiis as I understand
 will not do it that
 he would not take on
 himself at any future Mr
 FESSENDEN No Mr JOHNSON Nota
 bit of it You are
 candid and frank in saying
 so for I be licve
 it You will not Who
 wilt Will ama jority of
 this Senate make it Did
 they ever rnake it upon
 any question that ever came
 before us unless it was
 the slavery question Never in
 my day How then shall
 we have a full inves
 tigation I should be pleased
 to know How shall we
 have any action of this
 Government upon which onc or
 two men cannot get up
 and throw a stain and
 an imputation upon the char
 acter and integrity of the
 transaction How can we ever
 bring it to that position
 by anything of sanctity that
 we can throw around it
 that will enable us to
 cast a vote without groat
 danger that we are doing
 absolute violence to truth and
 justice and ricyht Now Mr
 President this case is simply
 this these Indians for a
 o reat nmny years have
 been claiming that this Go
 vernment had not dealt justly
 I time the investigation of
 this matter unless indeed the
 Senate itself were to require
 it of him When this
 is the case I take
 it that the Senator from
 Maine and the Senator from
 California cannot well and with
 justice totally refuse to pay
 any part even of that
 which is undeniable and which
 throughout all our previous action
 has stood un disputed Are
 these Indians to come here
 forever Is it right to
 delay them in this way
 I do not care for
 the sanctity of character which
 economists sock to throw around
 themselves I do not have
 an admiration for that kind
 of ambition which socks distinction
 by denying debts by denying
 honest avid acknowledged and recognized
 obliga tions I do not
 admire that kind of ambition
 which seeks reputation at the
 expense of the Gov ernment
 s own acknowledged obligation Mr
 President I do think that
 this is absolutely the most
 palpable and glaring and the
 worst case and settled fairly
 v rith them That complaii
 t has of evasion that
 i have met with here
 in all the dealings with
 our Indian tribes With them
 it is been Inade by
 thenl for great number of
 years as the remarks of
 the Senator from California famous
 and notorious that we have
 been a taskmaster to speak
 the best and have been
 but At len2tll sorne few
 years since havc shown Congress
 and the Go verritnent woke
 up so far ns severe
 close and rigid traders Gentlemen
 here I have spoken of
 these Indians receiving a great
 to consider the question and
 upon full investi gation they
 made that treaty All of
 it has been deal of
 land of so much more
 value than that ratified confinned
 and settled and the only
 thing which they parted with
 With what justice can is
 to pay the money such
 a point as that be
 brought before the Senate that
 remains to be doh c
 The last tilne the matter
 can le before us the
 whole when that was done
 in 1830 and they were
 sent to a wilderness I
 shall not add to the
 poetry of amount of thc
 award which was son c
 two mil lion three hundred
 t lwusand dollars was deemed
 i the thing by talking
 about a howling wilderness It
 cainc up to be considered
 but if there could be
 a worse one than that
 to which to be undisputed
 they were transmitted I do
 not know of it upon
 by the Interior Department after
 it had been passed in
 the Indian bureau and was
 partly ex the continent of
 America They were sent off
 there that land was given
 to them in lieu of
 what cepted to by the
 Secretary of tho Interior red
 uci ng it again and
 now when it is brought
 down to the they ceded
 east of the Mississippi Now
 sir Iasi point when it
 is reduced to the balance
 always when tl kcy have
 opened that wilderness and con
 qucred it as it werc
 when you havc derived all
 before uncxcepted to and deemed
 unobjection able and is brought
 beforc you in that Ghapc
 a W tl le benefits
 that you obtained by your
 treaty when thirty years of
 unequaled ud vance through question
 is raised whether the w
 bole claim from out thc
 world have passed Senators turn
 round thc beginnino not been
 rotten and whether every branch
 of the Goverrnnent has not
 fhi sified I i here
 and speak not directly so
 for it would be too
 cross of the immense empire
 that these ln and abandoned
 its in and its in
 telligenee g and whether we
 should i dians have west
 of the Mississippi and that
 yvas whether an is not
 wrono given to theru for
 a lesser amount of lands
 situate pay it to any
 extent or not Nov r
 sir accordijva to my of
 the re east of the
 river and inside of the
 State of Mis i sissippit
 My God what kind of
 respcct for our marks of
 tbc Senator from IVTaino alth
 ou o h 110 has
 ta Icon occasion to declare
 that he did 110t say
 selves can we have when
 we seek to break our
 what I understood him to
 say much of his oppo
 II obligation and disregard it
 and thus defeat our own
 bargains with a helpless people
 upon grounds sition is laO
 to the presel t condition
 of the coun It is
 hardly worth while to com
 I try I do not
 mean that thc Senator intended
 to sucl l as these
 say I do not draw
 that conclusion that he ment
 upon that further i am
 tolerably well satisfied that if
 the Com would not pay
 or i v yree to
 acknowledcre a just debt and
 provide for its payment bccause
 of the mittee on Indian
 Affairs had brought forward their
 condition of the country but
 the conclusion I an wndmentto
 this bill which fortunately for
 their d rat v from
 it is that t hc
 condi lion of the coun
 try is patient chairman has
 not been ruled out of
 order embracing all that was
 due to this tribe of
 In just so far involved
 as the section of the
 country is I should be
 sorry dians there could have
 been easily obtained from concerned
 where the matter is those
 who contest the whole rnatter
 a prom if on account
 of tbc vacancy so many
 seats isc that they would
 pay what was undisputed if
 lately occupied by southern Senators
 justice is I trust it
 is not in tended as
 you would throw over the
 residue but now when not
 to bc had here the
 chance to make something in
 the shape of a declaration
 frcnn the other side in
 the suprem throwing off what
 is disputed has ceased and
 the acy of I heir
 power and thc strength of
 their feet incrs that they
 do not rnean that thc
 condition of only question presented
 is as to the naked
 obligat tion undisputed by any
 man except one here the
 country shall be forgotten in
 their legislation It is no
 cruarantoe no soot hing satisfaction
 to my I the Senator
 from Maine who says he
 does dis soul to know
 that I am herc under
 such circufri pate it and
 it is now disputed by
 him for the I am
 sorry to think thc condition
 of the first timc on
 the part of anybody on
 this floor stances country has
 anything to do with the
 opposition when the committee bring
 forward this which is It
 is a which has passed
 undisputed a contest is made
 on the whole mat to
 this claim ter and we
 are referred back to the
 very begin through every branch
 of the executive depart ment
 that has been th rough
 the treaty making ning if
 not further back than we
 have ever been power and
 been confirmed here that has
 obtained referred before to the
 whole of our intercourse an
 award from the Senatc on
 strict investigation with tho Choctaw
 tribeof Indians I think if
 the When it came up
 wit h ail these sanctions
 before amendiY1ent had been brought
 forward coverinr the Secretary of
 the Interior he cut ofF
 part of the whole amount
 that which was undeniable i
 and undisputed would be appropriated
 the amount and the Indians
 have now come for I
 ward and said Take all
 the balance if you will
 I hope Chat Senators on
 the otherside will con only
 give us what nobody has
 heretofore ob sider this matter
 and that they will not
 vote I trust that acrainst
 a case so pain and
 so fatr jected to I
 am sorry that the Senator
 from California the condition of
 the country has nothing to
 do could lend himself to
 any opposition of this char
 with this opposition From the
 State of Maine it comes
 a little hard to me
 particularly so when acter and
 I do not really believe
 that I could have understood
 him rightly because hc does
 not ordi consider that I
 have always regarded the Sen
 708 ator from Maine to
 be among the fairest on
 this If I could sec
 ark sort of apologv for
 this floor class of opposition
 on the part of the
 Senator apart from the condition
 of the country if the
 Senator would avow that it
 was on account of the
 condition of the Treasury I
 should be disposed I do
 not think the at once
 to ascribe it to that
 other Senators on the opposite
 side of the Cham ber
 can altogethér concur with him
 I hope very much that
 the debate on this matter
 may not be made anterior
 to the formation of our
 treaties and that we shall
 be confined now strictly to
 the sub icct itself and
 that we shall pay these
 people at some portion of
 the amount which we have
 acknowledged to be justly duc
 to thern after full consideration
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 wish to
 set my self right as
 to onc thing if there
 is any necessity for it
 to relieve Senators of any
 mistake that may I was
 very certain arise from my
 expression that I said nothing
 about the condition of the
 counory onc way the other
 and I am informed by
 the reporters of whom I
 have inquired that there is
 no such thing to be
 found in any remarks of
 mine That is an idea
 that sprang up in the
 brain of the Senator from
 Missouri and has been co
 Died it seems by the
 Senator from Arkansas k lr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas I am
 not dis posed to dispute
 the accuracy of the reporters
 shall not be so discourteous
 when the Sena tar has
 taken the pains to make
 the inquiry as to dispute
 what he says I still
 assert however that I so
 understood him but I presume
 i am in error Mr
 FESSENDEN It was a mere
 misunder standing of course Mr
 JOHNSON 0f Yes but 1
 did not cop Mr BESSENDEN
 1 10 not deem it
 a ter of an V
 consequence one way or the
 other for the simple reason
 that might appeal to the
 con lition f the country
 with great propriety if I
 saw fit to do so
 but I based n y
 objection to this claim on
 other grounds grounds that went
 to the root of the
 matter ent irely Mr JOHNSON
 of Yes beyond it Mr
 FESSENDEN 1 could go any
 deeper than Ihat The Senator
 is lilistaken supposing that in
 the debate which sprang up
 last year there was no
 object ion to the part
 of thisc laim now pro
 oscd to be allowed The
 Sena tor from Georgia Mr
 TOOMBS who argued the question
 fully went to the whole
 I Ie stated to be
 sure that two ucms of
 about onc million one hundred
 thousand dollars which were ulludet
 l to by the Secretary
 or the Interior ought to
 be taken cor sidcrat ion
 in his judgment und hc
 went ftu hcu than that
 und inquired whether the value
 of t hc wholc fifteen
 rnillion acres ought not to
 be into consideration and expressed
 the belief it would found
 a balance were struck larn
 ely noainst the tribe of
 Indians of which we l
 hat is the ground that
 was taken by the Senator
 frorn Georgia last year and
 tbc Senator from Arkansas wilk
 find it he looks at
 it I have looked at
 the matter this toat I
 ank righ t mornincr and
 my roea lection is fresh
 upon the did not say
 that I knew about this
 questi01 1 Taking il on
 the ground on which CONGIUSSIONAL
 GLOBE February 2 I speak
 for myself tribe and we
 agreed to give them a
 certain consid say withoüt consideration
 eration Subsequcntly in 1855 we
 mådc another and i speak
 fof others who have told
 me so giving these Indians
 the amount of the sales
 of I treaty with them
 in which the Senate of
 the Uni the hinds east
 of the Mississippi river a
 claim ted States was appointed
 the arbitrator not ag which
 under neither of thcsc treaties
 have they the Senator from
 Maine seems to think to
 go into any detail of
 accounts but to settle the
 principles the slightest pretensions to
 make in my judg ment
 now from an examination of
 them and I We did
 settle tlfem The Senate did
 I was not when the
 Senate passed upon it they
 did so un present on
 that occasion but the Committee
 on Indian Affairs after an
 examination reported to der a
 misapprehension and that misapprehen Sion
 might well grow out of
 what was said in the
 the Senate and the Senate
 made its award Of It
 was said that the claims
 course it then went to
 the Commissioner of indian were
 large but that the am
 ountwould not prob Affairs or
 kheSecretary of the interior to
 ascer bly exceed 800 000
 In fact the question which
 tain the amount due according
 to those principles was left
 to the Secretary of the
 Interior to settle and xvhén
 we find the amount to
 be a large one instead
 of standing by our treaty
 and standing by was not
 the amount of injuries not
 the amount If the Choc
 of claims that the Indian
 s had but the amount
 our award we begin to
 gag at it of sales
 according to the public records
 that had taws were a
 foreign nation we shoald be
 com been received by the
 Government That is all pelled
 to pay it and if
 it were a claim by
 us that he settled in
 any sl iape or form
 and that is against a
 foreign natiou we s vould
 enforce pay ment by the
 Army and the Navy but
 as it IS an the
 only mode in which it
 has been ascertained Indian tribe
 which has relied upon the
 faith 0K and the Senate
 will sec that tho whole
 thing is the Government whose
 men bers have served the
 delusive from beginning to end
 What I rose to state
 was what I now restate
 Government not only in the
 wars of the South that
 believing asl do that we
 as trustees for the west
 but in the wars of
 the Northx vest even un
 money of the people acted
 under an entire mis der
 General Wayne I thillk it
 is the Inore roason why
 the faith of the Government
 sl iould be kept apprehension
 without knowledge without un deestandiog
 and thus voted away if
 we ad here I Now
 why not pay at the
 present time The to it
 millions of the public money
 without know Senator from Iowa
 says the condition of the
 coun try is such that
 we cannot pay it and
 I believe ing what the
 amount of the claims was
 we are the Senator from
 California thought so too Did
 bound now to reconsider our
 action at any rate any
 body say anything about that
 when X ve were not
 to pay the money until
 we know that there is
 voting over two hundred Illillion
 the other day some reaily
 just foundation for it That
 is all I have no
 for a Pacific railroad We
 heard nothing about that I
 contended for and Ido so
 still idea that these Indians
 are sufferino so znuch as
 economy then fromei1hcrofthoseSenators That it
 might have might have staid
 over a year is pretended
 The testimony seems to be
 the other staid over two
 or three years We heard
 noth way in reference to
 that matter I think the
 claim at any rate long
 ing of the condition of
 the Treasury then This will
 keep a few years longer
 is a debt it is
 our duty to pay it
 and no v we are
 enough for the active friends
 of this uneasm e to
 have an investigation into t
 he real state of the
 informed by the memorial of
 the Choctaw ntition that their
 people are in a sufferinc
 r condition from affair in
 regard to the amount actually
 due these l hat amount
 I an t eady to
 pay at any the loss
 of their crops and in
 danger many of Indians them
 of starvation and hardship and
 we who as knorncnt ill
 ox to this part of
 the claim have no sort
 of defet lse Mr GRIMES
 One single word sir planation
 of the vote I am
 about to give on this
 the fact is there is
 very little as to the
 other it is At the
 last session of Congress I
 il proposition voted in favor
 of the allowance of this
 claim then t hoagl l
 it was just and right
 upon the roc ord as
 iL nox v stands I
 still think that it is
 right but in consequence of
 the present condition of thc
 country although it be such
 a gravc offense in E
 the estimation of the Senator
 from Arkansas to allude to
 that I shall not vote
 for its being in corporatcd
 into this bill 1 believe
 that it is the duty
 of every Govern ment to
 protect itself We all know
 that our r I t
 easury is at this time
 in a bankrupt condition and
 if it be in that
 condition it is our business
 to see that its wheels
 bc kept in motion to
 see that those shall be
 paid whom it first becomes
 our duty to pay I
 t nrn to the record
 here the rc port of
 the C01Y1mi ssionm of Indian
 Affairs and find that the
 Choctaw nation is the richest
 com I think munity on
 the face of this continent
 therefore that it is proper
 that we should allow this
 ciairn to lie over and
 that we should pay those
 ofliccrs of the Governnoent who
 huve o neccssilies and great
 calls upon us for the
 pay Unless it shall bo
 shown that this award as
 it is called was improper
 v obtained from the ruorc
 plausible than real but as
 to this part of the
 claim there is no deiZnlse
 it ought to carry inter

 I say simply because it
 is a and duc to

 We have made a good

 in the award I thaBk

 Indisputable Despite the assertion of

 say you have heretofore ac

 It has tion of that

 and sent back the Senate
 amended Vari ous post routes
 have been put on and
 there is an amendment to
 the provision for daily öVeiiand
 mail to California An amend
 merit passed Senate during the
 last session to estabhsh a
 daily overland mail but there
 x vas no limitation as
 to the amount Now the
 House of Representa tiveg has
 limited it so that it
 shall not exceed 800 000
 The House Representatives also allow
 addi tional time to carry
 printed matter thirty five days
 instead of requiringall the mail
 matter to be carried in
 the same time The Senate
 passed it dur ing the
 last session it comes back
 to us amended This dispenses
 with the ocean service entirely
 and carries the mail daily
 on the central route as
 proposed during the last session
 of Congress and passed bv
 the Senate LATHAM My colleague
 is mistaken about one thing
 The ocean service is to
 be dis pcnsed with when
 the overland route is put
 in complete operation IVh GWIN
 Certainly Mr HUNTER But in
 the mean time is there
 110t a limitation that you
 are not to send mail
 mat ter by this line
 of over one thousand pounds
 Mr G W IN All
 over one thousand pounds they
 lift ve thirty five days
 to carry in instead of
 twronty They have n thousand
 pounds to carry daily and
 they have a longer period
 in which to convey the

 The Chair would remark that
 the bilk does not appear

 necessity for action now I
 would rather it should go

 in order that I may
 look into the question Mr
 PEARCE I would suggest that

 the bill out of committee
 and the chairman of the
 Comrnittee on Indian AfTairs can
 offer his amendment turain in

 We might as well pass
 the bill through the Committee
 of the Whole now Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas 1 ask
 this favor of the Senate
 and I believe it has
 been rarely denied I cannot
 consent to yield to i
 tny more little maneuvers I
 do not say that the
 Senator from Maryland makes any
 little maneuvers but I may
 not be here these are
 advantages at least when the

 The PRESIDING OFFICER The questioni
 MP HUNTER Are we adopting
 amendments to thig bill is
 on the motion of the
 Senator from Arkansas I The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The that the
 further consideration of this bill
 be post poned until Monday
 next The motion was agreed
 to THE PRIVATE CALF NDAR
 tion will be on concurring
 in the House amend ments
 to the Senate amendtnents in
 rotation to this matter the
 bill was brought back and
 what the Senator fron n
 California states is exac lly
 true but the only pointl
 think that the Senator has
 consulted the committee upon is
 the overland mail route My
 recollection IS different from the
 Senator s in regard to
 the proceedings of t ho
 body at the last session
 I have an im pression
 that this provision did not
 pass the Senate Mr GWIN
 It did Mr LATHAM Yes
 it was put on the
 post route bill Mr GWIN
 This bill Mr HALE I
 know when we had the
 discus Sion up there was
 a good deal of debate
 and a great many propositions
 were offered one by myself
 one by the Senator from
 Massachusetts Mr WILSON I never
 heard an objection to Mr
 GWI any portion of the
 bill except that about the
 over land mail Mr HALE
 That is what I was
 going to sa I I
 Mr HUN rl ER I
 think there ought to be
 sorne Of course I supposed
 that was the reason regard
 to the provision for the
 overland mail I exolanalion I
 understand that these amendments involve
 thc expenditure of a was
 in favor of it last
 year and am in favor
 of Mr LANE I that
 Friday and Saturday II put
 to the bill will it
 now but I was in
 favor then and am now
 of of next vveek be
 set apart for the consideration
 of good deal of Inouey
 for another overland route I
 thought in addition to toc
 one we already have I
 should dispensing with the Butterfield
 route nrivatc bills then and
 I think now that we
 ought not to pay Mr
 FESSENDEN In the present state
 Of like to know how
 rnuch we aro putting upon
 the the appropriation bills before
 the Committee on post Office
 Department how much we add
 to the a year for
 carrying that mail The post
 II age that was received
 upon that route by the
 re Finance f hope that
 F riday and Saturday will
 postal expenses already so heavy
 not be set aside for
 private bills We have a
 great The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator port of the Postmaster
 General at the last Session
 can call for a separate
 vote on each amendment which
 i examined if I rememberaright
 was some deal to attend
 to Mr HUNTER I do
 not want to delay the
 thing like twenty seven thousand
 dollars for the Mr LANE
 At the suggestion of many
 Sen sum of paid out
 but it was suggested at
 ators I will change my
 motion and say Friday Senate
 but I think we ought
 to have some expla NIL
 FESSENDEN I shall make no
 further li nation of what
 we are doing that time
 that in consequence of the
 breaking off I of t
 he ocean navWation which was
 suspended for objection I have
 made the Sucrgestion The II
 Mr GWIN This is a
 House bill which the Senate
 passed at the last session
 with amend a while and
 other causes that would be
 constantly Senate can act as
 they please The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Senator ments Thosc amendments
 went to the House increasing
 and I suppose it has
 increased I have from Oregon
 znodifies his motion and now
 moves of Representatives and failed
 to receive the sanc I
 not looked at the report
 this session to knoxrv the
 710 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 2 amount received last year
 Can either of those Senators
 tell me Mr G WIN
 I have not examined it
 Mr HUNTER What is the
 amount of the expenditure Mr
 HALE The amount spent on
 the But route is 600
 OOO and on this route
 800 OOO a year for
 car is proposed making ryingAthe
 mails between these two points
 sub stantially I am in
 favor of this overland mail
 route from St Louis to
 San Francisco I do not
 remember what the precise termini
 are but I think it
 is incumbent upon us in
 some way or other to
 cut Off the Butterfield route
 if q e take this
 because the establishment of this
 alone and the payment of
 800 000 to it will
 enable it to carry everything
 that is necessary between the
 If you establish this Atlantic
 and Pacific coast overland mail
 route tl le Butterfield route
 will bc comparatively uselcss I
 may almost say entirely so
 but perhaps not entirely go
 I consented that the amendment
 should be reportcd and I
 hope that the Senate will
 adopt it but that is
 all the examination that has
 been given to the bill
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 think a
 matter of this importance ought
 not to be passed without
 further consideration more than we
 can give it at this
 hour of the day Mr
 GYVIN I am willing that
 it shall go over I
 do not want anybody to
 vote on it without un
 It is unnecessary however to
 derstanding it refer it Mr
 FESSENDEN 1 move that the
 Senate adiourn Mr LATHAM 1
 hope the Senator from Maine
 will withdraw that in order

 Mr WALTON Mr Speaker 1
 per sonal explanation and an
 explanation on behalf of the
 Connnittcc of Claims A few
 days ago I reported froin
 the of Claims a joint
 resolution for the relief of
 Jonas P Levy On that
 occasion I find the gentleman
 from Ohio Mr SHERMAN reported
 as saying that it was
 the same claim which I
 vlr Whittlesey pronounced a fraud
 after full examination Mr SHERMAN
 I merely inquired whether it
 was the same claim reported
 against by Mr Whittlesey Mr
 WALTON In either event an
 imputa tion migl t be
 inferred against the Committee of
 Claims and I wish to
 say a word There is
 no authority of noore weight
 with that committee than that
 of Mr Whittlesey who was
 so long distinguisl ed I
 inay say above all its
 chairman his fidelity to duty
 His report is a others
 for strong orle against thc
 claim it I vas examined
 by the con nniit cc
 it has been placed on
 tbc files and it goes
 with the other papers to
 the account ing officers of
 the I rea sury for
 their exarnination it is proper
 to But in justice to
 all concerned state that it
 appears from Mr s re
 port that there is one
 item of the claim which
 hc did not pass upon
 M oreover the claimant alleges
 that there is important testimony
 in the case which neither
 Mr Whittlesey the board of
 com papers originally filed and
 said to be lost As
 to lost papers the Court
 of Claims has well said
 that upon some evidence though
 it be slight of loss
 and diligent and unsuccessful search
 the claimant may then niake
 affidavit of loss and thereupon
 be permitted to prove the
 contents of thc lost papers
 by secondary evidence This remains
 to be done and we
 think the claimant should be
 permitted still to avail himself
 of this right Again in
 respect to the claim for
 damages in conse quence of
 illegal expulsion from Mexico the
 Court of the laws of
 Mexico under which Levy was
 expelled have not been produced
 nor inferior proofs presented We
 can see no great difficulty
 in producing or proving the
 statutes of Mexico or any
 resolution or order for the
 expulsion of American citizens from
 Mexico and we think the
 claim ant should be permitted
 todo it This seems to
 have been a part of
 the claim admitted to be
 valid by the commission erg
 The Auditor rejected it for
 written reasons but those reasons
 cannot be found the Comptrollerdid
 not pass upon t his
 part of the case at
 all and in rejecting it
 the Court of Claixns distinctly
 intimates that it is for
 want of proof which is
 certainly material and seems to
 be attainabke For the purpose
 of permitting the claimant to
 produce evidence which the Court
 of Claims has decided to
 be pertinent and essential and
 of disposing of the case
 the committee report the accompanying
 joint resolution and reconnnend its
 passage COMPROMISE MEMORIALS Mr NOELL
 I desirc to present three
 memo rials from my constituents
 in reference to existing diffcu
 ties one from citizens of

 their devotion to the country

 dearest to them will be

 IN IOWA Mr TRIMBLE By
 the instruction of the Committee
 on Public Lands I desire
 to report a joint resolution
 to quiet tille to certain
 lands in the State of
 Iowa and to ask that
 the same considered now and
 put upon its passacre The
 bill which was read provides
 that all the title which
 the United States still retains
 in the tracts of lands
 along the Des Moines river
 above the mouth of the
 Racoon Fork therein in the
 State of Iowa which have
 heretofore been certi fied to
 that State improperly by the
 Secretary of the Intcrior as
 part of the grant approved
 under the act of August
 8 1846 be relinquished to
 the State of Iowa Mr
 TRIMBLE If there is any
 objection made to it such
 objection may be removed by
 an ex planation which will
 not occupy more than turo
 minutes Mr THOMAS 1 would
 like to have the bill
 explained Mr TRIMBLE In 1846
 the Congress of the United
 States made a grant of
 land to the State of
 Iowa to aid in the
 improvement of the navigation of
 the Des Moines river The
 Secretåry of the Interior certified
 to that State some four
 hundred thousand acres of land
 above the mouth of the
 It has been decided Racoon
 Fork of that river II
 by the Supreme Court of
 the United States that those
 lands were improperly certified A
 sub sequent grant made by
 Congress to the State of
 Iowa for railroad purposes covers
 the whole missioners the Court
 of Claims nor any other
 authority has yet had We
 simply propose that Of these
 four hundred thousand acres writh
 the exception of about one
 thousand acres These the claimant
 should have a rehearing with
 the ben lands therefore do
 not revert to the Govern
 efit of that testimony and
 all that is now in

 Mr GREEN the Senate then
 adjourned I he Senate so
 decided at the last session
 case I need not add
 anol her word but in
 order that the ground upon
 which the committee acted may
 be understood I will conclude
 with an extract from the
 report of the committee It
 is as follows On a
 review of the case we
 find that there has been
 some new evidence produced both
 favorable and adverse inuch crimination
 and re much argumcnt pro
 and con crimination and yet
 that rhe case stands substantially
 as it did when Congress
 reopened it in 1854 The
 evidence now in the case
 vy ill not admit a
 decision in favor of the
 claim and on the other
 hand we are not disposed
 to re ject it because
 the papers aileged to have
 been lost have not been
 produced nor have their cont
 ents to any cons_id erable
 dcrzree been supplied by secondary
 evidence The claimant f urther
 alleges that nnportant papers now
 exist in the State and
 ih casury ncpartrnents which the
 committee Illight call ibr but
 he does not allege that
 these are the I ment
 of the United States in
 consequence of that decision but
 are still to be retained
 by the State for railroad
 purposes These lands have been
 sold to actual settlers who
 have paid their money for
 them They are now occupied
 and there are three or
 four towns built upon them
 There are to my actual
 knowledge lands among them worth
 from fifty to sixty doklars
 per acre The settlers want
 their titles confirmed The State
 sold and patented the lands
 to the present occu pants
 and all this resolution asks
 is that their titles may
 be confirmed This resolution is
 drawn up and its adoption
 recommended by the Secre tary
 of the Interior Mr PHELPS
 If 1 am not mistaken
 this question was before the
 late Secretary of the 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 711 terior
 for his decision and there
 has recently been some action
 upon it by that Department
 Is not that so Mr
 TRIMBLE It is 1 have
 had the matter in my
 hands since the last session
 of Congress and during the
 present session The result of
 the deliberations of the Interior
 Department is the recommendation of
 the adoption of this resolution
 which as I said before
 was drawn up by the
 Sec retary of the Interior
 Mr PHELPS Then it met
 with the approval of the
 Commissioner of the General Land
 Office and of the late
 Secretary of the Interior Mr
 Thompson Mr TRIMBLE Accompanying the
 resolution is a communication from
 the Secretary of the In
 terior giving his reasons for
 recommending its passage No objection
 being made the resolution was
 received read a first and
 second time and ordered to
 be engrossed and read a
 third time and being engrossed
 it was accordingly read the
 third time and passed Mr
 TRIMBLE moved to reconsider the
 vote by which the resolution
 was passed and also moved
 to lay the motion to
 reconsider on the table The
 latter motion was agreed to
 Mr SCOTT On entering the
 Hall this morn ing I
 found lying upon my desk
 an address to the President
 and Vice President of the
 United States signed by W
 C Jewett of Pike s
 Peak whom I suppose to
 be crazy and insane I
 would like to know by

 to be in sulted by

 STOKES I ask the unannnous
 consent of the House to
 report back from the Committee
 on Invalid Pensions a bill
 for the relief of Larkin
 Tally a citizen of my
 district and a poor blind
 soldier and I ask that
 it may be put upon
 its passage The bill which
 was read for information directs
 the Secretary of the Interior
 to place the name of
 Larkin fl ally on the
 pension rolls of the United
 States at the rate of
 eight dollars per month from
 and after the 1st of
 January 1861 during his nat
 ural life Mr BURNETT 1
 ask for the reading of
 the report The report which
 was rend shows that the
 petitioner volunteered in the company
 of Captain Thomas Ricks of
 Mecklenburg county Virginia in 1813
 and was attached to the
 sixth regiment commanded by Colonel
 William Sharp and Col onel
 Greig Green Efe served six
 months as a drummer at
 Norfolk He swears that he
 then was honorably discharged but
 has lost or mislaid the
 same so that he cannot
 produce it The evidence further
 shows that he applied to
 the department and drew two
 land warrants for eighty acres
 each also that he is
 very old and very poor
 and totally blind and not
 able to procure any support
 for his family or himself
 but on the contrary is
 wholly dependent upon the charity
 of others These facts are
 fully substantiated by the deposi
 tions of a number of
 good citizens No objection being
 made the bill w as
 reported by the Committee on
 Invalid Pensions and ordered to
 be engrossed and read a
 third time and being engrossed
 it was accordingly read the
 third time and passed Mr

 we have still a law
 upon the statute boök authorizing

 opposed to the passage of

 I desire that money shall
 be placed at the con

 i act but no additional
 conmensation shall be allowed to
 any person salary by law
 by the Secretary of the
 Treasury There is a bal
 ance of that loan of
 nearly fourteen million which li
 Do gentlemen suppose that the
 Government can proposition which make
 that the loan of 22d
 June last was authorized to
 be expended in the retiring
 of Ti easury notes and
 for no other pur pose
 whatever We have provided by
 at this session of Congress
 that the Secretary of the
 Treasury may issue 10 000
 000 of Treasury notes and
 they have been already issued
 for the purpose of redeeming
 outstanding Treasury notes I am
 aware it will bé urged
 that the balance of the
 loan of 22d June last
 is applicable only to the
 redemption of the Treasury notes
 outstanding at the date of
 the passage of the act
 and of such Treasury notes
 as were authorized to be
 issued at this sessi6n of
 Congress These Treasury notes bear
 a rat e of interest
 at from ten to twelve
 per rate of twelve per
 cent except about two hundred
 and fifty thousand dollars The
 next was macle at an
 averacre rate of interest of
 not qtlite eleven per cent
 The Treasury notes will not
 go into circulation They will
 not be redccmc bv the
 Government because the hold ers
 will no t present them
 for redemption until the twelve
 months shall have expired and
 the sixty days additional allowed
 by the terms of the
 ID other words there is
 no need of pro act
 viding for the redemption of
 the Treasury notes authorized at
 this session until the next
 Congress shall have assembled It
 will be ample time then
 to provide for their redemption
 Gentlemen on the other side
 now propose to modify the
 tariff and they assert that
 the tariff bill which passed
 the House of Representatives will
 if it become a law
 yield us at least 6
 000 000 of revenue more
 than is received under the
 present tariff act I do
 not believe that it will
 be so But the gen
 tlemen who make the statement
 du believe it and if
 so why do they now
 propose to create so large
 It is expected that the
 tariff bill will go into
 effect about the 1st of
 July next in other words
 that we will commence to
 receive all the benefits under
 this increased rate of duties
 before the end of this
 fiscal year or by the
 commencement of tl C next
 fiscal year You must recollect
 Mr Spcakep that there is
 a large amount of goods
 now in 1110 bonded warehouses
 stored undQn the existing warehousincr
 system thc irapm ters hav
 ing three years frokY1 the
 time they are deposited to
 withd raw them for consumption
 or reéxporta If this new
 tariff act which proposes the
 abolition of the warehousing system
 shall go into effect you
 necessarily force into market a
 large amount of goods now
 deposited in the bonded warehouses
 and thus you either increase
 the re ceipts of revenue
 or drive the importers to
 reex port these goods I
 see that for the fast
 six months the goods entered
 for consumption and with drawn
 from the bonded warehouses have
 been small and the revenues
 derived from them have been
 insufiicient to meet the expenses
 of the Gov ernment The
 merchants in the interior owing
 to the pressurc in the
 money rnarket add to the
 political difficulties of the country
 ate slow in m aking
 purchases If these political disturbances
 be settled you will find
 commerce and manufäc tures reviving
 and the importation of foreityn
 goods will be largely increased
 unless the higher rates of
 duties imposed under the new
 tariff bill shall have the
 effect of restricting importation I
 repeat Mr Speaker that if
 we desire to main tain
 the public credit our proper
 course is to make provision
 for the use of the
 loan already au thorized by
 the modifications proposed in my
 amendment instead of authorizmg a
 new loan of 25 000
 000 I now tell the
 chairnman of the Com mittee
 of YVays and Means that
 if this biil pass in
 its present form no money
 will be realized from it
 before the Isl of March
 next In order to carry
 the act into effect new
 plates will have to be
 engraved and notes printed and
 that will require time Bat
 if my amendment be adopted
 the plates at present in
 use can be used in
 printing the bonds to be
 issued and after ten days
 advertisement the Treasury will be
 prepared to issue its bonds
 The information which I have
 given to the House has
 been derived from the Treasury
 De partment and the amendment
 submitted by me receives the
 approval of the Secretary of
 the Treas 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 713 ury with the
 exception of the one provision
 that the proceeds of the
 loan shall be applicd to
 the current expenses of the
 Government but I un derstand
 that the present Secretary of
 the Treas upy would have
 given the act of June
 22 the same construction as
 I now propose to give
 it in defi nite terms
 I propose to leave nothing
 to implication My amendment proposes
 that this money can be
 used not merely in the
 redemption of Treasury notes but
 also to defray the current
 expenses of the Government I
 think Mr Speaker that this
 question is one of such
 magnitude that it ought not
 to be urged forward in
 this manner and pressed upon
 the House without time for
 consideration i am ready to
 vote för the amendment which
 I have submitted and for
 the bill as thus amended
 but I must sav that
 I cannot with the convictions
 which 1 entertain vote for
 the bill in the form
 in which it has come
 from the Cornmittee of Ways
 and Means It may be
 said that this 14 000
 000 is inadequate to defray
 the expenses of the Government
 till the 1st of July
 next I concede that it
 is I stated the other
 day that we would require
 a loan of something like
 25 000 000 to meet
 the current expenses of the
 Government from now till the
 1st of July next over
 and above the receipts from
 I still entertain the ordinary
 sources of revel lue that
 opinion But if the tariff
 bill should become a law
 then the 21 loan provided
 for in it added to
 the 14 000 000 already
 at the disposal of the
 Government will make 35 000
 000 while the cxpenscs of
 the Government wilk only amount
 to 25 000 000 to
 the 1st of July next
 over the current revenue as
 est imated by the Secretary
 of the Treasury I therefore
 say that it would be
 wise to pursue the course
 which i have indicated and
 that the bill reported by
 t he Committee of Ways
 and Means will have the
 efl ect of further depressing
 the credit of the Government
 Mr SHERMAN somewhat surprised that
 In y friend from Missouri
 should oppose a measure intended
 to pay off the existing
 debts made by this Administration
 I have here a com
 munication from the Secretary of
 the Treasury st ating that
 there will be an actual
 deficit in the revenue of
 21 677 524 The deficiency
 bill ap propriates between two
 and three million dollars So
 that there is an admitted
 deficiency of about twenty four
 million dollars to be now
 provided for The amount in
 the Treasury o n the
 1st day of January was
 2 233 220 while it
 requires at least in the
 Treasury to carry on tbc
 daily operations of the Treasury
 Department So that a deficiency
 of not less than exists
 now to be provided for
 by loan Now Mr Speaker
 under these circumstances while the
 Opposition side of the House
 bring forward a bill to
 place in the power of
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 money to pay off all
 the existing liabil ities it
 seems strange to n xe
 that any 011 position should
 from the other side of
 the I lot tse All
 of this Inotlc y will
 be requircd My friend II
 New York would say the
 credit of the Govern ment
 had been violated because when
 they took the Treasury notos
 under the law of December
 last it was with a
 specific pledge with a rnort
 in fact upon the loan
 of the 22d June last
 for their redemption Mr PHELPS
 I desire to ask tbc
 gentleman from Ohio One question
 Did he not vote for
 the homestead bili which passed
 during the present session of
 Congress Mr SHERMAN Oh cs
 Mr PHELPS And the gentleman
 voted to give away the
 public lands notwithstanding the fact
 that they had been pledged
 for the redemp tion of
 a former loan Mr SHERMAN
 It has been held over
 and over affairl that that
 pledge only existed in regard
 to a very small portion
 of the public debt and
 nearly all that to wh
 ichit applied has been paid
 off But here is a
 specific pledge made only a
 little more than a mont
 h ago that thc balance
 of the loan of Tune
 last shalÜbc pledged for the
 redemp tion of these Treasury
 notes and now my friend
 from Missouri wants us to
 take tl 10 loan thus
 set aside for a particular
 purpose and apply it to
 the ordinary current expenses of
 the Government Why IV II
 Speaker the plain Englisl i
 of this matter is that
 there is 25 000 000
 ot debts due and no
 Inonoy to pay them with
 no revenues to HI y
 them with have Totto resort
 to the credit I Nippose
 this 25 000 000 of
 the Government provided for in
 this bill wilk be sumcient
 to settle up tbc accounts
 of this Administration My friend
 refers to the tariff bill
 T hc tariff bill it
 n law will probably not
 take effect until July next
 when it will become neces
 sary to provide by law
 for a deficiency that will
 That bill accrue in the
 next fiscal ycar will probably
 contain a provision for a
 temporary loan but only one
 which win be required to
 meet the deficicncics for the
 next fiscal year This loan
 bill is tor a present
 deficiency and thcreforc its necessity
 will not bc obviated if
 the tariff bill shall become
 a law If as the
 gentleman says the tariff bill
 will pro vide a rcvenue
 sufii icnt to meet the
 current ex I penses of
 the Government then it will
 not become neccssary to negotiate
 the loan provided in the
 I certainly hope thc event
 will prove tariff bill that
 the tariff bill we shall
 pass will produce a revenue
 suflicient to meet all the
 expenses of the If so
 the loan bill s vhich
 accom Goverrunent panies that las
 v will lapse and that
 will be the I trust
 that no other Congress will
 end of it over be
 called on to pass any
 loan bill to rncet thc
 expenses of the Government in
 a irne of profound peace
 The ordinary revenues of the
 Government should always be sufficient
 to Nicet its expenses unless
 in time of war For
 the last three years and
 during every session the chairman
 of t he Conlrnit tee
 of Waysand Means has been
 compelled to cornc in here
 with a loan bill to
 supply the deficiencies in the
 revenues of the Governillent I
 trust such au event may
 never occur afrain in a
 time of peace b provision
 to pay off existing liabilities
 Whether of this loan will
 be required to pay off
 existino these liabilities have accrued
 in consequence of liabilities But
 hc says there is now
 upon the statute book a
 loan law which would enable
 the null administration of the
 Government or for whatever causc
 no man can doubt our
 obligation Secretary of the Treasury
 by some means or other
 to make provision for paying
 off those liabilities to get
 along until the 4th of
 Nfarch M r PHELPS said
 that I was informed that
 A nd here let me
 say a word to my
 friends on this side of
 the House I ask thern
 when we are somewhere in
 the neighborhood of eight million
 i dollars would be sufficient
 to defray the expenses i
 compelled to come in here
 with loan bill after loan
 the bill to enable the
 Government to meet its expenses
 of the Governrnenl until the
 41 11 of March balance
 of the loan authorized in
 June last of i if
 it is not time to
 pause in the appropriations they
 plate to which rhy friend
 fromÄIVfisgou ri alliided that the
 ten days during which the
 notice contin ues will I
 presume be sufficient to buve
 the plateS engraved and if
 not the old plates iwilt
 answer the purpose Mr PHELPS
 According to doctrine of the
 gentleman they will all be
 needed to redeem the outstanding
 Trea sary notes Mr SHERMAN
 Well theywillnotbenecded for that purpose
 within ine year and within
 that time I presume the
 artistsof the coun try will
 be able to get up
 new plates So that it
 seen is this objection of
 the gentleman from Mis souri
 is a very small matter
 in consideration of bill of
 this magnitude Mr HINDMAN I
 hope the gentleman from Ohio
 will permit me to offer
 my amendment I am very
 anxious to vote for this
 bill and I can do
 so cheerfully if my amend
 rnent is adopted but otherwise
 I shall be cornpelled to
 vote in thc neg Mr
 SHERMAN The gentleman can send
 up his amendment so that
 we can understand I move
 the previous question what it
 is Mr MAYNARD With the
 of the gentleman froin Ohio
 I desire to ask a
 single TITho question I desire
 to propound to q ucstion
 the chairtnan of the of
 Ways and Means is this
 the gentleman from Ohio has
 stated that session after session
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means have been c cnnpellcd
 to bring forward loan bills
 to carry on t he
 Government now desire to ask
 if il is contemplated to
 bring forward any other loan
 bill during the present session
 of Congress Mr SHERMAN This
 is the only loan bill
 except that incorporated in the
 tariff bill which is for
 a future deficiency that we
 contemplate bringing forward during the
 present session Now sir I
 think the House understands this
 matter sufficiently well and I
 must insist on my demand
 for the previous question Mr
 MILLSON I desire to offer
 an amend Inent t o
 the amendmcnt of the gentleman
 from Missouri Mr SHERMAN very
 well the gentle man send
 up his amendment and then
 I ask for thc previous
 question Mr HINDMAN ask that
 mv amendment to the original
 bilk bc read Mr SHERMAN
 If received then no further
 amendment is in order Let
 the amend of the gentleman
 from Arkunsas be read The
 Clerk read as follows Add
 at bc ond of the
 bill Pyovidcd I hat no
 part of the loan herein
 provided tor shall used in
 support or maintenance of any
 troops or vessels tar Inaking
 war against any State or
 States that have seceded or
 lilay hereafter secede from the
 Union Mr SIIL RiMAN 1
 trust that no foreign mat
 ter likc that will bc
 insisted on being attached to
 this measure Mr MILLSON 1
 ask the gentleman to yield
 to me to move an
 amendment Mr I II NDMAN
 Let ask whether my amendment
 has been received Mr SHERMAN
 It has not for the
 reason that it is not
 germane to the subject matter
 of the bill Mr HINDMAN
 Some four years aco when
 tbc Kansas bill vas pcnding
 the gentlen7an from Ohio offered
 a similar amend which he
 then considered germane and in
 order Mr SHERMAN That was
 to an appropri ation bill
 and limited the appropriation proposed
 to be This is a
 loan bill and an entirely
 I do not yield to
 let the avnend different matter
 ment come in which some
 fourteen million dollars is still
 within the power of the
 Secretary of the I reasury
 to use Mr SHERMAN think
 a simple statement of this
 matter wilt settle this question
 By the law of t
 he 22d June last we
 authorized a loan of 20
 000 000 A_ portion of
 that loan was taken the
 law In last December at
 the pressincr in stance of
 Mr Secretary Cobb we authorized
 the issue of Treasury notes
 with the spe cific pledge
 of thic balance of the
 loan of June 22 for
 the redemption of these Treasury
 notes And now my friend
 from Missouri proposes to take
 that loan thus specifically pledged
 for thc redemp tion of
 these Treasury notes and apply
 it to the current expenses
 of the Government say that
 it would be a violation
 of the public faith for
 this are makilng cert ainly
 the benefit of moonshine speculations
 for rights within the jurisdiction
 ofa i foreign Government Now
 as I desire to call
 the previous question Mt MILLSON
 I move to strike out
 of the amendn ent of
 the gentleman from I vlissouri
 Mr upon this bill before
 I take nny seat I
 will answer It is PHELPS
 so much as authorizes tbc
 funds raised any question gentlemen
 may desire to ask by
 this loan to be applied
 in payment of the cur
 The balance could not be
 sold upon thc terms of
 important that this bill should
 pass the Senate to rent
 expenses of the Government Mr
 HINDMAN With the of the
 Mr SHERMAN That is already
 engrafted gcntleman from Ohio desire
 to offer an amend upon
 the amendinent of the gentleman
 from Mis ment and if
 he will allow me I
 wilk state my souri I
 Mr MILLSON That much propose
 to I reason for offering
 it strike out I Mr
 SHERMAN 1 must say to
 the gentle SHERMAN 1 have
 objection to that I tnan
 again that it is important
 this bill should 20 amendtncnt
 beinø entered to the Senate
 in time to have it
 passed there to i Mr
 MILLSON Mr Speaker the gentleman
 d y so that the
 Secretary of the l reasury
 may I advertise for the
 loan as he is required
 to do for from Ohio
 has stated that it was
 strange the men bers of
 this side of the House
 should oppose a bih ten
 days Congress to pass the
 law now by the I
 will say in regard to
 the engraving of the for
 the payment of debts incurred
 by the present gentleman from
 Missouri The moneyed Inen of
 714 Administration and his remarks
 would leave the impression upon
 the House that ho was
 taking a step desired by
 the Administration I want to
 correct that impression The gentleman
 will find that the amendment
 of the gentleman Of Missouri
 with the amendment indicated by
 myself will accomplish all the
 objects desired by the Secretary
 of the Treasury The gentleman
 says that we want money
 to pay the expenses of
 the Government after the expn
 a tion of the present
 fiscal year but that is
 not the object of the
 present bill The Department at
 this time vvants funds to
 meet the accruing expenses of
 the Government before the 4th
 of March The Department will
 be satisfied with such modifica
 tion of the act of
 June 22 1860 as will
 dispense wi h the notice
 and authorize the negotiation of
 the loan on the most
 favorable terms The Depart ment
 does not desire the money
 raised by this loan to
 be diverted from thc objects
 stated in the act of
 June 1860 and therefore if
 thc amendment of the gentleman
 from Missouri be amended as
 1 propose at will meet
 at once the obicction of
 thc gentleman from Ohio for
 it v ill not ihen
 divert the loan from the
 objects originally contemplated which was
 to redeem outstanding Treasury notes
 The Depart ment is now
 able to meet the expenses
 of the Gov crnment provided
 you pass this loan bill
 with the modification suggested by
 the gentleman from Missouri and
 myself Mr PHELPS The which
 l have moved in regard
 to the bill does not
 require the Secretary of the
 Treasury to apply the proceeds
 of this loan in payment
 of the current expenses It
 merely gives him permis of
 the Government Sion to do
 so Mr MILLSON That is
 true it only gives him
 permission to do so but
 even that permis Sion renders
 the amendment liable to the
 objection made by the gentleman
 from Ok iio The Depart
 ment as I have said
 does not want this money
 to be applied to the
 current expenses of the Gov
 ernment At present Treasury notes
 are re deemed out of
 the current rcvet iues of
 the Gov ernmcnt but if
 this bill be passed it
 will relieve the current revenues
 from that liability to pay
 the It wili raise somc
 outstanding Treasury notes six or
 seven million dollars and I
 will state to the gentleman
 from Ohio that the Department
 does not propose even to
 negotiate thc whole loan author
 Ized by this bill There
 will bc no necessity for
 it What it wants is
 an immediate relief to the
 Treasury The gentleman will find
 that the re marks of
 my friend from Missouri are
 cntircly correct if the bill
 be passed in the mode
 proposed by the gentleman from
 Ohio If a new loan
 be authorized it will not
 meet the or ethe wants
 of the Department at all
 for it will postpone the
 receipt of money into the
 Treasury nntil tl le 1st
 of March at the earliest
 As to the fünds bc
 provid d for thc nextfiscal
 year they in the loan
 bill inserted in wilt bc
 provided f or the Morrill
 tariff bill in any other
 loan bill What is necessary
 now is innnediate prompt rc
 ccssity of giving the notice
 provided in that bill Let
 the bill bo l åssod
 modifying the existing law so
 as to dispensc with the
 notice now required and to
 authorize the ncgotiation of the
 loan on the best terms
 and that will Incet with
 the require monts of the
 Departmcnt Mr SHERMAN i will
 say a word in reply
 if the course he to
 my friend from Virginia suggests
 be pursued thén there will
 be no provis ion Qf
 law för the redemption of
 Treasury notcs issued under the
 law of last December Then
 next December will come around
 and there v ill be
 no provision for their redemption
 There will be no loan
 for their redemption and this
 Gov crnment will have to
 go on paying interest at
 the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 2
 Mr SHERMAN Let me ask
 my friend one question If
 the course he suggests should
 be pursued is there any
 provision of law for the
 payment of those Treasury notes
 when they be come due
 Mr MILLSON I will answer
 the gentleman The present bill
 as modified by the gentleman
 from Missouri and myself will
 leave the law exactly as
 it stood before with the
 exception that it dispenses with
 the notice and authorizes the
 negotiation of the loan on
 any terms that may be
 favorable Mr SHERMAN I demand
 the previous question Mr GARNETT
 Will the gentleman let me
 ask him a question Mr
 SHERMAN Yes for information Mr
 GARNETT If this bill pass
 1 under stand the gentleman
 to admit that our obligations
 will be under this bill
 under the Morrill tariff bill
 and 14 000 000 under
 u former bill Mr SHERMAN
 The referred to takes the
 place of outstanding Treasury notes
 It is not a new
 loan Mr GARNETT and in
 all required to meet the
 appropriations made by this Congress
 and t ie outstanding Treasury
 notes Mr SHERMAN Yes sir
 every ofit Mr GARNETT In
 addition to the current revenue
 Mr SHERMAN Until the tariff
 bill be passed and tried
 we cannot tell whether it
 will supply suflicient revenue or
 not to meet the cur
 rent expenses of the Government
 But sir this 25 000
 000 every dollar of it
 is required to meet cxisting
 liabilities The provided by the
 act of June 22 will
 be required to meet out
 standing Treasury notes Mr GARNETT
 Then the bill loan will
 be merc surplus and in
 fact this may be considered
 a bill for what purposes
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE I beg
 leave to say to the
 gentleman from Ohio the chairman
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Moans that if he
 de pends upon the operation
 of the tariff bill for
 the revenues of the country
 he and those who think
 with him will bc entirely
 disappointed The ab rogation of
 the warehouse system will I
 think shackle and paralyze the
 commerce of the coun _try
 Mr SICKLES That is a
 very good reason why a
 tariff bill should be accompanied
 by a loan bill Mr
 SHERMAN I hope gentlemen will
 not I call the previous
 debate the tariff bill here
 question The question first being
 upon the amendment offered by
 Mr MILLSON to the amendment
 of Mr i PHELPS Mr
 GARNETT dcmandcd the yeas and
 nays Mr JOHN COCHRANE called
 for tellers upon the eas
 and nays Mr ST IERMAN
 1 no necessity for ing
 the yeas and nays upon
 the amendment to the amendment
 Mr BURNETT we want the
 yeas and nays Tellers were
 ordercd and Messrs VANDEVER and
 JOHN COCHRANE were appointed The
 House divided and the tellers
 reported ayes thirty three noes
 not counted So tho yeas
 and nays were ordered Mr
 SICKLES to have the amend
 ment of the gentleman from
 Virginia read in con nection
 with the amendment of the
 gen tleman from Missouri Mr
 WINSLOW we may very well
 pass Pacific railroad bills and
 others of that character rate
 of twelve per centum per
 annum upon these Trcasury notes
 In that way a burden
 will be without knowing what
 we are doing but when
 thrown upon the next Congress
 that ought to be we
 come to pass loan bills
 I think we should provided
 for by this Congress And
 the gentle man does not
 answer my objection and that
 is that the loan of
 June 22 1é60 was specifically
 plcaged in December last for
 the identical notes Issued at
 that time I low this
 House can divert that fund
 without a violation of the
 public honor I cannot see
 Mr MILLSON It is not
 expected at the Treasury Department
 that the late issue of
 Treas ury notes will be
 presented for payment because of
 the high rate of interest
 which they bear know what
 we are about and therefore
 I desire to havo tho
 amendments read Mr PHELPS I
 wish to make another in
 quiry The gentleman from Arkansas
 offered an amendment and I
 desire to know whether or
 not it was received The
 SPEAKER The Chair supposes it
 vas not i Mr BURNETT
 That amendment pro posed to
 limit the uses to which
 this money should be applied
 and we have precedents for
 such amendments in the action
 of former Con gresses The
 SPEAKER The Chair did not
 decide but the gentleman from
 Ohio did not receive the
 amendment Mr BURNETT The gentleman
 from Ohio had no control
 over it He had yielded
 the floor to the gentleman
 from Arkansas The SPEAKER The
 Chair saw that there might
 be confusion and he paid
 close attention man from Ohio
 did not yield for that
 purposc He yielded to hear
 the amendment read and after
 he heard it he objected
 and then the gentleman from
 Virginia rose and offered his
 amendment Mr HINDMAN I vas
 giving special atten tion to
 what the gentleman from Ohio
 was say ing and I
 think the Chair is in
 error in his recol lection
 of what he did say
 I say of course With
 all respect to the Chair
 the gentleman from Ohio yielded
 me the floor to offer
 my amendment Mr SHERMAN only
 that it might be read
 and then I objected and
 said it was not material
 c The gentleman from Virginia
 having offered an amendment to
 an amendment that is the
 end of it Mr HINDMAN
 Of course but the man
 from Virginia had not offered
 his amendment at the time
 I offered mine Mr SHERMAN
 1 understood myself as objecting
 in a very polite way
 Mr HINDMAN 1 matter The
 question was then taken and
 it was de cided in

 1 object to taking up

 is in reference to carry

 and I shall propose the
 usual resolution upon the part
 of the House following the
 precedents of forty years without
 variation Mr GARNETT 1 submit
 that it is not in

 except by unanimous It is
 perfectly competenBfor the gentle consent
 man following the rules of
 the House on Monday to
 move to suspend the rules
 or clse to proceed to
 the business upon the Speakcr
 s table thereby reaching that
 resolution in the regular way
 A question of privilege is
 a question touching the rights
 of some member of this
 House or touching the privileges
 of this House This like
 many other duties imposed upon
 us by the Constitution is
 to be exercised in the
 regular way in conform It
 does not touch ity to
 the rules of tho House
 the privilcgcs of the House
 or of any of its
 mem bers The SPEAKER The
 Chair supposes that it is
 a constitutional requirement that thc
 votes shall be counted on
 a certain day and in
 that aspect of the case
 it seems necessary that arrangements
 should be made for that
 purpose The Chair is therefore
 of the opinion that this
 is a privileged question Mr
 GARNETT 1 doubt not that
 the decis ion of the
 Chair will be aflirmed by
 the House but I feel
 so confident that it is
 wrong I say it that
 I re with great deference
 to the Speaker spectfully take
 an appeal from the decision
 of the Chair I move
 to Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 lay the appeal upon tlm
 table Mr McCLERNAND 1 wish
 simply to say that while
 I have no objection to
 the passage of the resolution
 I think the point of
 order is well taken Mr
 GARNETT That is precisely my
 own I have no ol
 jection to the resolution position
 or to the counting of
 the votes in a perfectly
 reg ular way but I
 am unwilling to afford any
 facil ities against the rules
 of t hc House for
 that pur I demand the
 yeas and nays on the
 motion Pose to lay the
 appeal on the table and
 I call tellers on the
 yeas and nays Tellers were
 not ordered The yeas and
 nays were not ordered Mr
 GARNETT called for tellers on
 the tion Tellers were ordm
 cd and Messrs GARNETT and
 WASHBURNF of Illinois were appointed
 The House divided and the
 tellers reported avcs 106 noes
 19 So the appeal from
 thc decision of the Chair
 was laid upon the table
 The resolution of the Senate
 was tvrain read I offcr
 thc Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 following resolution Resolved I llat
 the House agree to the
 appointment of a conunittee consist
 of five Inenlbcrs to join
 said corn nfit ee on
 the part of the Senate
 subject and I hold in
 my hand his answer I
 ask that it be read
 The Clerk read the letter
 Mr GURLEY 1 move that
 the letter of the Superintendent
 with the letters accompanying it
 be laid upon the table
 and printed The motion was
 agreed to PRINTING OF A
 REPORT Mr MILLSON I move
 that thirty thousand extra copies
 of the report of the
 select committee in reference to
 the abolition of tho franking
 priv ilecre be printed the
 motion wras refexrcd under the
 rule to the Committee on
 Printing DEFICIENCY BILL Mr SHERMAN
 I now submit the motion
 that general debate on the
 Chiriqui amendment of the Sena
 te to the deficiency bill
 close at four o clock
 this afternoon Mr MORSE I
 hope my friend the chairman
 of the Committee of NV
 ays and Mcans will not
 press that motion Mr SHERMAN
 1 think we have wasted
 th ree enough timc about
 this Chiriqui matter Mr SICKLES
 I suggest to the gentleman
 that hc should name five
 o clock instead of four
 Mr MORSE I will say
 to the chairman of the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 that thisis a measure which
 was reported by the Committee
 on Naval Affairs No member
 of that committee has yet
 succeeded in getting the floor
 to explain the reasons which
 induced the committee to re
 port this measure to the
 House We have had two
 hour speeches against the amendment
 and one for it The
 gentleman s colleague Mr STAN
 TON who now has the
 floor is also opposed to
 the measure and will probably
 occupy the re maining hour
 which the gentleman proposes to
 allow for this debate Thus
 Mr Speaker the Committee on
 Naval Affairs will be entirely
 over slaughed and will not
 be allowed the privilege of
 giving the reasons which induced
 us to bring the I
 hope that the de measure
 before the House bate will
 not be limited Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE 1 suggest to the
 gentleman from Ohio that he
 do not move to go
 into the Committee of the
 Whole on the state of
 the Union at this time
 The gentleman from Maryland Mr
 HUGHES has the floor upon
 the report of the select
 committee of thirty three and
 is anxious to proceed now
 being unable to pro cecd
 by gas light because of
 a defrct in his vision
 and hc will find it
 necessary I undersland to read
 a number of extracts Mr
 SHERMAN My desire to dispose
 ofthis deficiency bill grovv s
 out of the fact that
 poor men have money duc
 them for printing and other
 ser vices about this Capitol
 which is provided for in
 the bill and they come
 to me every day wanting
 to know when thc deficiency
 bill will pass some of
 t hem saying that they
 are really in need hope
 therefore that we shall not
 continue the discussion of this
 Chiriqui matter Mr MAYNm D
 Let the deficiency bill go
 through and Ict the Chiriqui
 matter stand upon its own
 merits W c can then
 discuss it at our leisure
 Mr SHERMAN I am informed
 by my co league Mr
 STANTON who has the floor
 in com mittee that he
 is willing to waive his
 right and l allow thc
 gentleman from Maine to be
 heard I will state that
 that resolution is precisely thc
 same as the resolution offcred
 by Mr Jo NE s
 Mr S I ANTON Ishall
 not occupy more than ten
 minutes Tennessee on the 2d
 of February 1857 It Mr
 SCOTT 1 suppose that 1
 The resolution was agreed to
 in part represent upon this
 floor is more itnmedi Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois moved to
 re i ately and directly
 intcrestéd in this Chiriqui mat
 consider the vote by which
 the resolution was ter than
 all the other States put
 together agreed to and also
 moved to lay the motion
 to my desire to submit
 a few remarks to the
 I louse reconsider upon the
 table upon the subject Two
 long and able speeches The
 latter motion was agreed to
 have been made in opposition
 to the unwr dment The
 SPEAKER thereupon appointed the fol
 of the Senate and I
 hope that considering the lowing
 committee on the part of
 the House importance of the
 subject the chairman of the
 Messrs WASHBURNF of Illinois ADRAIN
 CRAIG Committee of Ways and
 N eans will not put
 the of Missouri ELY and
 ANDERSON of Kentucky II gag
 law upon us I understand
 that the Committee of Ways
 and PRINTING OF PATENT OFFICE
 REPORT Mr GURLEY A few
 days ago the House I
 Means have unanimously reported against
 his adopted a resolution instructing
 the Committee amendment That committee
 is certainly entitled I on
 Printing to inquire and report
 the causes of the io
 high respect but the Committee
 on Naval Af t delay
 in the printing of the
 mechanical portion of fairs is
 equal to it in every
 respect Two rnmn I addressed
 a letter to i bers

 716 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 2 Main e Mr MORSE
 the chairmm of the Naval
 Committee desires to be heard
 Mr PHELPS Only one member
 of the Com mittee of
 Ways and Means has spoken
 upon this q Ltestion Mr
 SCOTT well 1 do hope
 the chairman of the Committee
 of Ways and Means will
 have the tnagnapimity to extend
 the time an hour or
 two longer Mr SHERMAN I
 have no objection to the
 debate being left open to
 day with the under standing
 that it shall close at
 the adjournment of the House
 Mr SCOTT 1 will agree
 to that Mr MORSE It
 seems to me very evidcnt
 that we shall not get
 through the debate on this
 ques tion Y night If
 we am ee to the
 proposition of the chairman of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means that the debate shall
 run this evening with the
 understanding that no vote shall
 be taken till Monday members
 will go home and we
 shall not have the privilege
 of exélaining to the House
 the reasons which Induced us
 to bring forward this measure
 There is my friend from
 New York who op posed
 this measure last year and
 who wishes to make some
 remarks Mr SHERMAN I withdraw
 my proposition simply move that
 the rules be suspended and
 that the House resolve itself
 into the Committee of the
 Whole on the state of
 the Union Mr MORSE I
 have not given up the
 floor I want to say
 this The SPEAKER No debate
 is in order Mr MORSE
 It seems to me that
 we had better proceed to
 the debate on the report
 of the com mittee of
 thirty three to day and
 take up this Chiriqui matter
 on Monday and go through
 with If we take that
 cou rse we it and
 finish it then will get
 along just as rapidly and
 come to a close just
 as quickly as we would
 if we were to go
 on a littlc way to
 day with it and then
 go to the debate on
 the report of the committco
 of thirty th ree Mr
 SICKLES I suggest to the
 gentleman from Maine that hc
 had better accept the propo
 sition of the chairman of
 the Committee of Ways Means
 and go into the Committee
 of the Whole on the
 state of the Union now
 If we can not finish
 this matter to day it
 can be resumed on Monday
 I think the other Mr
 MORSE lhope not way is
 better The SPEAKER The question
 is on the mo tion
 of the gentleman from Ohio
 Mr SHERMAN The motion was
 agreed to Tho rules were
 accordingly suspended and the House
 resolved itself into the Committee
 of the Whole on the
 state of thc Union Mr
 BURNETT in the chair and
 resumed the consideration of the
 special order being the Senate
 amendments to the bill H
 R No 8GG to sur
 ply deficiencies in the for
 the service of the fiscal
 year ending June 30 1861
 the pending question being on
 Mr MORsE s amendmcnt to
 the third amcnd ment of
 the Senate as follows Add
 at the end of the
 amendrnent as foilows Provided I
 hat no part of the
 sum hereby appropriated shall be
 drawn from the Treasury u
 ntil after sueh conditions and
 rezulations I lavc been established
 I Y the President in
 performance of all the provisions
 of the smne as will
 fully protect the United States
 agninsr the failure or incapacity
 of sald Thompson or said
 Chiriqui Improvernent Company to fulfill
 its stipulations Provided further That
 the United States shall acquire
 no right of sovereignty over
 any terri tory ill the
 Republic of New Granada or
 Costa Rica nor any right
 to transport troops or munitions
 of war over such territory
 under or by virtue of
 he contract recited in this
 act u niexs the satne
 be v oluntarily consented to
 by sai i Republic The
 Senate amendment being as follows
 l o enable the Secretary
 the Navy to carry out
 the is proposéd here to
 appropriate 300 000 for the
 purpose of acquiring certain privileges
 for this Government within the
 jurisdiction and territorial limits ofa
 foreign nation which that nation
 has expressly refused to grant
 which we have no right
 to claim and the attempt
 to exercise which would be
 an act of hostility against
 a friendly Power and in
 fact would be an act
 of war I suppose Mr
 Chairman that the only valuable
 right which this Government can
 acquire by virtue of this
 contract with the Chiriqui company
 is the right to transport
 over thisxailway troops and muni
 tions of war and whatever
 else the Government may desire
 to transport over it and
 to establish naval stations depots
 at the two termini of
 the road Now if I
 can undcrstand this contract at
 all these are rights which
 the grantees are expressly precluded
 bv thc terms of the
 contract frorn giv Ing to
 any föreign Government They are
 rights which this Government cannot
 claim without a violation of
 the law of nations We
 have friendly relations existing with
 this foreign Government and the
 moment wc undertook to exercise
 rights under this contract we
 would violate these frien dly
 relations How that diffculty is
 to be avoided Ido not
 comprehend Does not every gentleman
 see that as a matter
 of course no nation can
 in the nature of things
 permit a foreign Power to
 acquire iurisdiction of this kind
 within her territorial lim its
 The right to transport troops
 munitions of war articles contraband
 of war the right to
 ex ercise iurisdiction in its
 harbors to control all the
 sovereignty of the State within
 whose jurisdiction these rights are
 to be given are things
 utterly inadmissible and at war
 with the law of nations
 It is a right x
 vhich cannot be conceded without
 an essential surrender of the
 sovereignty of the na tion
 within whosc limits it is
 to be given These rights
 are as I understand it
 the consideration for which wc
 are to pay the sum
 of You are to pay
 this money on the promise
 of Messrs Thompson Co that
 they will acquire and trans
 fer these rights to this
 Govrnment and that they will
 construct a railroad from the
 Atlantic to the Pacific across
 the Isthmus You are to
 pay the money and if
 these gentlemen build the road
 why it is all very
 well so far if you
 can get the privilege to
 transport troops across it or
 to use it at all
 but if not then there
 is an end to the
 whole business and the 300
 000 is gone I know
 You are to pay this
 money on trust that the
 gentleman from Mpine the chairman
 of the Committee on Naval
 Affairs Mr MonsE proposes that
 it shall not be paid
 until the Presi dent shall
 take such security as he
 may think necessary for the
 fulfillment of the contract by
 Thompson Co I do not
 choose to trust it in
 the hands of the President
 It seems to me Mr
 Chairman tl lat in times
 like these when the Government
 is about falling to pieces
 when the I Treasury is
 being plundered when loan biils
 are being passed by Congress
 we ought to know very
 well that we arc acquiring
 something valua ble we appropriate
 300 000 for a purpose
 of this kind That is
 all I havc to say
 These arc facts which present
 themselves right on the face
 of the report and do
 not need any elaboration How
 geiltle men can support this
 measure passes my com prehension
 I am told that there
 is a good deal of
 lobbying all around I do
 not know how thet is
 Gentlemen from Pennsylvania are very
 anx il ious to defeat
 it on account of their
 coal and the Panama Railroad
 Company are anxious to defeat
 it because it might interfere
 with their interests and the
 Chiriqui company are anxious to
 get this appropriation and therefore
 it is said that there
 Mr SiCRLDS and as far
 as that portion of the
 subject is concerned I would
 respectfully suggest to members to
 read in the Globe ot
 to day the views presented
 by the gentleman from Missouri
 and the overwhelming demolishing and
 crushing re ply of the
 gentleman from New York In
 fact if I had a
 disposition to allude to the
 argument of the gentleman from
 Missouri my sympathy for the
 bleeding wounds inflicted on him
 bv the gen tleman frorn
 New York would forbid my
 doing so The gentleman from
 Missouri without any cause without
 any charge being made gratuiö
 tously denied t_hat any lobby
 influence was at I work
 to defeat the Chiriqui route
 This is rather suspicious or
 why this denial before a
 charge was made Now in
 regard to the matter of
 lobbying I here declare that
 I have it from the
 most undoubted authority that there
 is a monopoly at work
 a monopoly which has been
 the curse and bane of
 rny State a monopoly which
 has ground down and oppressed
 the seven hundred thousand inhab
 itants on the Pacific coast
 a monopoly which hag defeated
 the Nicaragua route a monopoly
 which has broken down the
 rrehuantepec route and which now
 rears its brazen front to
 break down this Chiriqui route
 I allude to the Panama
 Rail road Company I do
 not mean to say and
 far be it from me
 to member of this House
 has been improperly approached on
 this subject but I have
 reason to believe that there
 are some persons from the
 city of New York who
 have assumed the livery of
 Heaven to serve the devil
 in at work to perpetuate
 the Panama rail road monopoly
 and to break down this
 Chiriqui route It is a
 monopoly of the most outrageous
 monstrous and infamous kind and
 stinks in the nostrils of
 every honest man on the
 Pacific coast Mr PHELPS As
 the gentleman from Cali fornia
 is noticing some allusions I
 made the othec day I
 desire to say that some
 of the friends of this
 amendment approached me and alleged
 there was an influence at
 work on behalf of the
 Panama Railroad Company to prejudice
 their rights and defeat the
 amendment of the Senate remarked
 at that time that being
 upon the committee which was
 charged with the examination of
 this subject I had yet
 to be approached by a
 single person out side of
 Congress who was opposed to
 the passage of this arnendment
 but tha t I had
 met several gentlemen outside of
 Congress who were urging the
 adoption of the amendment of
 the Senate I alluded to
 the subjectin consequence ofthe remarks
 I had heard that agents
 of the Panama Railroad Company
 were here for the purpose
 of breaking down this contract
 with the Chiriqui Improve ment
 Company I stated that so
 far as my in formation
 extended no opposition had been
 pre sented here to the
 confirmation of this contract upon
 the part of the Panama
 Railroad Company Mr SCOTT I
 state it upon the most
 unques tionable authority that the
 Panama Railroad Com pany are
 opposed to the approval of
 this contract as they have
 opposed and broken down the
 op position on the Nicaragua
 route and on the Te
 huantepec route I do not
 blame them for it They
 have 10 000 000 invested
 in this road which pays
 them twenty per cent per
 annum upon their in vestment
 It is well known that
 they have a sink ing
 fund for the purpose of
 wiping out every at tempt
 that shall be made to
 establish an opposition to their
 monopoly Sir with a capital
 of the sum Of paying
 them an interest of twenty
 they can well afford to
 devote ten per per cent
 I cent for the purpose
 of crushing out all opposing
 enterprises And it is this
 Panama Railroad Com pany which
 raises its front here in
 opposition to the confirmation of
 this contract with the Chiri
 qui company by the Secretary
 of the Navy noth is
 a good deal of lobbving
 about it Mr STEVENS o
 Pennsylvania I ask the ing
 else But sir let us
 examine and see what the
 priv gentleman whether he has
 heard any member I from
 Pennsylvanialobbyingagainstthismeasuro ileges of the Panama
 railroad are As i said
 conditional contract Inade by him
 with the Chiriqui rm 21st
 day of May 1859 for
 the purpose of eceuring to
 the Mr STANTON Not a
 word I have heard before
 for six long years we
 on the Pacific coast have
 had our necks under the
 heel of the Panama United
 certain valuable privileges and no
 lobbying on any side No
 one has approached tied in
 said contract and which said
 contract is hereby me to
 say a word about it
 I Mr SCOTT Mr Chairman
 my remarks on approved 300
 NOOO On which Mr STANTON
 was entitled to the this
 amendment will be as brief
 and concise as possible It
 is very evident that the
 House is get floor Mr
 STANTON Mr Chairman 1 propose
 to ting tired of the
 subject I shall not take
 a legal occupy the attcntion
 of the committee for but
 a or a constitutional view
 of it will I even
 at tempt to answer the
 arcrument made by the gentle
 I have Inade no elaborate
 investi föw minutes gation on
 the subject and I desire
 simply to pre man from
 Missouri Mr PHELps afewdayssince sent
 an idea or t wo
 that lie on the surface
 and That duty has been
 well and faithfully performed about
 which there cannot be any
 controversy it by the d
 istinguished gentleman from New York
 Railroad Company It is true
 that the progress of the
 Pacific coast has been unprecedented
 in the annals of history
 it is true that California
 has in the short space
 of eleven years from a
 popu lation of less than
 twelve thousand persons risen i
 to a State containino not
 less than five hundred thousand
 freemen but it is also
 true that instead of that
 number of inhabitants we should
 have exceeded a million if
 our communication with the Atlantic
 had not been blocked up
 by the out 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 717 order to
 meet this objection and to
 remove this i in the
 bay of Panama in order
 that our vessels raoeous monopoly

 the bankrupt condition of the

 with which not to engage
 in any expenditures which are
 not urgently and immediately required
 by the wants of the
 Government The gentleman from California
 Mr SCOTT in thc earnest
 rernarks which he just made
 has endeavored to pcrsuade the
 House that the question to
 be decided by voting for
 or against the Senate amendment
 is whelber we wilf sup
 port and encourage the present
 monopoly of the Panama Railroad
 Company or destroy that ino
 i nopoly by gravitinff moderate
 aid to a rival enter
 If the appropriation sought would
 if prise made really accomplish
 the latter obiect there would
 be little opposition to it

 sir that is not the

 whether if it shall be

 knows that it is perfectlv
 easy for New Granada to
 raise 5 00 000 in
 France in England or in
 Chis coun try at six
 per cent which witli the
 presentearn ings of the road
 would givc them a clear
 profit of fourteen per cent
 upon In fact the citizens
 of this Govern nent would
 have to pay a profit
 of fron l one million
 five hundred thousand to two
 million dollars annually to a
 foreign Govern ri Fht of
 transit across the Isthmus naent
 for the You will then
 have no inter ocpanic commutiica

 Pacific and will be upon

 terms i i they allege

 is intelli Fence enough in
 the Department to sec that
 every clusive privilege of establishing
 a railroad bett vcen thing
 is gained by t hc
 Governrnent stipulated by the two
 oceans across the Isthmus of
 Panama I have no doubt
 that and further provides that
 during the ninety nine the
 terms of tho contract it
 will be seen to that
 these parties have tbe power
 years of exclusive Drivilege thus
 conceded to that Io confer

 company for the establishment of
 railroads from final arranæemcnts are

 the Government shall neither itself

 well known rille of law
 that paid over whenever a
 party toacontract fails to fulfill
 its stip i i pan

 the power to es i
 tablish anotheriron railroad or macadamized
 road ulations then tho contract
 becomes null and void serving
 as a means of communication

 there must necessarily be a

 embracos not only the pro

 the mercy or courtesy of

 Chiriqui If gentlemen a foreign
 Power för the enjoyanent of
 that riffht propriated Everything sir
 has been the action of
 will refer to out treaty
 with New Granada made Now
 sir let us look at
 the facts of the case
 Last year the legality and
 validit y _ f the
 consti Congress so far as
 this mat tcr has proceeded
 after the grant to the
 Pallama Railroad Company 9 United
 States Statutes at Large p
 897 they power of this
 Goverjiment to establish The reports
 w hich have been laid
 before us in favcn of
 the contract are those of
 our own officers will see
 that the Isthmus of Panama
 expressly was never disputed rllhe
 coal depots at Chiriqui recognized
 as extending to the southern
 bound I iVill this House
 repudiate the expedition which gen
 tle nan from Pexmsylvarna STEVENS
 SUT it sanctioned Look a
 t the saving too in
 respect i ary of Costa
 Rica which is also the
 northern gested hat there was
 no sufficient of the i
 boundary of the of Chiriqui
 existence of coal on the
 Isthmus of Chiriqui l hat
 of the supplies of coal
 for our Navy on the
 Pacific Sir our approved geographies
 show the same the point
 made arrainst thedistinguished chair This
 Government is now paying this
 infamous man of the Committee
 on Naval Affairs last year
 Panama railway monopoly fifty cents
 per ton a thincr New
 Granada is divided into four
 cantons when he advised the
 approval of this contract as
 month for the privilege of
 storing its coal upon i
 and thirty six provinces One
 of these cantons recommended by
 the Secretary of the Navy
 In li one of the
 little islands belonging to that
 company is denominated the Isthmus
 118 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 2 musr of Panama and
 embraces four provinces one of
 which is the province of
 Chiriqui This sir shows with
 perféct plainness that if the
 Government of New Granada had
 undertaken to grant to the
 Chiriqui Company or Mr Thomp
 son a right to construct
 a railroad or even a
 macadamized road across the province
 of Chiri qui or across
 any part thereof with a
 view to connect the two
 oceans the grant would have
 been wholly void as being
 in direct violation of its
 contract with the Panama Railroad
 Company And if under such
 a grant an attempt were
 made to Construct the projected
 Chiriqui railroad the courts would
 be constrained by the plainest
 prin ciples of law upon
 the application of the Panama
 Railroad Companyj to enjoin the
 of the work And this
 sir is the railroad privilege
 for which we are invoked
 to make a vast appro
 priation and to shut our
 eyes demand no secu rity
 and havc faith that all
 will be well This is
 the way in which the
 Panama railroad monopoly is to
 bc broken up and such
 golden fruits are to be
 dropped into our lap Sir
 our credulity though great can
 hardly be thus practiced upon
 Sir it is due to
 the intelligence of the Secretary
 of the Navy to say
 that in his contract with
 the Chiriqui company and Mr
 Thompson he does ndt stipulate
 for a right of transit
 over a railway or for
 the construction of a railway
 nor does he even stipulate
 that the company shall improve
 the old provincial roadway granted
 with certain lim itations to
 Mr Thompson The stipulation is
 simply for a right of
 transit over the roadway which
 could be of no value
 to the Government whatever The
 right to construct a railway
 the practicability of the cntcrprise
 and its value to the
 Government seem to have been
 an after thought morc fully
 to insure the confirmation of
 thc contract by this House
 Mr SICKLES If I understand
 the point made by the
 gentleman and if I have
 failed to do so it
 is not for the want
 of close attention but on
 account of the diffculty of
 hearing hc objects because the
 territory upon which the road
 is to be constructed is
 not within the jurisdiction of
 Costa Rica and thereforc it
 is not covered by tho
 contract of 6th July Mr
 PORTER I do not know
 t ho datc of the
 I will soon allude to
 that point if thc contract
 gentleman will allow me to
 proceed and at that point
 I will thank him to
 interrupt me The Govern ment
 of New Granada acted in
 good faith when it made
 its grunt to Mr Thompson
 and it did not contemplate
 a grant to him of
 the right to construct a
 railway rllhe contract is plain
 I will now read from
 it 1 An exclusive privilege
 for sixty years hereby conceded
 to Ambrose W Thompson for
 improving in a solid Inanner
 fit for thc transit of
 wheeled vehicles and maintaining in
 good condition the provincial road
 opened illnre tl an fourteen
 yearg ago between this clt
 y and Bocas del roro
 which starts froni this capital
 crosses the Cordilleras and terniinates
 at Chiriqui lagoon on the
 Atlantic r lec period tnentioncd
 in this articlé shall date
 frotn the day when the
 Unprovement or the road shall
 be entirely ccnnpleted according to
 the tenns of this con
 Mr Thompson is to incintain
 and improve the old provincial
 road rro constructa railroad would
 supersede and destroy it and
 not maintain and improve it
 I hc context shows that
 by the term wheeled vehicles
 railroad cars were not meant
 to be included and repels
 the idea of a railroad
 grant Article seventeen provides that
 The full time for which
 this privilege is given havincr
 expired the province of Chiriqui
 shall enter in full posses
 Sion of all the properties
 belonging to the enterprise that
 iR the wharves bridges toll
 houses ofhees docks store houses
 c and alt the things
 belonging to the road with
 out Mr Phompson receiving any
 indetnyity whatsoever he being bound
 to deliver over the road
 with all its appur tenanccs
 in the same state in
 which he has kept it
 during the period of thc
 privilege Who ever heard sir
 of a toll house to
 a rail road What was
 meant was what was said
 that this company should improve
 and maintain the old provincial
 common highway and mighterect ton
 gates 10 collect tolls thereon
 Something has been said here
 about a grant by the
 Government of Costa Rica to
 this Chiriqui company to construct
 a railroad Why sir the
 southern boundary of Costa Rica
 is many miles from either
 terminus of this projected railroad
 and this railroad at no
 point touches the terri tory
 of Costa Rica Mr SICKLES
 It is right at this
 point that I desired to
 interrupt the gentleman That posi
 tion is accurate perhaps with
 reference to the former limits
 and boundaries between Costa Rica
 and New Granada but it
 is not correct with refer
 ence to the present boundaries
 and limits since the new
 treaty of limits and boundaries
 between New Granada and Costa
 Rica Mr PORTER I thank
 the gentleman for alluding to
 that matter for L have
 the treaty here and reference
 to the map accompanying this
 sec ond report will show
 that I have spoken in
 view of that very treaty
 What does that treaty say
 That the river Doraces Dorces
 or Dorados designed by article
 fort y one as the
 dividing line of the two
 repub lies on the Atlantic
 side is the first river
 a short distance to the
 east of Monkey Point Ec
 This river is not only
 far north of the eastern
 terminus of this projected Chiriqui
 railroad but not less than
 sixty miles distant from the
 north ernmost part of the
 Chiriqui gulf itself Mr MORSE
 Let me ask the gentleman
 which road he is arguing
 about Mr PORTER 1 am
 arguing about the road which
 this commission has reported upon
 Mr MORSE The last report
 of the commis sioners Mr
 PORTER Yes sir that one
 An exam ination of the
 map will show that this
 railroad is not at any
 point according to my understanding
 within fifty miles of the
 southern boundary of Costa Rica
 Mr MORSE I would state
 that this gulf of Golfito
 is within the boundaries of
 Costa Rica and I believe
 the road under the new
 treaty in reference to boundaries
 is within Costa Rica There
 is an unsettled boundary there
 The maps state it both
 ways but there is a
 treaty between the two Governments
 not yet ratified by Costa
 Rica by which Costa Rica
 gives up some lands upon
 the lagoons and Granada some
 lands upon the gulf of
 Golfito The gentleman will find
 that thc road starts from
 the territory of Costa Rica
 Mr PORTER If my friend
 will refer to the contract
 between the Chiriqui company and
 Costa Rica hc will see
 that the railroad which it
 allows MI Thompson the privilege
 to construct is from fifty
 to a hundred miles north
 of the gulfs of Chir
 iqui and Golfito But it
 is enough for my present
 ar rt unent that it
 is north of it at
 all It would be enough
 for my argument if one
 quarter or one third of
 this rail road as projected
 is to be constructed within
 the territorial limits of New
 Granada for neither the Government
 of New Granada nor any
 province thereof has granted the
 right to Mr Dhompson or
 the Chiriqui company to construct
 a railroad at all and
 if they should undertake to
 make one the grant would
 be void because of the
 previous exclusive grant to the
 Panama company I ask Tentlemen
 who are doing me the
 honor of listen Ing to
 my remarks to examine this
 matter for themselves and tliey
 will find that buta very
 small part of this road
 I do not believe any
 pai t within the jurisdiction
 of Costa Rica Nor docs
 the contract of the Secretary
 of the Navy provide for
 a right of transit upon
 any railroad or other road
 in Costa Rica If there
 be any doubt left concerning
 the right of the Chiriqui
 company and Mr Thompson to
 construct the projected railroad it
 will be dispelled by a
 reference to the lelter of
 the Attorney Gen eral of
 the United States where he
 says concern ing the contract
 of the New Granadian Govern
 ment with Mr Thompson It
 must also bc romcnibere d
 that this grant of a
 road way does not include
 any right to niake a
 railroad Then we have the
 opinion of the Atlorncy Gen
 eral of the United States
 the treaty with New Granada
 the grant to the Panama
 Railroad Com pany the grant
 of the Provincial Legislature of
 Costa Rica all repelling the
 idea ofa right on the
 part of this company to
 construct a railroad in the
 province of Chiriqui The only
 right acquired by virtue of
 this grant of the New
 Granadian Gov ernment and the
 contract of the Secretary of
 thc Navy with the Chiriqui
 company is the supposed right
 to transport our horses our
 seamen our troops and munitions
 of war over a common
 provincial highway But sir as
 if to show how utterly
 valueless the contract of the
 Secretary wi th this Chiriqui
 company is it is expressly
 provided in the grant of
 the New Granadian Government that
 the troops and munitions of
 of no foreign Government shall
 be transported over that high
 I way except by the
 express authority of that Gov
 ernment It has been gravely
 argued that under the con
 tract with this company we
 acquire the invaluable right to
 use certain harbors within the
 gulfs of Chiriqui and Golfito
 Sir has the Government of
 New Gh anada parted with
 its jurisdiction overany of its
 harbors No sir nowhere Does
 this com pan y even
 own the land around all
 or most of the harbors
 Nothing before us shows any
 such thing We obtain from
 this company no right to
 use harbors which we have
 not always enjoyed If we
 wish to obtain any enlargement
 of our rights the Government
 of New Granada and not
 this company is the authority
 to which to apply Sir
 a most important consideration is
 yet to be presented The
 contract between Mr Thompson and
 the Government of New Granada
 provides for a forfeiture upon
 any infraction or default of
 Thompson in complying with any
 of its con ditions What
 assurance have we that when
 we have paid our 300
 000 some infraction or dc
 fault may not at once
 destroy the whole value of
 our contract Indeed it may
 readily be seen how it
 might become the interest of
 the company to commit such
 a breach or allow such
 a default to get rid
 of the burdens of their
 contract shall have very little
 to say sir about the
 much boasted right to the
 use of coal conferred by
 this contract The masterly argument
 of the gen tleman from
 New York Mr POTTLE has
 made further argument on that
 subject superfluous is not shown
 that this company have acquired
 a right to all the
 convenient coal beds in the
 prov ince of Chiriqui and
 it is likely that we
 could acquire coal privileges on
 better terms from the If
 the supply too is Granadian
 Government inexhaustible as is pretended
 the company will always find
 it to its Interest to
 dispose of It at a
 fair price If not inexhaustible
 I may add that it
 is not at all clear
 under the contract that our
 Government will have an exclusive
 right to its use For
 this coal we are to
 pay ten cents per ton
 and the cost of mining
 and delivery Who shall determine
 the cost Sir between shrewd
 individuals on the one side
 and the Government on the
 other it is not difficult
 to sce who will de
 termine it and in whose
 favor it will be deter
 mined The cost practically will
 be whatever this company chooses
 to charge if indeed it
 chooses after receiving the money
 to perform any part of
 the contract Herc Mr Chairman
 is an opportunity when our
 Treasury is bankrupt our revenues
 cut short our securities sold
 at a ruinQus sacrifice to
 raise means to carry on
 the Government here is an
 opportunity to throw away a
 third ofa million dol laps
 Here is a chance by
 a prodigal expendi ture of
 borrowed money to purchase rights
 w iich we already enjoy
 and privileges utterly empty and
 illusory It will soon be
 seen whether we will embrace
 it Mr MORSE then obtained
 the floor but yielded Mr
 DAWES who moved that the
 committee rise The motion was
 agreed tb So the committee
 rose and the Speaker having
 resumed the chair Mr BURNETT
 reported tha t the Committee
 of the Whole on the
 state of the Union had
 had under consideration the state
 of the Union generally and
 particularly the amend ments of
 the Senate to the deficiency

 the ap pointment of an

 objection to that The SPEAKER
 The Chair supposes not but

 many propositions to be discussed
 Mr SICKLES 1 suggest to

 remarks which submitted to the
 Senate a few days ago
 on the resolution in relation
 to the Sen ate s
 order in favor of Mrs
 Linn I styled the letter
 of Mr Medill in regard
 to it as imperti nent
 I rise to sav what
 I would have said then
 but the Senator from Ohio
 Mr PUGH took me up
 a little sharp about it
 that I used that term
 in its literal and legal
 sense the very one that
 is given in the dictionary
 impertinent in that itdid I
 did not mean not pertain
 to the subject matter it
 to be personally dffensive to
 Mr Medill 1 meant it
 In the same way that
 it is used in an
 swers to bills in equity
 The first meaning given in
 the dictionary is that it
 is not pertinent and does
 not belong to the subject
 matter in hand That is
 what I meant to say
 of his letter that it
 I did not mean to
 did not belong to the
 subject make any personal application
 of it to him Mr
 PUGH The Senator from New
 I lamp shire was kind
 enough to make that explanation
 to me on Saturday after
 the adjournment and I told
 him then that I was
 very sorry to have given
 him any pain by what
 I then thought was an
 ap propriatc response to the
 word used by him m
 Its usual acceptation I beg
 his pardon for hav ing
 misunderstood him PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS
