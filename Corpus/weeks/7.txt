 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 5S5 having
 the losses upon it being
 greater to the merchant than
 the profits The credits are
 almost all upon one side
 consequently the osses are also
 There is no reciprocity in
 the credit system be tween
 the North and the South
 There is scarcely any thing
 of northern manufacture that the
 South will not want as
 much after disunion as it
 does now There is hardly
 any product or manufac ture
 of the North that the
 South now purchases of her
 that she cannot furnish against
 the markets of the world
 therefore free trade so far
 as the South is concerned
 could Ilia ke but littlcdifference
 to the commercial or manufacturing
 interests of i so much
 greater in numbcrs with almost
 infinite resources that such an
 unequal contest could only i
 excite feelings of pity for
 them with every reflect ino
 mind We can afford to
 be magnanimous and forbearing and
 let us do nothing which
 will put us in the
 wrono in any particular in
 the eyes of i the
 civilized world If we do
 not yield we are told
 by the advocates of compromise
 we are like the Government
 and tories of Great Britain
 in the days of theRevo
 lution They were told by
 the Burkes and thc Pitts
 that the colonists were righ
 in resisting and the King
 would lose the colonies if
 the Govern i ment did
 not recede So we were
 told now that the North
 If we should have a
 peaceable division which this Government
 shall be overthrown if we
 do I conceive next to
 impossible but if it were
 pos not cease to hate
 slavery and love freedom It
 sible the trade of the
 South would be more valu
 i seems to me this
 parallel should be reversed The
 able to the North than
 it is now Credit would
 colonists vere struggling against usurpation
 and be much more restricted
 than now and our losses
 on the part of those
 in power They would be
 comparatively light Our Government would
 also be relieved from an
 enormous expend iture which we
 have been are now and
 prob ably will be obliged
 to incur for the benefit
 of the South if we
 continue together most of which
 is drawn from the pockets
 of the northern peo ple
 The persons and property of
 our citizens would be much
 better protected then than now
 A united North under one
 Government would then as now
 be masters of this continent
 and all other Powers here
 would have to bow in
 hum ble submission tö our
 will We should be three
 times as great in numbers
 very much larger in inhabited
 territory and in wealth and
 material resources incalculably superior to
 the United States when she
 waged a successful war acainst
 Great Britain no longer ago
 than 1812 a nation of
 freemen with resources so vast
 with an I intelligence so
 great with a mission so
 important would not yield and
 they overthrew their power Just
 so with us We have
 resisted the usurpa tions and
 aggressions of tbc slave power
 and they would not listen
 to our appeals and we
 have risen in our strength
 and overthrown them I heard
 tlie distinguished Senator from Missis
 sippi say the other day
 that it would soon bc
 too latc if it was
 not already to tender the
 olive branch of peace that
 obstinacy and refusal to make
 concessions in season cost one
 king of Eng land his
 head and drove another his
 successor into exile And he
 compared us to King James
 who refused to listen to
 all complaints until hc saw
 his kingly scepter passing from
 him when he would gladly
 have made all the concessions
 demanded of liim but it
 was too late and he
 was I lore again is
 the mistake of driven into
 exile misapplication The parallel should
 be reversed James came into
 power under most favorahle aus
 picos with a Parliament devoted
 to his interests what a
 speetacle we should present to
 the civil which if he
 had been moderate and wise
 he could ized world When
 I reflect upon it I

 would be as pack threads

 unshorn Samson Before I close
 I wish to say a
 word in reply to the
 aspersions so frequently Cast upon
 the fair fame of Massachusetts
 and her distinguished Chief magistrate
 I will say now what
 I haved said before in
 this place that Massachusetts needs
 no eulogy from any of
 her sons Her works praise
 her and envy or malice
 may occaSion her disparagement but
 she stafids forth to day
 in the estimation of all
 enlightened men through out the
 world as the model State
 of this Union Her achievements
 in science in literature in
 arts in industrial pursuits and
 in works of benevolence and
 her intellectual and mbral standard
 gcthcr unsurpassed by any section
 of cquäl terri torial extent
 upon this continent Eqütdly pre
 eminent is her historic greatness
 and so Well settled is
 this by the general judgment
 orall man kind that no
 one whose opinion is worth
 quoting dares to deny her
 historic supremacy Her de votion
 to the interests of freedom
 is but the record of
 her history SIIC ever has
 been and evpr will be
 true to hcp plighted faith
 She will observe every constitutional
 obligation As she made greater
 sacrifices of the treasures of
 her coffers and the blood
 of her sons than any
 other State to secure constitutional
 liberty so she will al
 ways stand by the flag
 of the Union as the
 symbol of its power and
 the type of its continuity
 Her excellent Governor has been
 most basely slandered not only
 by the Opposition press but
 writhin the walls of this
 Cäéitol by those who should
 have known better as defender
 of the invasion of Virginia
 by John Brown The recoi
 d Of his testimony g
 ven under the solcmnitics of
 an oath not long after
 the occurrence in this very
 Capitol before the Harper s
 Ferry invcsligating committee stamps the
 declaration as false He has
 often declared in public and
 private that John Brown s
 invasion of Virginia was without
 justi fication or wa rrant
 Mr MAYNARD gentleman from Mas
 suchusetts will allow me desire
 to say a single word
 in explanation of his remark
 that the Gov crnor of
 Massachusetts has been grossly slandered
 in respect to his favoring
 the John Brown raid I
 suppose it is proper that
 the fact should be known
 that the statement of thc
 supposed sen timent of the
 Governor of Massachusetts origin ated
 in a reported speech delivered
 in Tremont Temple if I
 mistake not about the 19th
 of Novem bcr 1859 on
 taking the chair to preside
 over a meeting called for
 the purpose of sympathizing with
 the family of John Brown
 perhaps or with some persons
 connected with that unfortunate affair
 Mr ALLEY say tothe gentleman
 from Tennessee that I desire
 not to be undérstood as
 imputing to any one in
 this House or in the
 Sen subjection With us cither
 one of several of our
 as bloodless and as beneficent
 in its results as ate
 an intentional misrepresentation of the
 posi tion of Governor Andrew
 I stated that has that
 of 1688 then indeed may
 the péople well old States
 could raise equip and maintain
 acon been basely slandered by
 tho Opposition press at rejoice
 siderable army upon its own
 resources and all the North
 and that the report which
 has been combined could defy
 the world in arms This
 is I This Government in
 my judgment will ncvcr made
 of his remarks on the
 occasion to which the no
 exacgerated picture as every thoughtful
 man be overthrown W c
 may have secession tem porary
 perhaps permanent and it may
 bc wise gentleman refers Was
 a garbled report that he
 has knows Is it for
 us then to humiliate ourselves
 since contradicted it and that
 his testimony given sacrifice our
 principles and be bound hand
 and policy to lot some
 of the refractory Stat os
 go but they will never
 repent before the investigating committee
 of the Senate peaceably if
 they foot by this arrogant
 slave power to save these
 southcrn States from rushing upon
 their own it hut once
 and that will bc always
 If they can proves the
 declaration to have been false
 1 will il state to
 the gentleman further that I
 have heard afford to go
 we can certainly afford to
 lose them dest ruction Never
 Never But they are our
 brethren and we would not
 But deeply as I should
 deplore it should feel Governor
 Andrew both in private and
 in public say that thc
 invasion of John Brown wus
 withoub forget if we could
 that they are descendants of
 that much worse political evils
 could befall us justificati01 1
 or excuse that he never
 had the the same heroicancestry
 and thus far have shared
 and for one I should
 try to bc content i
 do not believe with someof
 t hose who are slightest
 sympathy with his raid whatever
 and with us a common
 destiny And let us remem
 that they know not what
 they do They I implorirv
 us to submit to any
 demand to save that he
 never said In his life
 that he would justify ber
 t ue Union that may
 bc made upon us that
 free or tolerate any such
 conduct have been deceived and
 imposed upon as to our
 purposes and views by our
 opponents at the dom will
 die with the destruction of
 this Rcpub E Massachusetts has
 had twenty one Governors North
