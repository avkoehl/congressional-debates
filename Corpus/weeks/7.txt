 CRITTENDEN What is the question
 The VICE PRESIDENT The motion
 is to take up the
 message of the President of
 the Uni ted States in
 unswer to a resolution of
 the Sen Mr SLIDELL Temporarily
 The PRESIDENT The resolutions which

 of the Senate the rcasons
 given by the President in

 instant lor not communicating to
 the Senate at an earlier
 day the fact of his
 having appointed on thc 31st

 are not satisläc tory Resolved
 That in the opinion of
 the Senate the grounds assurned
 by the President in his

 of his views of the
 executive authority to make durincr
 the session of the Senate
 an appoiut ncnt of an
 acting Sec retary of War
 for a period not exceeding
 six months lim ited by
 his own discretion are at
 variance not only with the
 intent letter spi rit of
 tl c Constitution but witli
 the tl u and nu
 aning of t he act
 of 13th Februai y 1795
 to 4i hich he has
 reterred and if suffered to
 pass by without express dis
 sent would a precedent alike
 dangerous to the principles on
 which our systen of Governtnent
 was estab fished and in
 derogation of the constitutional rights
 and privileges ot thc Senate
 The VICE PRESIDENT Does the
 Senator ask for the present
 consideration of the resolu tions
 Mr TRUMBULL Let them lie
 over Mr SLIDELL very well
 then 1 give notice that
 to morrow I will call
 up the resolutions make the
 motion now to take up
 the President s message for
 the purpose of considering it
 I the resolutions cannot be
 entertained to day I shall
 call them up to morrow

 VICE PRESIDENT The Senatorfi om
 Louisiana moves to take up
 the message of the President
 of the United States in
 answer to the resolution of
 the Senate in regard to
 the vacancy in the offce
 of Secretary of Mr COLLAMER
 i believe the time fixed
 for taking up the bill
 for the admission of Kansas
 has now arrived I rnove
 that it be taken up
 The VICE PRESIDENT Hearing a
 gestion of that kind from
 some Seriator the Chair inquired
 of tbc Secretary if there
 had been any order of
 the Senate to take it
 up at half past twelve
 o clock and is informed
 there is none but it
 is unfinished business and will
 take precedence at one o
 clock The VICE PRESIDEN Does
 the Senator from Florida ask
 unanimo consent The Chair hears
 no objection Mr YULEE Mr
 resident I rise to make
 known to the Senate that
 in consequence of cer II
 tain proceedings which have lately
 taken place in I the
 State of Florida my colleague
 and myself are of the
 opinion that our connection with
 this body is legally terminated
 I i The Slate of
 Florida has through a convention
 II Of her people duly
 assembled decided to recall l
 the powers delegated to this
 Government and to assume the
 full éxercise of ail hcr
 sovereign rights It as an
 independent and separate community I
 am sure I truly represent
 her when I say that
 her people have not been
 insensible to the many blessings
 they have enjoyed under the
 Constitu tion of the United
 States nor to the proper
 ad vantages of n Union
 directed to the great purposes
 of establishing just ice insuring
 dornestic tran quillity protnotin g
 the general welfare and secur
 ing thc blessings of tibcrty
 to themselves and their posterity
 f i hcy have held
 in patriotic reverence the memories
 that belong to the Union
 of Amer icall States in
 its ori in and progress
 and have cluncr with a
 fond assurancc to the hope
 that its wise plan and
 the just principles upon which
 it was based would secure
 for it a perpetual endur
 ance and transcendent usefulness They
 have decided that their social
 tranquillity and civil security are
 jeoparded by a longer con
 tinuance in the Union not
 from the contemplated or necessary
 operation of the Constitution but
 from the consequences as they
 conceive of an unjust exercise
 of the powers it conferred
 and a persistent disregard of
 the spirit of fraternity and
 equality in which it was
 founded Recent events have impressed
 tl hern witli the belief
 that the peace of their
 homes and the preservation of
 their com munity interests can
 only be secured by an
 im mediate withdrawal from the
 dangers of a per verted
 and hostile employment of the
 powers of the Federal Government
 They are not willing to
 disturb the peace of their
 associates by an inflamed and
 protracted struggle within the Union
 for rights they could never
 with self respect or safety
 surrender and against a policy
 of administration made a special
 order for half past twelve
 o clock I gard to
 be hostile to their best
 interests and vio An ofttir
 was made for an understanding
 of that lative of the
 legitimate duty and trusts of
 the Gov kind but it
 was not accepted but still
 I am Will l ernment
 They have preferred to abandon
 all the ing to take
 it up and dispose of
 it and if taken hopes
 they rested upon the cormnon
 growth and up I wish
 to speak just two minutes
 and no common power of
 the Union and to assume
 the rnore serious responsibilities ofa
 separate existence and The VICE
 PRESIDENT The question is new
 and untried relations It is
 only under a deep on
 the motion of the Senator
 frorn Louisiana sense of duty
 to themselves and their posterity
 that Mr TRUMBULL Would it
 be in order to so
 important a step has been
 taken I am sure that
 move to postponc all other
 prior orders and pro the
 people of Florida will ever
 preserve a orateful cecd to
 the consideration of the bill
 for the ad memory of
 their past connection with this
 Gov mission of Kansas ernment
 and a just pride in

 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE spirits
 in all those States whose
 sense of justice and whose
 brave efforts to uphold the
 right have been not the
 less appreciated nor will be
 the less remembered because unsuccessful
 We have not been wantitv
 in timely warning to our
 associates of the unhappy tendency
 of their policy It was
 in the unhallowed pursuit as
 we thought of sectional aggrandizement
 and the in dulgence of
 unregulated sentiments of moral duty
 that the equilibri um of
 power between the sections which
 had been maintained until then
 was ruth lessly and unwisely
 destroyed by the legislation Of
 1850 The injustice and danger
 of those prp cecdings was
 considered by a large portion
 of the South to be
 so flagrant that vve resorted
 to an unusual formality in
 bringing our views and apprehensions
 to the attention of the
 country Upon our official responsibility
 a number of the Senators
 thosc of Florida among them
 giving expression to the opinions
 of thcir constituents presented a
 written protest against the wrong
 to which our section was
 subjected and a fraternal warning
 against the dangerous tendency of
 the policy which incited to
 that wrong That pro test
 was refused a place in
 the Journals of this body
 contrary as we thought to
 the express duty enjoined by
 the Constitution but it went
 before the public and I
 think it proper to recall
 the attention of this body
 to its contents in the
 hour when the apprehensions it
 expressed are fatally realized Let
 me be pardoned Mr President
 for detain ing the Senatc
 with a further remark The
 cir cumstance that the State
 of Floridn was formed upon
 territory acquired by the United
 States and the paucity of
 her numbers has bccn occasion
 ally remarked upon Owing to
 causes she could not contrdl
 her settlement has becn until
 rc Thc follow ing is
 the protest referred to in
 Mr YULEE s ren arks
 and which was presented in
 the Senatc by Mr HUNTER
 on the 14th of August
 1850 with a Cor leave
 to have it spread upon
 the Journal of the Scnate
 We the undersigned Senators deeply
 impressed the I ilnportance ot
 the occasion and t vith
 a solc nn sense of
 the responsibility under which we
 are acting respectiidly sub mit
 the föllowinu protest against the
 Caliiör nia as a State
 into this Union and request
 that it Inay be entered
 upon the Journ l of
 the Senate WV c fuel
 that it is not enough
 to have resisted in debatc
 alone a bill so fraught
 with rniscl ief to the
 Union and the States which
 we rep resent with all
 the resources of argument which
 we pos sessed but that
 it is also due to
 ourselves thc people whose interests
 have becn intrusted to our
 care and to posterity which
 oven in its mostdistantgeucratioas Inay
 its con sequences to leave
 in whatcvcriörm Inay be most
 solen mll and enduring a
 Inen orial of thc which
 we have made to this
 iheasure and of thc reasons
 by wlüch we l avc
 been govertled Upon the pazrs
 ot a Journal which t
 tre Con kept so long
 as the Senatc rnay have
 st itution requires to be
 an existence we desire to
 p ace the reasons upon
 which we are willing to
 be judacd by generations livin
 r and yet to cmne
 tar our opposition to a
 bill whosc conseqitcncos may be
 so durable and Ijortentous as
 to make it an object
 of decp interest t all
 who ma y coine after
 us WV e have dissented
 t rom this bill bccausc
 it gives the sanction of
 and thus itnparts validity to
 thc unauthor ized action of
 a portion of the inhabitants
 of CalifOrnia hy which an
 odious discrimination is madc against
 the prop cvty of the
 fifteen slaveholding States ot the
 Union who are thus deprived
 or that position of equality
 which the Constitution so manifestly
 designs and which constitutes the
 only sure and stable iOundation
 upon which this Union can
 repose Because the right of
 the slaveholding States to a
 com mon and cqual enjoyment
 of tbc territory of tuc
 Union lias been delOated by
 a system of Ineast_trcs which
 without the authority of precedent
 of law or of the
 Constitution gress must sanc tion
 and adopt should this bill
 become a Ia v In
 sanctioning this system of measures
 this Gov ernment will admit
 that the inhabitants of its
 i erritories whether permanent or
 transient and svhether lawfully or
 unlawfully occupying thc sannc tna
 rm a State without the
 previous authority ot law without
 even the partial security of
 a territorial organization törmed by
 Congress without any legat census
 or other sufficient evidence of
 their possessing the urnber of
 citizens necessary to author ize
 the representation which they may
 claim and without anv of
 those salOguatds about the ballot
 box which can only be
 provided by law and whieh
 are necessary to ascer tain
 the true sense of a
 people It will admit too
 that Congress having refused to
 providc a government except upon
 the condition of excluding slavery
 by law the exec utive
 branch of this Governuxe nt
 may at its own discretion
 invite such inhabitants to meet
 in convention under such rules
 as it or its agents
 may prescribe and to Form
 a con stitution affecting not
 only their own tights but
 those also of fifteen States
 of the Confederacy by including
 territory with the purpose of
 excluding those States from its
 enjoy Incnt and Athout regard
 to t fie natural fitness
 of boundary or any of
 the considerations which should properly
 detenn ine the liniits of
 a State It will also
 that the con vcntion thus
 called into existence by the
 Executive nmy be paid by
 him out of the funds
 of the United States with
 cently comparatively slow But her
 population exceeds that of sevcn
 of the sixteen States that
 composed the Union when the
 census of 1790 was taken
 under the new Constitution and
 six of L he thirteen
 original States had fewer numbers
 when they formed the Constitution
 Rights of sover eignty and
 liberty depend not upon numbers
 It is quite truc that
 her limits comprehend a part
 of the territory to which
 the title was ac quired
 by the United States from
 Spain But it is also
 true that a part of
 the considerationtfpr the cession was
 a reservation to the inhabitä
 6ts of the right to
 admission into the Federal Union
 upon terms of equality and
 it was in view of
 this right that most of
 the inhabitants remained there If
 their number has been increased
 by subsequcnt immicrration it was
 mostly of citizens from Others
 of the United States who
 wcrc lineal inheritors of the
 glories and fruits of the
 American Revo lution In pursuance
 of this stipulation and of
 the cs tablished policy of
 the country they vet e
 admit ted into the Union
 and ip thc act of
 admission Florida was expressly recognized
 and deckared to be a
 STATE and admit ted into
 the Union on an EQUAL
 footincy with the original States
 IN ALL RESPECTS WHATEVER In
 the exercise of her equal
 Eight in the Union and
 moved by a comrnon sympathy
 with the peo pie of
 the section of which her
 territory forms the cxtrerne southern
 part and with w osc
 fate her destiny is indissolubly
 bound Florida has resolved to
 withdraw from the present Union
 I ler course derives sanction
 from the imbortant fact that
 she is preceded in it
 by the chivalrous State which
 by a spirited act in
 1765 became by acknowl edgment
 of a l lassachuset ts
 historian THE And her resolution
 is FOUNDER OF THE UN10N
 to make that convention dependent
 upon it and last but
 not Icast in the series
 of Ineasures which this Govermnent
 must adopt and sanction in
 passing this bill is the
 release 0k the authority of
 the United Stares by the
 Executivc alone to a gover
 uneut thus fönned and not
 presenting eV6n iicient evidence of
 its having the assent of
 a Inajority of tbc people
 whom it was designed W7ith
 a vigwof all these considerations
 the undersigned arc constrained to
 bclicve that thisGovernment could never
 bc brought to adtnit a
 State presenting itself under suC11
 circumstances iC It were not
 the purpose of excluding the
 people of tbc slaveholding States
 fro n all opportunity of
 settling will their property in
 that I erritory Because to
 vote för a bill passed
 under such circum stances would
 be to agree to a
 principle xvhiclk excl Iörcvcr hereafter
 as it docs now the
 States which we rep regent
 from ail enjoyincnt of the
 conuno territory of thc a
 principle whiel destroys the equal
 rights of their Union the
 eqnality of t heir States
 in the Confed constituents oracy
 the equal dignity of t
 hose vll nn they represent
 as Inen and as citizens
 in tbc c ye of
 the law and their equal
 tille to the protection of
 the Government and the Consti
 tution Because the adlnission of
 California as a State into
 the Union without any previous
 reservation assented to by her
 of the puhl c lcnnain
 11 ight involve an actual
 surrcilder of that dotnain to
 01 at all events places
 it s fu Lure disposal
 at the rncrcy of that
 State as no reservation in
 the bill can be binding
 upon her until she assents
 to it and as hcr
 dis hereafter would in no
 Inannel am ct or impair
 the scnt act of her
 admission Because all the propositions
 have been rcjeeted which have
 been made to obtain cither
 a recognition of the right
 of the slaveholding States to
 a eon unoil enjoyment of
 all the territory of the
 Unitcd States or to a
 fair division or that territory
 between the slaveholding and non
 slavcboldinø States of the Union
 every e trort having failed
 which has been made to
 obtain a fair division of
 tho territory proposed to be
 brought in as the State
 of California But lastly vvc
 dissent from this bill and
 solemnly protest aaainst its passatre
 because in sanctiouina measures so
 contrary to fOnncr precedent to
 obviouæ policy to the spirit
 and intent of the Constitution
 of the United States for
 the purpose of excluding the
 slaveholding States froni the ter
 ritory thus to be erected
 into a State this Government
 in effect declares that the
 exclusion of s avery from
 tbe terri tory of the
 United States is an object
 so high and i nportant
 as to justify a disregard
 not only of all tbc
 principles of sound policy but
 also of the Constitution itself
 Against this conclusion vve Inust
 now and lörever protest as
 it is destructive of the
 safety au t liberties of
 those whose rights have been
 counnit ted to our eare
 fatal to the peace and
 equality of the States which
 we represent and Inust lead
 if persisted in to the
 dissolution of that Confederacy which

 Acknowledginz Mr President with gratefål

 have enjoyed in my intercoursewith
 the gentlem en of this
 body and with most cordial
 good W isbes for their
 welfare I retire from theii

 the mandate of my State
 ond with a PELORY Concurring
 as I do with V
 all that my colleague has
 said I ask but a
 brief mcnnent to add a
 word or two further In
 retiring from this body I
 cannot but feel and I
 will not forbear the expression
 of profound recrret that existirv
 causes imperatively impel us eparation
 When reason and jüstice shall
 to h is have tisserted
 ascendency over party and passion
 they will bc justly appreciated
 and this southern movement demanded
 by considerations dear to freemen
 in every age will stand
 proudly vindi cated Throughout her
 long and patient endurancé Of
 insult and wrong the South
 has clung to the Union
 with unfaltering fidelity a fidelity
 which while nourishing irritation in
 1 he hearts of her
 own sons has but served
 to nerve the arms of
 her adversaries Florida camc into
 the Union fifteen years ago
 upon an equality with the
 original States and their rjghts
 in t h c Confederacy
 arc cqually her righte She
 could not if she would
 separate hcr action from her
 southern sisters and demanded as
 her action is by those
 considerations which a free people
 can never ignore she would
 notif she could From the
 Union governed by the Constitution
 as our fathers made it
 there breathes not a secessionist
 upon her soil but a
 deep sense of injustice inequality
 and insecurity produced by the
 causes to which have adverted
 is brought home to the
 reason and patriotism of her
 people and to secure and
 maintain those rights which the
 Constitution ho longer accords them
 they have placed the State
 of Florida out of the
 Con fed eracy In thus
 turning from the Union to
 the vailed and unknown future
 we are neither iønorant not
 reckless of the lions in
 our path We know that
 the prompt and peaceful organization
 of a piac tical republican
 government securing liberty equality and
 justice to every citizen is
 one of the most difficult
 as it is one of
 the most mo mentous duties
 devolving upon men and nowhere
 perhaps upon the earth beyond
 our own country could this
 great work bc achieved But
 so well are human rights
 and national liberty understood by
 our people so deeply are
 they imbued with the spirit
 of freedom and of govern
 that were this Republic utterly
 brOken and destroyed like the
 shattered vase of the poet
 to whose very fragments the
 scent of the roses still
 clung its very ruins breathing
 the true spirit of civil
 and religious liberty would plead
 for and demand a wise
 and noble reconstruction I Whatever
 may be the immediate results
 there I fore of the
 momentous crisis now upon us
 I have no fears for
 the freedom of my countrymen
 Nor do I admit for
 a moment that the great
 American ex periment of govern
 ment has proved or canproye
 a failure butl maintain on
 the contrary that pass ing
 events should inspire in the
 hearts triotand statesman not only
 hope but önfidenpe Five States
 have alrcady dissolved their gonnec
 tion with thc Union and
 throughout the everal stages by
 which their people in their
 sövereign capacity have reached secession
 have ex hibited a calmness
 and d dibéhatiöh which find
 no parallel in the history
 of mankind This is 486
 ao ainst our laws who
 fled to the North with
 our forms of the Constitution
 Must we consent to THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January A entirely
 of our admirable system of
 independent State governments And sir
 were this Federal District with
 Presidents Congress Departments and courts
 and all the machinery of
 Federal Government suddenly sunk a
 thousand fathoms deep under the
 admirable working of theseState governments
 the rights and liberties of
 their people would receive no
 shock or detriment In thus
 sevcrincr our connection with sister
 States ve desire to go
 in peace to maintain to
 wards them an attitude not
 only of peace but if
 possible of kindness and it
 is for them to determ
 Ine whether we shall do
 so or not and whether
 Commerce the great pacificator of
 earth is to connect us
 as producers manufacturcrs and con
 sumers in future friendly relations
 If folty wickedness or iride
 shall preclude the hope of
 peace they may at once
 rear up diffculties in our
 path leading at once to
 what I confess I regard
 and dread as one of
 the greatest calamitics that can
 befall a nation civil war
 a civil war embrac ing
 equally North and South But
 sir bo our diffculties what
 they may stand forth a
 uni ted people to grapple
 with and to conquer them
 Our willingness to shed our
 blood in this cause is
 the highest proof we can
 offer of the sincerity of
 our connections and I warn
 nay I implore you not
 to repeat the fatal folly
 of the Bourbons and mistakc
 a nation for a faction
 for the people of ihe
 South as one man declare
 that sink or swim live
 or die they will not
 as fi ccmen submit to
 the degradation of a constrained
 existence under a violated Constitution
 But sir we desire to
 part from you in peace
 From the establishment of the
 Anglo Saxons upon this continent
 to this hour they have
 never as colonies or States
 shed the blood of each
 other and I trust we
 shall be spared this great
 calamity We seek not to
 war upon or to conquer
 you and we know that
 you Imbrue your hands in
 our cannot conquer us blood
 and thc rains of a
 century l vill not wash
 from them the stain while
 coming generations will weep for
 your wickedness and folly In
 thus leavmg the Senate and
 returnmg to my own State
 to pursue with unfaltering head
 and heart that path be
 it gloomy brigllt to which
 her honor and interest may
 lead I cannot forbear thc
 acknowledgment of the kindness and
 courtesy which I huvc ever
 received from many of the
 gentlemen of the Opposition Senators
 to whom I am indebted
 for much that 1 shall
 cherish through life with pleasure
 and toward whom I entertain
 none but sentiments of kindness
 and re spect And 1
 trust sirs that when we
 next con front each other
 whether at this bar or
 that of the just God
 who knows the hearts of
 all our lips shall not
 have uttered a word our
 hands shall not have committed
 an act directed against the
 blood of our people On
 this side of the Chamber
 we leave with profound regret
 those whom we evill cherish
 in our hearts and whose
 names will be hallowed by
 our children One by one
 we have seen the representatives
 of the truc and fearless
 friends of the Constitution fall
 at our side until hardly
 a forlorn hope remains and
 whatever may be our destiny
 tbc future with all of
 life s darker Inem orics
 will be brightened by the
 recollection of their devotion to
 the true principles of our
 Gov ernment and of that
 wealth of head and heart
 in their intercourse with us
 which has endeared them to
 us and to ours forever
 Mr CLAY rise to announce
 in behalf of my colleague
 and myself that thc people
 of Ala bama assembled in
 convention ut their capitol on
 the 11th of this month
 havc adopted an ordinance whereby
 they withdraw from the Union
 formed under a compact styled
 the Constitu tion of the
 Uni ted States resume the
 powers delegated to it and
 assume their separate station as
 a sovereign and independent people
 This is the act not
 of faction or of party
 but of the people True
 there is a respectable minority
 of that convention who op
 posed this act not because
 they desired to pre serve
 the Union bub because they
 wished to se cure the
 coöperation of all or o
 a majority of the southern
 or of the planting States
 r here are many coöperationists
 but I think not one
 union ist in the convention
 all are in favor of
 withdraw ifig from the Union
 I therefore warranted in tion
 of sudden spasmodic and violent
 passion It is the conclusion
 they have reached after years
 of bitter experience of enmity
 injustice and in jury at
 the hands of their northern
 breth ren after long and
 painful reflection after anxious debate
 I and solemn deliberation and
 after argument per suasion and
 entreaty have failed to secure
 them Instead of causin y
 their constitutional rights surprise and
 incurring censure it is rather
 matter of amazement if not
 reproach that they have endured
 so much and so long
 and have deferred this act
 of self defense until to
 day It ik now nearly
 forty two years since Alabama
 was admitted into the Union
 She entcrcd it ag she
 goes out of it while
 the Confödcracy was in convulsions
 caused by the hostility of
 the North to the domestic
 slavery of the South Not
 a de cade nor scarce
 a lustrum has elapsed since
 her birth that has not
 been strongly marked by proofs
 of the growth and power
 of that an ti slavery
 spirit of the northern people
 which seeks the overthrow of
 that domestic institution of the
 South which is not only
 the chief source of her
 prosperity but the very basis
 of her social order and
 State polity It is to
 day the master spirit of
 the northern States and had
 before the secession of Alabama
 of Mis sissippi of Florida
 or of South Carolina severed
 most of the bonds of
 the Union It denied us
 Christian communion because it could
 not endure what it styles
 the moral leprosy of slaveholding
 it refused us permission to
 sojourn or even to pass
 through tho North with our
 property it claimed freedom for
 the slave if brought by
 his master into a northern
 State itxviolated the Constitution and
 treaties and laws of Congress
 because designed to protect that
 property it refused us any
 share of lands acquired mainly
 by our diplomacy and blood
 and treasure it refused our
 property any shelter or security
 beneath the flacr of a
 common Government it robbed us
 of our property and refused
 to restore it it refused
 to deliver crin iinals property
 or our blood upon their
 hands it threat ened us
 by solemn legislative acts with
 io no minious punishment if
 we pursued our property into
 a northern State it murdered
 southern men when seeking the
 recovery of their property on
 northern soil it invaded the
 borders of southern States poisoned
 their wells bu rnt their
 d wellings and murdered their
 people it denounced us by
 dc liberate resolves of popular
 meetings of party con ventions
 and of religious and eventlegislative
 as semblies as habitual violators
 of the laws of God
 and the rights of humanity
 it exerted all the moral
 and physical agencies that human
 ingenu ity can devise or
 diabolical malice can employ to
 heap odium and infamy upon
 us and to make us
 a by word of hissing
 and of scorn throughout the
 civilized world Yet we bore
 all this for many years
 and might have borne ib
 for many more under the
 oft repeated assurance of our
 northern friends and the too
 fondly cherished hope that these
 wron rs and injuries were
 committed by a minority party
 and had not thc sanction
 of the majority ofthc people
 who would in time rebuke
 our enemies and redress our
 cricvances But the fallacy of
 these promises and folly of
 our hopes have been too
 clearly and conclusively proved in
 late elections especially the last
 two preside ntial elections to
 permit us to indulge longer
 In such pleasing delusions The
 platform of the Republican party
 of 1856 and 1860 we
 regard as a libel upon
 the character and a declaration
 of war against the lives
 and property of thc southern
 peo pie No bitterer or
 more offensive calumny could I
 be uttered against them than
 is expressed in de nouncing
 their system of slavery and
 polygamy as twin relics of
 barbarism It not only re
 proaches us as unchristian and
 heathenish but Imputes a sin
 and a crime deserving universal
 scorn and universal enmity No
 sentiment is more insulting or
 more hostile to our domestic
 tranquillity to our social order
 and our social ex istence
 than is contained in the
 declaration that our negroes arc
 entitled to liberty and cauality
 with the white man It
 is spirit if not effect
 i as strong an incitement
 and invocation to servile t
 insurrection to murder arson and
 other crimes as any to
 be found in abolition literature
 And to aggreate the insult
 which is offered us saying
 that this is the act
 of the freemen of Ala
 in demanding equality with us
 for our slaves the to
 resist our entrance into the
 Territories with our slaves or
 the extension of slavery which
 as its founders and leaders
 truly assert must and will
 effect its extermination To crown
 the climax of insult to
 our feelings and menace of
 our rights this party nominated
 to the Presidency a man
 who not only indorses the
 platform but promises in his
 zealous support of Its principles
 to disre gard the judgments
 of your courts the obliga
 tions of your Constitution and
 the requirements of his omcial
 oath by approving any bill
 prohibit ing slavery in the
 Territories of the United States
 A larcre majority of the
 northern people have declarca at
 the ballot box their approval
 of the platform and the
 candidates of that party in
 the i late presidential election
 Thus by the solemn verdict
 of the people of the
 North the slavehold outlawed incr
 communities of the South are
 branded with ignominy consigned to
 execration and ultimate destruction Sir
 are we looked upon as
 more or less than men
 Is it expected that we
 will or can cxercise beareth
 all things that godlike virtue
 which believeth all things hopeth
 all things endureth all things
 which teaches us to tote
 our enemies and bless thenz
 that curse us Are we
 devoid of the sensibilities the
 sentiments the passions tho reason
 and the instincts of mankind
 Have we no pride of
 honor no sense of shame
 no rever cncc of our
 ancestors no care of our
 posterity no love of home
 or family or friends Must
 we confess our baseness discredit
 the fame of our sires
 dishonor ourselves degrade our posterity
 abandon our homes and floe
 from our country all for
 the sake of the Union
 Must we agree to live
 under the ban of our
 own Governmenti Must we acquiesce
 in the inauguration of a
 President chosen by confederate but
 unfrien Ny States whose political
 faith constrains him for his
 con science and country s
 sake to deny us our
 con stitutional rights according to
 the live under a Government
 which we believe Will henceforth
 be controlled and administered by
 those who not only deny
 us justice and equality and
 brand us as but whose
 avowed prin ciples and policy
 must destroy our domestic tran
 quiltity imperil thc lives of
 our wives and chil drcn
 degrade and dwarf and ultimately
 destroy our State Must we
 live by choice or compul
 sion under the rule of
 those who present us the
 irrepressib e conflict with dire
 alternative of an thc northern
 people in defönse of our
 altars and our fireside or
 the mamumission of our slaves
 and the admission of them
 to social and political equality
 No sir no The freemen
 of Alabama have proclaimed to
 the world that they will
 not and havc proved their
 sincerity by segeding from the
 Union and hazarding all the
 dangers and dif ficulties of
 a separate and indepenüent station
 among the nations of the
 earth Thev have learned from
 history the admoni tory tryuth
 that the people who live
 under gov ernors appointed against
 their consent by un friendly
 foreign or confcdcratc States will
 not long enjoy the blessings
 of liberty or have the
 courage to claim them They
 feel that wore they to
 consent to do so they
 would lose the respect of
 their foes and the sympathy
 of their friends They are
 resolved not to trust to
 the hands of their enemies
 the measure of their rights
 They intend to preserve for
 themselves and to transmit to
 their posterity the freedom they
 received from their ancestors or
 perish in the attempt Cor

 for weal or woe Mr
 DAVIS I rise Mr president
 for the purpose of announcing
 to the Senate that I
 have satisfactory evidence that the
 State of Mississippi by a
 solemn ordinance of her people
 in conven tion assembled has
 declared her separation from the
 United States Under these circumstances
 It of course my functions
 are terminated here has secmcd
 to me proper however that
 1 should appear in the
 Senate to announce that fact
 to my associates and I
 will say but very little
 more The occasion does not
 invite me to go into
 ment and my physical condition
 would not per mit mc
 to do so it it
 were otherwise and yet it
 seems to become me to
 say something on the part
 of the State I here
 represent on an occasion so
 solemn as this It is
 known to Senators who have
 served with me here that
 I havc for many years
 advocated as an essential attribute
 of State sovereignty the right
 of a State to secede
 from the Union There fore
 if I had not believed
 there was justifiable cause if
 I had thought that Mississippi
 was act ine without sufficient
 provocation or without an existing
 necessity I should still under
 my theory of the Government
 because of my allegiance to
 the State of which I
 am a citizen have been
 bound by hcr action I
 however may be permitted to
 say that I do think
 she has justifiable cause and
 I conferred with her people
 I approve of her act
 bcfore that act was taken
 counseled them theri that if
 the state of things which
 they apprehended should exist when
 the convention met they should
 take the action which they
 have now adopted I hope
 nonc who hear me will
 confound this expression of mine
 with the advocacy of the
 right of a State to
 remain in the Union aid
 to disrc gard its constimtional
 obligations by the nullifica tion
 of tbc law Such is
 not Iny theory Nulli fication
 and secession so often confounded
 are indeed antacronistic principles Nullification
 is a remedy which it
 is sought to apply within
 the Union and against the
 agent of the States It
 is only to be justified
 when the agent has violated
 his constitutional obligation and a
 State assum inglo judge for
 itself denies the right of
 the agent thus to act
 and appeals to the other
 States of the Union for
 a decision but when the
 States them selves and when
 the people of the States
 havc so acted as to
 convince us that they will
 not re gard our conslitutional
 rights then and then for
 the first time arises the
 doctrine of secession in its
 practical application A great man
 who now reposes with his
 fathers the United States They
 have no relation to any
 we but tread in the
 path of our fathers foreign
 country It is a perversion
 of terms at least it
 is a great misapprehension of
 the cQse which cites that
 expression for application to a
 State which has withdra vn
 from the Union You If
 it be the may rnake
 war on a foreign State
 purpose of gentlemen they may
 make war against a State
 which has withdrawn from the
 Union but therc are no
 laws of the Umted States
 to be executed within the
 limits of a seceded State
 A State finding herself in
 the condition in which Mississippi
 has judged she is in
 which her safety requires that
 she should provide for the
 mainte nance of her rights
 out of the Union surrenders
 all the benefits and they
 are known to be many
 depri ves hcrsclfofthe ad vantages
 they are known to be
 great severs all the ties
 of affection and they are
 close and enduring which have
 bound her to the Union
 and thus divesting herself of
 every benefit taking upon herself
 every burden she claims to
 be exempt from any power
 to ex ecute the laws
 of the United States within
 her limits I well remember
 an occasion when Massachu sctts
 was arraigned before thc bar
 of the Senate and when
 then the doctrine of coercion
 v as rife and to
 bc applied against her because
 of the res cuc of
 a fugitive slave in Boston
 My opinion then was the
 same that it is now
 Not in a spirit of
 egotism but to show that
 I am not influenced in
 my opinion because the case
 is my own I refer
 to that time and that
 occasion as containino the opinion
 which then entertained and on
 which my present conduct is
 based I then said if
 Massachusetts following her through a
 stated line of conduct chooses
 to take the last step
 which separates her from the
 Union it is her right
 to go and I will
 neither vote one dollar nor
 one man to coerce her
 back but will say t
 o her God speed in
 memory of the kind associations
 which once existed between her
 and the other States It
 has been a conviction of
 pressing necessity it has been
 a belief that we are
 to be deprived in the
 Union of t he rights
 which our fathers bequeathed to
 us which has brought Mississippi
 znto her present decision She
 has heard proclaimed the theory
 that all men a re
 created free and cqual and
 this made the basis of
 an attack upon her social
 institutions and thc sacred Declaration
 of Inde pendence has been
 invoked to maintain the posi
 tion of the equality of
 the races That Declara tion
 of Independence is to bc
 construed by the circumstances and
 purposes for which it was
 made The communities were declaring
 their in dependencc the peoplc
 ofthosc communities were to use
 hc lan proclaim our independence
 anetake This is done not
 in hostility to othérg not
 Covin jure any section of

 pecuniary benefit but from t
 the hidh aarid solemn motive
 of defending and protectiig kthe

 it is our sacred duty

 must part They may be
 mu tuaily beneficial to us

 of offense there has been

 how hearing on Saturday of
 all the amendments I pro

 the items of arraignment posed
 and I shall not renew
 them I see It is
 It is to be justified
 upon the basis that the
 made aRainst George Ill was
 that he endeavored the settled
 judgment ofa majority of the
 Senate edies States are sovereign
 There was a time when
 to do just what tho
 North has been endeavoring to
 pass this bill without amendment
 but I must I hope
 the time may come affain
 of late to do to
 stir up insurrection among our

 that I moved these none
 dcnicd it when a better

 better promote the public in

 And how was this to
 be enumerated among They however
 failed and while under the
 rules the high crimes which
 caused the colonies to sever

 have a right to renew
 them their connection with the

 we get out of the

 into the Senate I shall
 not do so forl am
 rendered more palpable for there
 we find pro II and
 proper and should have béen
 bound by their is against
 them I had intended on
 Saturday to brings me to
 the important point which 1
 wishon ert y II make
 a speech on the questions
 of the with white men
 not even upon that of
 paupers dtw I will not
 now do that this last
 occasion to present to tbc
 Senate by this confounding of
 nullification and secession and convicts
 but so far as representation
 was i to some other
 perhaps more suitable occasion that
 the name of a great
 man whose ashes now concerned
 were discriminated against as a
 lower but I must be
 permitted to make this remark
 that thc only object I
 had on mingle with his
 mother earth has been invoked
 caste only to be represented
 in the numerical I ing
 a postponement was to have
 a mote full Sen to
 justify coercion against a seceded
 State The proportion of throe
 fifths Then Senators we recur
 to th nompact which ate
 so as to give every
 opportunity phrase to executo the
 laws was an expression i
 to vote upon the question
 thismörhing Now which General Jackson
 applicd to the case of
 a binds us together we
 recur to the principles upon
 State refusing to obey the
 laws while yet a I
 nem which our Government was
 founded and when as the
 bill comes up wi t
 the amendment pend bcr of

 not the case which is

 will give me leaVe wili
 with 488 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 21 drawtheamendment Leave Leave
 Ido not wish to prejudice
 the question itself Jeffer son
 Territory ought to be organized
 but many of the Senators
 in favor of the bill
 advise me that they will
 at the proper time vote
 for it if I bring
 iL up as a separate
 measure For that purpose withdraw
 thc amendment with the leaveof
 the Senate The PRESIDENT The
 yeas and nays have not
 been ordered nor has any
 amendment been moved to the
 amendment and therefore the Senator
 has a right to withdraw
 it If no amend ment
 be offered the bill will
 be reported to the Senate
 The bill was reported to
 the Senate without a mendment
 Mr FITCH I shall renew
 the amendment which I offered
 to this bill on Saturday
 The vote was then too
 close to satisfy me that
 a majority Of the Senate
 were determined not to adopt
 it It is well known
 Mr President that nearly ali
 of our present lamentable sectional
 diffculties are con nected with
 the disposition of our Territories
 and articularly with two questi0i
 s in relation to those
 Territories One of these is
 thie right ofa Terri torial
 Legislature to abolish slavery Another
 the existence or non existence
 of that institution within the
 Territories by virtue as it
 has been claimed by some
 of the Representatives of the
 southern States of the Constitution
 Both of these questions are
 now pending before appropri ate
 judicial tribunals and unless the
 refusal upon the part of
 the members of the Senate
 on the op posite side
 ofthe Chamber to adopt the
 amend ment which I have
 offered lets one of these
 questions fall they will both
 be before the Supreme Court
 in a short time Certainly
 sir it is desirable they
 should both bc finally adjudicated
 for not withstanding the declaration
 oi Senators upon the opposite
 side of the Chamber that
 in the Dred Scott case
 these questions were not decided
 arid only an opinion an
 obiter dicturn of the court
 given in relation to them
 I call but hope those
 Senators are as willirjg they
 should be decided as are
 Senators upot this side and
 wili be cqtaally loyal to
 the decision whenever it shall
 be made One of these
 points has been decided by
 a Uni ted Stales court
 in Kansas Territory and I
 may bc excused for feeling
 some interest in havirp that
 case decided in the highest
 court because ere is stiti
 another point involved in it
 which was the subject of
 colloquy during the last ses
 Sion between the Senator from
 Mississippi who then sat on
 my right Mr BROWN ond
 myself That Senator it wili
 be remembered asked for congressional
 protection of slavery in the
 Terri tories In common with
 the Senator from Louis iana
 Mr BENJAMIN I took the
 position that no such congresszonal
 protection was required that if
 slavery existed as he claimed
 by virtuc of the Constitution
 in the Territories the common
 law affordcd all the rernedies
 he ought to desire The
 case in the Kat sns
 territorial court was a suit
 at corn mon law The
 Territorial Legislature hav ing prohibited
 slavery a slave escaped from
 her owner and was reclaitned
 upon a coin mori law
 writ a writ of replevin
 as I think the legal
 pro fession calls it The
 defense was tl Qt the
 l erri toriai Legislature having
 abolished slavery no such property
 existed within that Territory The
 judgment of the court was
 that the action of the
 Territorial Legislature was unconstitutional this
 case goes to the Supreme
 Court then one of these
 controverted points which at this
 moment are shaking the Government
 to its foundation wiki be
 finally decided one way or
 thc other There is at
 this time I am informed
 in Chi cago another case
 in which is involved the
 ques tion of the existence
 or non existence theoreti cally
 of slavery in a common
 Territory by virtue of the
 Constitution or of common ownership
 There a fugitive has been
 rescued and the dc fense
 is that she escaped from
 Nebraska a Tcr ritory in
 which thcre was no local
 law recocyniz ino or protecting
 slavery and that therefore no
 such property existed within that
 Territory The bill of course
 now before the Senate for
 the ad rnrssion of Kansas
 does not afTect this latter
 case but it does the
 foriner and a very vital
 one Now when Senators over
 the way see only on
 one Sidc the wishes of
 a population as limited as
 that of Kaylsas and upon
 the other a Union about
 to cramblc to fragn lents
 because perhaps of a want
 mainly of decision on these
 specific points will they hesitate
 Which is of the most
 import ing upon personal rights
 it is our duty to
 save all that can be
 saved of judicial rights and
 reme ance to procure an
 early decision of this question
 or to hurry the admission
 of Kansas two three 1
 am prepared to do that
 1 am not pre or
 four days earlier at the
 expense perhaps of pared to
 make an exception from the
 customary preventing a decision altogether
 This is what practice for
 the purpose of sustaining this
 partic is involved in the
 amendment on the one side
 a prompt appeal to the
 Court and an early decision
 of an important controverted point
 on the other side a
 delay iri according the wishes
 of a limited population in
 a remote Territory upon the
 one side a mere blecdinff
 Kansas on the other a
 bleeding Union I have nothing
 further to say on this
 subject I promised Saturday that
 would not debate it Mr
 DOUGLAS lhave only to remark
 that there is no such
 question involved as a delay
 in the settlement of this
 judicial question to which the
 Senator refers No one proposes
 to do any i act
 by which the suit pending
 shall be delayed On both
 sides it is proposed that
 there shall be such legislation
 as shall preserve that casc
 in its order If the
 case shall continue in the
 United States court there is
 no probabilit y that it
 can be reached in one
 two or three years in
 the due l order of
 proceeding in that court bencc
 all the arguments made about
 delay fall to the ground
 for it does not involve
 a delay of one instant
 of It is only a
 quostion whether this bill shall
 time be sent back to
 the House of Representatives by
 an amendment that will delay
 the admission of the State
 I understand gentlemen on the
 other side of the Chamber
 to sav that thcy intend
 to bring in a bill
 at once to establish the
 United States judiciary for that
 new State and to make
 provision for the preservation of
 all the cases Mr COLLAMER
 That can be preserved Mr
 DOUGLAS All that can be
 preserved under the Constitution of
 the United States think we
 can trust those assurances especially
 when they have as much
 interest in that line of
 policy in ray opinion as
 any men in the world
 T I icy cortainly do
 not dcsirc to leave that
 State without a judiciary syston
 l for twelve months and
 unless they pass it and
 l ave it approved be
 fore the 4th of March
 there can be no judiciary
 ular interest of a public
 nature which is supposed to
 depend upon the result of
 private litigation in these cases
 As the honorable Senator from
 Illi nois has said I
 rcspond you may bring in
 your bill to day for
 the organization of a judicial
 dis trict in Kansas and
 I will vote for it
 and I will vote to
 save every remedy which can
 be saved regardless of the
 consequences whether the judg ment
 which is to be pronounced
 be for or against the
 principles which I maintain in
 the adminis tration of the
 Government Mr FITCH Mr President
 Senator from New York says
 that any proposition any extra
 neous one as I believe
 he designates this in con
 nection with this bill should
 have been brought in a
 year two Thc Senator s
 memory is very treacherous unless
 he recollects that this was
 brought in a year ago
 or whenever the bill came
 before the Senate and has
 been pending from that hour
 to this It was printed
 simultaneously with other amendments to
 the bill Mr SEWARD Mr
 President the honorable Senator from
 Indiana Mr FITCH 1 had
 not finished Mr SEWARD beg
 pardon Mr FITCH yield of
 course Mr SEWARD I he
 honorable Senator from Indiana misunderstands
 me or else I fail
 to ex plain myself I
 do not complain that this
 is a new proposition MT
 l at say is that
 Kansas wag entitled to admission
 last year and that all
 these questions ought to have
 been made last year and
 disposed of and not have
 delayed the whole ques tion
 until this time and now
 send the bill back to
 the House of Representatives for
 the purpose of securing conditions
 which ought to have been
 considered together with the bill
 itself upon its merits and
 acted upon then Mr FITCH
 And Mr President as to
 the other cause for opposition
 mentioned by the Sen system
 there until next winter ator
 from Illinois that the amendment
 will delay I the passage
 of the bill by rendering
 it necessary Mr COLLAMER Ofthe
 United states cases Mr DOUGLAS
 Of United States cases to
 send it back to the
 House of Representatives I take
 it for gran ted there
 is no question of delay
 do Senators distrust their own
 political associates ing thc judicial
 décision but the is as
 in that wing of the
 Capitol now in an overwhelm
 to delaying the act of
 admission For that rea incr
 majority M ith this amendment
 the bill son I arn
 ulterly opposed to any amendment
 of will not necessarily be
 delayed two days l he
 the bill but renew the
 pledire have I nu etofore
 only question would be about
 bringing it up in i
 made brin up your bill
 to morrow or to day
 the order of business If
 Senators on Ibe oppo for
 establishing a judicial system and
 I will vote to put
 right ihrough wilhout the slightest
 de lay and i shall
 think that gentlemen on the
 other side act very strangely
 after what they have said
 if they do not vote
 so too N Ir SEVVARD
 Mr President 1 respond entirely
 to what has been said
 by the honorable Senator from
 I Ifinois I want to
 meet this ques lion of
 the ad nission of Kansas
 upon its merits and I
 do not want to meet
 collatcrai or incidental questions any
 longer in connection with Kansas
 If there is any community
 in this country which is
 entitled to any right at
 the hands of the Con
 oress of the United States
 it is the people of
 Kansas to be admitted into
 this Union now and to
 be admitted after complying as
 they have done in good
 faith and fully with all
 the customary reqåircment s to
 which the people of the
 I errito ries are subjected
 whén they apply to Congrcss
 to allow them to change
 their condition from a Territory
 to that of one of
 lhe States of the Union
 This procecding is sought to
 be embarrassed by connecting with
 it a prop osition to
 oro anizc a judicial district
 in the State It is
 unusual it is unnecessary it
 can be done separately and
 dis tinctly and that is
 the prevailing custom which has
 becn applied in such cases
 If we depart now from
 that custom and incorporate that
 provision into this bill it
 serids Kansas back to the
 House of Representatives after we
 have kept her svait ing
 here one whole year for
 admission ago the House of
 Representatives sent us a bill
 to admit Kansas If i
 ve had conditions to annex
 if we had incidcnts to
 take care of it ought
 to have been done a
 year acro and not nosv
 The proposition to organize this
 judicial dis trict is magnified
 by the circtunstance that there
 are suits which may fall
 Those suits practically have just
 exactly the value which every
 suit be tween individuals has
 in the Territories Stand site
 side of the Chamber and
 the Senator from Illinois are
 so willil lg that a
 judicial district shall be created
 in Kansas and pending suits
 kept alive why not do
 it now when we know
 the passage of this bill
 is beyond the possibility of
 doubt and there is doubt
 about the passage of any
 separate judiciary bill I do
 not doubt the sincerity of
 the Senator from Illinois or
 of the Senators on the
 other side of this Chamber
 in their expression of willingness
 to pass such bill but
 they cannot pledge themsel ves
 for the action of the
 other House and whilc they
 are unable to thus pledge
 them selves they well know
 the importunce attached to the
 early admission of Kansas by
 their political associates in that
 end of the Capitol is
 such that an amendment of
 this rcasonable character will not
 delay its passage as I
 have already said be yond
 a day or two if
 there is a willingness to
 keep the im portant suit
 to which I have alluded
 alive that it may fifially
 be decided in the Supreme
 Court if I there is
 that willingness to create a
 judicial dis trict why not
 evince that willingness by adopt
 ing the amendinent I certainly
 had a right to expect
 that the Senator from Illinois
 would assent td it but
 I do not know that
 I have any right to
 expect that Senators on the
 opposite side of the Chamber
 will They have manifested so
 little dispositiou ofa conciliatory character
 in relation to our sectional
 troubles that I have little
 expecta tion they will by
 act or vote keep alive
 a suit in vhich a
 great question against which they
 have contended is involved and
 which is likely through this
 amendment to be decided contrary
 to their view s Mr
 GREEN There is this other
 considera tion the trouble is
 in regard to the order
 of busi ness in tho
 House of Representatives We know
 what their rules are and
 we know the diffculty i
 of bringing a question up
 for consideration 1 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 489 believe that
 a separate bill to organize
 that State into a judicial
 district would pass if it
 could get a not only
 ih this Chamber but in
 the House of Representatives We
 can get a hear ins
 in this body but thei
 e is great diffculty in
 getting a hearing in that
 body You cannot move to
 suspcnd the rulcs except b
 n pne day and it
 takes two thirds to carry
 t hat If vc pass
 the bill it will nev
 er be reached in the
 House of Representatives but if
 we put this amendment in
 this bill it of necessity
 comes up as a disagree
 ing vote between the two
 Houses and has to be
 passed upon by it and
 thus it insures the passage
 of it if It meets
 the concurrence of a majority
 there whereas a judiciary bill
 cannot be passed unless two
 thirds agree to suspend the
 rules for the purpose and
 then only on Monday when
 a motion to suspend the
 rules would be in order
 There is therefore manifest propriety
 as the thing itself is
 right and as all concede
 it to be right to
 put it on this bill
 for that insures its con
 sideration in the House of
 Representatives it cannot possibly delay
 the bill Talk about keeping
 Kansas out of the Union
 It is not done to
 keep Kansas out of the
 Union It is a total
 misapprehe nsion of the design
 of the mover Not u
 single amendment has been proposed
 for the purposc of keeping
 Kansas out of the Union
 Suppose it shall delay it
 until to morrow morn ing
 how much harm wili be
 done We pro mote a
 great public good by providing
 means to enforcc the laws
 and then vt re may
 with propri ety say the
 Union the Constitution and the
 enforcement of the laws The

 Pennsylvania Mr BIGL to the
 amendment of the Senator from
 New amp shire Mr CLARK
 Mr BIGLER Aftec the solemn
 s ene pre sented here
 this morning I confess I
 scarcely have the heart to
 approach the consideration of this
 subject The solicitude the universal
 and sol emn solicitude not
 to say alarm that pervades
 the popular mind in my
 State touching the pres ent
 distracted and imperiled condition of
 the country and the importunities
 which reach me daily on
 that absorbing topic must plead
 my apol ogy to the
 Senate for the expression of
 my opin ions and feelings
 at this time I shall
 probably never claim their attention
 again and I shall be
 as brief as I properly
 can rt is mainly my
 pur pose to deal with
 the eventful and inauspicious present
 and as far as that
 is possible V1th the mysterious
 and gloomy futurc of our
 country and Government I shali
 not repeat at length the
 oft told and fa miliar
 storics of the establishment of
 colonies on this continent of
 their early history their doings
 and sufferings their progress and
 prosperity of the means by
 which they were induced to
 embrace the institution now the
 subjectof unhappy if not fatal
 controversy between the States of
 the Con federacy nor how
 those colonics in the coursc
 of time threw off their
 allegiance to the moti ier
 coun try how their representatives
 assembled at Inde pendence Hall
 at Philadelphia ill 1776 and
 ab solved themselves from their
 former allegiance to Great Britain
 how the people of all
 the States north and south
 made common cause in the
 pri vations and sufferings that
 followed how after a struggle
 of seven years their independence
 was fully éstablishcd how they
 formed a Confederacy of States
 for the nuntual benefit of
 all how and s vhy
 that Confederacy failcd to answer
 the pur poses for which
 it was designed and how
 in 1787 these thirteen separate
 and independent States by their
 representatives assembled in convention at
 Philadelphia in order to form
 a more perfect Union establish
 justice insure domestic tranquil lity
 provide for the common defense
 promote the general welfare and
 secure the blessings of liberty
 nor how in that work
 Madison Ran dolph Pinckney Rutledge
 and others of the South
 and Franklin Sherman Gerry Paterson
 and others of the North
 sat side Gy side day
 after day in solemn conclave
 over the affairs Of the
 nation how the individuality of
 the States was preserved and
 distinguished how each ex pressed
 its views by a single
 vote the smallest being equal
 to the greatest and how
 it was agreed that when
 ninc oui of the thirteen
 should unite on conditions of
 a more perfect Union that
 that Union should supersede the
 old form of Govern ment
 and be binding on those
 States only who might adopt
 it leaving the opportunity for
 four of those indcpendent parties
 to remain as separate States
 or sovereignties outside of the
 new Union Nor need I
 relate the history of the
 acceptance of those new conditions
 or call attention to the
 extreme caution and qualification with
 which they were accepted by
 New York Virginia and other
 States and how Rhode Island
 and North Carog lina remained
 out of the net Confederacy
 for two years or more
 and were noticed by Congress
 as separate and independent Powers
 nor more than state the
 political problem about amending the
 Constitution to show what care
 was taken to re tain
 power in the States over
 the popular will of the
 whole mass of people of
 all the States con sisting
 in the fact that amendments
 to the Consti tution can
 be defeated by the votes
 of one thirti eth of
 the electors of the United
 States and at the same
 time thatamendments can be carried
 against the will ofthe majority
 This would beby the small
 States to the ntimberof one
 fourth uniting against the large
 States and by a close
 vote within each State on
 the other hand the united
 vote of one fourth of
 the largest States cast together
 would make more than a
 majority of all the votes
 whilst the remaining three fourths
 would carry the amendment how
 it gr6wn as it were
 wby magiO from thirteen feeble
 colonies in habitants to thirty
 three independent States embracing a
 population of midr million Nor
 how all the members of
 the federacy and the people
 North and Scu iths niadö
 common cause m 1812 against
 a foreign f contributing with
 unsurpassed zeal and geidr osity
 money for the common Treasury
 and men for the field
 of battle and how those
 men stpöd or fell together
 Nor how at a later
 date in the history of
 the country in the war
 with Mexico northern and southern
 men rushed with unsur passed
 zeal to the flag of
 the country and fol lowed
 it and plahtéd It wherever
 the rights and the honor
 of the nation required Then
 there was no talk of
 North and South of East
 and West none of slaveocracy
 and none of sectionalism All
 was forgotton in the common
 cause of the country Away
 down at Vera Cruz beneath
 the rays of a teopical
 sun were beheld the northern
 and the southern soldier and
 sailor in cordial fél lowship
 and coöperation And then again
 on the rugged higllways toward
 the City of Mexico was
 heard the steady tread of
 the Palmettb boy_ and the
 Pennsylvama volunteer side by side
 and shoulder to shoulder movinT
 against a foreign foe with
 unfaltering zeal and courage No
 thought of domestic feud or
 geographical distinctions dig turbed that
 harmomous band Their thoughts turned
 to the triumph and glory
 of the arms ofa common
 country Nor sir need call
 to mind the distinguished heroes
 and patriots of the Revo
 lution and of thc subsequent
 struggles to show that the
 South equally with the North
 and the North equally with
 the South have contributed to
 establish our indepcndcnce and to
 build up our great country
 and Government Nor Mr President
 is it my purpose to
 trace in minute and elaborate
 detail the inauspicious events of
 the last fifteen years which
 have brouo ht our once
 happy conntry to the very
 verge of civil war and
 its countless horrors and ravages
 A glance at each of
 these is enough for my
 pur pose One after another
 they have followed so closely
 down the current of time
 that the popular mind has
 seldom had time to become
 composed whilst it has often
 been so agitated and maddened
 that reason and judgment have
 yielded to passion and prejudice
 Nor sir shall I attempt
 to trace the history of
 these events with the view
 of fastening thc re sponsibility
 on this party or on
 that by an elab orate
 array of historical facts I
 shall only look at these
 things so far as it
 may seem necessary to impress
 men with a sense of
 their full responsibil ities to
 the country in the present
 critical epoch and for this
 purpose only On these points
 the pop ular judgment is
 too far matured to be
 disturbed by uny argument of
 mine Nor is it ess
 ential to my purpose to
 know what that judgment is
 The Union must be saved
 no matter whose measures and
 policy have endangered it The
 country must bc rescued from
 the disasters of civil archy
 no matter whose folly and
 madness have produced the impending
 peril History will take carc
 of this And as for
 the public men of the
 present day it were wiser
 for them to think of
 what history is to say
 of them than to indulge
 in dreamy anticipations about the
 White House first class missions
 and Cabinet places They have
 a chance for glorious or
 inglorious history but none none
 sir to gain the great
 prize of American ambition If
 the statesmen of the pres
 cnt day the men of
 these presents should prove themselves
 incapable of performing the great
 mis Sion of preserving the
 institutions transmitted to them by
 the fathers the sooner their
 names are forgotten the brighter
 will be their country s
 his The fundamental cause of
 the imperiled condi tion of
 the country is thc institution
 of African servitude or rather
 the unnecessary hostility to that
 institution on the part of
 those who have no connection
 with it no duties to
 perform about it and no
 responsibilities to bear as to
 the right or wrong of
 it Each event touching the
 extension contraction or control of
 this institution as it has
 presented itself has added to
 the mutual exasper ation and
 strife between the North and
 the South until men have
 become convinced that to have
 peace as to all things
 else the North and the
 Nor sir need I tell
 thb story of the subsequent
 South must be completely separated
 as to this in career
 of our country under this
 newt compact stitution of slavery
 From 100 to 1845 we
 had 490 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 21 comparative peace except
 only the agitation kept up
 by a small band of
 Abolitionists in the North vv
 hö wrote and harangued against
 colonization and in favorof immediate
 and unconditignal eman cipation of
 African Slaves everywhere But the
 annexatio of Texas they say
 she Wih need an nexing
 again soon the consequent war
 with Mex ico and the
 acquisition of new territory renewed
 the strife in Congress once
 more and by 1850 the
 country witnessed a scene not
 entirely dissim ifar to that
 which now surrounds us The
 first attempt at adj ustment
 was that of the Senator
 from Illinous Mr DOUGLAS on
 the basis of the plan
 which had given the country
 peace in 1820 but it
 is matter of history that
 this proposition was VOted against
 by the northern members of
 both branches of Congress with
 few exceptions and defeated The
 anti slavery men opposed its
 adop tion in 1820 resisted
 its extension to the Pacific
 ocean in 1848 and contended
 against its repeal in 1854
 This means of adjustment beiiP
 rejected another was absolutely necessary
 ana the com promisc mcasurcs
 of 1850 were the offsprint
 r of the wisest heads
 and the purest hearts in
 the land But the peace
 that followed was brief The
 legislation of 1854 in some
 measure renewed the excitement and
 the cotemporaneous organ ization of
 a sectional anti slavery party
 since proper and safe mode
 of doing this could that
 be brought about with sufficient
 promptitude to meet the exigencies
 of the times would be
 a conven tion of the
 States I mean all the
 States to meet as our
 fathers met in Philadelphia in
 1787 A body thus constituted
 would reflect the real sen
 timeh ts of the people
 and the cool judoment and
 patrioifsrn of the land and
 I cannot äoubt that the
 resuboul l be the adoption
 of new bonds of Union
 under which all M7e States
 could live for many generations
 in harmony if not till
 the end of time Bat
 the crisis is upon us
 the exigencies admit of no
 delay The dissatisfied States demand
 immediate assurance of justice and
 equality with in the Union
 and the return of good
 will and frater nity among
 the people else they separate
 at once and possibly forever
 from tho Government of the
 United States whatever the hazards
 or sacrifices may be Action
 prompt action and thorough is
 imperatively demanded on all sides
 The prop osition of the
 Senator from Kentucky to take
 the sense of the people
 immediately on measures of I
 adjustment which it is believed
 would arrest the progress of
 dissolution and ultimately restore peace
 and good will is to
 my mind the most auspicious
 step we can take I
 am of those who believe
 his rncasures will be accepted
 by the north ern people
 whatever the politicians may say
 or known as the Republican
 party gave embodiment do to
 the contrary and why should
 they not be and force
 to the new agitation Next
 came the submitted Why should
 we not make at least
 struggle between the North and
 the South for as this
 effort to save the Union
 In God s name cendency
 in Kansas with its countless
 excesses are we to stand
 idly by and see this
 great Gov outrages usurpations seditions
 and crimes next crnment broken
 into fragments and possibly the
 tbe struggle about the admission
 of the State of whole
 nation plunged into an internecine
 war If Kansas and in
 1858 came the era of
 the dogma there be not
 statesmanship love of country mag
 Of an irrepressibfe conflict between
 tbc insti nnnimity and justice
 enough in Congress to save
 tutions of the States enunciated
 by the President the Government
 let us say so to
 the people and elect Mr
 Lincoln and tho distinguished Senator
 call upon them to come
 to tho rescue But why
 from New York Mr SEWARD
 Then followed should any man
 object to tho reference of
 this the John Brown raid
 on the State of Virginia
 and question to Ibe popular
 witl in the several States
 next the developments of tbc
 mischievous doc or who will
 say that he will not
 obey that will trines of
 the Hclper book indorsed by
 sixty ninc whatever it may
 be Cert ainly no Senator
 will members of Congress and
 the vote of sixty Re
 assume o round so untenable
 I can readily sce publican
 members of Congress for the
 Blake res why Senators might
 be un willing to accept
 these olution to say nothing
 of the unjust and highly
 propositions for the people but
 I can see no just
 offensive attack made on southern
 Inen and south I reason
 for refusing the people the
 opportunity to ern institutions in
 this body by the Senator
 from accept them for themselves
 and for their repre side
 or that either is blameless
 Were the sacred challenge invoked
 in this body whosoever is
 without sin amongst y let
 him cast the first stone
 I should have o fear
 of whizziwy rniS siles from
 the other s c of
 the Chamber nor do I
 believe thcrc wot d be
 many discharged from this As
 I have said b fore
 I considerthe warof crim ination
 and recriminat ion about slavery
 the root of the evil
 that besets our country and
 the or ganization of a
 sectional party based on that
 issue derivinff its vital energies
 from that question as the
 effective means by which the
 country has been brought to
 the brink of destruction and
 of these things I shall
 speak more at length hereafter
 This is mv view cxpressed
 in no unkind spirit and
 only because I vvould impress
 upon Senators on the othcr
 side and upon the Inen
 they repre sent the duty
 of concession at their hands
 The proposition of the Senator
 from Kentucky pre sents the
 means of doing this without
 much sac rificc of feeling
 or pride or principle proposition
 so far as the Territories
 are con cerned simply to
 divide to give all north
 of 360 30 to the
 North excluding slavery and to
 give all south of that
 line to the South for
 her insti tutions during the
 territorial condition and on either
 Sidc of the line as
 everybody knows when the rl
 crritorics become sovereign States they
 can have slavery or not
 as they please Is thcre
 anything unreasonable in the scheme
 Can any thing be more
 simple and just It involves
 no dishonor and the sacrifice
 of no admitted right nor
 does it extend slavery one
 foot or add one slave
 to the number now in
 bondage adjustment on terms that
 must commend thorn selves to
 all fair minded men We
 cannot agree about thc manæyement
 of this joint estate w
 c have kept up a
 protracted and angrv controversy about
 its management and the Senator
 froru Ken tacky proposes to
 divide it on thc para
 icl of 360 30 giving
 the frcc States about nine
 hundred thousand square miles and
 the slaveholding States about two
 hundred and eighty thousand square
 miles Surely the North should
 not complain of a division
 so generous to her If
 we vverc about to makc
 a peaceable division no one
 would offer the Massachusetts Mr
 SUMNER Since then the sentatives
 Does any man doubt the
 intelligence South less and no
 umpire would award them less
 sectional patty of whose origin
 I have spoken and patriotism
 of the people or will
 any onc say But therc
 seems to be peculiar sensitiveness
 on have carried the elections
 in the North like a
 tor hc does not seek
 the counsel and advice of
 his nado and now their
 President c ect with the
 dog constituents in these times
 of trouble It seems mas
 of his party as his
 guide is awaiting the 4th
 to me that Senators on
 the other side whether i
 of March to take possession
 of the Government the propositions
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and though a millkon of
 Inen more voted against or
 those proposed by myself be
 acceptable or not I than
 for him hc is constitutionally
 ctectcd and should not hesitate
 to trust them to the
 people I must hold the
 omce am quite sure under
 similar circumstances I The southern
 people to a great extent
 belicvc should be very willing
 to take and abide the
 judg that those dogmas are
 to carried out by the
 in ment of those I
 rcprcsent Were it the question
 comin Administration and that they
 are incon of adopting the
 resolutions as amendments to the
 sistent with the constitutional rights
 of the peo Constitution to
 be referred to the States
 for rat I ification members
 might well insist on havincr
 ple of fit tcon of
 the sovereign States of the
 Union that those fifteen States
 arc to be deprived of
 their iust such propositions as
 met their own judgment just
 rights under the Constitution and
 thereby i but if they
 believe any measure of peace
 neces rendered than equals in
 the Congederacy sary I cannot
 sec why they should refuse
 to refer which constitutes in
 their opinion degree of tho
 propositions to tho people although
 they then dishonor and bumiliation
 to which t bey will
 not selves might be unwilling
 to accept them submit preferring
 the dissolution of tlGe IJnion
 This may be called an
 extraordinary step it and some
 say even civil war pestilcncc
 and may be said it
 is irregular that it is
 without war famine South Carolina
 already denies her alle rant
 in the Constitution My answer
 to all this is giance
 to the United States and
 Florida Ala that the times
 are irregular the nature of
 the case i the other
 side about the tcnns to
 bQ employed in expressing this
 division Why should that be
 so Is it not intended
 to be a division in
 good faith and that each
 section shall havc its share
 during the con tin uance
 of the territorial condition If
 so why not say so
 There is a perfect will
 ingness to interdict slavery on
 the north side Then why
 not recocrnize and maintain it
 on the south Surely no
 honorable man will seek to
 have both sides of the
 bargain If it be said
 that by this division according
 to yourdoctri ne you yield
 the righ t toexclude slavery
 from two hundred and eighty
 thousand square miles south of
 the line southern tnen reply
 Ihat according to their doctrine
 and in rnyjudgment the truc
 doctrine they yield the right
 to go into nine hundred
 thousand square miles nortli of
 the line As for the
 question of future acquisitions I
 would not stand upon that
 point though I think it
 the part of wisdom to
 makb the settlement final The
 junior Senator from California Mr
 LATHAM I requires extraordinary measures
 and certainly I fcars that
 this feature of the adjustment
 may re emn conventioa declared
 thcir determination to there is
 nothing in the Constitution denying
 tbc i strain future acquisitions
 Be it so I think
 expc right to Congress to
 submit propositions to the ricncc
 is demonstrating that wc have
 quite as resist its authority
 and the ten vacant seats

 people the power that croatod

 a large Share I say
 follow I he interdiction against
 the right of Con the
 largest share of the responsibility
 to gress to interfere with
 slavery in the places under
 I have previously leclared the
 opinion that the bear I
 do not say that the
 fault is all on onc
 us excausive jurisdiction and if
 this District and 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE against any future
 right to interfere with slavery
 within the States seems less
 objectionable As for the rendition
 of fugitive slaves thc Constitu
 tion is sumcicnt as it
 is and if amended at
 all in my judgment it
 should impose the duty of
 re turning fugitives on the
 States as well as on
 Con gress and surely all
 will agree that the service
 of the President should be
 limited to a single term
 and that the slave trade
 should be forever inter dieted
 But the territorial question is
 the great obstacle in the
 way of peace for it
 is through that feature of
 the adjustment that the South
 IS to have that recognition
 of their rights and equality
 necessary to relieve their honor
 and allay their apprehen sions
 For myself Mr President I
 hold that the people of
 the southern States with their
 slaves have a just and
 constitutional right to go into
 the common Territories there to
 hold use and enjoy all
 property of whatsoever kind known
 to the laws of the
 State they emigrated This principle
 was clearly laid down by
 the Supreme Court in the
 case of Dred Scott Butl
 do not rest my plea
 for the South on that
 decision alone found it on
 the broad principles of equity
 and justice The Territories were
 acquired by the expenditure of
 common blood and treasure and
 are therefore the conu non
 property of all and so
 long as they so remain
 if open to occupancy at
 all they must be open
 to all T hc States
 are equals by t hc
 express language of the Constitu
 tion and that principle of
 equality must prevail in the
 enjoyment of acommon estate The
 right rests on the great
 principle of equity as old
 as human government and almost
 as sacred as di vine
 truth How palpably unjust it
 would be for the two
 great States of New York
 and Pennsyl vania to seize
 upon a large district of
 this connuon estate and then
 prescribe onerous conditions for emigrants
 from the small States of
 New Jerscy and Delaware and
 yet this is precisely the
 right I claimed in the
 Republican platform to wit that
 the northern States having a
 majority in Congress shall lay
 down thc law to the
 effect that the emi grant
 from a slaveholding State shall
 not go into the common
 Yerritories unless hc leaves his
 slave property behind To my
 mind Mr President this is
 the point at which the
 Republican creed is fatally at
 fault and at which their
 gravest respons ibilitics begin and
 at which the work of
 savincy tho Union must begin
 Here thcir creed encotnn President
 elect has said that werc
 he a member of Congress
 he would vote for such
 a law the I decision
 of the court to the
 contrary This is the worst
 part of his record and
 I regret its existence for
 he is the President elect
 according to the Constitution and
 must hold the omce My
 logic Mr President is that
 if we are for the
 Consti tution at all we
 must sustain every feature of
 it and we must accept
 its meaning at the hands
 of those who have the
 right to expound it and
 I say further that you
 might as well discuss the
 prmciplcs of the Christian reliffion
 with the in fidel who
 denies the Bible as american
 politics with the man who
 will not take the Constitution
 for his guide talk thus
 plainly because I would have
 men realize the responsibilities Dfthcir
 teach ings and ponder on
 their consequences Let them takc
 warning from the voice of
 Webster at Ca pon Springs
 in 1851 a bargain broken
 on one side is broken
 on all sides A solution
 for the awkward dilemma of
 the Republican party is fur
 nislled in the resolutions now
 pending before the Senate Will
 they accept relief In that
 vay Will Senators on the
 other side permit the people
 to decide If not the
 issue must be with them
 and their constituents and let
 them be prepared for the
 consequences The unfaithful execution of
 the fugitive slavc law though
 at times greatly exaccrerated in
 its extent is cause of
 grievous complaint on the part
 It is said in extenua
 of our southern friends tion
 of this wrong that so
 far as State laws are
 inconsistent with the Constitution they
 are null thct eforc do
 no harm To and void
 and can my mind Mr
 President tillisis no answer and
 It may be some kind
 no amend for the wronff
 of law but it is
 bad morals and enmity ra
 ther than comity Any attempt
 to embarrass the execution of
 the Constitution is bad faith
 and betrays an unfriendly spirit
 well calculated to awaken distrust
 and retaliation at the hands
 of the injured parties and
 I hesitate not to say
 that all statutes wearing even
 an unfriendly appear ance to
 the Constitution should be promptly
 rc pealed But some of
 those statutes are manifestly clear
 conflict with the letter and
 spirit of the Corlstitntion while
 others less offensive in ap
 pcarancc are liable to be
 perverted into means of mischief
 and wrong For instance the
 Supreme Court has hcld tha
 t the owner ofa fugitive
 slave has a right by
 virtue ofthc Constitution to pos
 ters both iusticc and law
 The justice of the case
 i sess himself of his
 slave wherever ho can find
 him and yet nearly all
 lhc personal liberty bills is
 apparent to everybody and the
 law is found in thc
 Dred Scott decision In that
 case tbc effect in the
 North punish the owner for
 arresting his of an act
 of Congress interdicting slavery neces
 slave in a mariner to
 produce tumult or riot All
 sarilyorose and the decision is
 clear and cmphatic I ao
 ree that tumult and riot
 should be prevented that Congress
 has no right to pass
 such a law but who
 does not know that half
 a dozen of abo litionists
 and an equal number of
 free neo roes and it
 vas therefore null and void
 I will not pa rade
 the language of the court
 SD often presented and so
 familiar to Senators But it
 is said that the court
 was divided What of that
 sir A majority make the
 court and I when tho
 majority speak the law is
 declared Congress is divided about
 the passage of laws but
 when the majority speaks though
 that ma jority consists of
 one vote 01 ly thc
 law is enacted and nonc
 but a madman would for
 that reason doubt its validity
 Sad will be the day
 and deep the demoralization when
 men go behind the face
 of the lavv to inquire
 how legislators were divided and
 behind decisions to see how
 the judges dif fered in
 order to find pretexts to
 evade or violate the law
 But notwithstanding this decision it
 can get up a riot
 anywhere on the occasion of
 the arrest of a fugitive
 and thus give the owner
 pen altios instead of property
 My own State has been
 arraigned on this point and
 candor requires me to say
 that she is not entirely
 blameless A part of her
 statute of 1847 has been
 the means of mischief and
 wrong and ought to be
 repealed But justice to her
 requires that I should also
 say that so long as
 she was left to the
 performance of this duty of
 returning fugitives in her own
 vvay there was little if
 any cause of complaint Morc
 than onc hundred and fifty
 years ago the provin Cial
 authorities of Pennsylvania recognized the
 right of tho owner to
 the service of his slave
 and in the law of
 1780 abolishing slavery she pro
 vided for the return of
 fugitive slaves and mani is
 an article of the Republican
 faith that this un constitutional
 and unjust thing shall be
 done and fested her high
 spirit of comity by providing
 for more when almost ready
 to grasp the power to
 the transit of slaves through
 her limits and fora do
 this thing you flatter yourselves
 that you have temporary sojourn
 of the owners with their
 slaves and servants for a
 term not exceeding six months
 had no part in imperiling
 the Union express sur prise
 at the clamor that is
 raised in the South Her
 law of 1826 was passed
 at the instance of the
 slaveholding State of Maryland and
 under the and talk freely
 about rebellion and treason about
 auspices of commissioners appointed on
 the part the execution of
 the laws and fidelity to
 the Con stitution and about
 the chastisement due to the
 of that State and singularly
 enough that law seditious and
 disobedient That is all very
 right I contains some of
 the provisions complained of at
 and proper but it would
 be well for them to
 put this day It punished
 kidnapping and forbade themselves right
 before they attempt to punish
 E State omcers to execute
 the fugitive slave iaw of
 others Let thcm take the
 beam out of their own
 1793 but its own provisions
 for the return of eyc
 and then they will sce
 more clearly to rc It
 fugitives were simple and direct
 and convenient move the mote
 out of their brother s
 eye Your ofexecution and the
 State officers and magistrates members
 Of Congress with scarce an
 exception were required to execute
 it under heavy penalties of
 Congress and held that the
 that subject were null and
 void in good faith to
 secure the return of fugi
 tive slaves that the jurisdiction
 of the gubiect Was not
 cdnz current but belonged exclusively
 to Congress or rather that
 Congress having le9slated for the
 ex ecution of that part
 of the Constitution State legiSb
 lotion was inadmissible It was
 held in addition that the
 owner had a perfect fight
 to possess him self of
 his fugitive without process arid
 in disre gard of all
 State statutes The effect of
 this decision was felt immediately
 in the States of Maryland
 and Virginia It threw about
 the law of 1793 the
 utmost inconvenience of execution In
 the State of Pennsylvania for
 instance Federal process could only
 be had at Pittsburg or
 Philadelphia with an intervening distance
 borderin on slave States of
 four hunz dred miles and
 hence claimants of fugitives in
 stead of applying for process
 made arrangements for discovenng and
 recapturing their fugitives without process
 und without trial This done
 by the establishment of agencies
 and alleged slavcs werc picked
 up everywhere with impunity and
 carried off without the prcsentation
 of the slightest evidence that
 the persons were slaves or
 If slaves that they were
 to bc returned to their
 real owners This proceeding became
 exceed ingly distasteful to the
 people and a subject of
 general clamor even among those
 who were most desirous to
 execute the Constitution and keep
 faith with the slave States
 Nor sir will it do
 to say that therc arc
 no instances in which free
 negroes were carried off As
 I have before inti mated
 on this floor I know
 that one was carried from
 my own county well known
 to be free through the
 agency ofa base man in
 a neighbor ing county The
 consequence of these things was
 the law of 1847 enacted
 in pursuance Of a very
 general public sentimcnt This law
 punishes kidnapping and that is
 right No slave State It
 relieves State officers from will
 object to that the duty
 of executing the law of
 Congress That can bc no
 subject of complaint because the
 Sue preme Court says such
 was the intention of thc
 Constitution It denied the use
 of the county prisons for
 the detention of fugitives during
 trial After the adoption of
 the fugitive slave law of
 1850 this provision was rcpealed
 and thc use of prisons
 permitted to facilitate the execution
 of the law of Congress
 The worst feature of it
 in exist ence at present
 is that which punishes the
 owner who may arrest his
 fugitive without process under the
 law and thereby producing tumult
 and riot and this I
 say ought to be promptly
 repealed for tho reason that
 il is liable to abuse
 But sir it is not
 true that there is any
 want 0f disposition with the
 great mass of people that
 constitute that State to observe
 in good faith every obligation
 imposed upon them by the
 Constitution They intend to perform
 their part Nay more sir
 they desire to avoid even
 the appearance of wrong and
 had the State been permitted
 to follow her own just
 policy no man ever would
 have had suffcænt ground for
 complaint against her But Mr
 President the organization of a
 geo graphical party that organization
 against which George Washington warned
 his country was the fatal
 day for this Republic I
 have been in the habit
 of saying sir everywhere on
 the stump that such an
 organization was inconsistent with the
 peace of thp nation that
 a political associa tion so
 hostile to thc institutions of
 another sec tion of the
 country that it could have
 no recogni tion and no
 members in the assaulted section
 must necessarily be an agent
 of alienation and hostility among
 the people George Washing ton
 and Andrew Jackson both foresaw
 this and men on thc
 other side should have heeded
 their varnings It will not
 do to say that it
 never was intended to be
 sectional party that it is
 based on ffreat truths that
 can be and ought to
 be univer salt Sir disguise
 it as may the Republican
 organization has had and has
 now but one vital I
 spark of existence and that
 is prejudice and hos tility
 to admitted rights to the
 institution of slavery an institution
 recognized by the fathers I
 I know sir it is
 said in mitigation that they
 never intend to exercisc any
 unconstitUtional right that its purpose
 is not to interfere with
 are pledged to deny to
 the slaveholder the right II
 From that timc down to
 1842 when the decision to
 go into the common Territories
 unlcss he leave of the
 case of Prigg against the
 Commonwealth of slavery in the
 States But Mr President tell
 his slave property behind him
 notwithstanding Pennsylvania was announced there
 was but little me when
 or where a Republican meeting

 of that party wherc the

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 21
 in the language of the
 orators that in some way
 or other the Republican organization
 was the agency through which
 slavery was to be abolished
 everywhere This was not always
 done directly and m plain
 terms men occupying the position
 of statesmen dare not do
 this but they would talk
 about an irrepressible conflict between
 the local institutions of the
 States They would say they
 did not expect the house
 to fall but they did
 expect it to become all
 one thing or all the
 other all slave or all
 free and who could im
 agine that they intended to
 intimate that the States should
 all become slave Then sir
 they would talk about hemming
 slavery in With a of
 fire so that it might
 perish by its own blasting
 effects It is idle Mr
 President it would be unmanly
 at a time like this
 to close our eyes to
 the mani fest effects of
 what men have said and
 done This kind of mysterious
 teaching of the Republican leaders
 was necessary to draw to
 them the sup port of
 the old anti slavery party
 of the North Without that
 support they could not succeed
 and they could not get
 that support without to a
 greater or less extent identifying
 themselves with the doctrines of
 abolitionism and of aggres Sion
 upon slavery everywhere Now sir
 if these doctrines are not
 to be carried out why
 not say so Cannot men
 rise above the ordil ary
 posi tion of partisans and
 say frankly and emphati cally
 that they do not intend
 either by direct or indirect
 means to interfere with the
 rights of the southern States
 or attempt to deny to
 them per fect equality not
 only as members of the
 Con federacy but in the
 use and enjoyment of our
 common Territories Let the President
 elect say this and the
 skies will brighten Come Sena
 let justice be done though
 the heavens tors fall let
 the South have her share
 of the common estate and
 as she is the weaker
 party give her prompt and
 efficient guarantees a ainst future
 in terference and against future
 aggression as far as that
 can be done and we
 shall have peacc again Without
 it without concession and coin
 promise our destiny is inevitable
 dissolution civil war and anarchy
 are before us To my
 own mind Mr President a
 still greater source of evil
 of alienation and hostilitv than
 all these is the habit
 which prevails in thé North
 of branding slavery and slaveholders
 with opprobri ous cpithets and
 denouncing slaveholders as bar barians
 and criminals fordoirp that which
 it was agreed they might
 do This is the exhaustless
 fountain from which flow the
 bitter waters of discord which
 are poisoning all the chnnncls
 of intercourse commercial political and
 social between the northern and
 the southern States wielding an
 influence more poisonous and blieht
 ink than the shades of
 the deadly upas Southern men
 frotl notions of pridc and
 dignity give less prominence to
 this idea but no man
 who has as sociated with
 them as I have could
 fail to dis cover its
 effect upon their feelings A
 southern marl once a men
 bor of this body but
 not now Union touchingly remarked
 to me on this floor
 Look at our case look
 at my State said 110
 the present generation there have
 had nothing to do with
 establishing slavery we inhcritcd it
 we believe it to be
 right wc do just X
 vhat it was agreed we
 might do at the time
 the Confederacy was made and
 what the northern States were
 mainly doing at that time
 and yet sir for doing
 th is thing we find
 ou rselves branded as barbarians
 and our Institution talked about
 as a twin relic of
 barbar sm and polygamy and
 we as men favor ing
 a lower Order of civihzation
 than that enjoyed in the
 North and as living in
 the daily practice of oppression
 and Now sir said he
 disease which is exhausting the
 vitals of our Re public
 How to remove it God
 only knows The expression of
 sentiment under our institutions cannot
 be suppressed and can be
 butslightly re strained and I
 had reförence to this feeling
 mainly when I remarked on
 the 11th of December that
 whatever remedies were adopted ought
 to be com plete and
 final reaching the root of
 the disease and separating the
 question of slavery entirely from
 popular elections in the North
 in order that the public
 mind may be at rest
 and that those men who
 are sincere conscientious enemies of
 slavery for a large body
 of them are so should
 feel themselves entirely separated from
 the institu tion that they
 have no connection with it
 no responsibility to bear and
 no duties to perform l
 hus separated possibly they wotfld
 cease their aggressions on their
 southern friends or per hüps
 they would turn their attention
 to a wider field and
 look to the elevation of
 the condition of the African
 in Cuba where they could
 wage war if war they
 must have without making it
 upon their kindred and their
 brethren vhcre therc would be
 no compacts to v olate
 and no fraternal blood to
 shed or to the still
 wider field presented in the
 native land of the African
 and where they would find
 a still lower grade of
 degradation Surely when they shall
 havc occupied those fields and
 elevated the native African to
 the condition of the descendants
 of that country in the
 southern States no one will
 object to their efTorts to
 elevate and relieve the condition
 of the African slave in
 Amer ica But it scems
 to rne that true philanthropy
 and humanity require that they
 shou ld take hold of
 the disease wure it is
 uvorst The skillful physician would
 do this The philanthropist ought
 to exert himself in the
 field where suffer ing humanity
 needs lv aid most Then
 Ict them labor to bring
 the Afr can in his
 native country or in Cuba
 up to the condition of
 the southern would not only
 be slaves but miserable starving
 degraded slaves As was well
 remarked by the Senator from
 Virginia the other day in
 tracing the consequences of war
 between the two sections and
 justly denying tne right and
 possibility of subduing the South
 if you had the South
 sub dued what would you
 do with the slaves He
 said as I say you
 would have to retain them
 there and if the South
 were conquered provinces of the
 North the institution of slavery
 would have to be maintained
 and the right of property
 in slaves recognized Whata hazard
 we are run ning then
 Mr President for an idle
 abstraction or a vain delusion
 I have no pleasure sir
 in this kind of talk
 As God is my judge
 my heart is not in
 it at all I am
 in no sprit of crimination
 I stand between the extremes
 here of the North and
 the South getting but little
 countenance or sympathy from either
 side But I stand for
 my country for the Union
 of these States for tl
 te cause of justice and
 humanity for the right for
 duty and fidelity on all
 hands and against a fratricidal
 war at all times and
 in every contingency I have
 already said that I do
 not hold southern Inen blameless
 on this subject They have
 in dul ed a spirit
 of recrimination and retaliation towards
 the North neither wise nor
 philosophical and it cannot be
 denied that a vexatious system
 of espionage has been kept
 up in some southern States
 as to northern men visiting
 that region and in some
 instances cruel and condign punish
 ment inflicted upon them in
 a manner disgraceful to the
 age and well calculated to
 provoke aggres Sion and hostility
 They have in addition been
 unnecessarily sensitive and exacting on
 unim portant points and at
 times have left the impres
 Sion that nothing that the
 northern people could do or
 say would relieve their apprehensions
 cn assuage their feelings As
 for secession I am utterly
 against it r deny the
 right and I abhor the
 consequences but I shall indulge
 in no awa ment on
 that point It is no
 remedy for any one of
 the evils lamented and in
 my judgtnont it will amrravate
 rather than romove them and
 in addi tion superil duce
 countless others ofa more dis
 and destructive character IL were
 wiser to bear the ijis
 we have than fly to
 others we know not of
 Will dissolution arrest sions upon
 the rights of the South
 Will it ex tend the
 area of their peculiar institution
 Will i it break up
 the machinations of those who
 con spire to carry off
 slave property Will it assuage
 slave and when they shall
 have done that then let
 them turn their attention to
 the descendants of Africa in
 the NOI th the free
 necyroes a de graded and
 suffering race and see what
 they can do for them
 Sir I do not wish
 to be understood as an
 advo cate for Africao slavery
 I nm not but I
 cannot see the cruelty or
 the political or moral evil
 in it that men on
 the other side attribute to
 it They do not intend
 to give the negro political
 equality in this country They
 will not dare say t
 hey do nor do they
 intend him to have social
 equality What then remains to
 him Physical existence and nothing
 c se Such liberty is
 a delusion and a fraud
 the word of promise to
 the ear to be broken
 to the hope Suppose the
 proposition were submitted at points
 in the North where large
 nun bers of free negroes
 are found to appoint re
 spectabte and responsible white men
 as guardians for each family
 to direct their physical efforts
 for an animal existence to
 see that their labor was
 properly directed so that their
 earnincrs might be applied to
 the usc of the family
 to take care of the
 aged and feed and clothe
 the younff would that be
 a very crucl proposition Certainly
 not and yet stripped of
 occasional abuses of the in
 stitution by the violent separation
 of fami lics and the
 recognition of an unpleasant principle
 and this is aböut all
 there is in the institution
 of sla very in the
 South It is the application
 of a su perL01 intellectual
 ability to direct the muscular
 efforts of these men to
 secure subsistence But in God
 s name if this agitation
 is to go on if
 a party in one section
 of the country is to
 be orcranized and derive its
 vital spark of existence from
 this æyitation let us know
 what is to be ac
 complished what good end is
 to result from it what
 can be done for the
 white or the black race
 by it In what possible
 way is the condition of
 I carc little about your

 They call y and morally

 not bc brought North and
 if such a thing Unhappily
 Mr Presidcut this feeling is
 too were possible every sane
 man must know that wide
 and too general I say
 it is the seat of
 the their condition would be
 infinitely Worse They the popular
 feeling in the North as
 to slavcrv it give additional
 security to thö holders of
 slaves and will it prevent
 insurrection In my judgment it
 will do none of thesa
 things Nor can it by
 any possibility improve the material
 interests of either section of
 the Union and I do
 not intend to dwell upon
 the question of material interests
 in considering the value of
 the Union If we could
 have two republics of equal
 size and live it harmony
 and in unrestrained commercial and
 political intercourse the national growth
 might not be seriously affected
 But would this revolution stop
 with two republics and can
 peace ful relations be maintained
 Both is possible but neither
 the onc nor the other
 is probable If once disruption
 becomes permanent the history of
 the world would seem to
 teach that subdivisions would follow
 until the American Union would
 be divided into a score
 or more of petty wrangling
 and demoralized republics exciting only
 the pity and contempt of
 the world Acknowledging the justice
 ot the complaints ot the
 southern States to no inconsiderable
 extent I deprecate with all
 my heart the remedy they
 pur sue and am prepared
 to resist it by ali
 proper and peaceful means in
 my power Even if the
 right of secession were clear
 Mr President I maintain that
 justice and good faith to
 the other States South should
 first be sought at the
 hands of the people the
 fountain of political authority and
 in I the forms prescribed
 in the Constitution The southern
 States should have petitioned Congress
 for a convention of States
 to revise the Consti complain
 In this way they could
 have ascertained the real sentiments
 and intentions of the northern
 people towards them and the
 great alternatives of continued Union
 or peaceful separation could have
 been determined upon This was
 the course of our fathers
 in reference to the old
 Confedera 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

 of the world like the
 rightor wrong of revolution must
 depend in no inconsiderable degree
 upon the suf ficiency or
 insufliciency of the reasons that
 in duced it and the
 consequences resultino there from I
 think the reasons insufficient and
 the remedy not only futile
 but uninst to others 1
 deplore it I deprecate the
 movemel lt with all my
 hcat t and I would
 be willing t o any
 proper power in the Government
 any peaceful Incans to arrest
 thc movement so that rncn
 might be in duced to
 look before they leap But
 it is said on Lhe
 other side that the authority
 of the Gov ernment of
 the United States must be
 vindicated that rebellion sedition and
 instirrcct ion nutst be put
 down the Union saved and
 the laws executed j at
 all hazards On thcse points
 and as to the duty
 and powers of the Government
 I concur mainly in what
 was said by the Senator
 from ll linois No man
 denies that the laws should
 bc executed but if the
 people of a sovereign State
 by a voice and in
 authoritative form threv oiF their
 allegiance to the Federal Govern
 men t and acknowledocd another
 how are you to execute
 the laws within such a
 State or carry out any
 one of the functions of
 the Federal Gov errnnent To
 execute the laws suppress insur
 rection and put down rebellion
 is a nice theory and
 pleasant talk but will gentlemen
 tell us how it can
 be done against the anited
 voice of a sov ereigll
 State When the people have
 thrown off and I theii
 allegiance to the General Government
 acknowledge only that of the
 State the Federal Government may
 command the citizen to do
 one thing but l iis
 allegiance to the State would
 require him to do another
 and so heis bound hand
 I and foot You cannot
 carry unails hoid courts or
 collect revenues with the Ai
 lny even if you had
 a large one but with
 all the Army this Gov
 ernment has at present s
 uch a work would bo
 idle What then Shall we
 recocrnize the States now claimirg
 to bc out of the
 Union as de facto Governmcnts
 and wacre war them to
 re gain the jurisdiction of
 the United States within their
 respective limits Before we do
 this let us look at
 the fearful alternatives Such a
 war would not involve a
 contest with five States only
 but with t vc lvc
 or pose of the war
 It must either be to
 chastise the ofTending States to
 gratify feelings of hostility against
 them to vindicate the honor
 and dignity of the Government
 or reconstruct the Union but
 it would fail to accotnplisb
 the one ot the other
 What good end thorm will
 it subserve to shed the
 blood ofour race and kindred
 who separate from us politically
 because they have believed they
 were not treated as equals
 Statcs cannot bc brought back
 into thc Union or kept
 in the Union by the
 sword It is impossible Ours
 is a Government of consent
 and must be sustained by
 good will and fraternal affection
 By what earthly means can
 you compel a sovereign State
 to perform the func tions
 of a mernber of this
 Confederacy against her will Can
 you make her dtizens hold
 offce Can you make them
 regard your laws Can you
 com pcl them to elect
 members of Congress and can
 members of Congress be forced
 to serve Can you collect
 revenues or taxes where no
 man will perform the office
 of tax gatherer It is
 idle say therefore that coercion
 is a mere phrase a
 sheer delusion Tho idea of
 thirty three States that failed
 to live in fraternal union
 being reunited by a long
 and bloody y ar is
 startling No sir this never
 can be And in saying
 this I do not mean
 to say that I would
 not force ail the States
 to remain if I believed
 it possible for no greater
 service could bc rendered them
 In my opirrion secession is
 the worst possible remedy for
 the evils of by the
 south ern States and coercion
 the maddest of all the
 remedies sucgest ed for secession
 The States ought to live
 in frulernal bonds but if
 they will not T shall
 one half put the other
 to the sword Such a
 wat would be one of
 extertninution Neither side could ever
 conquer and if the northern
 States could conquer what would
 they do with the southern
 States as provinces The Senator
 from Virginia met that point
 the otbcr day so com
 pletely that need not discuss
 it But God for bid
 that war should cvcr begin
 Iamao ainst it I am
 for peace and I am
 ready to grant anythint In
 reasou 10 recorlcilc the discon
 ten teed States and the
 offended people I aln rcady
 to itnplore thefn to rernain
 in the Union I am
 road y to f Rht
 for their constitutional rights to
 tho last hour but to
 shed a brother s blood
 in a fratricidal war I
 shall ready never never But
 still I have an abiding
 faith that the nation can
 be saved not by noerc
 hosannas to tho Union though
 I like exceed iuo iy

 well as faith When was

 who talk of war study
 fall Babylon had existed sixteen
 centuries when structed as far
 as broken might we not
 hdpe that its foundations were
 to be deeper and finier
 than ever that the ordeal
 through which it is now
 passing would root its foundatio
 more effect ively and completely
 in the affections of the
 people mt Senators talk of
 war and it disturbs no
 man s nerves that widely
 separated States and communities should
 do so The men of
 the arctic regions of the
 United States away up in
 Maine and Vermont and Massachåsetts
 can shake their gory locks
 at those inhabiting a neck
 of land in the tropics
 of America known as Florida
 and the Floridians in turn
 may manifesta belligerent design Such
 a fight will be bloodless
 but it will be far
 otherwise with the free and
 slave States bordering on each
 other should that be the
 line of division They will
 be within striking dis tance
 and to them this war
 will be no idle bravado
 It will be a matter
 of life and death Look
 at the position of my
 own glorious old State No
 broad river or high mountain
 or deep chasm or high
 wall divides her from the
 slaveholding States From thc waters
 of the Ohio to those
 of the Del aware her
 broad side lies nestling close
 up again the sides of
 hcr slaveholding sisters First on
 the west comes Virginia then
 Maryland and then fall up
 in her generous bosom rests
 her little sister Delaware with
 the heads of both re
 clining on the banks of
 the river where at the
 same moment the rays of
 the mornino sun may kiss
 thc brow of both For
 four hun red miles from
 the Ohio to the Delaware
 her south side re clines
 against the north side of
 slavehold ing States mountain to
 mountain hill to hill valley
 to val ley farm to
 farm neighborhood to neighborhood brother
 to brother sister to sister
 hand to hand and heart
 to heart The line has
 been to frater nal citizens
 on either side imaginary they
 have passed from the North
 to the South and from
 the South to the North
 without even a thought that
 it marked the beginning of
 a people strangers to each
 other much less aliens and
 enemies All along this linc
 there has been marrying and
 giv ing in marriage The
 sons of Virginia have mar
 ricd thc daughters of Pennsylvania
 and the sons of Permsylvania
 have married the daughters of
 Virginia and so has it
 been with Maryland and Delaware
 That line is sanctified by
 all the ties that can
 endear men to each other
 political and commercial ties tics
 of interest and custom ties
 of consancruinity and affection Great
 God Are all these to
 be severed Is this line
 to marl the boundaries of
 enemies Impos sible Humal lity
 and justice forbid it Penn
 sylvania will never become the
 enemy of Virginia Pennsylvania will
 never draw the sword on
 Vir ginia and she is
 no less affectionate to her
 other sisters In good faith
 she has performed her part
 in peace and in war
 For many long years she
 has endcavored to stay the
 tide of disaffection and alienation
 between the two sections She
 has been truly the keystone
 of the Federal arch and
 the bulwark of the rights
 of her sisters Like some
 mighty peninsula between two heaving
 seas she has resisted and
 rolled back the waves of
 discord and strife but alas
 the waves liave risen h
 igher and higher and she
 is quite sub merged until
 her counsels of peace are
 powcrlcss For myself I have
 but a few days longer
 to serve here when I
 shall return to share her
 fate She is my mother
 and I love her with
 filial affec tion She has
 made mc what little I
 am and though at times
 she has cherished and caressed
 and then frowned whether smilingor
 fro wnino I love her
 still Frowning though last she
 has been just and generous
 and come what may peace
 or war weal or woe
 her cause will be my
 I say to her in
 this presence in the touch
 cause ing language of ineffable
 love Whither thou goest will
 go where thou lodgest I
 will lodge thy people shall
 be my people and thy
 God my God Mr WILSON
 I move that the further
 con sideration of this question
 be postponed until Wednesday at
 half past twelve o clock
 Mr CRITTENDEN hope that these
 res the picture Nothing in
 all the sad consequences the
 mysterious characters on the wall
 gave the olutions will not
 be made to give way
 to the of dissolution can
 be so blastincy and horrible
 as affrighted king notice that
 the time of its down
 i E Pacific railroad f
 will not repeat remarks I
 such a I var even
 though it presented the hope
 of fall was at hand
 The Athenian Government ex have
 heretofore made on this question
 The sub reé stablishing the
 Union But how fallacious and
 isted more than twelve times
 the period which jects are
 both well understood by the
 Senate and delusive must be
 the idca of union through
 such ours has been in
 existence The English Govern f
 hope that that whicl i
 relates to the nation and
 rneans It involves the l
 actice of disunion of the
 ment has seen over six
 centuries since the days do
 l 0t wish to underrate
 nor do I underrate Union
 is gone forever What would
 be the pur seen one
 Could it be now saved

 that bill 494 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 21 Mr POWELL
 Mr President I desire to
 address the Senate to morrow
 on the resolutions of my
 colleague now under consideration Mr
 C04 AMER To morrow is
 fixed for the bill Mi
 GREEN What day does the
 Senator from Massachusetts propose Mr
 WILSON Wednesday athalfpast twelve o
 clock Mr GRIMES There is
 a special order for Wednesday
 on the motion of the
 Senator from Pennsylvania Mr CAMERON
 Mr POWELL I move to
 postpone tre fu t ther
 consideration of the resolutions of
 my col league till to
 morrow at one o clock
 Mr LATHAM The Pacific railroad
 bill is the special order
 for to morrow at one
 o clock and I hope
 that will not be interfered
 with Mr CAMERON Ishould like
 to say asingle word before
 the qucstion is taken Of
 course I will not occupy
 the time of the Senate
 because I never I never
 ha d any ambition to
 make a speech make speeches
 and if I had it
 would be all driven eut
 of my mind by the
 little attcntion that has been
 paid to the able the
 eloquent and tile proper speech
 of my colleague The whole
 ivorld it seems to me
 are now taken up with
 this question of separation or
 union and yet out of
 this whole Senate of sixty
 six members there were not
 a dozen men at any
 one time listening to the
 speech mado by my colleague
 representing one of the greatest
 States in the Union He
 came here to offer the
 olive branch of peace he
 came to save the Union
 and yet hc was not
 listened to Cer tainly after
 seeing that demonstration I shall
 not mako a speech but
 I desire to state for
 tho great State of Pqnnsylvania
 and I say great because
 I believe her position makes
 her great thatevery body there
 1 believe certainly a very
 large ma jority of her
 people will do anything consistent
 with honor to save this
 Union Daily I reccivc letters
 innumerable and I receive pctitlons
 signed by the thousand asking
 rnc to do something to
 save this country desire to
 say that anything I can
 do by my vote here
 as a Senator I will
 do to prevent the separation
 of the South from the
 North the North from the
 South What we can do
 do not know I am
 very much inclined to vote
 for the propositiotls of my
 colleague r I hey appear
 to Inc to bc sensible
 and proper I only say
 now that everything I can
 do will be done to
 save this Union from separation
 for I consider its benefits
 to the human race far
 above every other political consideration
 which can in terest the
 human race Mr GREEN Mr
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr P0LK
 in the chair I oes
 the Senator from Pennsylvania give
 way Mr CAMERON Certainly Mr
 GREEN Then 1 desire to
 say this there were a
 ntnnbcr of absentees on this
 side for this reasoi we
 had so much confidence in
 the honor the patriotism the
 integrity and the good sense
 of the Senator from Pennsylvania
 Mr BIGLER that we did
 not think it necessary to
 sit still an watch As
 for the othcr side they
 knew that they vere so
 adverse that it would do
 no good to wait and
 therefore there were but few
 members pres It resulted frorn
 these two causes We havc
 ent unlimited confidence in the
 Senator from Pennsyl vania Mr
 BIGLER in his honor integrity
 pa triotism ability and love
 of the Union On the
 other side they did not
 want to hear words of
 honor of patriotism of true
 devotion to the Con stitution
 out of which the Union
 has grown and without which
 there is no Union This
 is the reason why there
 was a very thin Senate
 Now onc other word The
 speech has been made l
 vell received and I hope
 there will be no unjust
 insinuation cast now to prejudice
 it Let it be read
 and considered by the public
 If the public will not
 approve it they will condemn
 it if they do approve
 it the Senator s insinuation
 against it will react against
 himself I think we had
 bnttcr adjourn and Ict the
 Senator from Ken tuck y
 speak the next day this
 subject comes up As a
 motion is made to postpone
 it until to mor row
 I shall vote for it
 Mr CAMERON Mr President it
 was not kind in the
 Senator from Missouri to talk
 about insinuations He knows I
 am a plain limn I
 I speak out even worse
 make no insinuations than I
 think and certainly in regard
 to this great question of
 the Union I have nothing
 to conceal i want this
 Union preserved in its whole
 integ rity I wish the
 gentlemen from the South who
 left us this morning had
 waited until my colleague I
 wish they had only waited
 made his speech until Pennsylvania
 had spoken before they left
 us Certain y if they
 are sincere in their devotion
 to the country to the
 Union and to the preservation
 of peace they would have
 done so and all I
 ask of the gentlemen who
 are still here is to
 wait until we act Mr
 IVERSON Will the Senator allow
 me to ask him a
 question Mr CAMERON Certainly Mr
 IVERSON he seems from the
 few remarks he has made
 to approve of the senti
 ments uttered by his colleague
 I will ask the gen
 tleman does he approve of
 what his colleague has said
 Mr CAMERON vcry much Mr
 President I am very much
 inclined to go with my
 colleague and if that will
 save tho country I will
 say to the gentleman from
 Georgia positively I will go
 I will go for that
 and further still to with
 him save this great country
 from commotion and from ruin
 Has the Senatorany morc questions
 to ask Mr SAULSBURY Mr
 President 1 hope 1 shall
 be allowed onc word I
 wish to make this remark
 as a member of the
 Democratic side of this Chamber
 I think the words which
 have fallen from the lips
 of the Senator from Pennsyl
 vania Mr CAMERON instead of
 meeting with opposition here should
 be cherished by us think
 hc has manifested a spirit
 of patriotism and of devotion
 to his country and to
 the Unifi of these States
 that we may well imitate
 Mr CRITTENDEN think so too
 Mr HALE Mr President Mr
 CA MERON 1 have just
 oncword more to say The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Docs Sen ator
 from New Ham l shire
 give way I Mr CAMERON
 Oh 1 know he will
 1 say to the Senator
 from Georgia and to all
 gentlemen here if tl ley
 will takc thc proposition of
 my col league I will
 vote for it and we
 will pass it if that
 will give us peacc and
 preserve the Union Mr IVERSON
 The Senator misunderstands the object
 of my question It was
 not whether he approved the
 proposition of settlement which his
 colleague haspresented to the Senate
 and the coun try but
 vhcth01 he approved the sentiments
 which the Senator from Pennsylvania
 uttered against the coercion of
 the seceding States That is
 the point to which I
 wanted to call the attention
 of the Sen I asked
 him whether he approved of
 it or a to r
 Mr CAMERON Mr even that
 Coercion is the last remedy
 to which I would resort
 I should dislike above all
 things in the world to
 raise my hand against my
 brother Mr GREEN Is it
 at all Mr CAMERON It
 is a bad remedy Mr
 GREEN Is it a remedy
 at Mr CAMERON I do
 not that 1 should ever
 resort to it bu t
 certainly it is the last
 remedy that I would resort
 to to keep my brethren
 in my family I love
 them too much to imagine
 it would ever be necessary
 to resort to coercion to
 make them do their duty
 Mr GREEN As between the
 States of the Federal Government
 is it any remedy at
 all Mr GRIMES 1 desire
 to ask what is the
 before the Senate The PRESIDINGOFFICER
 The question is on the
 motion made by the Senator
 from Mas sachusett s that
 the subject now beforc the
 Senate be postponed until Wednesday
 next at half past twelve
 o clock IVIr MASON On
 that question I want to
 say a word If I
 recollect aright some two or
 three days ago the resolutions
 offered by the Senator frorn
 Kentucky were rejected by this
 Senate and rcsolutions offered by
 the Senator from New Hampshire
 Mr CLARK were substituted in
 their place and if I
 recollect aright the Senator from
 Pennsylvania Mr CAMERON voted to
 reject the propositions of the
 Senator from Kentucky and voted
 to substitute for thcm the
 resolution of the Senator from
 New Hampshire Mr CAMERON 1
 will answer that if the
 Senator wants to do so
 Mr MASON lhave not firnshed
 Mr CAMERON well when you
 are through Mr MASON If
 I recollect aright the tenor
 of the resolutions of the
 Senator from New Hamp shire
 was that the Constitution needed
 no amend ment that what
 were spoken of in the
 resolutions if I remember correctly
 as demands of the south
 ern States were unreasonable and
 if I recollect aright further
 that the only reanedy for
 the dif ficulties or the
 dangers now before the country
 was to enforce the laws
 and the Coistitution If I
 remember correctly the Senator from
 Pennsyl vania Mr CAMERON voted
 to reject the resolu tions
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and to sub stitute for
 them those of the Senator
 from New If I remember
 further aright the Hampshire Senator
 from Pennsylvania as he stated
 at the request of some
 gentleman I know not who
 moved reconsideration of that vote
 The re consideratio was had
 but if 1 remember cor
 rectly the Senator from Pennsylvania
 who moved tho reconsiderati0Q voted
 against it Mr CAMERON All
 right Mr Mr MASON I
 yave not done The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Virginia
 is entitled to the floor
 Mr MASON 1 advert to
 these facts only to present
 them as a type of
 the condition of things between
 the North and the South
 to my people and strongly
 to exemplify what I saw
 recently in the newspapers to
 which I call attention The
 Senator from Ohio Mr WADE
 whom Ido not now sce
 in his seat presented a
 few days ago resolutions of
 his Stale In the sixth
 resolution it was declared as
 the sense of the Legislature
 of Ohio that all laws
 or I think as the
 resolutions expressed it all enactments
 upon the statute books of
 the States which were intended
 in any manner to impede
 or delay or frustrate any
 laws of Congress that were
 intended to execute the provisions
 of the Constitution should be
 repealed I do not remember
 the exact language but it
 was a clause that wax
 eointed at what are called
 per sonal liberty billå m
 many of these States It
 was a declaration that they
 should be repealed same mail
 that brought us those resolutions
 brought information that the House
 of Delegates the lower House
 in the State of Ohio
 had rejected a bill to
 repeal a law of that
 character Now sir I want
 to show to my people
 the dif ference between professions
 and practice I illus trate
 it by what has fällen
 from the Senator from Pennsylvania
 Mr CAMERON who has professed
 here an entire coincidence of
 opinion with the sentiments that
 have fallen from his colleague
 and the purposes of his
 speech understand that the purpose
 of the speech of his
 colleague Mr BIGLER is this
 to recommend resolutions that he
 had offered exactly of a
 character With those offered by
 the Senator from Kentucky as
 a sub stitute for the
 resolutions of the Senator from
 New Hampshire which resolutions have
 been adopted by the Senator
 from Pensylvania Mr CAME RON
 in preference to the resolutions
 of Ille Sena tor from
 Kentucky I want to prcsenb
 it to the people of
 my country as the difference
 between profössions and practice with
 those with whom we have
 to deal here Mr CAMERON
 Mr President it seems to
 me the only difference between
 myself and the very distinguished
 Senator from Virginia is that
 he seeks for some excuse
 for getting out of this
 Unon while I desire to
 preserve it by any sacri
 fice of feeling and I
 may say of principle To
 me this Union is above
 all things in the Govern
 It scorns to me that
 for somc reason or men
 t other he Wants to
 go out and to put
 the blame on somebody else
 I on the contrary am
 will ing to save tile
 Union which his fathers ahd
 mine cemen tcd with their
 blood at any sacrifice bccom
 ing honorable and patriotic men
 The history of my connection
 with the resolu tions of
 the Senator from Kentucky is
 this while my State desires
 to make any sacrifice to
 savc this Union and while
 am willing to sacrifice my
 self if necessary to preserve
 the Union I took no
 part in that subject until
 after the resolutions were lost
 and the venerable and distinguished
 Senator from Kentucky came to
 me and asked me to
 move a reconsideration which did
 to gratify him and to
 givé another chance for n
 set tlcment of this question
 After I had done so
 found there was no inclination
 on that side of the
 House to make any compromise
 at all but to put
 us on this side on
 our bended knees to ask
 for giveness from them I
 have no forgiveness to 1861
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBD 495 I have
 done no wrong My section
 of the State for remaining
 in this Union not ask
 for While I will not
 an excuse to get out
 of it country has done
 no wrono I muy speak
 perhaps Mr President with the
 beg them to forgive me
 I am willing macynani mously
 to forgive all their backslidings
 and do temperament that belongs
 to my constitution and with
 some appearance of warmth when
 I do not anything l
 can to save this Union
 I mean not a Now
 Mr President this Union to
 me as an mean it
 Earnestness I mean individual is
 perhaps of little consequence but
 word of unkindness to any
 onc here I know if
 it is of great importance
 to this country and to
 the there be any man
 that can shut up his
 intellect and world and to
 those who are to follow
 us hereaf ter in the
 world and therefore I am
 willing to do anything a
 man can do to save
 it With that spirit I
 said to day and I
 say it in pi ivate
 circles everywhere I will go
 for the proposition of my
 colleague or for any othcr
 proposition to save the country
 but 1 will not be
 dragooned into this As a
 proud man and a man
 representing a great and proud
 State these gentlernen cannot come
 hcre and talk to me
 as they would talk to
 one of I am the
 those beneath them I am
 their equal peer of the
 Senator from Virginia and I
 wrill maintain my equality with
 him here and else In
 the State of Pennsylvania we
 havc where interests which have
 been injured by the votes
 of that gentleman and of
 gentiemcn from his sec tion
 of the country but we
 are willing to overlook all
 that for the sake of
 this country As I said
 in the begin ning the
 folly of making speeches is
 illus trated by the little
 attention which that gentleman and
 other persons on his Sidc
 gave to my colleacyue when
 he came herc witlk the
 olive branch antl therefore greatly
 prefet to let my action
 speak for me Mr MASON
 Mr President I am utterly
 un conscious of havinff said
 anything in the world to
 excite the wrath of the
 Senator from Pennsyl vania I
 was reciting facts Mr CAMERON
 No sir Mr MA SON
 1 understood Senator to I
 was recit agree with mo
 that they were facts ing
 the course which his judgment
 dictated to him upon these
 measures before the Senate understood
 him to admit they were
 true every one of them
 and I was only expressing
 the sur prise which I
 ftlt that after having followed
 that course in reference to
 the resolutions of the Sen
 ator from Kenlucky when they
 were brought in opposition to
 resolutions offered by the Senator
 from New Hampshire vcry recently
 when ho had gone so
 far as to move a
 reconsideration of thc vote by
 which the Kentucky resolutions had
 been rejected that there should
 have been so sud den
 a conversion as that we
 are called upon to infer
 from what fell from him
 in reference to the I
 can only say to the
 speech of his colleague Senator
 tliat I meant nothing personally
 unkind whatever but I thought
 there was a probability close
 his ears or his eyes
 to the facts around us
 I know this Union is
 at I am not one
 of them this day dissolved
 absolutely dissolved The separation of
 one Statc is as much
 a dissolution of the Union
 as the separation of te
 n The sep aration of
 five so far as we
 have trone at present and
 it is but a work
 of tirne to add to
 the list does no more
 as far as the dissolution
 of the Union is concerned
 than to confirm the fact
 that thc Union is dissolvcd
 Honorable Senators on the other
 side of the Chamber at
 least I know say the
 Union is not dissolved that
 the act of these States
 in separating themselves from it
 is a void act They
 do not recognize it The
 fact that the names of
 their Senators remain here upon
 your list and are called
 every day to vote is
 evidence that in the sense
 of Senators on that side
 at Icast now in a
 majority they do not reco
 nize the fact of separation
 Their recoTnition or their refusal
 to recocnize does not change
 the fact in any form
 or shape whatever The Stales
 arc gone the chairs herc
 are vacant never again to
 be filled under the ex
 istinT state of things What
 is the remedy Force Coercion
 I he discipline that a
 peda o oøue inflicts upon
 a village urchin at school
 Honorable Senators entertain that idea
 in relation to a sovcrcign
 St ate They tcll us
 we have but to enforce
 tile laws that the Constitution
 is im perative upon the
 Executive head of enforcing the
 laws and that the Constitution
 is imperative upon Congress it
 any additional legislation is required
 to give it that the
 laws nay bc enforced Sir
 the theory of the Government
 is against it It he
 voicc of hurnanity at this
 civilized age is against it
 You cannot enforce your laws
 against the State that is
 no longer under your dominion
 by a barbarous war the
 last resort of thc tyrant
 The thcory of the Government
 unquestionably is this the laws
 are to be administered through
 the courts and resistance to
 the law is not known
 to the Constitution unless it
 is resistance to the law
 as expounded and administered in
 the courts Such is the
 whole tel lor of our
 legislation The President has power
 on earth to use a
 ship or a soldier unless
 hc is first admonished by
 the civil tribunals of the
 country that there is a
 resist ance which the civil
 power of the country is
 un that in the report
 of proceedings here not by
 i E equal to overcotne
 Are you to change that
 and our reporter but in
 the way in x vhi
 it gets into ivc to
 the President the power of
 making war the atmosphere possibly
 tho cou e of tho
 Son by what you call
 enforcing thc laws Sir you
 ator from Pennsylvania might e
 mistaken I cannot eniörce thc
 laws against one of these
 seced ing States unless you
 do change the law and
 you my people and desired
 that t should not be
 cannot change the law unless
 you violate the so Now
 one word more sii That
 honorable Constitution You cannot work
 out the problem Senator says
 that I scorn to be
 seeking an excuse in any
 other way on earth that
 you fix it v hat
 remains I am onc of
 those Ah Mr President svell
 sir to get out of
 this Union that day has
 passed if i felt it
 necessary to find who have
 venerated this Government for the
 good that it did au
 ld for the hopes of
 the future as an excuse
 it would bc to remain
 in the Union no excuse
 for going out of the
 Union the Scnatou much as
 any man who hears me
 I saw a people inexc
 ing from three to thirty
 million in a period I
 confess from what I have
 may rely upon it of
 history so small as not
 to be appreciated in thc
 seen here around me and
 the votes that have been
 I saw them increasinff in
 taken I am utterly at
 a loss to know what
 excuse history of nations I
 could assign to my people
 for remaining in this strength
 in all the resources that
 belong to na tions in
 intellect wealth powcr respectability I
 Union An excuse to get
 out of the Union is
 not I saw that it
 wras the fruit of and
 knowledge necessary Sir whata spectacle
 have we seen to day
 Six that Union which our
 fathers devised and if there
 bc any in this broad
 continent who valued Senators representing
 three States taking a formal
 leave of the Senate bringing
 here officially that Union more
 than I did I have
 yet to know to the
 notice of the Senate that
 their States were i who
 he is But when the
 preservation of that no longer
 members of this Union One
 State I Union is required
 of us at the expense
 of our do their predecessor
 has had no Senators here
 duril ff t mestic safety
 and our domestic peace when
 it is required of us
 at the expense of our
 self respect the whole session
 Another State as we learn
 from the telegraphic news hag
 already dissolved when it is
 required of us at the
 risk of destroy its connection
 with this Union five of
 them gone ing the very
 foundations of the social fabric
 upon which the southern States
 repose I say let thc
 five States holding a homocreneous
 interest with States as it
 was when this Congress commenced
 its session How many States
 will remain here in the
 next month I will not
 undertake to æay_ how many
 States will remain here 4th
 of March next when the
 present CongreSs expires I will
 not undertake to say but
 I will undertake to say
 this that we shall not
 have by many the States
 that are now here Now
 sir we are in a
 minority on this side certainly
 as far as the South
 is concerned There are offcially
 eight Senators from the southern
 States absent never to return
 Others are to follow necessarily
 backed by their If it
 is proposed to pass laws
 to coerce States those States
 what will bc the result
 I need not say to
 honorable Senators here who themselves
 are brave men men conscious
 of their manhood of the
 honor of their States and
 prepared to meet any emergency
 that may present itself that
 this idea of coercion has
 no terrors for them Much
 as they would deplore it
 they would deplore it from
 the consequences that must follow
 and not from any personal
 fear to themselves or to
 those corr nected with them
 They must deplorcit from the
 consequences that must follow And
 what are those consequences Why
 sn you makea war Call
 it enforcing the laws if
 you please call it whipping
 achild who has been refractory
 it is war the exercise
 of public force on one
 side against public force on
 the other Well what is
 the end of war Peace
 What has been the consequence
 of war An unnecessary barbarous
 and indecent effusion of human
 blood as a sacrifice to
 human the impoverish rnent of
 the societies passion around you
 the load of debt that
 is to be accu mulated
 and more than all the
 breaking up of all those
 foundations upon which concord or
 I should rather say amity
 and good will and kindness
 should have rested among the
 inhabitants of the States of
 North America It is gone
 sir and you have done
 it You have placed it
 out of the power of
 the southern States to confederate
 with you any longer You
 have not only declared your
 selves enemies but you have
 made them feel that you
 are enemies You may pursue
 a sentiment or a vague
 idea that you are enforcing
 the laws when you are
 rnaking i var war that
 the civilized world will acknowledge
 as such war to be
 governed by ail the rules
 of war and your idea
 of hanging for treason is
 nonsense According to my recollec
 tion there was no man
 hung for treason durinr r
 the Revolution Threats were abundant
 enough but in that war
 made by dependent colonies upon
 a strong and able maternal
 power all their threats of
 execution for treason vanished into
 thin an If it is
 instituted now it will be
 It was war followed by
 a peace That peace will
 restore what treaties call amity
 but it will be only
 that amity that is spoken
 of on the cold pages
 of his tory We shall
 stand I should fear for
 genera tions in a hostile
 relation to each other which
 it will take more than
 generations to remove and bring
 about actual peace I say
 to honorable Senators on tbe
 other sidc or to the
 section which they represent that
 peacc or war is in
 their hands The issue of
 war is not but the
 fact of peace or war
 is in your hands or
 those u vhom you represent
 MT e have no voice
 If war comes it is
 to be made upon us
 irfit we are to accept
 it not to institute it
 The whole responsibility will be
 with you and you wili
 have to answer to the
 generations which are to follow
 for all the consequences of
 that war Why have a
 war Realize existing facts and
 you have no war Realize
 the existing fact that the
 constituei ts of this Government
 are sovcreio n powers and
 that those sovereign powers are
 not mere component parts of
 a common empire Re monslpate
 with them reason with them
 as you will about the
 cxercise of their sovereignty but
 concede it When those States
 who have left us and
 those States that are to
 follow shall have assumed their
 condition of independence they wiih
 say 1 0 you murk
 n i 7 word for
 it we are that which
 I rcprescnt There is sympathy
 in I Union go with
 whatever regret with ready cither
 for war or negotiation Deride
 it if I tell the
 you please plumo yourselves upon
 the nurnerical conecrn t herc
 rnay be no rernorse timate
 sympathy necessary sympathy betwreen my
 honored State and those in
 all those ties which honorable
 Senator from Pcnnsy vania for
 whom strength which you possess
 talk of your cigh bind
 us together That Senator talk
 to me of my I
 really entertain kind personal feelings
 while i I teen Illillion
 against eight or nine million
 bring the barbaric force of
 numbers to bear upon the
 this thing lasts want excuse
 for leaving this wantirw an
 excuse to go out of
 this Union I tell southern
 States and you will have
 a war such the Senator
 if he will look at
 it with the consid ii
 Union Would to God he
 would give me an as
 the world has seldom if
 cver seen a war that
 excuse for remainimy in it
 eration and calmness that becomes
 his position he would ask
 Ilirusclf as I would ask
 myself can Mr Presidcnt there
 is but one thing remainino
 must terminate in a peace
 or extermination But what is
 the opposite Lct them go
 regret it find an excuse
 in any wray for remaining
 in the for us that
 I know of The Union
 is dissolved remonstrate denounce it
 if you will but let
 them It is no longer
 a Union of thirty three
 Union Can I assign any
 excuse to my honored gone
 496 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 21 go Then the good
 sense of nations will return
 when passion has subsided and
 a union may be restored
 or reconstructed which never can
 be done if the mad
 passions of the day prevail
 vhich secm now to prevail
 at the North I am
 sorry to detain the Senate
 thus long but I confess
 that I fclt anxious to
 expose to the constituents of
 the honorable Senator froni Pennsylvania
 as well as to my
 own that in the present
 posture of the country I
 and those with whom I
 stand ask no excuse for
 leaving this Union but we
 shall be deeply grateful as
 after ages will be to
 him if he will give
 us an excuse to remain
 Mr HALE obtained the floor
 Mr CAMERON Mr President The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator from
 New Hampshire is entitled to
 the floor Mr CAMERON I
 hope he will give way
 to allow me to say
 another word M HALE I
 have already given way once
 and half the Senate has
 spoken on that leave Mr
 CAMERON hope 1 shall be
 allowed to say a word
 If I am interrupted now
 in the thread of my
 discourse shall forget all about
 it and not be able
 to say anything at all
 Mr HALE Go on The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Does the Sen
 ator from New Hampshire give
 way Mr HALE Yes sir
 Mr CAMERON Mr President 1
 am very sorry that the
 Senator from Virginia took the
 trouble to tell us what
 will be the resultsofa sep
 aration of this Union The
 discussion between him and me
 is a very small affair
 which I thought would have
 pdssed with a w ord
 or two from him but
 when he goes on to
 talk about the North charging
 them with treason bloodshed and
 war i Inust be compelled
 to say a word Mr
 MASON I charged no treason
 Mr CALVIERON 1 think you
 talked about I took down
 thc word at the time
 1 treason have paid earnest
 attention to this discussion frorn
 the commencement of our meeting
 here never heard in this
 Senate on this side of
 it a single man talk
 about treason in regard to
 this question No man here
 on this side has ever
 talked about eighteen million aoai
 nst nine million On the
 contrary everybody on this side
 has been for peace and
 particularly desirous that nobody here
 should give offense to the
 other side T liat is
 the feeling of my State
 and that is the fu21ing
 Now if there is to
 be war the gentlemen on
 the other side and especially
 the gentleman from Virginia bring
 upon us this Virginia has
 been looked up to as
 the mother of States and
 statesmen We who profess democratic
 princi ples have loved i
 ler and ber principles and
 when she becomes recreant to
 hcr principles and to the
 Constitution of the country then
 we may look for trouble
 I tell you that no
 one in Pennsylva nia al
 ld I only speak for
 hcr cvcr thinks of war
 but if war must come
 we will meet it ns
 becomes men But sir we
 will Five up not only
 our pre judiccs but our
 feelings and as I said
 before even a portion of
 our principles on this subject
 of slavery to gratify the
 South This country has been
 controlled for seventy years by
 the slaveholding interest I have
 never desired and no man
 of common sense in my
 State has over desired to
 bring thc into equality with
 the white man No man
 ever dreamed of liberating the
 slaves in the southern States
 We object to southern statesmen
 and southern poli ticians and
 southern intriguants working upon the
 prejudices of their people so
 as to make them be
 lieve the whole North were
 combined against their interests for
 the purpose of elevating their
 men to high places in
 this Union That is the
 fecling we have Why sir
 upon cvcry occasion in the
 last thirty years the interests
 of Pennsylvania have been stricken
 down by the South every
 where When the interests of
 Pennsylvania came up for discussion
 southern men voted against us
 and yct we have stood
 by tl kC South and
 by the Union because we
 loved the Union and because
 we had our ancient feelings
 for the South and a
 fraternal love for southern tnen
 I he Scnator frorn Virginia
 knows I am no He
 said so much in reply
 to me that I speaker
 have forgotten what he did
 say but I desire to
 say now in short that
 if this Union falls it
 will be no act of
 ours it will be no
 act of the North their
 wrongs are imaginary and as
 a proof of it it
 they will bring forward any
 projet upon which they will
 call this question settled the
 North wili cornc in and
 sustain it Tell us what
 you want tell us what
 your wrongs are and then
 ask us to redress them
 You cannot drive us to
 madness by bullying us because
 we are your equals We
 do not undertake coercion nor
 war because we believe you
 are as brave as we
 are but if you want
 this Union preserved let us
 know wherein we have done
 wrong and we will try
 to cor rect it Mr
 SAULSBURY 1 think sir if
 the Sena tors on this
 side of the Chamber and
 the Sena tors on the
 other side would imitate the
 very laudable spirit manifested by
 the Senator from Pennsylvania who
 has just taken his seat
 cer tainly this Government would
 suffer no detri ment butl
 think great good might result
 to our common country I
 see nothing in the remarks
 of the Senator from Pennsylvania
 Mr CAM ERON that justifies
 the spirit of this debate
 I look at it as
 an omen of good It
 cornes from the Senator ofa
 great State a State which
 perhaps can do as much
 as any other to quiet
 the public mind and restore
 peace and harmony to a
 now distracted country Sir I
 believe that the Sena tor
 from Pennsylvania was sincere when
 he de clared his willingness
 to do everything in his
 power to save the Union
 of these States and though
 It may be true that
 four or five States may
 have declared themselvesouto this Union
 if the other side of
 the Chamber Will meet this
 question in the same spirit
 in which it has been
 met by the Sen ator
 from Pennsylvania the Union will
 not be permanently dissolvcd but
 it x vill continue in
 the future as it has
 been in the past not
 only A union of Ia
 kes and a union of
 lands A union which none
 halt sever But it will
 be A union of hearts
 and a union or hands
 And a union of States
 forever I therefore invoke Senators
 on both sides to imitate
 the laudable spirit rnanifested by
 the Senator from Pennsylvania Let
 us raise our selves to
 the height of this o
 rcat avgumor t and the
 people of the whole country
 North and South East and
 Wost will say not only
 that we have manifested the
 right diÅposition but that dispo
 sition which will inure not
 only to our own ben
 efit but to the benefit
 o all aces to come
 Mr CRITTENDEN What is the
 question The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 in the chair The question
 is on the motion of
 the Senator Croni Massachusetts that
 this subject be postponed until
 v7ednesday at half past twelve
 o clock Mr CRITTENDEN And
 the reason as signed is
 that the Pacific railroad bill
 is set for to morrow
 Sir I do not intend
 to continue this debate The
 question probably is ill the
 hands I of the friends
 who sit on my left
 alluding to the Republican Senators
 W hether this great sub
 II ject shall be postponed
 and a preference Yiven to
 the railroad bill I hope
 gentlemen will think upon tion
 and more disunion I trust
 we shall come to gether
 in peace and brotherhood as
 we have here tofore I
 do not to continue t
 his discussion I hope that
 the motion to postpone will
 not pre vail Sir it
 may be of very little
 consequence whether it does or
 not it may be in
 reality of but very little
 significance but it will strike
 the pub lic mind as
 inauspicious It will harden public
 feeling North and South to
 see this manner of I
 hope we shall con treatment
 of the subject tinue at
 it until we sball arrive
 at some decision and I
 trust that that decision will
 be one of a con
 ciliatory and compromising character With
 this hope I oppose this
 motion to postpone Mr POWELL

 Mr THOMAS I have no

 proceeded to road a rcport
 made in the Senate Mr

 this business upon the hour
 expressly reserved under the rules
 for other business Tho SPEAKER
 proceeded to call the States
 a lid bills and resolutions
 beginning where the call was
 last left off with the
 State of Indiana POSTAL SERVICE
 Mr COLFAX introduced n bill
 in relation to postal service
 which was read a first
 and sccond timc Mr COLFAX
 I move that the bill
 be referred to the Committco
 on the Post Offe e
 and Post Roads It is
 a bill ofa great deal
 of importance and will probably
 be called up at an
 early day if the committee
 shall agree to report it
 back It is very brief
 and I hope that it
 will be read so that
 gentlemen may understand it The
 bill was read as follows
 Mlhcreas several States of the
 Union the judges dis trict
 attorneys and marshais cornrnissioned by
 t lze Gov ernment o
 the United States tor said
 States have resigned their oiliecs
 and it appears impracticable in
 consequence of revolutionary proceedings therein
 o fill tho vacancies thus
 created and whereas tbc Government
 of the United States is
 thus withont any Ineans ot
 collcctingor enforcintr in such Stat
 os the pa vlnént of
 the postal revenues from the
 oftiecrs coileeting the same or
 of punishing of the postal
 laws cornmittcd by robberies of
 the tnai s or otherwise
 or of enforcing the perfonnance
 of nail con tracts Therefore
 Be it enacted Ithat in
 all States which are or
 may here after be situated
 as above the Postrnas ter
 General is hereby directed to
 disconiinue thc postal service for
 such period of titnc as
 his jud nnent the public
 interest may require and shall
 report his action to Congress
 Mr CRAIGE of North Carolina
 How does that bill here
 The SPEAKER It is introduced
 upon a reg ulm call
 in the regular order of
 business Mr BRANCH 1 think
 it be better to refer
 that bill to thc select
 committee of five to whom
 this whole class of subjects
 has been re ferred by
 an order of the House
 I think incorr venience will
 result from distributing them out
 to the standing committees when
 the whole subject has been
 referred to a select committee
 1 think the gentleman from
 Indiana had better move to
 refer his bill to the
 select committee Mr COLFAX I
 prefer its reference to the
 standing committee and I assure
 the gentleman that if it
 shall be favorably reported on
 he shall have on opportunity
 to be heard The rcason
 why it is introduced is
 simply because we have no
 means of protecting our inails
 in those regions I insist
 on my motion that the
 bill be referred to the
 Committee on the Post Office
 and Post Roads Mr BRANCH
 Well Mr Speaker 1 cannot
 perhaps give fully the reasons
 why I desiro that the
 bill shall go to the
 select committee of five but
 this whole class of subjects
 has been referred I the
 motion that the to that
 committee bill be referred to
 the select committee of five
 MI COLFAX By the rules
 when two mo tians to
 refer are made a motion
 to refer to a standing
 committee takes precedence The SPEAKER
 That is so The question
 was taken on Mr COLFAX
 s mo tion and it
 was agreed to So the
 bill was referred to the
 Committee on the Post Offce
 and Post Roads Mr COLFAX
 moved to reconsider the vote
 by Which the bill was
 so referred and also moved
 to lay the motion to
 reconsider upon the table T
 hc latter motion was agreed
 to CRITTENDEN ADJUSTMENT Mr EfGLISH
 offered the following resolu lion
 and moved the previous question
 on its adop lion thc
 present alarming condition of the
 Resolved country imperatively de lnands
 that Congress should take irrnnediate
 eteps to preserve the peace

 rernovin y as far as
 possible all causes of irrita

 January 1860 and to continue

 was reported to the Senate
 without I amendment ordered to
 a third reading read the
 third time and passed WITHDRAWAL
 OF SENATORS Mr HALE withdraw
 the objectiorH ich interposed this
 morning to the suggestion made
 by the Senator from Indiana
 that the Vice Pres ident
 be authorized to fill the
 vacancies on the committees did
 not understand whether his remarks
 were addressed to the want
 of omcial information on his
 part relative to the vacancies
 on the commit tees or
 the absence of members from
 the Senate I make this
 suggestion to obviate the difficulty
 in regard to the committees
 The VICE PRESIDENT There are
 one or two vacancies caused
 by the resignation of Sen
 atOrs on the committees Thcre
 are a number of additional
 vacancies if the act of
 those gentlemen yesterda is recognized
 by the Senate Mr RALE
 I think the suggestion that
 is made by the honorable
 Senator from Indiana is a
 very pertinent one that if
 the acting chairmen of the
 several committees will notify the
 Vice President of the vacancies
 actually existing it will be
 enough for his guidance believe
 that the best way is
 for the Senate and the
 Vice Presi dent to recognize
 things as they are regardless
 of how they would wish
 to have them and I
 think the suggestion of the
 Senator from Indiana is highly
 proper Mr COLLAMER Some of
 the chairmen have gone away
 Mr HALE The acting chairmen
 can notify the Vice President
 Mr DOUGLAS I do not
 think there is any diffculty
 in this question We have
 been notified that certain Senators
 have retired and do not
 intend to be here during
 this session and hence there
 are vacancies on those committees
 of which they were members
 It is known to the
 Senate for each of the
 Senators who has withdrawn has
 risen and taken his leave
 of the body Taking their
 leave of the Senate is
 a withdrawal from the committees
 of the Senate Whether their
 States are out of the
 Union or not is a
 very different question but that
 those Senators did represent those
 States and that they have
 formally om cially dissolved their
 connection with this body and
 gone away is within our
 knowledge it has been done
 in our presence Mr TRUMBULL
 1 think my colleague is
 clearly right Whatever dispute there
 may be as to the
 ricrhtof a State to withdraw
 from the Union no one
 apprehend denies the right ofa
 Senator to withdraw from the
 Senate to resign to dis
 solve his connection with the
 body Several SENATORS They have
 not resigned Mr TRUMBULL 1
 do not know that there
 is any constitutional provision or
 any law or any rule
 of the Senate which requires
 a resignation to be in
 writing I understand that certain
 Sen ators yesterday did dissolve
 Lheir connection with the Senate
 stated so in its presence
 Whenever that was done in
 my judgment their names should
 be stricken from the roll
 and they should be no
 longer treated as members of
 the Senate The VICE PRESIDENT
 Thesenatorfrom That is an individual
 act which they had a
 right Indiana moves that the
 Presiding OÆcer fill ex to
 perform istincr vacancies upon tho
 committees Mr WILSON Ido understand
 that the The motion was
 agreed to by unanimous con
 gentlemen who withdrew from the
 Senate yester sent day have
 resigned their places as Senators
 of The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Chair would the United States
 The Senators from South like
 some instruction from the Senate
 as to what Carolina did
 resign to their State formally
 but vacancies exist and at
 this point would take the
 the othv Senators that have
 withdrawn have not liberty to
 make a rernark No notice
 has been resigned their places
 here and are now members
 taken on the Journal this
 morning of the with of
 this Senate They have simply
 withdrawn He also presented two
 petitions of residents of drawal
 of certain Senators from the
 Chamber themselves in obedience to
 the wishes of their the
 county of Philadelphia Pennsylvania pray
 yesterday No paper was filed
 with the Presid il States
 It is well enough I
 think for the Senate ing
 that pensions tnay Ipc granted
 to the surviving Ing Offcer
 by them it was an
 act of withdrawal soldiers of
 the war of 1812 and
 to the widows 01 to
 recognize the fact to this
 extent so far as regards
 notified to the Senate Upon
 that subject it will the
 committees that they are temporarily
 absent those who may hereafter
 die which were ordered befor
 the Senate to determine whether
 the Journal and that their
 placcs should be fifled up
 by other to lie on
 the table shall note the
 factoftheir withdrawal and whether Senators
 and there no difficulty it
 seems to me REPORTS FROM
 COMMITTEES their names shall continue
 to be called when votes
 if the committees inform the
 Vice President that Mr THOMSON
 from tbe Committee on Pen
 I are takcn by yeas

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 501 far as
 the individual is concerned I
 have no hesi lation therefore
 in treatino each one of
 these seats as vacant by
 resignation by the Senators having
 given notice to the body
 that they have It finaiiy
 withdrawn and never intend to
 return does not reach the
 question at all as to
 whether the States have withdrawn
 That is a very dif
 ferent question We recognize the
 right of a Senator to
 withdraw to resign and in
 resicrning it is not necessary
 that he should use the
 word I decline to act
 as a re sl n
 Ile may say Senator any
 longer and there is an
 end of his 1 withdraw
 from connection with the body
 or the Senate forever that
 dissolves his connection with the
 body or I am going
 to remove beyond the limits
 of the United States and
 live in a for eign
 country that is a resignation
 hold therefore that they have
 resigned their seats here and
 wo can take cognizance of
 that fact and act upon
 it Whether the States have
 separated their connection with us
 or not isa very different
 ques tion Mr SAULSBURY To
 test the correctness of the
 views of the Senator from
 Illinois suppose that any of
 those Senators who took leave
 of the Senate yesterday were
 to appear here this rhorn
 and undertake to vote would
 there be any power in
 the Senate to prevent their
 voting upon any question that
 arose in this body To
 whom have they resigned Have
 you any evidencc that they
 have resigned to the Governor
 or to any proper authority
 of their own State None
 at all They came into
 the Senate and declared that
 they should not in futåre
 act as members of this
 body Suppose however that they
 have changed their minds and
 that they present them selves
 this morning and the ycas
 and nays are called and
 they wish to record their
 votes can this Senate prevent
 them from recording their votes
 I hold that they are
 members of the Sen ate
 of the United States until
 they have resigned to some
 other authority than the Senate
 of the United States Mr
 DOUGLAS There is nothing more
 com mon than for a
 Senator to resign to the
 body of which he is
 a member and nothing more
 com mon than for us
 to communicate the fact ofa
 va cancy to the Governor
 ofa State I hold that
 if they have done an
 act which amounts to a
 resig nation they cannot withdraw
 it the next day If
 onc of them They have
 no power to do it
 comes in here and takes
 a seat of course we
 will permit him to do
 so by courtesy as an
 ex Sena tor but I
 apprehend he would not vote
 as an ex I cannot
 recognize the doctrine that a
 Senator man may dissolve his
 connection with the body and
 withdraw from the obligations of
 a Senator and come back
 when he has a mind
 to do so and give
 the castino vote in a
 tight struggle and then slip
 out again They are either
 members of the If they
 are members of body or
 they are not the body
 they are subject to the
 rules of the body They
 should be required to attend
 the body and to vote
 not when they chose but
 when the body requires them
 to do so according to
 its rules But I hold
 if they have done that
 which amounts in fact and
 in law to a resignation
 their seats being vacant whether
 they will be filled or
 not will depend upon the
 States that they formerl represented
 Mr BITCH Mr President the
 very object of the suggestion
 I made was to avoid
 this de bate I supposed
 it would do so The
 proposi tion suggested was so
 fair on its face and
 so man ifestly designed to
 avoid this discussiån relative to
 the manner in which certain
 Senators have left their seats
 and their right to do
 so or the right to
 recognize that act on our
 part that I supposed it
 would meet with no objection
 from any source I am
 sorry it has not escaped
 the criticism of the Senator
 from Illinois Thereare Senators to
 whom his rernarks will not
 apply One of the Senators
 from Georgia is absent He
 has never notified us of
 his intention to absent himself
 TW Sen ators from South
 Carolina and one from Missis
 sippi also are absent without
 notifying us of their absence
 but the fact that they
 arc absent is known to
 the respective committees and if
 the acting chairman of those
 committees should notify the Vice
 President of that fact do
 not see why those vacancies
 could not be filled without
 raising a question relative to
 the manner in which they
 j left or t be
 right ofa State to secede
 That is not involved in
 the question at all Mr
 BENJAMIN It is impossible to
 avoid some determination upon the
 questionsprcsemed by the Presiding Offcer
 of the Senate I think
 the Senator from Indiana will
 find that thatques tion will
 recur and require determination by
 the Senate It is obvious
 that the difficulty here arises
 from a vital difference of
 opinion in relation to the
 fact of the action of
 the seceding States It appears
 to me very strange indeed
 whatever may be our opinions
 as to the legality or
 right ofa sovereign Statc to
 commit an act which dissolves
 its con nection with tho
 Union that there should be
 a question as to the
 fact However that factis dis
 puted it seems Although certain
 States have declared th cmsel
 ves independent States although in
 point of fact they are
 organized as independ ent nations
 although in point of fact
 there is l 0t a
 Federal offcer within their limits
 perform ing Federal duties except
 with their express con sent
 in certain exceptional cases although
 the Government is utterly without
 possession of those States or
 the power to enforce its
 lat vs there by tribunals
 yet gentlemen persist in saying
 that the fact is the
 are still members of the
 Union Mr FITCH Will the
 Senator from Louisi ana permit
 me to make a remark
 The object of my suggestion
 was to avoid all allusion
 to the fact one way
 or the other Mr BENJAMIN
 I understood it perfectly well
 Mr FITCH It was to
 avoid any recognition of that
 but the fact of their
 absence we propose to recognize
 of course Mr BENJ AMIN
 1 premised my remarks by
 stating that such had been
 the Senator s intention and
 informing him that in my
 judgment we can not avoid
 the discussion for thcre are
 other things to bc taken
 into consideration as vill very
 soon be obvious to the
 Senate Now sir in the
 first place there was one
 su gestion from tho Chair
 which it strikes me re
 quires the immediate action of
 the Senate understand the Chair
 aright we were informed that
 there was no entry upon
 the Journals of the occurrence
 which took place in open
 Senate yes terday vital in
 the constitution of this body
 Did I understand the Chair
 aright Then 1 will begin
 by moving that the Journals
 of our proccedings state the
 facts They form the oflicial
 record of what occurs in
 this Senate of everything of
 a public character requiring to
 bo preserved and in order
 to test the sense of
 the Senate so far as
 that is concerned I suppose
 there can bc no objection
 to that I move that
 it be ordered to be
 stated upon the Journal among
 the proceedings of yesterday that
 certain Senators arose in their
 places and communicated to the
 Senate that their States had
 assumed the right of withdrawing
 from the Union had passed
 ordinances of secession declaring themselves
 independent of all Federal ties
 and of all allegiance to
 the Constitution of the United
 States and thereupon took leave
 of the Senate and retired
 That fact ought to appear
 It is a fact in
 the history of upon our
 Journals the country in the
 proceedings of the Senate which
 can by no possibility be
 passed over in i move
 therefore as a preliminary mo
 silence tion that the Journals
 be ordered to be so
 cor rected as to state
 that fact Mr FESSENDEN should
 like to ask the Senator
 from Louisiana a question if
 hp will allow me to
 do so Mr BENJAMIN With
 pleasure Mr FESSENDEN ask him
 whether in his judgment after
 making that annunciation with reference
 to their seats yesterday and
 the tact being so that
 the States had passed these
 or dinances of secession these
 gentlemen would have had a
 legal constitutional right to remain
 here had they chosen to
 do so and act as
 Senators Mr BENJAMIN In my
 opinion very clearly not Mr
 SEWARD Mr President it seems
 to me if we are
 going to make up a
 record of the transaction of
 yesterday it ought to be
 either a I think it
 will be doing full one
 or none at all very
 great discourtesy to our associates
 who have which they aid
 their States had usumed tainly
 it would bC contrary to
 a II inLä hnet of
 kéer ing records to enter
 speeches of this kind utterly
 opposed however MR Presidélit foxany
 entry of this transaction I
 think the less theré is
 said about it the sooner
 it Will be mended I
 am for leaving these seats
 here fortbose Sendtofs or for
 Other Scoatoi s from the
 States which they represent to
 be resumed at their own
 time and in their good
 pleasure I hope diat ihe
 time will not be long
 before they will be here
 again If oi if records
 shall only be kept for
 the instru ctiofi Of posterity
 in faihng to record the
 transaction Of yesterday in that
 respect it will be an
 omission that I think will
 be more honored than would
 be the observance and a
 statement of the facts Mr
 FESSENDEN Mr President some diffculties
 about this question in my
 judg ment which all gchtlemen
 probably have pea ceived I
 hold most decidcdlj and decisively
 without any qnestion or any
 reservation or any limitation of
 any kind whatever that no
 Stat e has a right
 to secede as the language
 is from the Union and
 that consequent ly all these
 acts that havc been performed
 by these four StateS are
 without any constitutional to their
 duty and of no sort
 of effect whatever so far
 as we are concerned I
 do not propose now to
 go into an argument to
 show the grounds of my
 opinion but that is my
 opinion as gentlemen probably very
 well understand Therefore when these
 gentlemen announced yesterday that they
 withdrew from the Senate in
 consequence of this act I
 did not consider that the
 act itself had any sort
 of connection constitutionally with what
 they themselves saw fit to
 do upon the floor not
 in the slightest possible It
 might be a suf ficient
 reason to justify tilem t
 oüeir own minds and in
 their own minds for what
 they did but to me
 the reason for thc act
 had no sort of signifi
 cance Then sir we stand
 precisely in this attitude we
 I say on this side
 of the Senate I speaking
 for myself do not recognize
 in any way the act
 that has been performed by
 these States 1 can not
 help recognizing however what was
 done by the Senators themselves
 They made a certain announcement
 and the question for us
 to settle as it is
 brought up now is how
 far that announce mcnt has
 any legal effect whatever They
 did not say that they
 resigned their seats upon this
 I suppose it would be
 perfectly competent floor for them
 to say it without putting
 it in writing and that
 we might accept the notice
 It is accord ing to
 the usual form The ordinary
 course of proceedings as I
 understand it is for the
 resigna tion to be made
 to the bodies that elected
 them and for us to
 be notified of the fact
 I do not understand that
 any resignation has been made
 in thc casc of these
 gentlemen In the case of
 the South Carolina Senators there
 wras a formal resignation of
 their offces as we learned
 from the newspapers but we
 have not been notified of
 the fact at all Now
 that the State of Mississippi
 for instance should to morrow
 elect if their Legis lature
 was in session other Senators
 other gen tlemen than those
 who retired yesterday and they
 should come bere and present
 certificates of then election and
 suppose at the same time
 that the old Senators who
 retired yesterday should return and
 claim their seats upon this
 floor how are we to
 settle that question Who are
 t he Sen ators to
 bc admitted It comes back
 to the fact whether they
 had ever resigned their seats
 or not That is the
 question whether they had ever
 le gally ceased to be
 members of this body W
 c do not admit that
 they ceased to be so
 by the act of their
 States in withdrawing at all
 We do ad mit however
 the right ofa Senator to
 of course Have those Senators
 resigned their seats or not
 Now I agree in part
 with my friend from New
 York that so far as
 the act of these seceding
 States is concerned with reference
 to withdrawing themselves from the
 Union I would not take
 any notice whatever on the
 record of a notification to
 withdrawn under very peculiar circumstances
 that purport if it was
 given here I agree with
 and probably very disrespectful to
 their States him I think
 it is of no consequence
 so far as that the
 fact should be stated that
 they rosc in thc record
 is concerned although of very
 great their seats and made
 that announcement and then i
 i consequence in its effect
 upon the Union But sir
 we are compelled to take
 notice of the act of
 withdrew without spreading upon the
 records the Senators themselves here
 If it is a resigna
 the reasons and the arguments
 which they ad dressed to
 ihc Senate ih support of
 the position tion we must
 take notice of it upon
 the recordi 502 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 22 and it
 must be entered there Otherwise
 we do not know thc
 fact that they have resigned
 in any way except as
 it may be in the
 minds of individ uals Now
 what did they say They
 said that in consequence of
 the act of their States
 in seced ing from the
 Union they were no longer
 mem bers of this Senate
 and withdrew from it va
 cated their seats The reason
 is their own the actis
 ours What might have been
 their own reasoning is for
 them selves to settle What
 they did here and the
 notice they gave us are
 matters for us to under
 slånd I take it that
 no particular form of words
 is necessary to a resignation
 of an oßice A man
 need not say that he
 resigns in order to make
 a resignation Any words that
 he uses which are equivalent
 to that are sumcient to
 convey the idea Now sir
 when a gentleman rises in
 his place in this body
 and says For certain reasons
 satisfactory to no reason at
 all if he am no
 longer a member of this
 Senate and I so notify
 the Senate and withdraw from
 It that is a resignation
 so far as we are
 concerned The only question that
 comes back is is it
 necessary for him to give
 notice to the bodies that
 elected him That is the
 form but is it the
 substance May he not resign
 here in this place and
 leave us to notify his
 State that he has resigned
 his place instead of resigning
 there and then notifying us
 that he has sent his
 resignation to the bodies that
 elected him Again I say
 when a Senator rises in
 his place here and says
 For reasons satisfactory to me
 I am no longer a
 member of this Senate I
 so no tify the Senate
 and withdraw in my judgment
 he has resigned his seat
 in the Senate That is
 my opinion and it is
 the same thing if he
 gives a reason the validity
 of which we do not
 recog nize in any way
 We havc nothing to do
 with his reasons They are
 of no consequence what I
 do not recognize the validity
 of the ever to us
 reason in this case I
 care not for it in
 a consti tutional sense but
 I do think that those
 Sena tors resigned their seats
 and are no longer mem
 bers of this body and
 cannot become so without a
 reelection Mr HUNTER Mr President
 1 do not un derstand
 that those Senators resigned their
 seats yesterday I do not
 believe that a resignation could
 be made otherwise than in
 writing and the very fact
 of a debate in regard
 to the effect of their
 speeches yesterday shows the importance
 of requiring that all such
 acts should be in writing
 Those Senators declared that their
 Stales had seceded from this
 Union and that as a
 necessary result of that act
 in their opinion they were
 bound to withdraw They did
 not resign their seats There
 is not one of them
 I presume who would not
 tell you that if he
 believed his State had a
 right to a seat in
 the Senate he was the
 man entitled to it hut
 he acted upon the opinion
 that the secession of the
 Stnte with drew his powers
 as a Senator He did
 not resign he withdrew from
 this body as a conclusion
 from that propo sition Now
 sir it seems to me
 that we have no right
 to treat it as a
 resignation I believe they are
 no longer Senators because I
 think their States have seceded
 and thus they have lost
 their au thority to sit
 here but if I believed
 their States had no right
 to secede I could not
 treat the act of yesterday
 as a resignation and I
 should feel bound to insist
 that they still were Senators
 sub ject to the process
 of the Senate subject to
 be recalled through the Sergeant
 at Arms subject if there
 were a call of the
 Senate to be brought here
 into the Senate as any
 other Senators and the only
 reason which I could give
 for excusin them from the
 service of such process would
 be that they had retired
 bccausc their States had withdrawn
 the authority under which they
 x vere sitting here Believing
 that I am of the
 opinion that they are not
 Senators but I do not
 agree that they have resigned
 or that a resignation could
 be made in any other
 way than in writing It
 is hoWever a different affair
 in regard to the committees
 The Senate has a right
 to fili vacan cics if
 thcy absent themselves Their State
 has no particular right in
 that regard that is an
 au thority which they derive
 through the Senate and liminary
 question ought to Rive rise
 to a debate on the
 general question When that comes
 up it will be a
 very serious and a very
 important de It will then
 involve the relation of the
 bale States to each other
 and to the Federal Govern
 ment but on a mere
 question of this character I
 do not see the necessity
 for that debate I think
 it is perfectly competent to
 fill up the committees even
 in the temporary absence of
 members It was done three
 years ago in consequence of
 the sickness of one of
 the members on the Territo
 rial Committee The Senate then
 on my mo tion added
 another member to the committee
 to serve during the sickness
 of that member Al though
 I have said that this
 is not the time to
 debate the general question I
 will take this occa Sion
 to add that we need
 not seek to avoid it
 The Senate will be forced
 to pass its judgment upon
 that question at some time
 and it ought to be
 done after mature reflection deliberation
 and investigation For the present
 we had better let it
 pass merely fill the committees
 and when that question does
 come up in its proper
 shape it will bethoroughlydiscusscd We
 cannot avoid it Mr COLLAIVIER
 Will the Chair state the
 question pending The VICE PRESIDENT
 There is no ques tion
 now pending in reference to
 vacancies on the committees The
 Chair considers himself suff ciently
 instructed by the remarks made
 by Scna tors on that
 point There is however a
 motion pending to correct the
 Journal made by the Sen
 ator from Louisiana Mr BENJAMIN
 1 have reduced my motion
 to writing in this form
 I move that the Journal
 of the proceedings of the
 Senate be so corrected as
 to record the tact that
 the Senators from the States
 of Florida and Alabama and
 Hon JEF FERSON Davis Senator
 of the State of Mississippi
 madc announccmcnt that thc said
 States of Flor ida Alabama
 and Mississippi had seceded from
 the Union had resumed the
 powers delegated by the said
 several States to the United
 States of America and that
 they the said Senators con
 sidered themselves by reason of
 said action of said States
 as being no longer entitled
 to retain their seats as
 Senators and accordingly there upon
 withdrew from the Senate Mr
 SEWARD Let us have the
 yeas and nays upon that
 Mr DOUGLAS I desire to
 offer a substitute for the
 motion of the Senator from
 Louisiana I move to strike
 out all after the word
 that and insert Mr DAVIS
 of Mississippi Messrs FITZPATRICK and
 CLAY of Alabama and Messrs
 YULEE and MALLORY of Florida
 having announced that they were
 no longer niem bcrs of
 this body the vacancies on
 the committees of which they
 were members be filled Mr
 GREEN The question of vacancies
 has been settled This is
 a motion to correct the
 Journal MI DOUGLAS I m
 vish to put it upon
 the Journal that they announced
 their resignation The VICE PRESIDENT
 Will the Senator from Illinois
 reduce his proposition to writing
 Mr DOUGLAS Certainly but see
 the amendment of tho Senator
 from Louisiana Mr G WIN
 Is this a privileged question
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Chair
 thinks so as it is
 a question in referencc to
 a correction of the Journal
 Mr G WIN I wishcd
 to call attention to the
 fact that the hour has
 arrived for the special on
 dm thc Pacific railroad bill
 Mr HUNTER While are waiting
 for the substitute to be
 reduced to writing I will
 make a suggestion to the
 Senate It seems to me
 that the Journal was made
 up correctly Itis the prac
 tice in making up the
 Journal to record nothinff but
 propositions which have been voted
 upon No proposition was made
 to the Senate in this
 respect yesterday and there xvould
 be great dif ficulty in
 attempting to state what those
 gentle men said They are
 not herc to correct us
 We find here already a
 difference as to the facts
 The Senator from Illinois says
 that they stated that they
 were no longer members of
 th1S body Others of us
 think they said that their
 States had I withdrawn their
 powers and therefore they with
 not from their State and
 the Senate has a perfect
 I drew Tho onc would
 state it as a resitynation
 Of but here we are
 making up a statement for
 them without having a copy
 of what they did say
 I think therefore it is
 better that it should not
 ap pear on the Journal
 but if anything is to
 appear we should at least
 have the report of what
 they did say that we
 may be accurate in regard
 to it We have no
 right to undertake to say
 for them what they meant
 to say and to present
 the case according to our
 own view of the principle
 in volved in the subject
 I think therefore it would
 be better to with draw
 all propositions for the amendment
 of the Journal for the
 present The question will not
 arise practically until we come
 to the point of what
 constitutes a quorum Then it
 may be that we may
 have to consider whether they
 are mem bers or not
 when we come to ascertain
 how many it requires to
 make a quorum Otherwise I
 do not see thc practical
 effect of deciding the ques
 I do not see how
 it is to come up
 except tion in order t
 o ascertain how many Senators
 there are that we may
 know what makes a quorum
 Mr FESSENDEN Under the peculiar
 cir cumstances of tho case
 I should be quite willing
 to leave the matter without
 any notice at all The
 Senator from Louisiana however makes
 his mo tion but I
 am very glad to see
 that Senators on the other
 side of the House who
 have so much to say
 on this matter of secession
 wish to retain a kind
 of locus pcnitentiæ for these
 gentlemen to let them come
 back when they get ready
 I am perfectly willing to
 leave the whole matter open
 Mr DOUGLAS If a vote
 is asked for by the
 Senator from Louisiana upon his
 proposition I move to substitute
 for it the following Mr
 DAX ns of Mississippi Messrs
 FITZPATRICK and CLAY of Alabama
 and Messrs YULEE and MALLORY
 of Florida announced that they
 were no longer rnembers of
 the Senate and withdrew Mr
 SEYVARD I move to lay
 the subject on the table
 Mr FESSENDEN What subject Mr
 SEWARD The whole subject which
 we have been debating And
 on that I ask for
 the yeas and nays Mr
 BENJAMIN I will observe to
 the Sen ator that the
 question must come up to
 morrow morning again or can
 be taken up at any
 time and therefore it is
 idle to lay it on
 the table now Mr SEWARD
 1 it is an unprofitable
 subject at any time and
 to day it is premature
 We are not prepared to
 consider it in all it
 s as pects and I
 believe the time has arrived
 for the special order Mr
 BENJAMIN I raise the question
 whether it is in order
 to move to lay upon
 the table amo tion to
 correct the Journal of the
 Senate of yester day It
 strikes me that the proper
 keeping of bhe Journal of
 each day is required from
 the very nature of the
 case to be determined on
 the follow in mornifrf and
 that that question cannot bc
 pretermitted by the Senate The
 Senate is bound by the
 Constitution to keep a correct
 Journal of its proceedings and
 when on the reading each
 morning of the Joürnal of
 the preceding day the question
 arises as to thc accuracy
 of the Journal that question
 must be determined before we
 can proceed in our business
 It is obvious that other
 by this system of laying
 on the table the whole
 question as to the accuracy
 of the Journal might be
 kept open until the memory
 of what had occurred would
 be lost I think it
 is a ques tion of
 privilege which requires immediate decis
 ion from its very nature
 Mr FITCH Mr President The
 VICE PRESIDENT In the opinion
 of the Chair thc motion
 may be made to lay
 it upon the table Mr
 FITCH Then 1 have nothing
 to say 1 think the
 Journal is right as it
 is Mr DOUGLAS I desire
 to make one remark I
 think we may as well
 determine the point now for
 the reason that it is
 more than probable that before
 we adjourn to day tho
 question will arise as to
 whether there is a quorum
 in the body It will
 interrupt us in the business
 that we are pro ceeding
 with then to determine the
 question of a quorum if
 we do not decide it
 now It was about to
 arise on Saturday evening and
 perhaps would have arisen if
 those gentiemen had then retired
 on the question how many
 it takes for a quorum
 right to treat every absence
 as a vacancy ona their
 seats in this body the
 other would statc it It
 may arise in various ways
 and I think we committee
 and to fill it as
 a withdrawal because of this
 act of their States may
 as well settle it now
 as to try to avoid
 it for Mr GREEN I
 do not think that this
 pre There is an important
 difference between the two a
 few hours 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBB 50B Mr BAKER Mr
 President for one 1 am
 prepared to vote now because
 the sooner the question is
 settled the better I will
 give my opin ion in
 a very few words I
 undérsland that gcn tlcmcn rose
 in their seats yesterday and
 declared that they were about
 permanently to withdraw from this
 body They did so I
 think a perma nent withdrawal
 is a resignation and I
 think it is equally a
 resignation whether it is offered
 in writing or whether it
 is offered verbally in their
 In my judgment it is
 quite places on this floor
 as much a resignation whether
 they undersqnd clearly for themselves
 the reasons which induce If
 Senator resigns his them to
 resign or not place here
 believing that his State has
 reoalled him whether by a
 vote of the Legislature or
 a vote of a convention
 or a vote of the
 people or no vote at
 all still if he believes
 that he is recalled and
 acts upon that belief and
 docs resign the res ignationshouid
 take effect and be so
 held whether hc be mistaken
 or otherv 7ise as to
 the reasons which influence him
 Now I am one of
 those who do not believe
 that South Carolina has seceded
 or Mississippi or A abama
 because I do not believe
 they have the power or
 the right to do so
 bub I believc they Intend
 to do that and I
 bclicvc their Senators are 1
 believe that they QCting upon
 that intention have in the
 most formal way possible perhaps
 certainly the most solemn offered
 their resigna to this body
 Ido not think it becomes
 me to obicct that they
 could not resign because I
 do not think they ought
 to have resigned I accept
 what the v have done
 as a permanent withdrawal from
 this body and i propose
 so to treat it The
 con sequences I may argue
 hereafter If those States to
 morrow should propose to send
 other Senators here I should
 be glad and happy to
 rcceive them but I would
 not be will incr to
 receive these Fentlemen u rain
 unless they were reelected because
 in my judgment they resigned
 and havincy resigned I do
 not think their and therefore
 I am resignation can be
 recalled quitc willing to vote
 either for the amendment to
 tho Journal proposed by the
 honorable Senator from Louisiana or
 the amendment to that prop
 osition offered by the honorable
 Senator from Illinois though l
 beg leave to state that
 I I n efer the
 modc of expression of the
 Senator from Illi nois because
 I think it is more
 in accordance with the fact
 Beyond that I may add
 another word I am not
 anxious to acknowledge upon this
 floor secession in any way
 if I can avoid it
 Certainly It may a fact
 so I may bc forced
 to it patent so notorious
 so dangerous that I shall
 be so compelled But while
 I think that the resi
 r nation of these Senators
 as a matter of fact
 ought to bc here recorded
 do not know that their
 reasons for it or the
 condition of public affairs in
 their Slates are necessary to
 be mentioned on the Journal
 and therefore it is that
 I prefer tho wordincr of
 the amendment of the Senator
 from Illinois as understand it
 a simple statement that certain
 gentleman Senators upon this floor
 rose in their places in
 this body and declared their
 permanent withdrawal from it as
 Senators Thal is the fact
 and in my judgment facts
 ought always to be stated
 Mr DOUGLAS The Senator me
 to sucrrrest that I have
 modificd my amendment by aüing
 and that their namcs bc
 dropped from the list Mr
 BAKER That is a consequence
 that will inevitably follow The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair will
 suggest to Senators that the
 motion to lay on the
 table is not debatable Mr
 MASON Allow me to saya
 vord I understand the question
 was made by the Sen
 ator from Louisiana and I
 think correctly taken that it
 cannot bc laid on the
 table so as to doför
 action on it The Journal
 of the day Illust be
 corrected to the satisfactionoftheSenatc I
 should think before the Senate
 cen proceed with busi objection
 the Chair will hear the
 Senator from Virginia Mr SEWARD
 1 withdraw the motion The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Senator from
 Vircrinia then can proceed Nil
 MASON IVIr President there are
 four States claiming to be
 out of the Union and
 théir representatives here the SenatorsAHLve
 offcially informed the Senate of
 the fact that their States
 have withdrawn from the Union
 and in pursu ance of
 it as they have informOd
 the Senat they have withdrawn
 also considering themselves no longer
 members of this body These
 are the facts Honorable Senators
 on the other side morc
 especially tho very able Senator
 from Maine Mr FESSENDEN have
 said that these are not
 facts that the States have
 not withdrawn that they arc
 as much members of this
 Union as they were at
 the commcncemcnt of the session
 and that it is not
 competent for those States to
 with draw unless the concurrence
 of their confederates is given
 in some way as I
 understand Now Mr President it
 is a matter of very
 little moment to those States
 that have Withdrawn It will
 wrhat the decision of the
 Senate rnay be not affect
 their action in the slightest
 degree and l hey have
 under will not ailict their
 position It taken to decide
 that question for themselves is
 perfectly immaterial what the action
 of this Senate may be
 upon it they and their
 people no longer being under
 the jurisdiction of tho Senate
 But it would seem to
 nio to be a mat
 t er of some moment
 for the Senate to determine
 because whether they are or
 arc not members of the
 Union affects at once the
 condition of this body and
 its If they ure not
 members of competency to act
 the Union those four Stales
 being out there are but
 twenty nine States in the
 Union and there being but
 t V0 Senators from each
 State of those it the
 Union the quorum will be
 governed thcrcbyo My colleague so
 rested iust now that the
 ques tion did affect the
 quorum and perhaps had bet
 t er not be decided
 now if I understand correctly
 whence the honorable Senator from
 Maine in ferred that therc
 was a design here to
 reserve what he called a
 locus pænitentiæ to those States
 I am utterly unaware that
 there is any such de
 sire on this side of
 the Chamber because if there
 were it would be but
 doing a vain act the
 act would bc void if
 we attempted to reserve a
 place for those Senators or
 Senators from those States on
 this floor non obstante the
 action of the States It
 is not in our power
 to do it if we
 themselves desired it But I
 think he does rny colleague
 in justice in tho construction
 of his remarks because out
 sympathies are with those States
 in what thcy have done
 W c believe they had
 a right to do it
 and we believe their act
 is perfected and requires nothing
 nwrc from any body of
 men whatever to place those
 States as they claim to
 bc entirely out of the
 jurisdiction of this Union as
 utterly discc nnected with it
 as the Government of France
 of England Well now sir
 as to this question in
 my judg ment the only
 propriety and the only necessity
 of dctermining It is to
 determine the condition of If
 honorable Senators on the other
 the Senate side are disposed
 to ffive an advantage to
 the mi novity on this
 side by refusing to recoenize
 thc act of secession be
 it so Ict them do
 it but let them please
 to understand that it is
 their act and not the
 act of any southern represerktative
 that 1 If they choose
 to am aware of upon
 this floor disable their majority
 and to increase the power
 of the minority here by
 so treating the subject bc
 it so it is their
 act not ours Mr HUNTER
 1 wish to say that
 my I did not I
 league certainly interpreted me aright
 repiy to that remark ab01
 tt tbc locus pcnitentiæ I
 because I thought it was
 a rnere sportive allusion which
 did not require reply Of
 course every body knows that
 these gentlemen desire no op
 precedent which will read thus
 A ifwill be found when
 we refer to the CönÉi
 essioü åtCGlbbé whéi e we
 shall see reported what h
 hej did2 say yefsCer day
 that they only asserted that
 theii Staves had seceded and
 that as a conseqüence théy
 bound to withdraw The effect
 of striking them off the
 rolls will be to treat
 their Stateé as havirig seceded
 no matter what statements may
 be made here as to
 what they said because when
 posterity shall come to look
 to this case as a
 precedent they will go to
 the Globe and see what
 they di l Say and
 when they come to ascertain
 what they did say they
 will find that they said
 nothing like resigning but on
 the contrary merely stated it
 as an act which was
 necessary upon the with drawal
 Of their States from this
 Union Mr BENJAMIN I disagree
 sir with the Senator from
 Virginia Mr HUNTERI in toto
 and I wish to say
 a few Words in opposition
 to the amendment suggested by
 the Senator from Illi nois
 Mr President it will be
 remembered by all Senators that
 on the question of the
 right of a State to
 recall its Senat01is there were
 long de bates in the
 Federal convention Under the Old
 Confederation cach State was entitled
 to one vote sent its
 delegations to the Congress of
 the Con federation withdrew them
 at pleasure changed them at
 will When the Constitution was
 framed repeated effort s were
 made to vest in the
 States the right to recall
 their Senators at will These
 attempts failed and the Legislatures
 of the States having onco
 exercised then functions of electing
 a Senator elect him for
 his entire term and pre
 serve no control over him
 They have no power of
 recall Now sir yesterday a
 number of Senators made a
 statement of fact and it
 is precisely that state ment
 of fact omcially made to
 the Seriåte by the Senators
 themselves which the Senator from
 Illiu nois proposes by this
 amendment to leave out of
 the record l he first
 thing done by thosd Sen
 ators yesterday none contest that
 was to make an omcial
 statement that their States had
 passed ordinances of secession a
 nd had withdrawn from the
 Union My motion requires that
 fact to be stated upon
 the Journal of the Senate
 as a part of the
 official record of the proceedings
 of the Senate the offcial
 announcement inade by members of
 the Senate to the body
 that their States had passed
 ordinances of secession If that
 was a proceed ing which
 took place in the Senate
 yesterday and none deny it
 by what authority shall it
 be kcpt out of the
 Journal The Constitution re quires
 us to keep a Journal
 of the proceedings of the
 Senate and whether a Senator
 makes oflicial communication to the
 Senate of the action of
 his State verbally or in
 writing I think it will
 be found vain to search
 fora precedent by which the
 fact of that official communication
 had been omit tecfin the
 Journal It is one of
 the proceedings of the Senate
 which by the Constitution is
 to be recorded That was
 one fact Another fact was
 that these Senators thereupon withdrew
 That all admit That is
 another portion Of the proceedings
 of the Senate which under
 the Constitution is required to
 be put down in the
 Journal and I totally dis
 gent from the suggestion of
 the honorable Senator from New
 York that we are to
 put in the Jour nal
 such things as please us
 and that there are certain
 omissions which would be better
 honored than the observance of
 the requirements of the Constitution
 We have no right to
 Icave out of the Journal
 any part of the public
 omcial proceed ings of the
 Senate Now sir these two
 points all admit first the
 official announcement of the withdrawal
 of the States no Senator
 objected to that being made
 by If that point of
 parol instead of in writing
 i order had been raised
 it would have been determ
 incd It was not raised
 The announcement was made by
 pnrol but it was madc
 by the Sen portunity for
 repentance but believe themselves to
 bc in the right I
 will say though while I
 arn ators officially in the
 names of theirSlates Next these
 Senators withdrevv There are two
 facts up just one word
 in regard to the proposed
 amend It will be found
 that my that must certainly
 go upon the Journal We
 ness That is my view
 should like to say u
 ment of the Journal few
 words in reply to what
 has been said on the
 suggestion in regard to the
 practical mode of meet have
 no discretion upon that subject
 Then rc ing the question
 is the right one I
 think Ona I mains one
 other question and what is
 that ques other side tion
 The Senator from Illinois and
 the Sénator The VICE PRESIDENT
 Does the Senator question of
 quoru n each man will
 vote whether these States are
 in or out upon his
 own reasons from Maine following
 him say that what these
 desire to address the Chair
 on lhe point of order
 no more than I have
 Now we are required to
 vote upon certain state gentlemen
 said was in their opinion
 equivalent to Mr NIASON No
 sir said I want to
 say a few words on
 the propo ments of what
 these gentlemen said when they
 a resignation but the Senator
 from Virginia is are not
 here present to correct us
 themselves i mistaken in supposing
 thatanyof them say it was
 sition itself The VICE PRESIDENT
 If there be no I
 My own opinion is however
 that it will makea a
 resignation that they resigned in
 terms N0 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBß
 January 22 b6dy_ haÉ preiérided
 that here Everybody knows the
 contrary We all know that
 those Senators said that they
 withdreW from tbe Senate as
 being their jådgmeht no longer
 entitled to hold seats here
 in consequence of the påsSage
 of the ordi tianée of
 secession What we are discussing
 here iow is not tlie
 fåct but the legal significånce
 Of ihé fact Now differ
 with the Senator from Illinois
 in drawing the conclusion of
 the resiøna tion Thatis his
 conclusion from what occu rred
 I did not understand him
 as stating that the Sen
 ators said they lidd esighed
 nordo I understand iliO Senator
 from Måine a S saying
 SO but they Éa y_
 that theSé Sphåtor s having
 stated that they Withdrew from
 the Senate that in their
 judgment amounts to resi n
 Ätion That is a fair
 argument to use and to
 be Supported as gentlemen best
 can but the proposition now
 before the Senate is to
 have the record Of its
 proceedings correct Does any man
 question here that the statement
 made by me in writing
 in my motion to have
 the Jour nal corrected does
 contain a true statement of
 what occurred first suggestion Or
 rather an offcial communication of
 the fact of the passage
 of the ordinance of secession
 and secondly the Withdrawal of
 the Senators upon their statement
 that they believed that by
 reasori of that seces sion
 they were no longer entitled
 to seats No body disputes
 these facts Therefore the Sena
 tor from Virginia is mistaken
 in saying that we are
 making up al record in
 the absence of these gentlemen
 about disputed facts The dispute
 that has arisen hete i
 upon the legal Significance of
 these facts I think no
 Senator has suggeSted a döUbt
 ds to the Statemérit of
 the Withdrawing Sen ators that
 they considered the action of
 thei r States such as
 deprived them Of the right
 to a seat in this
 body and it Was upon
 that ground that they with
 As under the Constitution of
 the United States Stales within
 the Union have no right
 to recall their Senators it
 is eminently proper that the
 fact that the withdrawal of
 these Senators through the action
 of their States occurred by
 reason of a secession should
 appear Otherwise it would appear
 upon the face of the
 proceedingS that the States Iliad
 assumed to recall Senators without
 authority under the Constitution so
 to do We know they
 have no such right The
 record then according to the
 motion I submit will present
 the propositions just as they
 occurred and the pre dise
 grounds taken by the States
 and by the withdrawing Senators
 They are not recalled by
 cheir States as States within
 the Union That ought not
 to appear upon the record
 It is not so it
 ought not to seem possible
 on the face of the
 record that those Senators were
 recalled by their States while
 their States were in the
 Union That would be an
 admission of a directly unconstitutional
 act and one which they
 them selves would admit to
 be unconstitutional When then the
 Senators declare that they withdraw
 by rcason of the action
 of their States as those
 States would have no right
 to cause such withdrawal by
 their recall if that State
 reniained in the Union the
 necessity is urgent that it
 should be stated that the
 Senators first declared that their
 States had gone out of
 the Union by ordinances of
 seces sion and therefore that
 act constituted the reason for
 their withdrawal I think sir
 that is the necessary statement
 of the constitutional question on
 the Journal Mr HALE Mr
 President I rise to a
 ques lion of order VICE
 PRESIDENT The Senator from New
 Hampshire rises to a question
 of order He will state
 it Mr HALE A motion
 was made to lay this
 sub ect on the table
 arid that is not debatable
 VICE PRESIDENT That has been
 Withdrawn Mr HALE 1 did
 not it Mr DOUGLAS 1
 agree with the Senator from
 Louisianä that we must enter
 all of our proceed ings
 upon the Journal and thät
 his criticism upon the remark
 of the Senator from New
 York if that was intended
 as serious that you could
 omit no part of our
 proceedings is well taken The
 dif ference between the Senator
 from Louisiana and myself is
 as to what was the
 proceeding yester day He understandé
 the proceeding yesterday as the
 announcement to this body of
 the secession of certain States
 of this Union I do
 not under stand th t
 any such proceeding was had
 under stand that certain Senators
 yesterday withdrew from this body
 as no longer being members
 of it and gave certain
 reasons for their withdrawal The
 fact of their withdrawal and
 dissolving their connection with the
 body was the only proceed
 ing that took place The
 reasons they assigned for the
 act are no part of
 our proceedings It is true
 they assigned various reasons One
 was that their States had
 passed certain ordinances Another was
 that their States were justifiable
 in passing them because their
 equality in the Union had
 been violated because of certain
 unkind and ungenerous conduct on
 the part of northern States
 and because they had not
 such protection for a certain
 class of property as they
 claimed and various other reasön
 s some of which I
 think were well founded and
 some of which I think
 were untrue abd I should
 have combated them at the
 time but for the fact
 that I should have been
 replying to retiring Senators who
 could not have replied to
 me I never would have
 permit ted those reasons to
 go on the record uncontra
 dicted because I think they
 do violence to the history
 of the country and to
 the truth of the case
 if tliey were to be
 spread upon the Journal as
 a part of our proceeding
 but inasmuch as they only
 constituted some of the reasons
 upon which they had acted
 I was wilfing that their
 reasons should go to the
 world so long as they
 did not constitute a part
 of our proceedings and history
 would give them such weight
 and the people of the
 country would award them such
 credit as they were entitled
 to The only fact to
 be recorded upon our Journal
 is that thesc gentlemen dissolved
 their connection with the body
 and withdrew Their reasons for
 that proceeding are not entitled
 to be put upon the
 record The Journal is not
 to containa transcript of our
 debates I deny that it
 is proper to take one
 of the reasons and detach
 it the rest and put
 that upon the record The
 Senator from Lou Isiana proposes
 to record the fact and
 give one amoncr several reasons
 He is bound to give
 the whole if the reasons
 or to give none of
 them Mr BENJAMIN If the
 Senator will permit me I
 nevcr understood that any other
 but one was given by
 these gentlemen They gave agreat
 many reasons why their States
 had seceded but I heard
 them give no other reason
 for their own withdrawal than
 the offcial announcement that their
 States had seceded and that
 that deprived them ofa right
 to a seat on this
 floor They then went on
 in parting remarks to give
 an opinion why it was
 their States had seceded and
 to jus tify the act
 of secession but they never
 Tave them for withdrawing from
 the Senate They gave but
 a solitary ground for svithdrawing
 from the Senate Mr DOUGLAS
 They gave the reason that
 the State had seceded Then
 they gave as another reason
 that they believed the State
 had a right to secede
 and that theretöre they were
 no longer entitled to seats
 here I think that was
 part of the art yument
 Mr BENJAMIN 1 think the
 Senator is en tirely rnistaken
 They never gave that the
 State had a rioht to
 secede as aground for withdrawal
 because they all admitted that
 whether thc State had the
 right or had not the
 right ithnd seceded and they
 considered the fact of secession
 as a svith drawal of
 their powers They argued about
 the reasons for the secession
 Mr DOUGLAS Mr President hold
 that unless they considered the
 States had first seceded and
 secondly they had a right
 to do it they were
 not bound to withdraw Suppose
 Mr MASON Will the Senator
 allow me to interru t
 him for a moment to
 present a fact Mr BOUGLAS
 Yes sir Mr MASON The
 President of the United States
 in his late message to
 Congress transmit ted to Congress
 the certified copy or properly
 the exemplified copy of the
 act of secession by the
 convention of South Carolina Therefore
 ns to that State the
 fact that she has seceded
 is offcially communicated to Congress
 by the President Mr DOUGLAS
 No one is denying that
 those lutions to recall a
 Senator and the Senator when
 those resolutions were presented here
 should say Believing that the
 State has a right to
 recall me I therefore yield
 obedience and retire vacates his
 seat because it is a
 resignation in fact Suppose on
 the other hand he should
 say Having no right to
 recali me I refuse to
 obey then he remains a
 member of the body it
 Whether he shall retire or
 not depends upon whether he
 recognizes the right ofa State
 to Wilh draw him or
 not T hese Senators therefore
 having determined to retire assigned
 certain rea sonS I am
 not going to inquire whether
 the reasons were well founded
 or not It is enough
 for mc that they retired
 and dissolved their con nection
 with the body that they
 had a right thus to
 retire and that too for
 bad reasons and I can
 recognize the fact that they
 are no longer mem bers
 of the body without indorsing
 their reasons Suppose one of
 those Senators in cxtremely del
 icate health had said I
 retire from this body never
 to return ao ain because
 my physician ad vises me
 that my health requires it
 Mr BAKER Will the honorable
 Senator allow me a moment
 to get the fact before
 the Senate I he opening
 remark of Mr YULEE iB
 before me which I will
 read Mr President I rise
 to make known to the
 Senate that in consequence of
 certain proceedings which have lately
 taken place in the State
 of Florida my colleague and
 my self are of the
 opinion that our connection with
 this body is legally terminated
 That is the whole thing
 Mr DOUGLAS Precisely and then
 they an nounce the fact
 that they have terminated their
 connection with theScnatc Butl was
 just makino a supposition that
 in assim ling the reasons
 which were given one of
 them had said in consequence
 of his health and the
 advice of his physician his
 life depended upon his retiring
 from the body and therefore
 he retired Is it necessary
 for us to inquire whether
 his physician haå given him
 sound advice or not Whether
 he was as sick as
 he thought he was Is
 it not enough for us
 to recognize the fact that
 he has dissolved his con
 nection with the body and
 leave his reasons to stand
 for what they are worth
 Now I deny that the
 Senate can properly enter on
 its Journal any other fact
 than the one that they
 had withdrawn from the body
 amounting to resignation and leaving
 the reasons out of consideration
 Mr HUNTER 1 never denied
 that the Sen ate had
 a right if it chose
 to enter a statement of
 facts upon its Journal 1
 merely spoke of what was
 usual in making up the
 Journal It is usual in
 making up the Journal as
 you very well know sir
 to put nothing upon it
 but propositions made for the
 action of the Senate If
 a resolution is offered and
 withdrawn without the action of
 the Senate that does not
 appear upon the Journal That
 is the fact in regard
 to the mode of making
 it up Of course the
 Senate if it chooses can
 put other facts upon it
 Neither did I mean to
 say that the Senator from
 Maine and the Senator from
 Illinois had declared that the
 seceding Senators had resigned in
 so many words My object
 was to show that the
 legal effect of declaring their
 seats vacant and en tei
 ing it on the Journal
 must be to acknowledge that
 the State did terminate their
 authority to sit here when
 it seceded from the Union
 My object was to show
 that when you come to
 enter Chat fact unless you
 declare that they have actually
 resigned it will be taken
 as a conclusion at which
 the Senate arrived from the
 action of the States that
 the Senators were no longer
 allowed to sit here and
 what I desired was that
 thc entry should not be
 mude if they determine to
 correct ence that those Senators
 had in so many words
 undertaken to resign their seats
 for that is not according
 to the facts of the
 case They said they withdrew
 as is stated in the
 extract from the paper just
 read by the Senator from
 Oregon be cause ofcefrtain proceedings
 in their States which proceedings
 had terminated their legal connection
 with this body Now sir
 all I ask is if
 the Sen States have passed
 ordinances of the kind stated
 ate undertakes to make theentry
 upon the Journal by various
 Senators but the point is
 in order to vacate their
 seats here first the States
 must have seceded and next
 they must have had a
 right to do so otherwise
 the Senator is not compelled
 I was going to that
 proposi to retire lion by
 supposing that a State should
 pass reso that it enter
 the facts as they occurred
 because if they do it
 will be found that the
 declaration that those seats are
 vacant can only be jastificd
 on the ground that they
 were vacant because secession of
 the States hud terminated their
 legal authority to sit here

 will allow me to have
 the floor again for the
 purpose of renewing my motion
 to lay this subject on
 the table i wili hear
 what the honorable Senator has
 to say Mr BENJAMIN Mr
 President the Sena tor from
 Oregon is unfortunate in his
 statement reading a preliminary remark
 from the Senator from Florida
 and saying that is the
 whole of it The Senator
 from Florida wcnt immediately into
 a statement offcially of the
 fact Just as he closed
 the sentence read by the
 Senator from Oregon he went
 on to say The Stat
 e of Flcuida has through
 a convention of her people
 duly assembled decided to recall
 tbc powers dele gated to
 this Government and to assume
 the fthll exercise of ail
 her sovcreign rights as an
 independent and separate community The

 adopted an ordinancc whereby they
 withdraw fronn tbc Union tbnned
 under a compact styled the
 Constitution of the United States
 resume the powers delegated to
 it and assmne thcir separate
 station as a sovereign and
 independent peo ple Mr Davxs
 the Senator from Mississippi rose
 officially to announce the fact
 also of the action of
 his State Mr DAvxs said
 I rise Mr President for
 thc purpose of announcing to
 the Senate that I have
 satisfactory evidence that the State
 of Mississippi by a solemn
 ordinance of her people in
 con vention assernbled has declared
 her separation frorn the United
 States Now sir my proposition
 is simply a statement of
 fact to be put upon
 the Journal that the Sen
 ators from those States announced
 secession and announced their withdrawal
 from the Senate in It
 docs not an consequence of
 the secession nounce the fact
 II makes no conclusion such
 as the Senator from Virginia
 has asserted Every man will
 draw his own conclusion from
 the facts The Senator from
 Illinois was certainly incor rect
 in stating that these gentlemen
 gave any num ber of
 reasons for their withdra val
 They gave not one but
 the one have just stated
 They announced the fact of
 what in their opinion was
 a recall of their powers
 Now as that recall of
 powers as Senators could not
 exist if the States were
 in the Union they were
 bound in announc ing that
 their powers were recalled to
 state that our Journal a
 full record I say that
 Journal is no full record
 I say that Journal will
 convey a false hood to
 posterity if it omits a
 statement of what occurred in
 this Senate yesterday Mr SEWARD
 I move to lay this
 subject on the table Mr
 SIMMONS Allow me to make
 just one I do not
 want to arcrue it statement
 of facts M r SEWARD
 Three gentlemen are wish I
 wish to say ino to
 make statements of fact Mr
 President I liave no desire
 to avoid a full discussion
 of this suhiect It will
 probably come up necessarily and
 legitimately when we come to
 the question of what constitutes
 a quorum I think suffcient
 unto the day is the
 evil thereof I do not
 wish to anticipate the question
 i want time to consider
 it in all its bearings
 The debate will bc protracted
 The Pacific railroad bill which
 think is of vast importance
 is lying neg lected for
 want of hearing and I
 hope my friends on both
 sides of the Chamber will
 excuse me after havin y
 waived my motion two or
 three It is that this
 times for now Insisting upon
 it subject be laid on
 the table Mr SIMMONS 1
 should like to ask the
 fa vor of the Senator
 to make onc statement of
 fact The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Chair will state to the
 Senator from Rhode Island that
 this motion must bc put
 without debate Mr SIMMONS 1
 ask the Senator to with
 draw it for one minute
 Mr SEWARD I will do
 so if I can have
 an understanding that the debate
 will stop with the I
 could not claim the attention
 of tbe Senator House again
 for have three times withdrawn
 it Mr SIMMONS I can
 renew the motion to lay
 on the table Mr SEWARD
 My honorable friend will excuse
 mc for insisting on my
 motion and ask ing him
 to vote for it to
 lay the subject on the
 table We can hear him
 to morrow Mr SIMMONS 1
 think those who do not
 make many speeches like myself
 should have the privilege of
 saying a word Mr MASON
 I rise to a question
 of order The VICE PRESIDENT
 The Senatorfrom Virginia will state
 his question of order Mr
 MASON I make asa question
 of order that the Senate
 must proceed at once to
 determine upon the correctness of
 its Journal and therefore the
 motion to lay on the
 table which involves delay cannot
 be in order The VICE
 PRESIDENT That question was made
 by the Senator from Louisiana
 and the Chair expressed the
 opinion that the motion was
 in order Mr MASON I
 did not hear the opinion
 of the Chair The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Chair stood the
 Senator from New York to
 ask for the they were
 recalled because the States were
 out of the Union to
 make official announcement of the
 yeas and nays when the
 motion was made be two
 facts first that their States
 had gone out of fore
 The yeas and nays were
 ordered the Union and secondly
 that they withdrew The VICE
 PRESIDENT The question is their
 powers because if the State
 hud remained I in thc
 Union it had no power
 to change their on the
 motion of tho Senator from
 New York that the motion
 of the Senator from Louisiana
 commission as Senators I hat
 statement they I draw no
 conclusion from and the amendment
 of the Senator from Illinois
 made to the Senate I
 leave every Senator to draw
 his own but do lie
 on the table The question
 being taken by yeas and
 nays I do say that
 in a crisis in our
 national history resulted yeas 32

 THE CONGRESWIONAL GLOBE January 22
 except by unanimous consent these
 proceedings cannot go on Mr
 G WIN I move that
 the Senate proceed to the
 consideration of the Pacific railroad
 bill I have no objection
 to the consideration of the
 res olutions of the Senator
 from Kentucky but there is
 a special order for to
 morrow the tariff ques tion
 To day was assigned for
 the Pacific rail road bill
 and if it loses its
 position it may be jeopardized
 GREEN There is no danger
 Mr G WIN That is
 my opinion about it and
 therefore I feél bound to
 make the motion to proceed
 to the consideration of that
 question The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Chair is of opinion that
 it is only by the
 consent of the Sen ator
 from Kentucky that the Senator
 from Cali fornia can make
 his motion Mr GREEN The
 Senator from Kentucky does not
 yield the floor Ele is
 prepared to make his remarks
 and I think it is
 hardly fair to inter rupt
 him Mr GWIN 1 had
 no intention to interfere with
 the Senator from Kentucky who
 is entitled to the floor
 if he wished to proceed
 this morning on that question
 Mr POWELL Certainly to proceed
 Mr G WIN Of course
 then I will yield I
 was not aware of it
 The Senate as in Committee

 consideration of the joint resolution

 His speech will be published
 in the Appendix Mr I
 IA Eand Mr WADE both
 addressed the Chair The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from New
 Hampshire is entitled to the
 floor Mr HALE I desire
 to address the Senate very
 brieflv on this subject but
 I will give way to
 the Senätor from Ohio Mr
 WADE Mr President 1 not
 the purpose of making any
 very lengthy remarks at the
 present time but more especially
 to answer something that was
 said by the Senator from
 Vir ginia Mr MasoN yesterday
 I intended to answer hirn
 then but some one else
 got the floor I had
 not an opportunity to do
 it Havin formerly said nearly
 all that I wish to
 say on this subject I
 do not propose to go
 into any extended remarks in
 answer to what has fallen
 from the Senator from Kentucky
 on the present occasion but
 the Senator from Virginia yesterday
 arraigned the State of Ohio
 fop assino resolutions through hc
 r Legislature presented here amoncr
 other things asserting that if
 there wpre any laws upon
 her statute book that were
 unconstitutional they ought to I
 C repealed I do not
 state the anguage but I
 belicve that was the substance
 of I Ic said that
 this was very well but
 that when a bill was
 introduced into the House of
 Representatives of Ohio for the
 purpose of repealing some of
 those laws it was postponed
 indefinitely or something to that
 stood him aright I think
 the Senator was entirely mistaken
 about that I saw what
 I suppose to be the
 same proceeding that he alluded
 to A bill was introduced
 I believe at the last
 session of the Legislature for
 the further security of free
 persons against kidnapping That was
 taken up at this session
 and a motion to postpone
 it pre vailed The Senator
 supposed that was a bill
 for the purpose of repealing
 some personal liberty law In
 that I think he was
 entirely mistaken the effect of
 it was precisely the opposite
 to what he supposcd it
 was It was a bill
 to give further security to
 free people but under the
 circum stances it was thought
 undoubtedly bv the House of
 Representatives that it was not
 necessary to pass it and
 therefore it was postponed But
 the object of the bill
 was difFerent from what the
 Sen ator presumes it to
 have been if I have
 a right understanding of it
 I wish the Senator were
 here that he might explain
 what information he had upon
 the subject for it is
 entirely diffct ent from mine
 but this I think I
 know that upon the statute
 book of Ohio there is
 no law even that hc
 would say infringes any port
 ion of the Constitu tion
 or any of the laws
 of the United States made
 in pursuance of it I
 am glad tho Senator is
 now present and I will
 say again that I believe
 he w as mistaken in
 saying that the House of
 Representatives of Ohio had postponed
 a bill the object of
 which was to repeal some
 personal liberty law of that
 State First I have asserted
 that according to the best
 of my information upon an
 inspection of our laws now
 in force there is no
 personal liberty law on the
 statute book of Ohio If
 the Senator is aware of
 such a law of course
 he will ex hibit it
 Mr MASON Mr President The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr POLK in
 the chair Does the Senator
 from Ohio give way Mr
 WADE Certainly Mr MASON I
 will repeat what I said
 yes terday in the absence
 of the Senator from Ohio
 I did not know that
 he was absent at the
 time I made allusion to
 his State Among the resolu
 tions of the Legislature of
 Ohio presented to the Senate
 some two 01 three days
 since by the Sen ator
 from Ohio in the sixth
 resolution was this clause It
 is incumbent upon any States
 having enactments on their statute
 books conflicting with or rendering
 less cffi cient the Constitution
 or laws of the United
 Staies to re peal them
 I said yesterday in alluding
 to this that the mail
 of the day on which
 the Senator presented the resolutions
 brought me the Baltimore Sun
 in which I saw a
 paragraph stating that the House
 of Representatives ofthe Legislature of
 Ohio had by a vote
 I think of fifty eight
 to thirty one rejected a
 bill that W as introduÖed
 there to repeal a law
 which was called in the
 report a law kidnappino It
 was said also in the
 satno statcmcnt that under that
 a deputy marshal of tho
 United States and onc or
 two of his assistants had
 been imprisoned when they had
 arrested a fugitive slave I
 think at Cleve land and
 had been subjected to a
 trial for an iff nominious
 offense Under that law thcsc
 pro ccedings took place and
 that was the law which
 effect I do not gi
 ve the Senator s words
 because the Legislature by its
 lower branch had refused I
 have not the paper before
 mc and I am sorry
 I to repeal after havino
 passed these resol tions the
 Senator is not in his
 seat now to correct me
 declaring it should bc repealed
 That w what if I
 am wrono I said and
 I regret that the Senator
 was ot pres I know
 the Senator did not intend
 to misrepre ent when I
 madc the statement sent anything
 or state it differently from
 what it Mr WADE In
 answer to that I t
 link I may was Now
 I wish to say to
 that Senator and to say
 there is no law in
 Ohio contrary to the Con
 all Senators that I do
 not believe the statute book
 stitution of the United States
 or any raw under of
 Ohio contains any law that
 is unconstitutional it for I
 havc looked over our statute
 books This I do not
 believe that it contains upon
 its pacres same question was
 up last winter when the
 Sen any law that the
 Senator from Virginia hilnself ator
 from Georgia Mr T 00MBs
 was arraicrning would call unconstitutional
 We have nothing the pcrsonal
 liberty bills in all the
 States and that you call
 personal liberty bills upon our
 stat ute book We have
 a law to prevent the
 kid napping of free people
 almost parallel with I believe
 and of the same effect
 as that upon the statute
 book of Virginia from which
 I rather think it was
 copied It does not anywhere
 im pino e upon the
 Constitution of the United States
 or any law madc under
 it We have no such
 law and suppose the Senator
 was mistaken in that He
 said that as he undcrstood
 it there was a bill
 introduced into the House of
 Representatives of my State for
 the purpose of repealing some
 law of this kind which
 was postponed if I under
 among otl iers he said
 he thought the State of
 Ohio had such a law
 On that occasion I pro
 cured the law and read
 it and con lmented upon
 it and showed its provisions
 to be such as rcn
 dered it impossible that it
 could conflict with the Constitution
 or laws of the United
 States be cause after providing
 for the security of free
 per sons who were kidnapped
 it went on to say
 that the law should be
 so construed that it should
 not this law to give
 it such a construction rightagainst
 its provisions as to overthrow
 the laws of Con gress
 and the Constitution of the
 United States supposed that the
 Senator gave up Ohio as
 not being within his category
 I think sir if it
 was true that a bill
 was introduced in the House
 of Representatives of that State
 to repeal that law it
 ought to have been postponed
 I think the Senator from
 Virginia would have thought so
 too because I believe upon
 the statute book of his
 State there is a law
 running almost on all fours
 with this for the security
 of free persons who may
 bo kidnapped That is the
 explanation I have to make
 We have no law that
 impinges the Constitution of the
 United States or the laws
 made in accordance with it
 As to the repealing bill
 that the Senator spoke of
 as I understand it and
 I have already stated it
 once and only state it
 again because the Senator is
 in his placé that bill
 was postponed Well it is
 no matter about that What
 I have said will go
 on the record and if
 I azn wrong anybody idspecting
 our laws can find it
 out svell enough I have
 said all that it is
 necessary to say on that
 subject and more But while
 I am up being one
 of those who have constantly
 from the commencement of this
 ses sion stated that in
 my judgment under the con
 dition in which the country
 IS now I was entirely
 opposed to all those measures
 called compromise measures I wish
 very briefly to state more
 in detail than I have
 heretofore done the reasons which
 bring me to that con
 clusion I have argued this
 question in view of all
 the difficulties under which we
 are now laboring and I
 see no reason to alter
 anything that I have already
 said on that subject and
 therefore I shall not go
 minutely into it again But
 here are attempts made to
 com promise as it is
 called with somebody for some
 thing Now sir I do
 not knaw what legitimate controversy
 we have to compromise with
 any body I have heard
 and listened attentively to the
 speech of the honorable Senator
 from Ken tuck y the
 chairman of the committee of
 thirteen who had this subject
 under consideration He has attempted
 to arraign the State which
 I in part represent for
 some delinquency but say to
 him that he has done
 it in so general and
 inconclusive a manner that no
 man can make a defense
 to such charges W c
 arc delinquent he says we
 have organizations in our State
 the purpose of which is
 to obstruct the execution of
 your laws I plead the
 general issue to it and
 teli you there is no
 such organization in our State
 and there never was one
 I low do you answer
 it Why sir he has
 heard a Representative from Ohio
 N lr Coax say that
 somebody told somebody else and
 through sonne Republican it came
 to him that there was
 such a thing as slaves
 escaping by some kind of
 process called the underground railroad
 by which they got to
 Canada I do not doubt
 that slaves do escape What
 I deny is that there
 is any organized company in
 the State of Ohio for
 that purpose When such a
 charge is made against a
 State they that make itought
 to be ready with the
 proof to make it at
 least probable You have no
 proof I have listened to
 these general dec larations during
 this session and I may
 say also for the ten
 years that I have had
 a seat here but good
 old Lord Coke said that
 fraud lurketh in generalities and
 it does lurk in generalities
 I ask gentlemen when they
 prefer charges against individuals or
 States of being derelict in
 their con stilutional duties to
 tell me wherein and bring
 the evidence that should call
 for a ply Mr MASON
 Will the Senat allow me
 to interrupt him Mr WADE
 Yes sir Mr MASON I
 will suggest one in his
 own State It has occurred
 between the State of Ohio
 al d the State of
 Virginia and is now pending
 The Governor of Virginia made
 a demand upon the Governor
 of Ohio for the surrender
 of a fugi tive who
 had committed treason and murder
 in the State of Virginia
 in the case of the
 John Brown raid at Harper
 s Ferry The Governor of
 Ohio replied that under the
 laws of Ohio that was
 not an offense and therefore
 in his construc tion he
 was not to be surrendered
 under the pro vision of
 the Constitution That is a
 case now pending impinge the
 Constitution of the United States
 or I Mr WADE Now
 Mr President will ask any
 law made under it I
 asked that Senator that honorable
 Senator if he does not
 know that then Were you
 judge sir would you suppose
 II this particular construct ion
 of that act is not
 pe that it was inccnnbent
 on you in administering i
 culiar to the Governor Of
 the State of Ohio Has
 1861 507 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE it
 not been a vexed or
 mooted question from the written
 opinion that such cases would
 not be cov foundation of
 our Government until now whether
 ered by the Constitution of
 the United States a person
 is to be surrendered on
 the demand of II whereupon
 the Governor of Virginia refused
 to another State as a
 fugitive from justice who had
 make the surrender and notified
 Ehe Governor of not violated
 the law of the State
 in which he was I
 Pennsylvania of that fact and
 accompanied his I know that
 the decisions of the courts
 have been reply with the
 written opinion of the attorney
 contradictory on this subject and
 here I will an general
 of Virginia Thereupon the Governor
 of swer over again the
 Senator from Kentucky who Pennsylvania
 communicated these papers to Gen
 I cral Washington as PresidentoftheUnitedStates
 made the same charge against
 our Governor will say now
 what I was not prepared
 to say when and he
 delivered or communicated them to
 the had it up before
 for after all when I
 call for Senate of the
 United States and asked for
 legis specifications they all run
 right back there there lation
 on the subject The response
 to that com I munication
 of General Washington was the
 law is little delinquency they
 can fasten upon us have
 said givc us specifications He
 has had a of 1793
 providing for the surrender of
 fugitive slaves and fugitives from
 justice That I believe month
 to consider upon it and
 has come here to day
 with a deliberate premeditated speech
 and I to be the
 first case that ever occurred
 in which a when I
 axk him to specify he
 runs right back to ii
 Governor refused to deliver up
 criminals upon the the same
 old charge again There is
 no new spe eification but
 it is said Governor Dennison
 re fused to deliver a
 man who was said to
 bc en gaged somehow in
 enticing slaves from Kentucky i
 can state to that Senator
 now what I intimated before
 and he said he did
 not know that our Governor
 in making this decision whcther
 it was right or wrong
 for I do not know
 it is a law question
 which the courts will decide
 had at least the merit
 or demerit of going to
 Ken tuck y and to
 a Kentucky Governor for his
 pre codent He grounded it
 upon that and I think
 that at all cvcnts ou
 rht to have excused him
 from the severity of the
 cilarge the Senator has made
 ao ainst him I say
 to the Senator from Virginia
 I do not know Mr
 POWELL 1 hope the Senator
 will allow a word as
 he has frequently alluded to
 a prccedent of the Governor
 of Kentucky Mr YVADE Yes
 sir Mr POWELL 1 like
 to know the If therc
 is such a casc I
 confess I am not case
 I should like to have
 the Senator aware of it
 state the grounds on which
 thc Governor of Ken tucayr
 refused to deliver a person
 up Mr WADE Becausc it
 was not a crime in
 n tuck y N lr
 POWELL In reply to that
 I have stated before when
 that case has been alluded
 to that I was not
 aware of it but I
 will state to the Sen
 ator now that I do
 not think it was though
 it might have been for
 the reason he assigns be
 cause from the very organization
 of our govern mcnt wc
 have had iaws on our
 statute book against kidnappmg Kidnapping
 has ever been ail offense
 in Kentucky We passed a
 lavvr I think as early
 as 1800 and do not
 doubt we incorporated It into
 our code of laws from
 Vir einia for 1 suppose
 she had laws on the
 subject I have not examined
 Our Governor then could not
 have refused because kidnapping was
 not an has been from
 the organization 0 Kentucky If
 our Governor did refuse he
 did wrong lieve it is
 a principle well established in
 law as well as in
 morals that no man can
 adduce a right I know
 that persons havc ih orn
 ano thor s been uniformly
 delivered up of late years
 for of fenscs that are
 not criminal under the statutes
 of Kontucky Mr DOUGLAS Will
 the Senator allow me to
 make an explanation on this
 point Mr WADE Yes sir
 Mr DOUGLAS 1 have heard
 a great deal of crimination
 and recrimination upon this question
 of Governors of States refusing
 to deliver up per sons
 where the offense charged was
 not criminal in the State
 in which the offender was
 found I ground that the
 oflönses charged were not crim
 Inal in the States where
 the offenders were found Since
 then it has occurred in
 other States It has been
 the subject of crimination and
 recrimination My own opinion is
 that the practice initiated by
 Virginia and followed bv the
 other States IS wrong but
 I do not think it
 forms proper sub ject ot
 crimination on the slavery question
 Mr MASON If the Senator
 from Ohio will give mc
 the floor an instant I
 shall be indebted to hirn
 very much Mr WADE Certainly
 Mr MASON The case introduced
 by the Sen ator from
 Illinois was as he states
 it and he states it
 correctly I presume but that
 originated before any law had
 been passcd by Congress for
 the sur render of fucitives
 from justice He adduces that
 for the purpose of impressinR
 upon the mind of our
 people that the first delinquency
 under the Constitution arose in
 Virginia Now I remem ber
 that case as a fact
 existing It is an incident
 I do not recollect but
 it was a case according
 to my apprehension in which
 the authorities in Vir crinia
 considered it necessary that the
 law should define what the
 Constitution required and until the
 law did define it the
 authorities of Virginia had a
 difficulty in determining to what
 extent the constitutional oblig ation
 went But understand the Senator
 from Illinois presents it as
 the first case that arose
 as a delinquency of the
 State of Virginia Now sir
 I arn indebted to the
 Senator from Ohio for giving
 me the floor but if
 Sena tors on that side
 of the Chamber or the
 Senator from Illinois Mr DOUGLAS
 supposes that the wrongs the
 injuries tho contumelies the insult
 that for the last twenty
 years have been practiced upon
 the slaveholdino States and those
 which have now brought them
 under the responsibility of dissolving
 this U nion are to
 be appeased by a clamor
 that thc first wron y
 was on our part or
 by a pretension that we
 have sustained no wrongs let
 them have the benefit of
 their aro ument Mr DOUGLAS
 1 have only one word
 to Mr MASON 1 am
 not yet through Let them
 have the benefit of their
 argument These slave holding States
 are capable of determining for
 them selves whether it is
 their interest whether their safety
 whether their honor will permit
 them longer to remain in
 confederation with these non slave
 holding States They will determine
 that for themselves and by
 themselves and it is perfectly
 idle for gentlemen to say
 Present your bill of indictment
 let us kilow wherein we
 have wronged you and it
 is perfectly vain perfectly idle
 for gentlemen to cndeavor to
 convict the slaveholding States of
 havi11T comrnitted the original error
 1 beg I did not
 intend to go into this
 argument the pardon of the
 honorable Senator from Ohio our
 list of grievances and have
 they are mustaken Now Mr
 President perhaps it isthe rmisfor
 tune of my manner to
 appear to be angry or
 ill tempered when I am
 really not so very far
 from If any Senator supposes
 that I have said any
 it thing here or intended
 to bé personally offensive towards
 him I do not so
 intend it only to call
 the attention of the Senator
 from Ohio to what I
 had in hand about what
 is called in the paragraph
 the kidnapping law which iS
 some times called the personal
 liberty law It is this
 published in the Constitution of
 the 19th of Jan uary
 and taken as it is
 said fromnhe Baltimore Sun The
 Ohio House of Representatives by
 a vote of fifty cight
 to thirty one has indefinitely
 postponed a bill to repeal
 the aet to prevent kidnappino
 Under this act says the
 Cleveland Democrat during the Wellington
 res cue trials in the
 United States court in this
 city three per sons one
 a deputy United States Inarshal
 and the other two kentuckians
 acting for the owner were
 arrested and indicted iör penitentiary
 oflénse for arresting a fugitive
 slave under the law of
 Congress foc the rendition of
 fågi It was framed and
 ha s the efféct to
 tives from service nullify the
 fugitive slave law of Congress
 That was the law as
 I understood it that the
 House of Representatives of Ohio
 refused to re peal after
 sending us these resolutions Mr
 WADE Yes sir well Mr
 Presi den t Mr DOUGLAS
 Will the Senator allow me
 one word Mr WADE Yes
 sir Mr I OUGLAS I
 must apologize to the Sen
 ator for interjecting these remarks
 into his speech but I
 have heard these accusations so
 often brought against tbc non
 slaveholding States as the justifi
 cation of the present revolutionary
 movements that I as a
 representative from one of those
 States have been restive under
 them when I knew that
 probably some cases have occurred
 in slavehold mg as well
 as in non slaveho dino
 States and when knew by
 the history of the country
 that the first construction of
 the Constitution this point which
 I believe to have been
 erroneous originated in a slaveholding
 State in the State of
 Virginia to which we look
 with great respect and veneration
 for a true construction of
 the Cone stitution I have
 here the message of General
 Washington and of the Governor
 of Pennsylva nia communicating these
 facts showing that this construction
 was first put upon the
 Constitution by the Governor and
 the attorney general of the
 State of Virginia I admit
 it to be erroneous I
 think it was but it
 shows that it is not
 so clear a case of
 a violation of the Constitution
 for a great many States
 have adopted that construction Mr
 FOSTER Will the Senator from
 Illinois state who was the
 Governor and who was the
 attorney general of Virginia at
 that time Mr DOUGLAS 1
 have not looked through the
 papers to refresh my memory
 and I cannot now recall
 to mind who they were
 The messao e of Washington
 bears date October 27 1791
 and that of the Governor
 of Pennsylvania July 18 I
 have not gone carefully ovcr
 them this 1791 time although
 I have done so on
 a previous occa sion Mr
 BIGLER Randolph was attorney gen
 cra Mr DOUGLAS The Senator
 from Pennsyl vania says Randolph
 was attorney general The Senator
 from Virginia makes an excuse
 in this case because it
 occurred before the law of
 Con gress was passed upon
 the subject That being granted
 it shows that the case
 arose under the Constitution itself
 and hence if it bc
 a violation have taken some
 little pains to trace it
 is not confined to our
 northern States nor to the
 who has kindly given me
 the floor but I confess
 I of the Constitution not
 to surrender up a person
 southern States perhaps thcre havc
 been as many that I
 bel it difficult to repress
 the feelings that in a
 case of this kind the
 first offense occurred cases of
 refusal in the one as
 in the other The belong
 to Ine as a southern
 man when Senators in Virginia
 clearly for hc said that
 under the here tell me
 You are in the wronø
 present your Constitution there was
 no such obliffation and earliest
 case that I have been
 able to find the onc
 that seerns to have been
 the precedent on which bill
 of indictment let us know
 what you complain I if
 the obligation did not exist
 under the Consti tution it
 was incumbent upon Congress to
 im of and upon an
 occasion when the disintegra all
 the others were founded occurred
 I think in 1791 in
 which certain persons were indicted
 in tion of this Union
 is going on by a
 power that pose au obligation
 Hence this covers the whole
 the State of Pennsylvania for
 runnirp away some cannot be
 arrested tlie States declaring them
 case free negroes and being
 found in the State of
 Vir selves absolved from ail
 obligation to any further Now
 I am willing to grant
 that the Governor ginia the
 Governor of Pennsylvania demanded obedience
 to the laws or the
 Constitution of the of Virginia
 made a mistake in construing
 the Con stitution and that
 the Governor of New York
 of tho Governor of Virginia
 their surrender T hc United
 States We are not going
 to presenta bill of indictment
 in any shape or form
 The history following his example
 made a mistake and that
 Governor of Virginia referred the
 casc to the the Governor
 of Kentucky following their exam
 attorney general of that State
 to take his legal of
 the country presents it The
 politicat expen ence of these
 non slaveholding States for roore
 ple made a mistake and
 that the Governor of Ohio
 opinion whether or not it
 v ras his duty to
 surren has made a mistake
 and that many northern and
 If honorable Sen than twenty
 years presents it der persons
 that were charged with offcnses
 that ators supposc that this
 great movement of disrup southern
 States have made a mistake
 in constru were criminal in
 the place where they were
 corn What does all this
 prove n3 itted but were
 not criminal in the State
 of Vir tion which has
 begun and is advancing is
 to be I the subject
 Of crimination gillia The attorney
 general of Virginia gave his

 that we must present 508
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 22
 and recrimination or pretexts for
 dissolving the Union but that
 we ought to give the
 Constitution its true construction I
 am prepared to do it
 but hope we are not
 to bandythese little cases back
 wards and forwards for the
 purpose of sectional irritation Let
 us rather meet the question
 and give the Constitution the
 true construction and allow criminals
 to be surrendered according to
 the law of the State
 where the offense was com
 mitted Mr WADE Mr President
 very hap Mr POWELL Will
 the Senator allow me to
 correct a slight mistakein the
 statement I made Mr WADE
 Yes sir 1 hope you
 cor rect all your mistakes
 Mr POWELL I stated that
 I knew nothing of the
 case in Kentucky referred to
 and that as early as
 1800 Kentucky had passed a
 statute to prevent kidnapping i
 was mistaken in that in
 one year I have here
 a memorandum made by me
 after havinv a controversy with
 the Senator on that point
 before and find that on
 Decem ber 19 1801 the
 Legislature of Kentucky passed a
 law punishing any person who
 shall be guil_ty of stealing
 or selling any free person
 for a slave his or
 her aiders abettors or cour
 selors with confinement in the
 penitentiary fora term not less
 than five years nor more
 than ten years said it
 was in 1800 It should
 bc 1801 By the coo
 stitution of Kentucky in 1799
 it was provided that all
 acts in force in Virginia
 of a general nature shall
 be in force in Kcntucky
 until re pealed by the
 General Assembly Hence I in
 ferred that Virginia had laws
 against kidnapping and that they
 had been in force in
 Kentucky from thc organization of
 our State government I re
 gr et on an occasion
 like this to hear Senators
 Indulge in crimination and recrimination
 In the remarks I had
 the honor to make to
 the Senate this morning I
 distinctly said that it was
 not my purpose to criminate
 or recriminate I merely assigned
 the grievances under which we
 labored to show that our
 people did have just cause
 of apprehension and that those
 grievances properly required constitutional guarantees
 Mr WADE I havc not
 criminated or recrim inated but
 as Senators had alluded to
 great de linquencies of constitutional
 duty in the State that
 I represent I supposed it
 was very proper that I
 should correct those that I
 thought had fallen into an
 error on that subject Sir
 I stand here to defend
 the State of Ohio against
 any charge of delinquency in
 her constitutional duty anywhere I
 am exceedin Yl y happy
 to find that after more
 than one montii s deliberation
 after the question had been
 agitated here whether she had
 been guilty anywhere of any
 coming short of her whole
 duty to the Union the
 Senator has gone back again
 upon the onc old specification
 that he made before l
 he Senn tor from Virginia
 also has brought forward a
 like case and now what
 does it all turn out
 to be Why sir if
 tbcrc is any error comnlitted
 by the Governor of Ohio
 he has the merit at
 all events of havin grounded
 it was right or wrong
 I only say that this
 isa vexed law question that
 has been decided in different
 ways in different States from
 the time the Con stitution
 was framed until now and
 is not settled toeday Why
 therefore is thisaecu sation brought
 up and poured on our
 heads constantly as being a
 great delinquency of our people
 and our State Sir you
 are hard run foraccusations or
 you would have cited some
 new specification Mr MASON Will
 the Senator allow me to
 vindicate Virginia Mr WADE Yes
 sir I hope you will
 be a ble to do
 so Mr MASON I wish
 to vindicate Virginia from the
 suggestion made by the Senator
 from illi I know the
 casc to which he refers
 but I nms have not
 read it I know it
 was a case that arose
 before any law had been
 passed by Congress on the
 subject Now the opinion of
 the attorney I general places
 it upon this ground as
 shown by I the opinion
 no man can be arrested
 in Virginia or in any
 other State no coercion can
 be placed upon his person
 unless it is authorized by
 law Everybody knows that That
 is the case in the
 Senator s own State The
 attorney general of Virginia said
 there was no law by
 which the State could place
 its hand upon the person
 for the pur pose of
 surrendering him In the opinion
 given by the attorney general
 as lawyers are very apt
 to do he discussed other
 questions as to whether it
 would or would not be
 within the contempla tion of
 the Constitution His advice to
 the Gov ernor of Virginia
 that the man could not
 be de livered up was
 placed distinctly and solely upon
 the ground that there was
 no law in Virginia and
 no law of the United
 States by which they could
 arrest the person His language
 is this There must be
 a legal control over the
 persons de manded before they
 can be delivered or removed
 T bat delivery ought not
 to be acquired by any
 force not specified and delegated
 by positivc law Neither the
 constitution them direct the mode
 or delegate an authority by
 which the magistracy of this
 State can acquire such a
 control It theretOre can only
 be acquired by force And
 that such an exercise of
 undelegated power over the liberties
 of freenlen would not be
 justifiable I am sure need
 not add It is therefore
 my opinion that the directions
 of the General Government under
 which the Governor ot Penn
 sylvania has Inade a demand
 Or the delivery and removal
 of the persons mentioned in
 his letter cannot be complied
 with by the Governor of
 this State without some provis
 ions by law to enable
 it to do so That
 is the gist of the
 opinion Mr WADE That is
 precisely tbe ground upon which
 I suppose Governor Dennison placed
 it There was no law
 making the offense crim inal
 in his own State and
 it was not one of
 those offenses that was cognizable
 as an offense at com
 mon law Mr MASON If
 the Senator will indulge me
 I beg his pardon for
 again interrupting him it was
 placed on no such ground
 that there was no law
 making that an offensc in
 the limits of Virginia It
 was placed distinctly on the
 ground that there was no
 law authorizing the arrest of
 the person to use force
 Mr GRIMES Mr President 1
 think it very upon decisions
 madc by old Virginia herself
 and desirable that the question
 of fact should be de

 the Senator from Iowa that
 the Senate do now adjourn

 THE JOURNAL Mr SICKLES 1
 rise to a question of
 priv I desire to make
 a motion to correct the
 Journal of yesterday On yesterday
 while the report of the
 select committee of thirty three
 was under consideration as a
 special order moved an amendment
 in the nature ofa substitute
 being in substance the proposition
 known as the Crit tenden
 compromise To enable me to
 make that motion I will
 explain that by the courtesy
 ofa gentleman upon the ot
 her side of the House
 who had made a motion
 that the House adjourn and
 who at my request withdrew
 his motion I rose was
 recognized by the Speaker made
 my motion and sent my
 amendment to the Clerk s
 desk I was under the
 impression and that was the
 im pression of gentlemen round
 me that the motion was
 legitimately in order and had
 been received by the Speaker
 I thereupon relinquished the floor
 which was resumed by the
 gentleman from Maryland Mr HARRIS
 who renewed the mo tion
 that the House adjourn The
 motion was put by the
 Speaker and the House adjourned
 Afterwards the paper was brought
 back to m desk by
 the page who had taken
 It to the Clerk s
 desk I think therefore that
 inasmuch as the Journal omits
 all mention of the proceeding
 and inasmuch as the amendment
 was offered ata proper yet
 her representativcs stand f jrth
 here and ac termined between
 the Senator from Virginia and
 time when 1 had the
 floor regularly and as it
 W the Senator from Ohio
 and I therefore move that
 was an amendment legitimately in
 order it ought cuse us
 of some great constitutional delinquency
 They tell us that the
 Union is about to be
 broken the Senate do now
 adjourn to appcaron the Tournal
 If any question of order
 up and destroyed and that
 it depends upon us Mr
 WADE Ido not care just
 as you please is intended
 to be made upon the
 admissibility of to say whether
 it shall stand or fall
 they can do Mr HALE
 I want to inquire as
 a matter Of the amendment
 that can only be properly
 done nothing about it You
 that seek to overturn practice
 whether if the Senate adjourns
 in that when the amendment
 is upon the record as
 in the the institutions of
 your country you who tell
 condition the Senator from Ohio
 or the Senator possession of
 the House I make the
 motion to us you are
 about to rebel against its
 constituted from New Hampshire is
 entitled to thc floor amend
 the Journal and the House
 can dispose authorities and wage
 war upon us ought to
 be gave way as a
 matter of courtesy to the
 Senator of it as they
 may see proper able to
 specify and tell us wherein
 we have com from Ohio
 but he let in all
 the other side after i
 The SPEAKER The Chair desires
 to state mitted an offense
 that is to be visited
 by these that Laughter i
 upon this subject as the
 reason for the omission consequences
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr POLK
 in of the proceeding to
 which the gentleman refers The
 Senator from Virginia tells us
 he will not the chair
 The Chair will state to
 the Senator i from the
 Journal that the floor was
 assigned to specify at all
 that it is a course
 of events that has from
 New Hampshire that in his
 opinion the the gentleman from
 Ohio Mr B NGHAM who
 been accumulating for twenty or
 thirty years Senator from Ohio
 will be entitled to the
 floor Why is it brought
 up now all at once
 for the first Mr BIGLER
 Before the motion to adjourn
 and for that purpose alone
 The gentleman from time Why
 does he not find something
 else to is put I
 desire to suggest that there
 is some New York could
 therefore not take the floor
 for accuse the free States
 of When he makes his
 i executive business that should
 be disposed of the purpose
 of offering an amendment while
 specification we see how it
 turns out This I and
 which will take but a
 few minutes Oh i under
 the rules of the House
 the gentleman from believe is
 the third time that the
 Senator from no They are
 not contested cases I there
 Ohio wras entitled to the
 floor Kentucky has accused Ohio
 and when I have fore
 move that the Senate proceed
 to the consider Mr SICKLES
 A single word upon that
 asked for specifications he has
 gone back to ade ation
 of executive business linquency of
 Governor Dennison and it turns
 out The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question I the floor in
 debate That is undoubtedly a
 ccu that Governor Dennison if
 he I ras erred at
 all will first be put
 on the motion to adjourn
 has erred in company of
 which neither of the Sen
 Me PilGLER hope we shall
 have an exec i the
 floor which was assigned to
 the ators should corn l
 fzun Now sir Ido Klot
 pro utive session from Maryland
 Mr HARRIS who moved an
 pose to say this decision
 of Governor Dennison The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question II adjournment
 But the gentleman from Maryland
 1861 at mv request withdrew
 temporarily the motion to adjourn
 and yielded to me to
 enable me to make a
 motion which I stated would
 not lead to debate or
 call for a vote that
 evening I he gen tleman
 from Maryland clearly and distinctly
 re linquished the floor to
 me and I was recognized
 by the Speaker No objection
 was offered by the gentleman
 from Ohio or by any
 other gentle man In my
 place I offered the amendment
 There was no point of
 order raised upon it was
 not ruled out of order
 by the Speaker upon any
 objection made and I insist
 that under the rules of
 the House and I call
 special attention If to the
 43d rule my amendment was
 in order the gentleman from
 Ohio had claimed the floor
 or the gentleman from Maryland
 had not relin quishcd it
 to me I could not
 have offered it But the
 gentleman from Ohio did not
 claim it and no objection
 was made on the part
 of the gentleman from Maryland
 who courteously ex tended the
 floor to me Mr GROW
 The gentleman from Ohio ex
 pressly yielded the floor for
 a motion to adjourn and
 for no other purpose Mr
 SICKLES That may be true
 but nev ertheless it does
 not alter the state of
 the case Mr GROW Yes
 it does Mr RUST What
 is the question before the
 House The SPEAKER If the
 gentleman from New York insists
 on his pointof order the
 Chair feels constrained to overrule
 it Mr R UST Does
 the gentleman from New York
 take an appeal from the
 decision of the Chair If
 he does not then I
 object to further debate Mr
 SICKLES My motion is and
 that is the question now
 before the House to correct
 the Journal Is it in
 order for me to move
 to correct the Journal The
 SPEAKER It is Mr SICKLES
 I supposed so and I
 have therefore submitted a motion
 for the correction of the
 Journal I move to correct
 the Journal so that it
 will show the proceedings I
 have stated The question was
 t akeri on Mr SICKLES
 mo tion and it was
 disagreed to RESOLUTIONS OF DELAWARE

 at the proper time I
 troubles will move them as

 report of the select committee
 of thirty three which is
 now the special order before

 presume there will be no
 objection to the resolutions being
 received laid upon the table
 and ordered to be printed

 any reason for having them
 read as every member of
 the House is already acquainted
 with them Mr HARRIS ofM4ryland
 1 do not object to
 that Mr BURNETT Are the

 Only by unanimous con sent
 Mr BURNETT Then object to
 their re ception and call
 for the regular order of

 Maryland my friend will withdraw
 his objection and let the

 too late The gen tleman
 from Maryland got the floor
 and had introduced the resolutions
 before objection was made CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE Mr BURNETT I do
 not cure particulaäy lllin case

 about this matter but my

 object to the rules being
 broken by publicly present ng

 SERVICE IN SECEDING STATES Mr
 COLFAX 1 am instructed by
 the Com mittee on the
 Post Oflice and Post Roads
 to report back the bill
 introduced by myself yesterday in
 relation to the postal service
 with the recom mendation that
 It do pass The Clerk
 will read it as I
 propose unless debate is desired
 on it to put it
 on its i assacye at
 this time The bill was
 read in extenso It provides
 that VVhcreas in several States
 of the Union the judges
 dis trict attornevs and marshals
 cornmissioned by the Gov crnmentof
 the United States tor said
 States have resigned their offices
 aud it appears impracticable it
 consequence of revolutionary proeeedings therein
 to fill the vacancies thus
 created arid whcrcas the Govcrnrnent
 of the United States is
 thus without any means of
 collecting or enforcing in such
 States the payment of the
 postal revenues from the officers
 collecting the satuc or of
 punishing violations of the postal
 laws committed by robberies of
 the mails or otherwise or
 of enforcing the perfOrmance of
 mail con tracts I herefore
 Be it enacted That in
 all States which are or
 may here after be situated
 as above the Posttnaster General
 is hereby directed to discontinue
 the postal service for such
 period of time as in
 his judgment the public interest
 may require and shall report
 his action to Congress Mr
 PHELPS Has that bill been
 printed The SPEAKER It has
 not It has just been
 reported Mr COLFAX I enter
 the usual motion to recommit
 the bill Mr Speaker I
 will make a few remarks
 in regard to this subject
 We should not have rec
 ommended the suspension of the
 postal service in rying the
 mails in those States may
 of courge hold us to
 the lettcr of our if
 hey choose they can refuge
 toy perform their part Of
 it and there is no
 legal remedy to cornpel lh
 this condition Of to perform
 their contract affan s it
 becomes as it seerns t
 o me the impefa tive
 duty of the Government if
 there be no mezins for
 protecting its postal service to
 discontinue that service 1 stated
 yesterday that I would yield
 to the gentleman from North
 Carolina Mr BRANCH If he
 desired to speak on this
 subject and I state to
 him now if he or
 his friends are not pepared
 to vote on the bill
 at this time I will
 agree to a poStponement of
 its further consideration for a
 few da s if they
 will name the time Mr
 BHELPS 1 desire that the
 bill may be printed before
 it is called up for
 action Mr BRANCH I stated
 yesterday when I moved the
 reference of this bill to
 the select com mittee of
 five that my reason for
 doing so was that subjects
 of a similar character were
 then I pending before that
 committee There is no more
 reason looking to the action
 of that committee why we
 should be prepared or why
 I should be prepared to
 speak or act on this
 bill than there was yesterday
 I therefore do not desire
 to act on it or
 to discuss it to day
 If however it shdll be
 postponed to some future day
 may desire to discuss it
 I do not now mean
 either to discuss or to
 act on this bill if
 I can avoid it but
 I will however avail myself
 of tho courtesy tendered to
 me by the honorable gentleman
 from Indiana i so far
 ns to submit an amendment
 in the nature of a
 substitute for the bill which
 he has reported and on
 which desire to vote if
 his bill shall ever come
 up for action It is
 the only extent to which
 I propose to avail myself
 of thecourtesy tendered to me
 by the chairman of the
 Committee on the Post Office
 and Post Roads Mr COLFAX
 In answer to the gentleman
 I desire to say this
 if the committee of five
 are investigating this matterÄt has
 not been especially referred to
 them I have no objection
 to their ex amining it
 But sir the postal system
 of the ountry is placed
 by OLU rulcs under the
 super vision of the Committee
 on the Post Office and
 Post Roads We have considered
 this matter and felt ib
 to be our duty to
 move Gn the manner I
 have indicated If the gentleman
 from North Carolina bc not
 prepared now to name the
 time when he will be
 ready to vote on this
 bill I must insist on
 calling for theprevious question on
 the passage of the bill
 I am perfectly willing that
 the amendment of the gentleman
 shall be read but avthe
 same time I cannot waive
 my motion to recommit to
 permit his amendment to come
 in I cannot for one
 reccvnize as truc what has
 been held in regard to
 seceding States being out of
 the Union The bill is
 not placed upon that ground
 I stated at the outset
 that if the United States
 courts had been allowed to
 remain in ex istence in
 the seceding States ewe would
 not have felt it to
 be our duty to report
 this bill Mr BRANCH 1
 hope the Indiana will hear
 my proposed amendment read He
 will find it so relevant
 to the measure pro posed
 by him and indeed it
 only differs by making the
 provision broader and covering a
 little more ground lhat he
 will not object to it
 The President of the United
 States has communicated to Congress
 that owing to the fact
 that we have no Federal
 offcers in at least one
 State of the Union that
 he is unable to execute
 the lawsof the United States
 The whole subject matter of
 that mes sage has been
 referred By the House to
 the select i he message
 which committee of five members
 the President conununicated to us
 is not that we are
 unable solely to execute the
 post offce laws but that
 all the laws of the
 United States in one of
 the seceding States of the
 Union South Caro the States
 called the seceding States if
 the Uni lina are in
 the same condition so fäu
 as their ted States courts
 had been allowed to remain
 in execution goes as the
 post office laws NOW the
 gentleman from Indiana proposes to
 select out tact L üt
 the condition of our postal
 service in those States now
 is this the people there
 are one class of laws
 one branch only of the
 public privileged if they choose
 to open the mails pub
 licly to rifle them to
 destroy them and there is
 no method provided under the
 law by which they can
 be brought to justice as
 such offenders must bc tried
 before a United States court
 A The SPEAKER If the
 gentleman from Ken postmaster who
 collects the revenue may refuse
 tuck y insists he is
 entitled to his objection and
 to honor drafts of the
 Department and there is I
 no means by which the
 revenue ean be eolleeted i
 the resolutions cannot be received

 arrangement in regard to that
 in the States which have
 seceded while I propose by
 my substitute t o extend
 the opera tion of the
 bill to all the laws
 of tho United States which
 according to the information given
 to us by the President
 cannot be executed in those

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 22 offce
 laws general and applicable to
 all laws of the United
 States Mr COLFAX I cannot
 consent that this matter shall
 be complicated with other matters
 Gentleman upon that side of
 the House have pro tested
 against coercion There is no
 coercion in this bill It
 is a measure of peace
 and at the same time
 a measure of economy No
 gentle man cari complain of
 this being an attempt to
 coerce a State It simply
 states that inasmuch as the
 postal laws cannot be executed
 the postal service shall in
 such cases be withdrawn Mr
 BRANCH Will the gentleman allowmy
 amendment to be read Mr
 COLFAX I have no objection
 to that Mr PHELPS I
 ask the gentleman from In
 diana to postpone the consideration
 of this bill to some
 other time Mr BRANCH 1
 call for the reading of
 the amendment Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 ask that the Clerk
 also read the original bill
 at the same time JOHN
 JOHNSON Mr VALLANDIGHAM Before thatisdonc
 I desire to have an
 error corrected which occurred yesterday
 It will occupy but a
 moment On my motion the
 Committee of the Whole House
 was discharged from the further
 consideration of House bill No
 263 for the relief of
 John John son and the
 bill was referred to the
 Committee on Indian Affairs By
 mistake the bill was en
 grossed and sent to the
 Senate as passed I am
 sorry that that is not
 the fact I submit the
 fol lowing resolution Rcsolecd That
 the Clerk of this House
 be directed to request the
 Senate to return House bilt
 No 263 entitled An aet
 tor the relief of John
 Johnson of Ohio The rcsolution
 was agreed to POSTAL SERVICE
 AGAIN The original bill offered
 by Mr COLFAX was again
 read l he amcndment offered
 by Mr BRANCH was read
 as follows Strike out an
 after the enacting clause and
 insert To the end that
 all occasion the use of
 force Inay be removed and
 to prevent the breaking out
 of civil wqr pending the
 deliberations of Congress on the
 existing crisis in public alläirs
 be it enacted that the
 laws of the Uni ted
 States be and hereby are
 suspended until the 1st day
 of January 1862 in and
 over those States which have
 here totöre adopted or which
 may previous to said day
 adopt ordinances of secession Mr
 COLFAX Icannotconsenttothatamend ment because if
 South Carolina chooses to send
 members of Congress back here
 I should be glad to
 see them and would throw
 no hindcrance in the way
 of thcir coming Indeed they
 evidently consider themselves zuembers yet
 for at least one of
 them a gentleman whom I
 respect sincerely was up to
 thc 16th of 1110 present
 month frank ing letters under
 the act of Congress that
 power upon members of the
 Congress of the United States
 and 1 do not desire
 to deprive them of that
 ri hl Mr DAWES I
 would inquire of the gentle
 man frorn Indiana whether it
 is his intention when he
 calls up the bill to
 put it under the op
 eration of the previous qucstion
 or does he intend to
 give sorne time for discussion
 Mr COLFAX It is ill
 y intention to put it
 underthe operation of the previous
 question when it is called
 up for passacre Mr DAWES
 1 hope the gentleman will
 re consider that determination The
 bill is of so much
 importance and involves so many
 matters of principle that I
 trust he will at least
 permit some little time for
 its consideration Mr COLFAX only
 say that if the Housc
 does not thirik the bill
 ought to pass in that
 way they can vote down
 the previous question and the
 bill will go over for
 general debate Mr PHELPS would
 suggest to the gentle man
 from Indiana that he do
 not insist that we shall
 proceed to the consideration of
 that bill at I this
 time Let it be printed
 and its consideration postponed until
 some future day It will
 then be under the control
 of the House Mr COLFAX
 The bill is brief and
 every gentlelnan understands it thoroughly
 waited one month after the
 so called act of secession
 was passed ill South Carolina
 supposing that they would inaucrarate
 some postal system of their
 own if they were as
 they claim to be independ
 ent Seeing no such thing
 probable and our postal matters
 being in the condition they
 are I considered it my
 duty to introduce this bill
 Mr BRANCH 1 desire ask
 the gentleman whether the laws
 in reference to the Post
 Ofhce Department and those in
 reference to the collec tion
 of the revenues from postages
 are not the only Federal
 laws in operation in South
 Carolina Mr COLFAX I cannot
 say what laws if any
 are in operation in that
 State Mr BRANCH And whether
 that is not the only
 branch of the service in
 South Carolina to which the
 gentleman s bill is unnecessary
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania 1
 wish to have an amendment
 read which I shall offer
 at I do not know
 whether it will the proper
 time be allowed to be
 printed butl would like to
 have it printed so that
 I can move it as
 a substitute when the time
 arrives Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1
 wish to suggest to my
 friend from Indiana that this
 most cer tainly is an
 improper season to press this
 neas ure upon the attention
 of the House The special
 committee to which all this
 subiect has been re ferred
 as wisely said by the
 gentléman from North Carolina has
 had and has this among
 other sub jects under consideration
 It is certainly a grave
 question whether all the laws
 of the land can be
 constitutionally suspcnded over any portion
 of the land or whether
 any portion of these laws
 can be It is a
 matter suspended and if so
 v rhat portion of grave
 inquiry now whether this is
 as the gen tleman terms
 it a measure of peacc
 or a piece of a
 measure Laughter This is the
 question before the House whether
 it will inure in its
 catholic sense to the correction
 entirely of the abuses or
 the evils under which we
 are suffering or whether it
 is only partial in its
 operation Now it is proper
 that this House should have
 time to consider under the
 benefit of all the lights
 which it proposes to itself
 by virtue of the labors
 the diligence and the application
 of the commit tee and
 to judge and determine whether
 the meas ures proposed in
 one or more of them
 are com petent and applicable
 to the exigency which this
 intended to meet therefore hope
 and hope in view of
 the dangerous crisis in which
 we are in view of
 the revolution into which we
 are pre cipitated that rny
 friend Crorn Indiana will in
 his discretion and wisdom give
 this bill another day r
 consideration Mr COLFAX I will
 now hear the amend ment
 of the gentleman from Pennsylvania
 read The proposed amendment was
 read as follows Be it
 enacted That the President is
 hereby authorized and empowered when
 in his judgment he shall
 deem it necessary to suspend
 ait laws and parts of

 DAVIS of Indiana I desire
 to propound a question Ito
 my colleague I desire to
 know of him whether this
 bill has been recommended by
 the Postmaster General and whether
 it meets with the approbation
 of the Post Offce Depart
 ment Mr COLFAX There is
 no Postmaster Gen eral now
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana Somebody
 is at the head of
 the Post Offce Department and
 I desire to know whether
 it is recommended by that
 De partment Mr HINDMAN I
 desire to know whether the
 late Postmaster General the present
 Secre tary of War approves
 it Mr COLFAX I decline
 to be questioned by the
 gentleman from Arkansas at present
 Mr SHERMAN Is motion to
 recommit pending The SPEAKER There
 is Mr SHERMAN Then 1
 move postpone its consideration one
 week Mr BRANCH How did
 the gentleman get the floor
 to make that motion Mr
 COLFAX 1 yielded to the
 gentleman from Ohio I am
 always willing to carry out
 the wishes of the House
 1 yielded to the gentleman
 from North Carolina and to
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania I
 now yield to the gentleman
 from I will say that
 I am willing to postponea
 Ohio the consideration of this
 bill to a day certein
 Mr PHELPS Postpone it two
 weeks from to day Mr
 HINDMAN Before the votc is
 taken desire to make an
 inquiry of the gentleman from
 Indiana He remarked a while
 ago that to his knowledge
 some of the members of
 Congress from South Carolina were
 franking documents up to the
 16th of the present month
 What is the ground of
 the gentleman s statement Mr
 DAVIS of Indiana If 1
 can get the ear of
 my colleague I desire an
 answer to the ques tion
 I propounded to him a
 moment ago Mr COLFAX 1
 wish first to answer the
 question of the gentleman from
 Arkansas A gentleman informed me
 yesterday that he had received
 a letter postmarked the 16th
 instant that was franked by
 a member of the House
 from South Carolina Mr HINDMAN
 Who was it Mr COLFAX
 I decline answering that ques
 tion but am perfectly convinced
 of its truth Mr DAVIS
 of Indiana I respectfully request
 my colleague to answer the
 question which pro poundcd to
 him u moment ago whether
 this bill has been recommended
 by the Postmaster Gen Mr
 COLFAX I offered the bill
 upon my responsibility as member
 of Congress and as chairman
 of the Committee on the
 Post Office and Post Roads
 Further than that I decline
 answer ing the question of
 my colleague with all respect
 except to say that Mr
 Holt is not responsible for
 the introduction of this bill
 though I hope he will
 approve of it The bill
 is recommended by the Post
 Offcc Committee Mr Speaker I
 have yielded the floor to
 the gentleman from Ohio Mr
 SHERMAN at tho re quest
 of gentlemen upon the other
 side of the House as
 well as upon this to
 move to postpone the consideration
 of this bill until Thursday
 week and to make it
 a special order for that
 day Mr SHERMAN It is
 not necessary to make the
 bill a special order The
 motion to recommit may be
 called up any time during
 the mornin p hour but
 if it be postponed it
 cannot be calleä up until
 the day to which it
 is postponed The motion to
 postpone was agreed to Mr
 PHELPS Let the bill printed
 Mr COLFAX lhave no objection
 to that and to the
 printing of all the amendments
 The bill and amendments were
 ordered to be printed Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE were those ments
 received The SPEAKER No sir
 Mr BRANCH I do not
 think the amend ments ought
 to be printed I think
 it is a very irregular
 proceeding Mr COLFAX If the
 gentleman objects to the printing
 of the amendments let the
 bill alone be printed Mr
 BRANCH I withdraw my objection
 to the printing of the
 amendments Mr GROW 1 take
 it that if the bill
 is printed that is all
 which is necessary There are
 no amendments pendino The SPEAKER
 It was distinctly understood that
 the amendments were not received
 They were only proposed but
 they were all ordered to
 bc printed MAIL IN WASHINGTON
 TERRITORY Mr COLFAX from the
 Committee on the Post Offce
 and Post Roads reported back
 with a recommendation that it
 do pass joint resolution H
 R No 48 in relation
 to mail service in Wash
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE ington
 Territorys and asked that the
 same be put upon its
 passage The iomt resolution was
 read Mr COLFAX Mr Speaker
 this reso lution is explained
 I think no member will
 obiect to it At the
 last session of Congress a
 law was passed authorizing the
 withdrawal of the steam ship
 service between San Francisco and
 Olympia in Washington Territory performed
 semi month ly at 122
 500 a year and substituting
 a daily service in four
 horse coaches through the inte
 rior to the samc points
 at 90 000 a year
 This effected a saving of
 32 500 and gave also
 daily service instead of semi
 monthly through the in terior
 of California Oreeon and Washington
 Territory to Olympia its capital
 and center We have now
 a weekly service by steamer
 through Puget Sound Admiralty Inlet
 and the Straits of Fuca
 from Olympia via Steilacoom Seattle
 Port Madison Port Ludlow Port
 Town send New Dungeness Whatcom
 and Fort Bel lingham to
 Semiahmoo touching also at Victo
 ria on Vancouver s Island
 and Camp Pickett on San
 Juan Island about two hundred
 and fifty miles of inland
 navigation on that remarkable in
 land sea at a cost
 of per year The proposition
 now is to appropriate a
 por tion of the amount
 saved by the retrenchment effected
 by the substitution of the
 inland for the steamship service
 to the improvement of the
 interior service in Washington Territory
 from weekly to semi weekly
 at pro rata increase of
 pay a service which reaches
 all our forts on that
 exposed frontier lying opposite to
 the island of Sal Juan
 about which we have at
 present some diffculty with Great
 Britain who claims it and
 the only service by which
 we can reach those r
 f he Committee on the
 Post Office and forts Post
 Roads unanimously recommend the passa
 re If any gentleman desires
 fur of the resolution ther
 information on the subject I
 presunu the Delegatc from Washington
 I erritory can rive it
 if not 1 will niove
 the previous question Mr PHELPS
 I would inquire of the
 gentle man from Indiana when
 this contract will expire in
 the Territory of Washington Mr
 COLFAX I he regular contract
 Mr PHELPS Yes sir Mr
 COLFAX In less than two
 years from this time Mr
 PHELPS Why then do the
 commit tee propose to make
 this an exception to all
 other postal contracts by prolonging
 the term of ser vice
 for twro years My impression
 is that the contract will
 expire one year from the
 30th of June next In
 other words this is an
 extension of a contract made
 under the former high prices
 when perhaps the prices may
 be reduced Why is this
 contract to be exernpted from
 the rule applied to ail
 other contracts and to be
 ex tended Mr COLFAX This
 was originally a con Besides
 that the putting on gressional
 contract of additional steamships making
 two trips per week involves
 of course a great expense
 to the contractors Mr PHELPS
 I understand the proposition is
 to discontinue the steamship service
 and have a land one
 Mr COLFAX My friend is
 mistaken It enlarges the steamship
 service from weekly to semi
 weekly co mm unicating on
 each side of Puget Sound
 and the upper part of
 the Straits of Fuca Mr
 PHELPS Why then extend it
 beyond the ordinary contracts Mr
 COLFAX Because it involves the
 ex pense of additional steamers
 and a contractor might object
 to this unless he had
 a contract for a term
 of years Mr PHELPS Has
 not the Postmaster Gen cral
 a right to increase the
 service on paying an increased
 ro rata Mr COIFAX The
 stated as undersland it to
 the Delegate from Wash ington
 Territory that he had no
 objection to ex tending this
 contract if Congress saw fit
 to order it but being
 a congressional contract he did
 not see fit to increase
 the service except by the
 action of Congress Mr STEVENS
 of Washington state to the
 gentleman from Missouri that I
 had an interview with the
 Postmaster General who said to
 me t_hat he had no
 objection to have this ser
 I will state furthermore that
 when the service original service
 was ordered it was put
 on a par ity with
 ocean service bids for a
 ten years con tract having
 been invited The Postmaster Gen
 eral made the contract for
 four years intimating that he
 would renew it Thc contractors
 pur chased a suitable steamer
 and entered on the performance
 of the service The compensation
 has been low but the
 service has been performed though
 with diffculty from the fact
 that it is in a
 country where there are neither
 founderies nor In order now
 to change it into a
 ship yards semi weekly service
 it is necessary as the
 chair man of the Post
 Office Committee has observed to
 put on another steamer at
 considerable expense The service is
 certainly a verv important one
 and it is but reasonable
 that it should be asked
 for seeing that we have
 been deprived of the ad
 ditional service through Puget Sound
 Mr PHELPS I will say
 to thegentlemenfrom Indiana and Washington
 Territory that arn willing the
 increased service should be extended
 during the continuance of the
 present contract But we have
 heard much of the high
 prices of contracts in these
 distant Territories and we find
 1 think that they are
 being gradually reduced therefore that
 when this contractexpires it should
 be thrown open to public
 competition when an tl le
 other mail routes in that
 l erritory be also open
 to public competition I think
 therefore that if it is
 dcsired to increase service on
 this route the best policy
 would be to increase it
 during the continuance ofthe present
 contract and no longer When
 proposals are invited for mail
 service in Washington Territory they
 may be invited not only
 for other c ntracts but
 for this one sire therefore
 to submit an amendment to
 con fine this increased service
 to the continuance of If
 I urn correctly informed the
 present contract that contract expires
 in a year from the
 30th of June next Mr
 COLFAX This year 1 am
 informed this particular contract expires
 Mt PHELPS Are the general
 lettings for the Territory of
 Washington to bc made this
 year Mr STEVENS of Washington
 The con tracts for the
 other routes do not expire
 till the 30th of June
 1862 but this one expires
 June 1861 Mr PHELPS Thcn
 1 am willing that this
 incrcascd service shall continue till
 the other con tracts expire
 and then let all be
 advertised for at once Mr
 COLFAX I consent that the
 amendment shall come in although
 I shall vote against it
 I move that Mr PHELPS
 very well amendment Mr COLFAX
 The recommendation of the Post
 Office Committee is based among
 other things on a joint
 resolution of the Territorial Legislature
 of Washington Territory I think
 myself there is a very
 grave doubt as to whether
 if the amendment of the
 gentleman from Mis souri prevails
 the contractor will be willing
 to build an additional steamer
 for the purpose of carrying
 the mail a single year
 But will let the amendment
 be offered and now I
 move the previous question The
 previous question was seconded and
 the main question ordered and
 under its operation the amendment
 was agreed to and the
 joint res olution read the
 third time and passed Mr
 COLFAX moved to reconsider the
 vote by which the joint
 resolution was passed and also
 movdd to lay the motion
 to reconsider on the table
 The latter motion was agreed
 to TELEGRAPH TO THE PACIFIC
 Mr COLFAX 1 am instructed
 bythe Com mittee on the
 Post Offce and Post Roads
 to re port back House
 bill No 891 supplementary to
 An act to facilitate communication
 between the Atlantic and Pacific
 States by electric telegraph with
 a recommendation that the second
 and fourth I sections shall
 be stricken out and the
 bill as amended passed STATE

 Nag that the special order

 from hidi ana labors under

 it The gentleman from Ohio
 Mr BINGHAM is en titled
 to the floor Mr WINSLOW
 Before the gen tleman from
 Ohio proceeds let me make
 an inquiry of the Chair
 When this debate sprung up
 yesterday nothing was read and
 the debate commenced I presume
 on the report of the
 committee would like to know
 now from the Chair whatis
 the distinct proposition before the
 House There are no less
 than four joint resolutions before
 the body and it is
 desirable we should know which
 is the distinct one to
 bc voted on first Mr
 PHELPS suppose the one proposing
 I an amendment to the
 Constitution The SPEAKER The chairman
 of the com mittec will
 indicate which will have the
 prece I dence Mr CORWIN
 I am not particularly con
 cerned as to the priority
 of any of the resolutions
 recommended i consider the whole
 subject as vice put on
 the same footing with the
 originai Mr COLFAX I understood
 that the order in I
 being before the House Mr
 WINSLOW The whole subject is
 be fore the House so
 far as the range of
 debate is concerned But all
 the bills and amendments can
 not be before the House
 at the same time for
 its action On which of
 them does the chairman of
 the committee propose first to
 take the vote ofthe House
 Mr CORWIN I suppose the
 first resolution proposed by the
 committee should be taken up
 and disposed of and so
 consecutively in tho order in
 which the stand on the
 report Mr WINÅLOW The first
 resolution is one reported for
 the action of the committee
 sume the Chair does not
 mean that Mr CORWIN No
 1 find the olution was
 put there by a mistake
 of the Clerk It is
 not before the House Mr
 WINSLOW There is series of
 seven I ask for a
 divis resolutions before the House
 ion of the question upon
 them The SPEAKER The Chair
 supposes that that will be
 in order after the previous
 question is demanded Mr WINSLOW

 notice now of my desire
 to have a separate vote
 on these resolutions i Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE laskwhetherany substitute offered
 to the resolutions reported by

 New York The SPEAKER tempore
 The Chair de cides that
 the objection comes too late
 The gen tleman from Viéginia
 had yielded the floor and
 the gentleman from New York
 offered his amend ment before
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania objected
 Mr GROW I appeal from
 the decision of the Chair
 Mr SICKLES I have the
 floor and the gen tleman
 from Pennsylvania cannot take it
 from me Mr GROW I
 can take the floor from
 any member upon a uestion
 of order The Chair has
 assigned the floor to the
 gentleman from New York and
 it can not be taken
 from him Mr GROW 1
 have appealed from the ion
 of the Chair I can
 take the floor för that
 purpose The SPEAKER pro tempore
 The Chair will state that
 the gentleman from Virginia yielded
 the floor and it was
 assigned to the gentleman from
 New York who is now
 entitled to it Mr GROW
 I objected to its being
 yielded Mr SICKLES I rise
 to a point of order
 Mr GROW have raised one
 point of order which is
 as much as can be
 entertained at one time Mr
 SICKLES My point of order
 is that the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania has made no point
 of order When the Speaker
 assigns u gentleman the floor
 the point that he is
 entitled to the floor is
 a matter of fact and
 not a point of order
 The act of the Speaker
 in assigning a gentleman the
 floor is a declaration of
 fact and not a decision
 I which is subject to
 an appeal to the House
 You I can appeal from
 a decision of thc Speaker
 but you cannot appeal from
 a declaration of fact I
 submit therefore that the gentleman
 has not raised question of
 order nor has he raised
 any ap cal which can
 be entertained GROW I have
 raised a question of order
 and I ask the Chair
 to decide it by putting
 the question to the House
 Mr SICKLES 1 insist that
 the gentleman has not raised
 any point of order which
 can be entertained Mr CLEMENS
 If is to come out
 of my lime I must
 resume the floor Mr GROW
 The first question is upon
 the appeal I have taken
 from the decision of the
 Chair Mr SICKLES I repeat
 that it is not an
 ap pealable question The SPEAKER
 tempore The gentleman a gentleman
 has the floor and another
 gentleman asks him to yield
 it it is not time
 to object until we can
 know for what purpose he
 asks it I objected to
 the gentleman from Virginia yielding
 the floor as soon as
 the gentleman from New York
 had announced that his purpose
 was to offer an amendment
 The SPEAKER pro tempore The
 Chair will state that the
 gentleman from Virginia yielded the
 floor unconditionally so far as
 the Chair can know The
 Chair then assigned the floor
 to the gentleman from New
 York Mr GROW And I
 objected as soon as the
 gentleman from New York announced
 what his P udose was
 r SICKLES The objection of
 the gentle man from Pennsylvania
 was not made until after
 I had obtained the floor
 and offered my amend ment
 Mr CLEMENS 1 must insist
 upon my right to the
 floor Mr GROW Very well
 I will withdraw my question
 of order if the gentleman
 from Virginia will go on
 with his remarks The SPEAKER
 pro tenpore Does the gen
 tleman from Pennsylvania withdraw his
 appeal Mr GROW Certainly if
 the gentleman from Virginia is
 goino on with his remarks
 I do Mr BURNETT desire
 to inquire before the gentleman
 from Virginia proceeds whether the
 amendment of the gentleman from
 New York has been received
 Mr GROW I take it
 that the amendment iF not
 received The SPEAKER pro tempore
 The Chair de cides that
 tho amendment is before the
 House Mr GROW Then the
 gentleman from Vir ginia cannot
 resume the floor until my
 point 00 order has been
 decided The SPEAKER pro tempore
 The Chair de cides that
 the gentleman s objection carne
 too late Mr GROW 1
 appeal from the decision Mr
 SICKLES 1 insist that the
 gentleman from Virginia is entitled
 to the floov and shall
 be permitted to proceed Mr
 CLEMENS I desire to go
 on with my remarks I
 hope the gentleman will give
 me my rights as a
 member of this House Mr
 GROW Certainly the gentleman shall
 have his rights but I
 also wish to clailn my
 right to appeal from the
 decision of the Chair The
 SPEAKER tempore The gentleman from
 Pennsylvania could not take the
 floor from the gentleman from
 Virginia Mr GROW I have
 the right to take the
 floor at any time upon
 a question of order The
 SPEAKER pro tempore The Chair
 will put the question to
 the House Mr BURCH 1
 hope this will not coma
 out of the time of
 the gentleman from Virginia The
 SPEAKER pro It will not
 Mr SHERMAN suggest to the
 gen tleman from Ne w
 York that he will have
 ample opportunity to offer his
 amendment in future Mr SICKLES
 Why not let it in
 now Mr GROW I insist
 upon my question of order
 I have no objection to
 the gentleman offer ing his
 amendment at the proper time
 but it has not been
 properly received now and I
 appeal from the decision of
 the Chair Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois I hope the Chair
 will put the question and
 have it decided Mr WINSLOW
 I wish to ask vhetherit
 was not the understanding that
 gen tlemen representing thc minority
 of the committee were to
 have the opportunity of presenting
 their propositions Mr GROW Certainly
 and every gentleman suppose will
 have an opportunity but thc
 gen tleman from New York
 is not a member of
 the committee at all Mr
 SICKLES The country is calling
 upon us to vote upon
 this proposition in this House
 Millions of people are looking
 to us Shouts of Order

 is that when which the

 The gentleman yield the floor

 sir having in connec preseutcd
 to the tion with another
 gentlcrnan House the views of
 a minority of the coun
 nitt ec of thirty three
 I feel it my duty
 to stand up herc and
 dcfcnd thc positions in that
 ronort At the proper timc
 I shall propose as a
 substi tute for the propos
 tic os now before the
 House thc following resolution Resolee
 d l hat the provisions
 of the Constitution are ample
 tor the preservation of the
 Union and the protection of
 all the material interests of
 the country that it needs
 to be obeyed rather than
 amended and our cxtrieation fronn
 present difficulties is to Oe
 looked tar in eflörts to
 preserve and protect the public
 property and eatörce the laws
 rather than in new guarantees
 for particular interests or cmnpro
 mises or concessions to unreasonable
 detnands This resolution expresses t
 he conclusion of the small
 minority of the committee to
 which i be long The
 majority of the committee have
 re ported various propositions but
 only four of them contemplate
 definite action A II of
 these propo sitions IVIr Speaker
 although not sanctioned at the
 final adoption of the report
 were adopted singly during the
 sessions of the committee do
 not wish to place any
 one in a false position
 by saying that these propositions
 are the opinion of the
 majority of the select committee
 They were adopted as I
 have already stated one by
 one by a majority then
 present as they came up
 for consideration Now sir the
 propositions looking to definite action
 report ed from tho select
 committee are a joint resolution
 to amend the Constitution of
 the United States an act
 for the adrnission of New
 i i Mexico into the
 Union as a State and
 an amend i ment to
 the fugitive slave law and
 the law relating to fugitives
 from justice Those propositions have
 been reported Wilh sundry resolutions
 expressive 33 THURSDAY JANUARY 24
 1861 merely of the opinions
 of mernbers Having been unable
 to concur in any one
 of these propositions and not
 wishing to be regarded as
 an ultra or un reasonable
 man I wish at this
 tirnc to state the reasons
 why I could not concur
 with the measures here proposed
 for the consideration of the
 House I wrill take the
 propositions in their order and
 if I shall succeed in
 showing that all of the
 com plaints which the propositions
 now offered are Intended to
 remedy are groundless and that
 their adoption will only subject
 the people of the North
 to further derision and contempt
 then sir I shall have
 accomplished ali that I desire
 think I shall be enabled
 to show very Clearly to
 the members of this House
 that the measures now submitted
 are wholly powerless for good
 even if they were all
 to be adopted I have
 been a patient attendant on
 all the sittings of this
 committee and it has been
 my desire to learn what
 werc the troubles what the
 difficulties what the grievances which
 were complained of and which
 required the remedial action of
 Con gress Although no two
 members could concur exactly in
 regard to the grievances complained
 of yet upon beint r
 grouped together they tunount to
 about this first it is
 complained that thc North does
 not faithfully execute the fugitive
 slave law second it is
 complained that some of the
 non slaveholding States have passed
 personal liberty bills third it
 is complained on thc part
 of tho South that the
 people of thc southern States
 are deprived of equal rights
 with the people of the
 North in the erritorics of
 thc United States and it
 is alleged also as a
 complaint against the North that
 fugitives from justice are not
 delivered up in accordance with
 our obligations under the Con
 stitution of the United States
 These constitute the principal causes
 of complaint except the fur
 ther one that we have
 elected a President who it
 is claimed is hostile to
 slavery This last is be
 lievcd to bc the occasion
 for existing treason and impcnding
 civil war and as the
 committce pro pose no rémedy
 the minority shall rulc the
 majority justified in saying that
 the measuu cs that they
 do propose will have no
 cffecl towards restoring peace to
 the country Sir it is
 not pretended it has never
 bcen pre tended that tho
 Federal Government has legis to
 tho prejudice of the people
 of thc South it has
 never been said and with
 truth it cannot bc said
 that they have not had
 all their rights in this
 Governrnent Never in a single
 instance can it be maintaiiied
 that Congress has refused to
 pass laws necessary for the
 security of their rights For
 sixty out of seventy two
 years since the Gov ernment
 was formed they have controlled
 thc Federal Government in all
 its departments legis lative exccutuvc
 and judicial They have so
 long been accustomed to regard
 themselves as specially appointed to
 rule this country that they
 have forgotten how to obey
 claiming to be ex clusively
 the ruling class ai d
 grown haughty proud and insolent
 from the posscssion of power
 they cannot brook the idea
 that a man who is
 peculiarly the representative of the
 great labor Ing classes should
 be at the head of
 the cxccu tive department of
 the Government We know full
 well Mr Speaker what will
 If we will yield up
 for all time to restore
 peace come the control of
 the Government to those who
 with small exceptions have ruled
 it heretofore cive them the
 Executive allow them to rctail
 the and dictate legislative and
 judicial departments our foreiffn and
 domestic policy thev will no
 doubt return to their allegiance
 and save the Union ave
 enorrnous and Sn their terms
 of salvaz cannot be acceded
 to l o show tl
 lat they mean to control
 the Government or destroy it
 I beg to go lowino
 extract from a lotter from
 a United States Senator from
 the Statc of Alabama Mr
 CLAY I to friends in
 South Carolina writ ten a
 short time since Ile says
 speaking of the pcople of
 tl i0 North They are
 thc most bitter relentless and
 vindictive enemies Ive have 011
 earth course wo cannot live
 under the sainc Government with
 I these people unless wc
 could control it NEW SERIES
 33 There sir you have
 the conclusion of the Whöle
 matter expressed in concise language
 The whole thing is in
 a nutshell We must cont
 rol the Government or we
 will not live under it
 The question then stares the
 people of the North full
 in the face Will they
 pass their too obedient necks
 beneath the southern yoke or
 will they as sert their
 manhood and refuse to purchase
 either continued union or peace
 at any such price No
 sir let us have disunion
 and if need be civil
 war rather than dishonor The
 first ground of complaint against
 the North for which a
 remedy is sought in the
 disruption of the Union is
 that the people of the
 North do not faithfully execute
 the fugitive slave law Is
 tho complaint true It is
 not That law is executed
 with surprising fidelity Ithat it
 is a most odious law
 to the pcople of the
 North and justly so I
 will not dispute nevertheless it
 is executed with great certainty
 Mr IVERSON in the Senate
 has recently borne testimony in
 regard to the law in
 the following language i Ve
 have a fugitive lave law
 of which the South does
 It is sufficiently guarded to
 aceomplL8h all not complain the
 objects iOr which it was
 designed if thcre was a
 proper public sentirnent in the
 northern States No better fugitive
 slave law could be devised
 by this Congress or any
 other It clothes the judiciary
 and Executive of this Govennnent
 with ample powers to execute
 tbc laws We do not
 corn plain that any Executive
 has ever been derelict in
 his duty in the discharge
 of this law Mr Fillmore
 was President when this law
 was passed and it received
 his sanction and I atn
 ready to say that so
 far as he was concerned
 he carried it out General
 Pierce carried it out and
 the pres ent Exceutivc So
 far as they h_avc the
 power they have done their
 duty faithfully Messrs DOUGLAS and
 PUGH Democratic Sene ators havc
 also borne recent testimony to
 the faithful observance of that
 law Instances where a fugitivc
 has been rescued under it
 are very rare and ten
 northern men are hung without
 judge or jury at thc
 South for the commission of
 no crime to every fugitive
 that is rescued In the
 State of Wisconsin I havc
 known but onc instance where
 a fugitive was attempted to
 be rescued and in that
 case the Government has pursued
 the alleged rescuer with a
 malignity unheard of in a
 civil izcd Govern ment aind
 from inability to pay the
 finc imposed upon him he
 is now wearinø out the
 rein nalÄ t of his
 existence in the common jail
 of the city of Milwaukee
 It is not then Mr
 Speaker tho non execu tion
 of the fugitive slave law
 that is cause foc secession
 BLit sir your committee proposed
 to amend it and I
 may as well here notice
 the proposed amend rilhe design
 of this amendment is to
 make ment the law more
 efficient and at the same
 time render it fess odious
 to the people of the
 North They have succeeded admirably
 in thc former Pass it
 and what hope is there
 left for the colorcd man
 who is claimed as a
 slave The whole power of
 the Govcrnmcnt of the United
 States is to bc in
 voked against him and at
 the sole cxpcnsc of that
 Government which should be a
 shield and pro tection to
 the weak ho is seized
 and t ransported to a
 southern State where after remaining
 per haps in prison for
 six eight or ten months
 he is to have a
 jury trial beforc the Ul
 ited States district judge Not
 a jury trial of the
 vicinao e from wlii ik
 jhc is alleged to have
 escaped but of the vicinage
 of the residencc of the
 judge which 111tty be perhaps
 hundreds of miles froun where
 he was alleged to aavc
 cscapcd If adjudged a free
 man no penalty is imoosed
 upon the man who false
 y claimed hirn anh after
 a loss of Inany months
 t nne perhaps he finally
 has the satisfac tion of
 being returned to the place
 of seizure at thc cxpense
 of the tJnited States They
 have attenoptcd to st_vrar the
 thing over by attaching a
 second section which only authorizes
 the mar shal to call
 for assistance to execute the
 law in I have looked
 casc IIC thinks he shall
 need help at thc prov
 sions of thc old law
 in this regard and i
 find the between that and
 the amendment is about the
 same as between twee dled
 um and tweedledee The idea
 being held out that an
 amendment to the law would
 be made making it more
 acceptable to the people of
 the 514 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 22 North I sought
 in committee to amend this
 amendment so as to give
 the fugitive a trial by
 jury in tho State where
 he was seized Such an
 amendment would be substan tial
 in its character and would
 dispense with personal liberty bills
 but I re ret to
 say it was voted down
 For these reasons I am
 opposed to this amend I
 regard it as no improvement
 on the old ment law
 which God knows is bad
 enough If you will give
 us no amendment which is
 an improvement on the old
 law then let that stand
 as a memorial of the
 barbarous age that passed it
 But Mr Speaker it is
 said that the North has
 passed personal liberty bills which
 givc cause to the Southern
 States to secede The committee
 do not propose any legislative
 action in regard to these
 bilks any further than to
 request the States that have
 passed them to repeal them
 1 am op osed to
 tho resolution reported on this
 subject regard it as an
 unwarrantable interference with I havc
 been pleascd to the rights
 of the States notice that
 the southern gentlemen on this
 com mittee who have joined
 in making reports are very
 careful to sav n othing
 about these personal lib erty
 bills m hcy are too
 smart to put themselves on
 paper as advocating that Congress
 should in terfere with what
 strictly belongs to a State
 They do not oven speak
 of them as grounds of
 com I do not oppose
 this resolution because I plaint
 would recommend to any State
 to pass unconsti tutionul laws
 or laws which will in
 effect impair the rights of
 any State in this Union
 or the citi zens of
 any State but because it
 is the provincc of the
 Slates themselves to judge and
 that with out any outside
 interference as to what they
 owc to their own citizens
 and what to other States
 of thc Confederacy I am
 willing that it should be
 left to the States themselves
 to determine what laws it
 is necessary to pass arid
 what they ought If they
 pass unconstitutional to forbcm to
 pass laws they are mcrely
 as so much blank paper
 I jass unconstitu and can
 harin no one tional laws
 the Constitution itse f provides
 a way to letermine that
 question and it does not
 confer upon Congress the right
 to dccidc what laws are
 constitutional and what are not
 When the con stitutional tribunal
 shall decide what laws arc
 un constitutional I havc no
 doubt that any State the
 Union which has passed such
 laws will repeal then l
 or tnake them conform to
 the Constitution thesc gentlemen of
 the South have been so
 long in the habit of
 controlling the Fed eral Government
 that they now desire to
 go into the States and
 indicate to them what laws
 they must pass and what
 they must not pass And
 thoucrh they ate carcful in
 their reports to say nothing
 in advocacy of tl lis
 idea yet such is showri
 to be their desire by
 the resolutions they report Sir
 it is an interference which
 the States may very properly
 resent have also recommcndcd the
 I he conn tnittee of
 a resolution requesting the southarn
 laws and if necessary to
 States to revise their pass
 laws to protect northern citizens
 from nu b s I
 am opposed to this resolution
 for the same rea son
 thal I refuse to vote
 for the resolution relatino I
 will do no south to
 the personal liberty bills ern
 Stutc the injustice to suppose
 that they have not passed
 thie laws nccessary to protect
 our I the lax vs
 are citizens from the action
 Ots Knobs not executed it
 is because the public sentiment
 there overrides the law and
 it is in vain to
 pass laws or recommend their
 passa re unless there is
 a public sentiment to sustain
 them But the committee have
 not called attention of southern
 States specially to laws which
 arc oppres i had sixty
 Stales in the Union an
 event which Sive to citizens
 of the northern States laws
 in ex islence in several
 Sta tes of the Union
 which au thor the power
 of the Federal courts and
 uell they may be from
 their usurpation of power hereto
 fore Any additional power which
 Congress may propose to confcr
 upon them will not be
 sanc tioned The reason assigned
 for this proposed amendment is
 that the question whether a
 fugi tive should or should
 not be delivered up should
 bc a judicial question and
 that the court should decide
 it in order that there
 may be a uniformity of
 decision upon the subject There
 is now a cause pendincr
 before the Supreme Court of
 the United States involving this
 very question and when decided
 if the court shall decide
 that to be a crime
 under the Constitution which is
 not a crime under thc
 common law or the laws
 of the State where the
 fugitive takes refuge I presume
 the Governors of States will
 conform to that de cision
 I do not feel inclined
 to comment upon this amendment
 at any great lencth but
 I wili particularly call the
 attention of fiawyers to it
 If I am not very
 much mistaken the effect of
 it vill be that requisitions
 will bg made undcr it
 for persons who were never
 in the State from which
 the requisition comes It is
 provided that the judge shall
 deliver up the fugitive on
 being satisfied that the person
 is the person charged and
 that he was within the
 jurisdiction of such State at
 the time such crime was
 committed and such charge is
 made primajücie evidence that he
 was within the State The
 very fact that a per
 son is charged with a
 crime committed in a cer
 tain State is to be
 received as prima facie evi
 dence that he x vas
 within the State no matter
 It is not contem whether
 he was there or not
 plated that the judge shall
 inquire into the fact as
 to whether he was there
 or not Nor is an
 in dictment required in the
 State from which the fugitive
 is alleged to have fled
 but other evidence may be
 received and is all that
 is necessary But sir these
 are matters of minor importance
 I now come to the
 question which is of some
 real importance and that is
 the proposed amendment to the
 Constitution There IS no gentleman
 upon that committee from the
 seceding States who will say
 that this amendment will have
 any effect to wards allaying
 our unfortunate difficulties What is
 the proposed amendment It proposes
 that we shall ncver interfere
 with the institution of slavery
 in the States never until
 a certain contingency arises which
 never can arise until all
 the States Shail sanction such
 a proposition Now sir i
 listened to the argument of
 the gentleman from Ohio Mr
 CORWIN yesterday upon that propo
 sition and his argument demonstrated
 tp my nund most conclusively
 that such an amendment ought
 not to pass I Ic
 demonstrated that there was no
 necessity whatever for any such
 provision in the Constitution It
 is well known that neither
 the Republican party nor any
 party at the North proposes
 to Interfere with the institution
 of slavery in the l
 hey do not claim to
 have anv such Stutcs power
 Under thc Constitution as it
 now is the peonle of
 the North have no right
 to interfere with the institution
 of slavery in the States
 and they havc no desire
 to do it But southern
 gen tlcmcn say that we
 shall acquire the power and
 alter the Constitution ill that
 regard The ment of the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr CORWIN
 was conclusive that that time
 cannot arrive for He showed
 that fifty years and perhaps
 never we could not take
 tbc first step towards amending
 the Constitution on the subject
 of slavery until we had
 forty five States in the
 Union and that such an
 amendment could not be ratified
 until we tate the question
 further when you know no
 good can comeof it In
 my judgment such an amend
 ment of thé Constitution will
 not be adopted by the
 people of the North not
 because they have any desire
 or claim that they have
 any right to interföre with
 the institution of slavery In
 the States but because they
 believe you have no right
 to demand from them any
 such bonds for their good
 behavior and for that reason
 they will vote it down
 They feel in regard to
 it no doubt as I
 do tainly shall vote against
 any such amendment here or
 elscwhere and yet I have
 not the slightest design or
 desire to interfere with slavery
 in the States I protest
 against the possession of any
 such power by the people
 of the North Why then
 do you wish to keep
 the country in an angry
 discussion for the next one
 or two years over this
 amendment when no possible good
 can grow out of it
 but absolute evil The next
 proposition is to admit New
 Mexico as u State T
 hc committee propose to get
 rid of this territorial question
 by the admission of Nevv
 Mexico as n State Well
 sir gentlemen who suppose that
 they can get rid of
 the territorial question in any
 such way have in my
 opinion a very poor idea
 of what that territorial question
 is The territorial question so
 far as it relates to
 the territory that we now
 have is a question of
 no consequence whatever to the
 people of the South It
 is a territorial question lying
 far be yond New Mexico
 that excites the attention of
 hese gentlemen Gentlemen may as
 well make up their minds
 to meet the real territorial
 ques tion for they will
 be called upon to meet
 it and to vote upon
 it before this Congress adjourns
 proposition is t o adopt
 a constitutional amend ment that
 shall recognize and guarantee slavery
 in territory hereafter to be
 acquired It is use less
 to be trifling about these
 little matters The question you
 have to meet is w
 hether you will guarantee slavery
 in all territory hereafter to
 be acquired Southern gentlemen will
 in a moment yield up
 everything else that they clamor
 about if will only consent
 to that The question is
 of no consequence to them
 so far as the existing
 territory is concerned Gentlemen who
 suppose that they can take
 this territorial question out of
 Congress by admitting New Mexico
 entirely mis judge what the
 territorial question is The question
 we ave got to meet
 is commended to the people
 beca vt It proceeds from
 a gentleman whose mod oration
 intelligence and patriotism have always
 becn recognized heretofore at the
 North and the weight of
 his great namc is relied
 upon to carry it through
 The dearest and most trusted
 friend of the immortal Clay
 now signalizes his departure from
 the councils of the nation
 by submitting a proposition that
 of all others would have
 been most distasteful to that
 great man who declared shortly
 before his death that so
 long as the vital current
 flowed in his veins ho
 never could he never woul
 i by thought word or
 action consent the extension of
 the institution of sla very
 into territory then free But
 sir I am opposed to
 this proposition to admit New
 Mexico as a State in
 the first place because I
 regard it as nothing more
 nor less than a proposition
 to admit two pro slavery
 Senators into the United States
 Senate who have no con
 stituency to back them Gentlemen
 who differ from me and
 propose to vote for the
 admission of New Mexico doubtless
 will do so in the
 ex I pectation that it
 will come in as a
 free State but I do
 not agree with them Just
 when the Repub lican party
 is about to obtain a
 majority in the Senate of
 the United States and to
 have an op can I
 n u dly be anticipated
 I say then that he
 portunity of developing its policy
 it is proposed demonstro tcd
 conclusively that there is 111
 neces i to bring in
 two pro slavcry Senators from
 Now 1 feel that ize

 persons who sity for this
 amendrnent of tho Constitution and

 to it there is no
 obligation upon me to vote
 for the every yentleumn who
 listened to him must be

 ens of the northern States
 satis fied that there is
 no such necessity even admission
 of a slave State because
 as smne gen the constitutionality
 of which they have by
 their local laws and their
 mobs refused to allow to
 be though any party desired
 to interfere with slavery ft
 is useless to sul mit
 such an in the States
 tested in the courts of
 the United States And while
 upon this point I desire
 to notice tunendment to the
 people not only because it
 is the f urther proposition
 to amend the laws in
 ref l unnecessary but because
 it is a humiliating prop
 erencc to the surrender of
 fugitives from justice osition to
 the people of the North
 It is equiva lent to
 declaring that you do not
 believe what they It is
 proposed to take from the
 executive of the States the
 obligations which they nov have
 to say and that you
 think they do design to
 intcr surrender up fugitives and
 to confer those obli fere
 with the question of slavery
 in the States regard this
 although you know fuli woll
 the tirnc is fur dis
 gations upon the Federal judges
 as the most obnoxious proposition
 reported by tant when they
 could do it even if
 they had the the committee
 and one which will be
 received disposition with more d
 istavor by the people than
 any other The pedple of
 the North will not accept
 such The people of the
 northern States are jealous of
 i an amendment Why then
 do you want to ao
 i tlemen have said in
 the organic law there a
 provision that they may come
 in with or without Tl
 he sarne provision Inay be
 found in slavery the organic
 laws of Kansas Nebraska and
 Utah and will gentlemen say
 that they would have felt
 themselves bound to have voted
 for the admission of Kansas
 as a slave State had
 she presented herself with a
 pro slavery constitution Or will
 they say that because of
 that provision in the or
 ganic act of Nebraska if
 she should present her self
 with a pro slavery constitution
 they would vote to adrmt
 her I think not sir
 This ques tion of admitting
 new States is one of
 discretion 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 515 entirely It is so
 recognized by the best consti
 tutional lawyers and so long
 sir as I have that
 discretion I intend to vote
 against thc admission of more
 slave States Gentlemen say that
 perhaps New Mexico will i
 believe I do not believe
 it sir bc a free
 State that the same power
 and the same party which
 has adopted in that Territory
 a slave code of the
 most barbarous character and which
 has been filly characterized by
 the gentleman from Ohio M
 r BINGHAM to day will
 adopt a pro slavery hose
 laws are in force there
 now co n stitu tion

 Mr CORWIN sluowed you yesterday
 that it is not likely
 they will be repealed This
 House to bc sure has
 Constitution frec white citizens of
 the United States Mr WA
 SHBURN 0fYVisconsin their number Mr
 OTERO Sixty thousand Mr WASHBURN
 of Wisconsin Then ac cording
 to the statcmcnt of the
 Delegate there was a larger
 white population in New Mexico
 thirty years ago than there
 is to day But Yap
 prehend there may be some
 misunderstanding as to what the
 word white means as applied
 to the people of that
 Territory The population has fallen
 off and from the best
 information I have I bccn
 able to get I find
 that the population of that
 i Territory has not increased
 within the last ten disapproved
 of them but it is
 not likely that for years
 notwithstanding that the Territor has
 years the Senate of the
 United States will be so
 t I been puffed into
 notice most assiduously r here
 nothing in the country to
 invite emigrati on constituted that
 they can be repe aled
 The gentlenmn fron Ohio Mr
 CORWIN said You Inay create
 a State there if you
 please but yesterday and I
 thank him fin his candor
 and I there is nothing
 there to sustain It The
 people commend what he said
 to the members on this
 of New Mexico cannot sustain
 a State govern side of
 the House that New Mexico
 was more ment They have
 not the power or the
 wealth to likely to come
 in asa slave State if
 admitted now do so The
 chairman of t11C committee of
 thirty indicated that we might
 give them than if her
 admission was delayed for a
 few years three indeed I
 commend that to members upon
 this side of the some
 help as we have done
 in other cases Y 0t
 know of any instance where
 assistance has I louse If
 they want to admit a
 slave State let been ffiven
 to a peoplo of a
 Territory t o enable them
 do it now because if
 they delay a few years
 It is true New Mexico
 will come in as a
 free State says them to
 sustain a State government Eat
 sir if I knew that
 land exrants have been made
 to different States the gen
 from Ohio to enable ihern
 to develop their resources but
 I that New Mexico would
 conie with a free Statc
 take it that if you
 uret e to make Mexico
 a constitution I should be
 no less opposed to her
 Frant of all the public
 lands within her limits she
 I believe that it would
 adli ission than i nowr
 would be still quite as
 unablc to support a Slate
 be uniust to the people
 of the old States to
 admit overnmcnt as she is
 now Poor as she is
 she New Mexico now as
 a State And sir I
 not prepared to say that
 it would be entirely just
 is not so poor as
 to own the lands of

 will find in to the
 people of the South to

 I have I free State
 even if I thought she
 would cotne in as a

 people do not desire a

 might then say with per
 free State ernment and yet
 it is by no means
 certain that fect propriety that
 it was our design 10

 an enabling act she will
 not apply in and crush
 them out to draw a

 will apply imme and in

 estimates they nulde it ninety

 evidence we havc it If
 we a re 10 judge
 of the ideas of justice
 or injustice held by the
 people of New Mexico by

 appears that there are but
 a very srnall of that
 population who arc not riatives

 It a slip which I
 cut from the N cw
 York Times Mr YI ERO
 I do not own a
 slave and have of the
 18th instant being from its
 New Mexico I nothing to
 do with slavery I do
 not Mr WASHBURN of Wisconsin
 correspondent The letter is dated
 Tucson New men say that
 under the decision of the
 Supreme Court of the United
 States they havc now the
 right to go with their
 slaves into all the T
 cri ito ries of the
 United States whether north or
 south of the Missouri line
 The Supreme Cöui t has
 decided that they have that
 right But they say that
 we of the Republican party
 disputethåt right and that therefore
 they wanl it put in
 the Con stitution They say
 that although it is their
 right to go with thetr
 slaves into the territory north
 of the Missouri line yet
 they are willing to be
 mag nanimous and to give
 up to freedom the country
 north of that linc We
 do not thank them for
 their liberality We have vindicated
 oui right to the country
 north of the Missouri line
 so that in conceding that
 to us they really concede
 us I will say to
 these gentlemen c Tinwo nothing
 I fear you when bearing
 Danaos et donaferentes gifts I
 have then sir I think
 examined all the pro jccts
 and propositions of the majority
 of the com mittee that
 propose definite action and believe
 they are powerless for good
 Southern gentlernen say they are
 all powerless except one and
 that is the proposition to
 amend the Constitution That proposition
 as I have endeavored to
 show is unnecessary as thc
 Constitution cannot be changed in
 that particular until we have
 al least sixty States admitted
 into the Union I see
 there fore no reason for
 it nor can I give
 my sanction to turning the
 North upside down in discussino
 this amendment of the Constitution
 Sir nothing will do any
 good that docs not al
 low thcsc gentlemen of the
 South to control the Government
 You can make up your
 minds to If you are
 willing to concede that that
 point you will have peace
 at once and South Carolina
 which lias gone out of
 the Union never to return
 will come right straight back
 again It is not claimed
 by these southern States by
 these cot ton States that
 thcy arc compelled to contribute
 an undue proportion for the
 support of the Gen eral
 Government T hc truth is
 they havc been cotton is
 go long in the habit
 of belicving that king that
 they have con le to
 entertain the idea t hat
 tho world could not get
 along without them that they
 control thc destinies of the
 world Mr Speaker we may
 as well dispel that de
 lusion first as last If
 cotton has been king it
 is I king no longer
 Great Britain is not willing
 that I her destinies shall
 depend upon the l tncertain
 supply of cotton depends on
 the culture of slaves She
 has been exploring the cotton
 fields I of the world
 in which she may raise
 her own supply and in
 that enterprise this very move
 ment at tho South is
 o oing to set her
 ahead fifty years in the
 matter of the production of
 her own cotton Her attempts
 at openinø new cotton fields
 t in the last few
 years have been eminentiy suc
 I cessful She is now
 receivinm nearly one million bales
 annually from India though the
 develop ment of that country
 for the growth of cotton
 has just commenced YVith a
 view of bringing the cotton
 regions of India into connection
 with the ports of the
 sea she has largely lent
 her aid to railroad companies
 which are penetrating the in
 terior and within a föw
 months some eleven hun dred
 miles of railway will be
 opened to the best cot

 that country But Great mean

 of Great Britain being dependent

 INTRODUCED I have figz stance
 the Post Offee Department uros

 condition of the six New
 England States to the six
 States which have seceded or
 are I suppose about to
 secede The State of Louisiana
 receives annu ally in the
 way of protection on sugar
 not less than four or
 five million dollars from the
 Govern ment while the revenues
 of the Post Offce De
 partment from that State are
 only about one fourth of
 the expenditures Without going into
 details I will say that
 New England largely overpays the
 Government for her postal expenses
 The Governmént receives from her
 in the shape Qf postages
 while the expenditures of the
 Government for her are but
 1 156 000 being quite
 a large surplus to the
 Government above being self sustaining
 Now takc these cotton States
 including Louisiana and you will
 find that theGovernment has received
 in the last year 722

 step in the right direction
 his proposition It is well
 for these people to flwl

 of the benefits they are

 Government It is very obligil
 ff on their 10 allow
 us to carry their mails
 at an expend of more

 while they are in opcn
 rebcllion and refuse to ac
 knowlcdge the authority of the
 General Govern Inent but so
 fur as I urn concerned
 while they the Government will
 110t continue in rebellion have
 my consent to do so
 in the Uture until they

 I have no s ccial

 will be all ovcrrulcd for

 talk about reconstructing this Gov
 ennnent after it shall have
 been broken up and destroyed
 I tell them no If
 this Government is destroyed it
 will not be reconstructed on
 the basis on which it
 stands Gentlemen may as well
 understand right here that if
 the Government is to be
 reconstructed the people of the
 North will have o word
 to say as to the
 basis of that recon struction
 and no new union will
 be formed that does not
 give them terms of perfect
 equality If this Union must
 bc dissolved whether by peace

 covers everything to the United
 States and all that he
 asks is that he shall
 be released from the resid
 ue If the evidence had
 been judicial to show the
 facts with sufficient certainty the
 committee would have gone further
 and have recommended that the
 sum paid should be refunded
 because on the face of
 the facts as stated had
 they been ju dicially authenticated
 to that extent it would
 be a case of gross
 oppression The bill as it
 stands as it is to
 relieve the party from uuther
 oxccu tion I trust will
 bo passed by the Senat
 c at 01 ce There
 being no abjection the bill

 JOSEPH CLYMER Mr SLIDELL I
 believe it is in order
 now to call up for
 consideration some resolutions that I
 Mr SIMMONS NV ill the
 Senator allow me to make
 a report Mr SLIDELL Certainly
 Mr SIMMONS The Committcc on
 Claims to whom was referred
 the opinion of the Court
 of Claims on the claim
 of Joseph Clymer have directed
 me to submit a report
 accompanied by a bill S
 No 548 for the relief
 of Joseph Cly mer The
 bill is very short and
 the committee were unanimous in
 recommendinæ its passaae I should
 like to have it considered
 now rhe bill S No
 548 for the relief of
 Joseph Clymer was read and
 passed to a second reading
 The VICE PRESIDENT If there
 be no 0b jection the
 Secretary will read the bill
 at length for the information
 of the Senate The Secretary
 read the bill Mr HALE
 Is there a report The
 VicE PRESIDENT Is there objection
 to the present consideration of
 the bill Mr HALE Yes
 sir Mr SIMMONS The committee
 were unani mous upon it
 and I hope the Senator
 v 7ill with draw the
 objection SECRETARY OF WAR Mr
 SLIDELL 1 renew my motion
 to take up the resolutions
 I offered a few days
 since re ferring the P
 resident s messtvre to the
 Committee on the Judiciary The
 motion was agreed to Ylr
 SLIDELL 1 intended to euoe
 and the resolutions torrethcr and
 I suppose they may be
 considered together The PRESIDENT Thatis
 the under standing of the
 Chair The Secretary read the
 resolutions submitted by Mr SLIDELL
 on the 21st instant Resolved
 I hat in the opinion
 of the Senate the reasons
 given by the Presrdent in
 his message of the 16th
 instant tor not connnunicating to
 the Senate at an earlier
 day the fact of his
 having appointed on the 31st
 of Decenlber last Joseph Holt
 as acting Secretary of War
 are not satisfac tory Resolved
 That in the opinion of
 the Senate the grounds assumed
 by the President in his
 aforesaid message in sup port
 of his views of the
 executive authority to make during
 the session of the Senate
 an appointment of an acting
 Sec retary of War for
 a pcriöd not exceeding six
 months Ihn ited by his
 own discretion arc at variance
 not only with the letter
 and spirit of the Constitution
 but with the true intent
 and meaning of the aet
 of 13th of February 1795
 to which he has reterrcd
 and if suffered to pass
 by without cxpress dissent would
 establish a precedent alike danger
 ous to the principles on
 which our system of Government
 was established and in derogation
 of the constitutional rights and
 privileges of the Senate Mr
 SLIDELL I think it proper
 to say that I do
 not present thcse resolutions in
 a factious spirit but with
 very sincere regret to differ
 from thc President in his
 views of execut ivo power
 have read his messao e
 with great attention and am
 compelled to say that it
 has failed to shake in
 any degree the strong convictions
 I entertained on the subject
 when offered the resolution to
 which it responds nor after
 a careful examiha tion of
 the long list of appointments
 to which it rcfcrs as
 establishing an uninterrupted usa ye
 of sixty five years do
 I find one solitary casc
 which can be quoted as
 a precedent for the ap
 pointment of Mr Holt as
 acting Secretary of War when
 the Senate was in session
 and the office vacant by
 the resignation of Mr Floyd
 Ail tho appointments onc hundred
 and seventy having been with
 the exception six in numbm
 of Mr T oucey as
 acting Secretary of the Treas
 ury on 12th December last
 made during the re cess
 of the Senate or when
 from illness absence or other
 cause other than death or
 resignation the duties of the
 office could not be discharged
 by the regularly appointed functionary
 I do not intend to
 argue the question now but
 considering it one of very
 great Interest I only desire
 to place on record my
 dissent from the opinions of
 the President and to bring
 the matter before the ap
 I move that the message
 and resolutions be ref0rred to
 the Committee on thc Judiciary
 Mr BIGLER 1 shall no
 further objec tion to the
 refin ence of this subject
 to the Com mittee on
 the Judiciary I only desire
 to say to the Senator
 from Louisiana that he must
 be per fectly aware I
 mado no objection in a
 spirit of in justice or
 opposition to him nor have
 I any de sire to
 avoid a full and thorough
 examination of the subject That
 could not be done if
 I desired it But sir
 at the moment the Senator
 from Louisiana madc the motion
 the other morning it occurred
 to mc that it might
 be a very serious matter
 He secrned to be exceedingly
 confident that thcrc was no
 authority under the Constitu tion
 for what the President of
 the United States had done
 and for that reason desired
 a reference of the message
 to the Committee on the
 Judiciary The first impression on
 my mind was that this
 might involve a very serious
 question and very serious consequences
 to our public affairs For
 that reason I suggnsted thc
 propriety of allow incr it
 to lie over and for
 that reason only and therefore
 have no objection whatever this
 morn ing to the reference
 The VICE PRESIDENT The motion
 of the Senator from Louisiana
 is to refer the President
 s message to tho Commit
 t oe on the Tudiciary
 Mr SLIDELL And the resolutions
 The VICE PRESIDENT It is
 moved and seconded that the
 message of the President of
 the United States and the
 resolutions submitted by 488 authorizing
 the holding of circuit and
 dis2 trict courts of the
 United States for the southern
 district of Illinois at the
 city of Cairo was con
 sidered as in Committee of
 the Whole Mr TRUMBULL There
 are some details in that
 bill that I have not
 looked at and I should
 like to have it lie
 over and not be passed
 this I do not know
 that I have any objec
 morning tion to it but
 I should like to look
 into some Of the details
 in regard to pending suits
 which I have not observed
 before Mr DOUGLAS It can
 lie over for a day
 until my colleague opportunity to
 exam The VICE PRESIDENT The
 bill will be passed over
 COMMITTEE SERVICE Mr IVERSON 1
 rise sir for the purpose
 of asking to be discharged
 from any further ser vicc
 upon the Committee on Claims
 I was dis charged some
 time since fromservice as chairman
 of that committee but I
 understand that not carry with
 it a discharge as a
 member of the committee Yesterday
 there was some contro versy
 and difficulty about filling placns
 on the committees in consequence
 of Senators having retired from
 the Chamber In order to
 obviate that difficulty in my
 own case while I am
 a mem ber of the
 Senate I ask to be
 discharged frOm the committee and
 that the Vice President fill
 the vacancy The committee I
 understand have already clected a
 chairman and the only thing
 necessary is simply to supply
 one committee man in my
 place The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Senator from Georgi asks to
 bc discharged from further ser
 vicc upon the Committee on
 Claims The motion was agreed
 to The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Senatormoves also that the Presiding
 Offcer fill the vacancy upon
 that committee T hc motion
 was agreed to ST LOUIS
 ARSENAL Mr POLK A few
 days ago when the morn
 ing hour closed the Senate
 had under considera tion a
 bill for the sale and
 removal of the arsenal in
 the city of St Louis
 desire that the Senate shall
 go on with that unfinished
 business during The VICE PRESIDEN
 r The Senator must move
 to take it up it
 fell Mr POLK If it
 requires a motion I move
 to take it up The
 motion was agreed to and
 the Senate as in Committee
 of the Whole resumed the
 consid eration of the bill
 H R No 132 to
 remove the United States arsenal
 from the city of St
 Louis and to provide for
 the sale of the lands
 on which the same is
 located the pending question being
 on the amendment of the
 Committee on Military Affairs and
 Militia to add at the
 end of the first section
 the following fl he proceeds
 of such sale to be
 applied to the erection at
 Jefferson barracks in the State
 Of Missouri of suitable buildings
 for containing all the tools
 implements machine ry arms and
 materials now at said St
 Louis arsenal Mr KING 1
 ask that the bill itself
 with the It passed unanimously
 amendments be read through the
 Committee on Military Affairs of
 the Senate with the amendments
 and I think there will
 be no objection to it
 if the whole case ap
 pears to the Senate VICE
 PRESIDENT The Secretary will read
 the bill with the amendments
 of the Senate Committee on
 Military Affairs and Militia The
 bill and amendments were read
 Mr GRIMES As 1 understand
 the bill now before thc
 Senate it provides that the
 whole of the land belonging
 to the United States and
 used for the purpose of
 an arsenal at St Louis
 shall the Senator from Louisiana
 be referred to the I
 be divided up into lots
 and sold and the eastern
 Committee on the Judiciary The
 motion was to UNITED STATES
 COURTS AT CAIRO Mr DOUGLAS
 If there is no objection
 1 should like to have
 the Senate consider now the
 bill providing for a separate
 term of the courts of
 the United States in the
 southern district of Illi nois
 at Cairo which has been
 reported from the II Committee
 on the Judiciary this morning
 I pre It will take
 same herc will bc no
 ol jecüon to it but
 an instant No objection being
 made the bill H R
 No half that which is
 nearest to the city of
 St Louis and the more
 valuable is to be appropriated
 ex clusively to the construction
 ofa new arsenal or I
 thc erection of new buildingsatJefferson
 barracks Mr POLK I will
 state to the Senator that
 he is just exactly mistaken
 occupied portion and I will
 state to the Senator that
 on inquiry since he and
 myself had a con versat
 ion on the subject I
 am satisfied that the proceeds
 of tbc unoccupied western half
 will not I be more
 than is necessary for the
 purpose of mak I ing
 necessary repairs If however the
 Senator 518 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 23 PRIVATE BILL DAY
 is disposed to put in
 an amendment to limit the
 amount to what is necessary
 i have no objection to
 it at all Mr GRIMES
 Why say that one half
 the value of this land
 shall be expended in the
 erec tion of a building
 when we do not know
 what If it is necessary
 for the value of the
 land is us to have
 an arsenal or new buildings
 erected at the Jefferson barracks
 let us appropriate the ne
 cessary amount to do it
 But this land if I
 know anything about its value
 if I have a proper
 ap preciation of it is
 worth three times as much
 as the amount that ought
 to be expended in thc
 con struction of buildings at
 Jefferson barracks Mr POLK The
 Senator is mistaken in sup
 posing that it requires thc
 expenditure or one half of
 the value That is nob
 the provision of the bill
 Mr GRIMES one half the
 proceeds Mr POLK It requires
 thc sale of the west
 ern half first The western
 half is that part of
 Jhc tract on which there
 arc no improvements T hc
 improved portion and most valuable
 portion is on the eastern
 half that lies next the
 river The proceeds of that
 are not to be applied
 to building an arsenal at
 Jefferson barracks The Senator therefore
 is under a mistake in
 that re spcct but the
 object of thc bilt is
 as I under stand from
 the Committee on Military Affairs
 to appropriate these proceeds to
 the building of an arsenal
 so that there shall be
 a place to which the
 munitions and the materials and
 the ma chinery that are
 now used at the St
 Louis arse nal can be
 taken and that they shall
 not be If moved until
 there is u place to
 take them to the Senator
 however wishes to limit the
 amount an amendment to that
 effect will meet with no
 opposition I suppose on the
 part of any metn ber
 of the c ounnittcc certainly
 it will not on my
 GRIN rrcs we do know
 how much this western half
 this unoccu pied half of
 the land may bring It
 I nay bring it rnay
 bring Ill this first section
 it is proposed that the
 whole of the value o
 that land no rnatter how
 much it may bring shall
 bc expended in the erec
 tion of buildings at Jefferson
 barracks Mr DOUGLAS 1 will
 make a sucr estlon which
 I hope inn y bviate
 thc diflicultics on this iMy
 sunurestion is to strike out
 all about one halt of
 the proceeds and say that
 the sum of froin the
 first proceeds be appropriated for
 the construction of an arsenal
 at Jefferson barracks Mr GRIMES
 That will be all right
 Mr DOUGLAS I understand that
 will be acceptable to the
 Senators from Missouri Mr GREEN

 ask that the report be

 from which it appearcd that
 Daniel Davis was a teamster
 in Captain Farrow s company
 of toamstcrs under the command
 of Quartermaster John Matthews He
 entered the service of the
 quartermaster on or about the
 20th day of May 1795
 for the term of three
 months and continued in the
 service for that period of
 time whcn he was honorable
 discharged by the quartermaster at
 Greenville While in the service
 he was cn gaged in
 hauling supplies from Fort Hamilton
 to Fort Greenville which was
 then the headquarters of General
 Waync The discharge of Daniel
 Davis is lost but Sylvanus
 Olney and Lucena Mann testify
 under oath that they knew
 Davis at tho time he
 was in the service They
 had very often seen him
 perforrning duty as a soldier
 and teamster I he witnesses
 are certified 10 bc cred
 ible persons Thc rcccrds containing
 the names of those who
 performed service during war arc

 sufficient to justify them in

 Mr COLLAMER Is there report
 in that case If there

 Mr LANE There is a
 report The Secretary read the
 report of the Commit tee
 on Military Affairs and Militia
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr BRIGHT
 in the chair The hour
 for the special order has
 arrived and it must be
 taken up unless the Sen
 ate direct otherwise Mr LANE
 will not ask that the
 special order be suspended at
 all but this bill may
 lie over ORDER or nus1NESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER There are
 two special orders The first
 is Senate bill No 230
 bill declaratory of the acts
 for carrying into effect the
 ninth article of the treaty
 between the United States and
 Spain Mr CAMERON J thought
 the first for to day
 was House bill No 338
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The second
 special order appointed for to
 day is I lousc bill
 No 338 entitled An act
 to providc for the pay
 ment of outstandincr Treasury notes
 to authorize a loan to
 rcgulate and fix the duties
 on imports and for other
 purposes Mr HUN I ER
 Are not the resolutions of
 the Senator from Kentucky Mr
 CRITTENDEN the unfinished business on
 which we adjourne yesterday evening
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr BRIGHT
 They are the unfinished business
 Mr HUNTER Then of course
 they come up first Mr
 POLK I will state to
 the Chair that that is
 not only so but the
 Senator from Ohio Mr WADE
 was on the floor in
 the midst ofa speech at
 the moment the adjournment was
 moved Thc PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair was croin on to
 remark that the unfinished business
 of yesterday was the joint
 resolution of the Sen ator
 from Kentucky and on that
 question the Chair is advised
 that the Senator from Ohio
 is entitled to the floor
 Mr CAMERON Will the President
 allow me to ask what
 is the state of the
 House bill to which I
 have alluded and if it
 be passed over nom v
 when will it come up
 The PRESIDING OFFICER When taken
 up it will be before
 the Senate as in Committae
 of the Whole and open
 to amendment Mr CAMERON I
 propose to fix some day
 IVIr SEWARD Let the Senator
 from Ohio go on novv
 and that can be fixed
 afterwards Mr CAMERON very well
 Mr WADE If the Senate
 is inclined to take up
 the bill referred to by
 the Senator from Penn sylvania
 which I deem one of
 the most inlport ant that
 is before us I will
 yield the floor for that
 purpose trusting to luck to
 get it some other time
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 519
 Mr CAMERON 1 am much
 obliged to the Senator from
 Ohio and would prefer that
 a great deal Mr CRITTENDEN
 I cannot consent to it
 Mr CAMERON 1 hope the
 Senator from Kentucky will not
 object His resolutions have taken
 precedencc of everything else but
 this bill is very important
 to the country just now
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 say one
 word If remember aright the
 bill on this subject about
 which the Senator from Pennsylvania
 speaks came from the Comtnittee
 on Finance with a recommendation
 that it be postponed until
 the 4th of March next
 and was laid upon the
 table with the understanding that
 at smne early day when
 the Senate was full it
 should be taken up and
 a day fixed for its
 consideration Now suppose the first
 vote to be taken must
 bc taken upon the question
 of postponement to the 4th
 of March 11 is with
 reference to that that we
 want a vote Docs the
 Senator from Pennsylvania want that
 vote to day Mr CAMERON
 1 do not think that
 is the state of the
 question Mr FESSENDEN 1 want
 to know what the situation
 of tho bill is Mr
 CAMERON There was report of
 the Committee on Financc as
 the Senator from Maine states
 on which there was no
 action but lurinqy the last
 week I moved that this
 day should be set aside
 for the consideration of this
 bill and that it should
 bo the first special order
 for this day and that
 was ao reed to by
 a large vote of the
 Senate take it therefore the
 bill is now before the
 Senate Mr DOUGLAS 1 will
 suggest to the Senator fron
 Pennsylvania that his measure is
 not mow bccorc the Senate
 The first special order is
 the rcsolutions of the Senator
 from Kentucky next is on
 a110ther subject iVhen thc Senator
 ft opn Ohio gets through
 his rctnau ks if nobody
 else follows hin it will
 be in order for the
 Senator to his motion but
 while these resolutions are pending
 it is certainly notin order
 unless by the unannnotts consent
 of the Senate and I
 see that several gontkemen intend
 to insist on other bills
 particularly the Pacific railroad bill
 they are now ready to
 object Mr BIGLER With the
 permission of my colleague I
 will suggest to hirn in
 order to get out of
 this diflicuity to name a
 subsequent day i say Friday
 01 Saturday for the consideration
 of this question Mr POLK
 Friday is already given to
 private Mr BIGLER Let us
 say to morrow Mr CAMERON
 I do not see that
 1 be a bit l
 ettcr oil by fixing it
 for to morrow or any
 otherday than am now The
 Senator from Ohio has agreed
 to waive his right to
 the floor Mr GRINIES I
 movc to postpone all other
 special orders in order to
 take up this bill If
 that is no Mr CANIERON
 very well cessary to accomplish
 my object I will do
 so although I do not
 think it is Mr XHIIMF
 S That will accmnplish it
 Mr CAMERON Then 1 other
 orders be postponed for the
 purpose of taking up muse
 bill No 338 Mr BIGLER
 On that proposition desirc to
 say a word I represent
 a State that is deeply
 interested in this question of
 the tariff I am com
 mitted to this policy indeed
 I am instructed by In
 y Legislature and am anxious
 for the consid eration of
 tho bill But i havc
 repeatedly expressed my great desire
 for action on the resolutions
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 as being more important than
 anything else and my colleague
 will put me in the
 position of voting in favor
 of the postpone ment of
 the resolutions of the Senator
 from Ken tuck y or
 voting to defer the consideration
 of the I believe we
 shall have ample time to
 con tariff sider the tariff
 bill fully and thoroughly after
 we have voted on these
 resolutions and I shall there
 fore vote against tho motion
 to postpone Mr FESSENDEN 1
 wish to Inquire what the
 report of the commit tee
 accompanying that I want to
 know whether I am right
 or bill was wrong about
 it Mr HVII V The
 Senator is right about it
 The PRESIDINGOFFICER CTheSecretary will read
 the order that is indorsed
 on the report The Secretary
 read as follows with a
 recommendation that it be postponed
 to the 4th day of
 March next January 18 1851
 Resumed and postponcd to and
 made the special order tor
 VVednesday the 23d instant at
 one o clock Mr FESSENDEN
 What 1 wish to inquire
 is whether that overrides the
 report of the com I
 mittee If it does it
 is all very well The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The special order
 now before the Senate is
 the joint resolutions offered by
 the Senator from Keniucky being
 the unfinished business of yesterday
 Mr FESSENDEN That 1 understand
 but I was inquiring what
 the effect of that reference
 of this bill was A
 motion has becn made to
 post pone all prior orders
 and take up this bill
 and I wish to inquire
 whether the action of the
 Senate already upon that bill
 supersedes the report of the
 Commi ttee on Finance so
 that when the proper time
 arrives the bill itself is
 before the Senate free from
 the recommendation of the comrnittec
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 understands that the order made
 on the 18th which makes
 the bill the special order
 for this morning continues the
 bill before the Senate is
 here a special order if
 there were no other bus
 The question is on the
 iness interfi2t ino with it
 motion of the Senator froin
 Pennsylvania to post pone the
 joint resolutions of thc Senator
 fronl Ken tuckv for thc
 purpose of taking up House
 bi l No 938B Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 hope that will
 not bc r I he
 genllernan roun Pennsylvania has done
 perhaps given very good reasons
 why his bili ought bc
 taken up and considered but
 ho has given no reason
 why these resolutions ought to
 I think he can hardly
 contend be postponed that tho
 subject to which the bill
 relates is of more importance
 than that to which the
 resolutions rc There is no
 reason and there can be
 none I think why these
 resolutions ought to be post
 for any b lsiness before
 the Senate HG proposes the
 Well sir it is a
 melancholy question to ask but
 we are compelled to ask
 it to what part of
 the United States would this
 tariff apply what ports and
 what harbors These are important
 sir Let us therefore settle
 and determine the questions that
 relatc to the Union and
 its stability and then adopt
 a policy on the tariff
 I hope the resoluti01 s
 will not bc postponed Mr
 HALE Before motion is put
 I want to ask a
 question of the Conunittce on
 Finance I believe the Senator
 from Virginia has withdrawn it
 and I should like to
 have an answer from if
 I can get it There
 the Senator from Maine was
 some discussion upon this bill
 wheyl it was up at
 the last session but I
 wish to ask whether this
 tariff bilk fronl the I
 louse was ever examined in
 detail tho Conn nittce on
 Finance of this l tr
 FESSENDEN 1 can only say
 in reply to the Senator
 if it has been I
 know nolhing I have never
 been able to givc ib
 any about it examination whatcvcr
 and indeed I mav say
 that there has been examination
 whatever ffivcn to thc details
 of thc bill in the
 Committee on Ili nanec It
 was reported back with thc
 recommend that it should be
 post ation of the committee
 pone d until thc 4th
 of March and this is
 the way I low much
 signifi it stands before the
 Scnatc cance that has one
 way or tlxc other I
 do not know Mr HALE
 Then 1 want to say
 a single word I amas
 willing as everybody knows riffht
 here to follow leaders as
 any enan in this body
 and I am as desirous
 for a tariff as anybody
 but I I C ieve
 this tariff affects very essentially
 the intcr csts of the
 peoplc whom I represent and
 am 100t willing to vote
 upon it in the dark
 until it has had the
 in telligcnt ofa committee of
 this body and that witl
 govern my vote when it
 comes up party or no
 party iMr BIGLER My colleague
 seems desirous of keeping the
 position of this hill and
 I quite disposed to allow
 him to have his way
 about it My own judgment
 is that it is not
 politic to press this measure
 this morning but I believe
 I shall vote with him
 to take the bill up
 expecting that after some discussion
 we shall fix a day
 for its I do not
 expect it to be dis
 final disposition posed of to
 day Mr FESSENDEN Mr President
 1 wish to flave the
 position of this rnuttcr fully
 understood I believed it to
 bc properly sent there nan
 cc because it had never
 been examined and my wish
 and ho were that when
 it went to that comrnit
 tee it s yould be
 thoroughly examined so that if
 we were disposed to pass
 it we should pass it
 understandingly and with proper amendments
 i have no doubt it
 requires some amendment But the
 majority of that committee thought
 proper to bring it back
 to the Senate with a
 recom mendatuon equivalent to its
 rejection entirely Now sic my
 opinion is that before tl
 iis body acts upon it
 il ought to go through
 the hands of a committee
 and be examined My opinion
 further is that when it
 is taken up in this
 Body if tho recommendation of
 the Committee on Finance to
 postpone it to the 4th
 of March is rejected it
 should then go back to
 the committee för exarnination and
 be reported at an curly
 day That is my notion
 about it although I Will
 not yress it against the
 wishes of the Senators from
 ennsylvania If they are disposcd
 to take it up and
 examine it here and run
 the risk of its passacrc
 without such a previous examination
 and a thorough one I
 am perfcctly willing that that
 should bc donc but I
 do think that it ought
 to be taken up immediately
 and I am surprised that
 it has not becn called
 up before I did not
 consider it my business to
 do it I hope it
 will be taken up immediately
 and if this recommend ation
 of the Committee on Finance
 is rejected a day fixed
 when it shall bc acted
 upon and that adhered to
 Mr CAMERON What has been
 said by Senator from Maine
 makes it my duty to
 say some thing about the
 course of the Committee on
 Fi nance in reference to
 this bill It will bo
 remem bered that this bill
 passed the House carly in
 the last session and when
 it came here it was
 re ferred to the Committee
 on Finance Perhaps I can
 110t with propriety speak of
 the proceedings of the committee
 but on every day thut
 I had an opportunity I
 urged upon the committee thc
 in vestigation of the bill
 Tho whole session was wasted
 and the bill was not
 cxamined Again it was referred
 t o the Committee on
 Finance by the Senator from
 Maine when I brought the
 bill up this session Mr
 FESSENDEN Oh no Mr CAMERON
 Yes sir on your vote
 Mr FESSENDEN No sir thc
 Senator is cntirely mistaken The
 report will show it Mr
 CAMERON very well 1 will
 not con trudict the Senator
 Hc ought to know better
 than I do But it
 was referred again to thc
 com mittee and there was
 no action had upon it
 until at last a resolution
 vv as adopted there which
 is tantamount to its destruc
 tion recommending that it lie
 over until the 4th of
 March Now I am tired
 of that If gentlemen on
 this side who are in
 favor of protection or some
 alteration in the tariff will
 vote with us for this
 bill we shall get what
 we desire but we shall
 never obtain it if this
 thing is to continue all
 thc session of post poning
 for sorne frivolous reason or
 other or re ferring the
 bill back to a committec
 who will not investigate it
 There is not a membcr
 of that committee who iVill
 look at it except Scna
 tor from Maine What havc
 we to gain by their
 looking at it The truth
 is such motions are only
 intcndQd to destroy the bill
 Now I perfectly willing when
 this bill Shull come up
 that a day certain shall
 be fixed to disposc of
 it but I have no
 desire to trust it again
 to that commit tee for
 an examination Mr G WIN
 I hope this will not
 come up to day for
 consideration It is well known
 to the members of the
 Committee on Finance I sup
 pose there is no objection
 to referring to the opin
 ions of the members of
 the committee that a majority
 of tho committee were opposed
 to this bill and that
 a report was inade more
 than a month ago with
 the object of ascertaining whether
 the majority of the Senatc
 would consider this question during
 the present session As the
 Senator from Maine said I
 expected it to come up
 lone ago but bei1P opposed
 to the Decenlber 20 1860
 Reported without amendincnt and This
 bill was first sent to
 the Committee on Fi bill
 I was of the opinion
 that those members of the
 Senate who were in favor
 of it were waiting for
 the happening of certain events
 which have happened here by
 which a large vote against
 the bill has been thrown
 out giving them a Letter
 prospect of pass it Now
 a word as to the
 t delay If the bilk
 had been taken up one
 month ago I have no
 doubt it would have been
 post 520 If it now
 comes up poned to the
 4th of March gnd that
 postponement is decided against the
 Scnator from Maine certainly has
 indicated the proper course for
 the bill has not been
 examined It was not examined
 by the Committee on Fi
 nance because they believed a
 majority of the Senate were
 opposed to the bill and
 we wanted a test vote
 Why go into the labor
 of preparinT amendments to this
 bill or examining It at
 all If a majority of
 the Senate were against it
 If it had been voted
 on onc month ago it
 would have been seen that
 such was the fact but
 the vote was postponed for
 the purpose of having a
 full Senate to ascertain whether
 the subject should be con
 sidered at all That motion
 has been postponed for upwards
 of a month and in
 the mean time six or
 eight Senators who are opposed
 to the bill have retired
 from the Senate Now the
 first question is shall the
 bill bc considered during this
 session or postponed to the
 4th of March which is
 equivalent to its rejection After
 that is decided if the
 Senate will entertain the bill
 iL ought certainly to be
 examined by some commit tee
 for it is in my
 judgment one of the crudest
 bills that over was presented
 to the Senate of the
 United States although it is
 on one of the rnost
 important subjects Therefore I hope
 it will not bo taken
 u now Mr DOUGLAS The
 statement the Sena tor from
 Maine that this bill has
 not been ex amined in
 detail by the Committee on
 Finance I think demonstrates the
 necessity of a recom mittal
 of the bill for the
 purpose of its undergoing such
 an investigation It is very
 clear that of all the
 measures upon which we have
 to act a tariff bill
 is the one that should
 be examined in its details
 critically by a committee who
 are presumed to understand thc
 subject and have been appointed
 for that purpose Now since
 the events of the last
 fcw wccks there has been
 or is to be a
 change in the position of
 the Committee on Finance The
 chairrnan of that committee MI
 I IUNTER who has served
 the Senate and the country
 in that position with so
 much ability for many years
 has deemed it his duty
 to retire and I understand
 that he places his withdrawal
 from the committce on the
 ground that he no longer
 represents a rna iority of
 the body These events changing
 the character of the Sehate
 transfer tbc power in this
 body from this side of
 the Chamber to the other
 side Mr FESSENDEN Oh no
 we have not Mr DOUGLAS
 well you have got it
 so nearly that two or
 three days will give it
 to you conclusively and the
 resignation of the chairman of
 the Committee on Finance is
 predicated as I understand on
 that fact From this time
 out the other side of
 the Chamber have the respons
 ibility of the action of
 lhis body and are entitled
 to their representation in the
 committees strikes rne therefore that
 the first is for thern
 to proceed to thc election
 of a chairman of the
 Conennit tec on Finance who
 rcprcscnt s thcir views and
 to fill the other vacancies
 so that that important committee
 will roflect the policy of
 a majority of the Senate
 and then reconunit this bili
 to tho committee as thus
 organized and when they make
 a report upon it wb
 shall bc rca ly to
 act upon it I think
 that is the truc mode
 of proceeding It does not
 fbliow that after tho Senate
 shall have appointed a new
 chairman of thc Committee on
 Finance and flilcd the vacan
 cies on that conn nittce
 there will be tho same
 report on this bill there
 may be a different report
 from that made by thc
 committee who recoin mended its
 postponement to the 4th of
 March does fi llow that
 this bill ought not to
 be passed until it has
 been examined by a conunit
 tee in de tail We
 must therefore either recommit it
 to the Committee on Finance
 or create a special committee
 to make the necessary investigation
 before we act upon it
 Inasmuch as the objec tion
 in the way of an
 investigation by the Com mittcc
 on Finance has becn retnoved
 by the resitr nations on
 that cornmittec all you have
 to do is to procccd
 to elect a chairman of
 that committee and filt up
 your vacancies in a manner
 that will bo satisfactory to
 a majority of the Senate
 and then recommit the bill
 and have a report on
 its the Ineasare CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 January 23 I Senate to
 consider this bill at the
 present session This bill was
 got up in the House
 of Representa tives with a
 great deal of labor and
 investigation I doubt whether any
 bill connected with the tariff
 or any other questiofi has
 passed the House of Representatives
 for years to which so
 much time I and labor
 have been devoted It comes
 here do not think it
 perfect It proposesgreat changes 1
 think the Senate ought to
 take time to examine it
 and examine it with care
 Therefore we should act upon
 it to day and if
 it is to go back
 to the Committee on Finance
 let us send it back
 at once and give that
 committee time to act upon
 it But there are I
 understand now before that c6mmittee
 several appropriation bills from the
 House of Representatives for their
 consideration and I do not
 know whether they will have
 time enough to devote to
 this bill that attention which
 ought to be devoted to
 it for the next fevvr
 days If they cannot do
 it I think the Senate
 should appoint special committee and
 send this bill to that
 special comrnittce and Ict them
 devote the days and nights
 to its consideration for it
 is a question of great
 importance to the country Sir
 there has been a pressure
 here for nearly four years
 to modify the revenue laws
 of this country I hc
 President has repeatedly recom mended
 these changes the late Secretary
 of the Treasury resisted Chem
 The chairman of the Committee
 on Finance has resisted a
 modification of the revenue laws
 Nov all the reliances that
 have been put by the
 Senate and the country upon
 the estimates of these officers
 have failed We have been
 incurring debts we have borrowed
 vast sums of money and
 we zu e now told
 that we want 20 000
 000 more to carry us
 through I think to the
 close of the fiscal year
 The time has come for
 action and this Congress should
 not adjourn without passinff a
 well devised rove nuc law
 for the country have no
 time to lose We should
 take up the bill I
 think and act upon it
 to day and send it
 to the Committee on Finance
 to bc thoroughly examined or
 what perhaps Ilia y be
 better if that committee be
 over burdened with labor as
 they may be with the
 numerous appropriation bills from the
 House of Representatives to a
 spectal committee that can give
 thcir days to tho consideration
 of the details ofa measure
 so important to the country
 Mr TRULVIBULL 1 desire simply
 to correct a misapprehension which
 have noticed in the newspapers
 and have heard in the
 Senatc this mormng in regard
 to the political condition of
 parties in this body I
 am quite willing to take
 my share of responsibility but
 I am very un willing
 that the Republican party should
 be held respofisible for what
 passes this Senate or for
 the non acti01 of the
 Senate in regard to important
 mutters when they have no
 power whatever here we have
 been told this morning that
 we should elect a chairman
 of the Finance Committee MT
 hy sir there is a
 majority of six aoainst us
 here in the Senate There
 ai efifty cightpe rsons here
 bolding seals and there are
 but twenty six Republicans rl
 herc are thirty two against
 us We can carry no
 measure wc can elect no
 man upon any com mittee
 I should be very glad
 to find that Sena tors
 upon the other side satisfied
 of the errors of their
 ways were joining with us
 and giving us a majority
 and then I should be
 willing to share my proportion
 of the responsibility and I
 think we should see a
 different class of legislation from
 what has been witnessed in
 the Senate for some time
 past if we had t
 kat majority rose simply to
 correct that niisapprehension so that
 the country should not suppose
 that the responsibility for non
 action or action cither I
 was upon the Republican organization
 in this body It has
 been repeated often it has
 been said that we could
 settle everything in the country
 but we have no power
 to pass anything Thore is
 a workincr majority against us
 upon every ques tio n
 Mr BIGLER know Mr President
 that I have ever witnessed
 an instance in which an
 effort x vas made to
 pass a bill by onc
 body be causc it had
 passcd another and in the
 precise terms in which it
 had been passcd by the
 other that did not lead
 10 delay and danger f
 have all thc while been
 of the opinion that however
 thor in trhe i louse
 of Representatives Senators would Mr
 WILSON It seems to sir
 that we feei that it
 was due to the magnitude
 of the sub have no
 time to lose if it
 be thc purpose of the
 II ject and the obligations
 that rest upon them that
 they should examine it or
 some committee for them in
 order that when it camc
 up here for final disposition
 some Senator or some two
 or three Senators should be
 able to meet every question
 presented in reference to it
 not only as to the
 general theory upon which it
 is based but its practical
 operation and I therefore concur
 mainly in what the Senator
 from Massachusetts has said that
 now we had better take
 up this bill and com
 I do not mean a
 committee mit it to a
 committee acrainst it as would
 be the Committee on Finance
 as heretofore constituted but a
 committee of those who arc
 willing to strike the proper
 medium on this question and
 to act promptly I think
 that can be more safely
 done by a select committee
 of three or five Senators
 and if the Senator from
 Rhode Island Mr SIMMONS who
 is evidently more familiar with
 this subject who from his
 long experience and practical connection
 with the whole question better
 understands it than any other
 member of this body will
 indicate his willingness to commit
 this bill to a select
 committee with the understanding that
 it shall act promptly and
 thor ought y I shall
 vote for that believing that
 in doing so I act
 the part of a true
 friend of that just policy
 which my constituents desire Mr
 SIMMONS I am not one
 of those who choose to
 commit themselves to anything to
 get a question up It
 is my intention If we
 can get this question up
 to make a motion but
 until it comes up I
 do not suppose it is
 necessary to in dicate what
 the motion will be Mr
 BIGLER That is enough Let
 us take it up and
 then let the Senator make
 his motion Mr HUNTER 1
 will only say in regard
 to the action of the
 Committee on Finance upon this
 bill svhile was a member
 of that cornmit tee that
 it will be found that
 it was sent to that
 committee on the 11th and
 returned on the 20th of
 December being in the possession
 of the com mittee only
 nine days and it wras
 returned be cause a majority
 believed that we could not
 at this session pass any
 proper revenue rneasure For onc
 I did not believe that
 the other system had had
 a fair trial We were
 gettin y a larger revenue
 than we had donc for
 many years up to the
 period of these political troubles
 and I have no idea
 that any tariff that ym_l
 can pass will pro duce
 revenue enough until they can
 be settled or pass away
 in some mode I did
 not believe for one therefore
 that this was the proper
 time to act upon it
 and that was reason enough
 foe me without a particular
 examination of the bill to
 vote for its postponement until
 the 4th of March So
 far as the bill is
 concerned I myself did ex
 amine it last session and
 Ido not believe itaffords foundation
 even for a proper rcvenuc
 measure but I know that
 there is a majority in
 the Senate ofa different opinion
 I dare say a special
 com mittee may be a
 very good one to consider
 it Perhaps that is the
 proper direction and I shall
 not resist it The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr BRIGHT T hc
 question is on postponing the
 unfinished business of yesterday for
 the purpose of taking up
 House bill No 338 Mr
 BIGLER Perhaps we can take
 up this bill now by
 common consent Mr CLINGMAN I
 would rather go on with
 the resolutions Mr BIGLER Very
 well let the question be
 put Mr CLINGMAN called for
 the and nays and thev
 w cre ordered Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 desire to have the
 question very distinctly on the
 postponement of the resolutions The
 motion is I believe to
 post pone all tbc preceding
 orders of the day to
 take up this bill Cannot
 I ask to divide the
 question and have it first
 on the postponement The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question is susceptible
 of division and the first
 vote then will be on
 postponing the special order That
 leaves it in the power
 of the Senate to take
 up any other business Mr

 special order being the resolutions
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and then the question wili
 come up as to what
 shall be the business before
 the Senate Mr BIGLER 1
 am aware of that but
 1 de sire to say
 that notwithstanding the division I
 vote to postpone the resolutions
 with the under standing and
 expectation that the tariff bill
 will be immediately taken up
 and committed and then the
 consideration of the resolutions resumed
 I do not consent to
 occupy the attitude of interfer
 ing with the consideration of
 the resolutions The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Senator from Kentucky calls
 for a division of the
 ques tion Hc is entitled
 to it and the Chair
 will con sider the yeas
 and nays as ordered upon

 sir Mr TRUMBULL 1 understand
 tee of the House of

 I know nothing mysclf of
 I know nothing of tho

 there ought it sccms to
 Ine to be some reason
 o iven for addino a
 list of names nt this

 Senator had listened to me
 when I offered the amend
 rnct t hc would have
 un dcrstood the reason why
 I did iFer it The
 amend Ellent of the Senator
 from Loui srana having left
 this matter open entirely and
 changed the char of the
 bill as it camc from
 tbc House a num ber
 of Senators have suggested the
 names of olhcr parties inasmuch
 as it was open to
 subscription They are the names
 of parties whom it would
 be important to have in
 originating and starting this great
 enterprise men of large Wealth
 and experi ence in railroad
 matters r hcy wexe to
 mc by members of thc
 Senate I have no narne
 myselt to propose ut all
 from any i ortion of
 the country certainly none fron
 i r ny own country
 but il was supposed that
 these names would aid in
 orga nizing and starting this
 great enterprise That was my
 reason for offering them should
 not have ofTGrcd any name
 if it had not been
 that the arnendmcnt of Lho
 Senator from Louisiana left iL
 an quest ion fin every

 hooscs to 10 it Mr

 from what States they Mr
 G WIN rl hc persor

 States from which they comc
 Ncw York Ohio and Pennsylvania
 I intended to oflör sorne
 from the State of Illinois
 but as the Senators from
 that State did not acyree
 on the narnes and nobody
 had objected to these I
 have offered them sepa rately
 Those that come fronl Illinois
 I will name afterwards The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FOSTER in
 the chair Is the Senate
 ready for tho ques tion
 on the amendment proposed by
 tho Senator from California to
 insert the names that have
 been mentioned The amendment was
 agreed to Mr GWIN Now
 Mr President 1 offer two
 names from the State of
 Illinois i will state in
 advance that as the Senators
 from that State do not
 acrree about these names I
 offtn them with out any
 feeling on tl le subject
 as to the partics named
 I want to get the
 names of individuals who will
 aid in this great enterprise
 I would not have o
 Fered m y narne as
 the Senators from the Statc
 did not agree upon them
 but it was dc sired
 bv onc of the Senators
 that at least one of
 the names presonte d should
 be offered the other Senator
 did not object to that
 and I have offered both
 of thcrn I noove to
 add at the end of
 the names of Virgil Hickox
 and last unendrnent the Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 move to amend
 the amendment by adding the
 names of William B Ogden
 and Henry Farnham Mr DOUGLAS
 1 may as well state
 very frankly the point of
 difference of opinion on this
 question At the last session
 I think it was when
 this bill was pending in
 the House of Rep resentatives
 a member of the House
 having it in charge came
 to me and told me
 that they wanted a man
 from Illinois They had selected
 one who was a Republican
 and thcy wanted one who
 was a Democrat so as
 to deprive it of any
 partisan character They said they
 had selected the name of
 William B Ogden who was
 a Republican and I considered
 wanted the name of a
 Democrat William B Ogden a
 very proper gentleman and there
 was no objection to him
 I gave them the name
 of John Moore a Democrat
 x vho is a re
 tired politician and has now
 no connection with politics and
 vv110 eminent ly possesses the
 con fidenceofthepeople of the State
 of Illinois When the bit
 catne 1 n here I
 found they had stricken out
 William B Ogden und put
 in the names of three
 very active politicians John Wentworth
 N B J add and
 Mr Hammond There were three
 against one who was not
 an active politician I suggested
 to my colleague that I
 thought this ougb t to
 be stripped of its partisan
 character either by striking out
 the two active politicians Mr
 Went worth and Mr Judd
 and let it stand John
 Moore and Charles G Hammond
 or by putting in two
 others so that if there
 were three on one side
 there would be three on
 the other and thus it
 would be divested of any
 appearance of political partisan ship
 I am willing now to
 strike them all out but
 one on cach side or
 I am willing to make
 it two or three on
 a side but Iam unwilling
 that it shall be made
 a partisan concern by carrying
 partisan politics into it My
 coilcague does not object whey
 110 has in the bill
 three Republicans who are very
 violent partisans and only one
 Democrat He does not object
 to the addition of two
 I cnno c rats to
 l lakc il even but
 he wants put ill two
 tnore Republicans so as aqrain
 to cret the prepon derancc
 I protest against party politics
 con ine into this question
 and for that reason I
 insist either on striking out
 all but ono on each
 side onc I cmocratand one
 Repu blican or Icavincr two
 Democrats and two Republicans or
 three Deni crats and three
 Republicans just as you please
 to keep it even on
 each side Mr TRUMBULL Mr
 President my col league has
 had the advantage of me
 so far as being consulted
 in regard to these names
 is concerrted I never consultcd
 and I did not know
 vhat narnes were inserted in
 the bill until it came
 to the Senate and I
 saw them here I supposed
 those names were selected without
 reference to party and though
 my colleague says they are
 very active partisans I did
 not know the politics of
 Mr Hammond In regard to
 another Mr MT entworth I
 may say that he is
 quite as tnuch of a
 party man on the side
 of my colleague as hc
 is upon ours W c
 do not claim him as
 party man I do not
 I am quite willinc if
 the Senator objects to him
 on party grounds that he
 shall have somebody else He
 certainly is not selected in
 consideration of his party politics
 i had nothing to do
 with his se lection If
 I were selecting men on
 that ground certainly I should
 not have selected him I
 am quite satisfied to let
 the names remain as they
 very well that he has
 been quite as much of
 a party man in hostility
 to Republicanism as he has
 been in its favor Therefore
 if ho proposes to add
 two names I propose two
 other gentlemen They are not
 party men I have named
 those gentlemen Mr Ogden is
 a gentleman largely in terested
 in railroads more so perhaps
 than anv man in the
 State of Illinois a man
 of large means who has
 had a good deal to
 do with the railroad interests
 of the West and he
 is a very proper per
 son independent of any party
 feeling as I pre surne
 my colleague will agree at
 once to be one of
 the corporators in this railroad
 bill The other gentleman named
 Mr Farnham is also a
 rail road man Neither of
 these gentlemen I pre sume
 would be called an active
 partisan although one of them
 is at this time a
 member of the Illi It
 is because they nois State
 central committee are interested in
 the object of this bill
 that I have named them
 and not in consideration of
 any par tisan fcelingswhicheitherof them
 may have The persons named
 by the gentlemen are as
 individ uals unexceptionable so far
 as I know but they
 arc not so exclusively connected
 with the railroad interest s
 of the West as are
 M t Ogden and Mr
 Farnham I have no objection
 to the names of Mr
 Hickox and Mr Higbee being
 inserted but if they are
 about to be put in
 on the ground of their
 being partisans then ask to
 insert two other names of
 persons who are not partisans
 but very worthy men Mr
 DOUGLAS Mr President 1 am
 ishcd at the statement of
 my colleague that Mr Wentwortl
 i is not a Republican
 and a partisan I regard
 him as the most powerful
 and formidable partisan in Illinois
 In northern Illinois he is
 thc very soul of your
 party by far the most
 in fluential and powerful adversary
 that I have per do
 sonally or that the Democratic
 party has not object to
 l is name in this
 bill on that ground He
 is not a railroad man
 He is a partisan but
 I do not object to
 it My colleague has said
 that Mr Hickox was chairman
 of thc Statc Democratic central
 com If hc wished to
 havc been candid he mittce
 would have said that Mr
 Judd was the chairman of
 the Republican State central committee
 in the battlc fighting me
 I think the one balances
 the l do not object
 to Mr Judd on that
 ground but if he is
 sincere in his objection to
 Mr Hickox because he was
 chairman of the Democratic com
 mittee as an honest man
 he is bound to object
 to his own man for
 tbc same reason One wili
 coun tcrbalance the ot hcr
 As to Mr Hammond hc
 savs he does not I
 ao not object to know
 that he is a partisan
 Mr Hammoid f am willing
 to leave him in the
 bill but he is n
 partisan I have reason to
 know that ho not only
 was a partisan but that
 his rail road was a
 partisan railroad In the contest
 of 1856 1 had to
 witness the fact with my
 own eyes that Deuuocrats could
 not ride home frozn a
 mass meeting by his railroad
 unless they rode under the
 Frénnont flag and hundreds of
 men were com pelled to
 go home in unolher way
 rather than submit to the
 humiliation of riding on a
 partisan railroad carrying partisan flags
 on its cars He does
 not know that these men
 are partisans Why you would
 not have had a party
 but for the money and
 the power of these rnen
 Ido not object to them
 on that ground butl want
 the bill stfippcd of its
 partisan character by equalizing it
 came from the House of
 R epresentatives but I say
 to my colieague strike out
 all the names when the
 names of four gentlernen from
 Illinois have been put into
 the bill without any reference
 whatever to politics so far
 as I know for I
 vvyas not consulted on the
 subject I am not quite
 will ing that n y
 colleague shall come into the
 Senate and ask that two
 party Inen shall be put
 in the chair man of
 the Democratic committee of Illinois
 and another violent partisan That
 looks to me a lit
 tle like bringino party into
 the bill Ido not sup
 posc that eitheé of the
 four names in the bill
 ori ginally were selected with
 a view to party but
 it shows that there is
 some party feeling about it
 when it is insisted that
 they must be divided equally
 between the parties I wish
 no party to enter into
 this bill I have not
 been consulted and I had
 nothing to do with the
 selection of the four narnes
 from Illinois but they are
 not parti san so far
 as i know with the
 exception of one Mr Judd
 is a party man and
 known as a Re publican
 MI Wentworth perhaps may be
 re C L iliobcc of
 lilinois il garded as a
 party man but my colleague
 knows but one on cach
 side He may choose one
 and I I vill designate
 John Moore as the Democrat
 If he objects to Ilim
 I will take another He
 may designate a Republican and
 if he is not personally
 I objeclionablc ho may come
 in I will put in
 no man to whom he
 objects He may have a
 veto on my Inan and
 I will have one On
 his Mr FESSENDEN Then you
 will never get anybody in
 Mr DOUGLAS Yes 1 will
 He may take William B
 Odgen the man whom he
 eulogizes so much I do
 not object to hirn He
 may take Mr Hammond whose
 politics he does not know
 I do not object to
 him He Inay take the
 partisan chairman of his committee
 Mr Judd I will not
 object to him but will
 just offset anothcr man against
 him If he takes the
 chairman of his com mittee
 I will talcc the chairman
 of ours leaves off the
 chairman of his committee I
 will leave off the chairman
 of ours I want the
 bill stripped of its party
 character I never dreamed 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 523 of
 putti1P a party man into
 the board and when suggested
 old John Moore I did
 so because he is not
 an active politician and because
 retired from politics he was
 selected by the unan imous
 vote of the State as
 the trustee to hold the
 I want no party char
 Illinois Central road trust I
 will agree to strike out
 all the acter in the
 bill names from Illinois or
 I will agree to put
 in a man on each
 side or two on side
 or three on a side
 equalizing it that is all
 I ask The Senate now
 can vote on the first
 two names Then if these
 are put in he can
 renew the others but I
 give notice that I shall
 renew name for name until
 they are equalized cither by
 striking out or bv adding
 to the names in the
 bill Mr WILSON Mr President
 1 regret that we should
 have anything said here about
 Illinois party politics or the
 party politics of any other
 State in regard to this
 railroad The Senator from Louisiana
 Mr RENJA MIN offered an
 arnend ment the other day
 which was adopted to this
 matter open to everybody in
 the country who I must
 confess I do not see
 chose to come in any
 particular reason to c han
 re that provision but if
 it is thought best to
 change it and to con
 fine it to certain persons
 named in the bill I
 do not care a fig
 what the politics of the
 men are who are to
 go in it If I
 could have ten ova hundred
 or a thousand or ten
 thousand good names of men
 who are ready to put
 their money into that road
 and use their influence to
 construct it I would never
 ask whether they were of
 one polit ica party or
 the other The great point
 is to get men of
 talent of influence men of
 money to take hold of
 and build this road and
 with all the in ducernents
 that are in this bill
 Iam not sure that that
 class of men will invcst
 their money or give their
 time to the construction of
 this road But sir if
 we arc to put names
 in the bill 1 hope
 we shall l iave no
 wranglin here about thcir party
 politics but shall select men
 of influence inen who have
 means rnen who can command
 rncans rnen who can command
 influences to bring money for
 the construction of the road
 Now there ara three names
 from my State mentioned in
 the bill and I never
 stop to ask what their
 pol In looking over them
 I have the im itics
 are pression that one of
 them belongs to the Repub
 lican party There are other
 names that I would be
 glad to sec in that
 bill and if we are
 to put I would names
 in propose to put some
 there propose Mr John M
 Forbes a gentleman who one
 of the largest owners of
 railroads in the country he
 is interested in the Michigan
 the St Joseph and other
 roads hc is a man
 of great ability of business
 character of wealth and of
 There is Mr position in
 every other respect Chester W
 Chapin president of the Western
 rail road of my own
 State a Democrat of Democrats
 I care nothing about his
 politics Then thero is Mr
 Genncry Twitcheli president of the
 Wor cester road rnan of
 great visror and great cn
 erg y and E Elasket
 Derby who has written more
 in regard to this Pacific
 railroad and rail roads in
 this country and who understati
 ls the whole railroad interest
 of this country perhaps better
 than any man in it
 or as well as any
 un less it be Mr
 Poor of New York Then
 there is Mr Samuel Hooper
 an eminent merchant of Boston
 a man largely engaged in
 railroads should like to see
 such names go into the
 bill 1 could pick thenl
 out in Iny own State
 and section of country by
 the hundred and I would
 not stop to ask what
 their politics arc All I
 want to know is will
 these men cive their time
 will they con tribute their
 means will they use their
 influence to get the means
 to construct this Pacific railroad
 That is all the question
 I ask and it is
 all any of us ought
 to ask here Mr I
 RU MBULL 1 agree with
 the Senator from Massachusetts entirely
 that the party pol ities
 of the gen tletnen named
 here should have nothing to
 do with the bill and
 they had not so far
 as I know anything about
 it until my col Icague
 came in and asked us
 to put in men as
 party men Mr DOUGLAS 1
 beg pardon Mr TRUMBULL That
 is the reason Hc put
 it on the ground that
 there were not as many
 Democrats there as Republicans and
 he made his proposition tor
 the purpose of havilV party
 men Mr DOUGLAS 1 beg
 pardon 1 have not I
 stated that I pro proposed
 them as partisans posed to
 my colleague privately the objection
 that it had a partisan
 character It has Mr Hickox
 to whom he objects has
 had more f o do
 with rail roads or as
 much as any man in
 Illinois He has been identified
 with t he St Louis
 and Chicago railroad from its
 beginning He is a thorough
 railroad man The men that
 1 propose have as much
 to do with railroads as
 the men he proposes Mr
 TRUMBULL Mr President my col
 league has made his speech
 and the vvhole bur dcn
 of it is and nothing
 else that he wants these
 men herc as party men
 He says he is willing
 to strike them all out
 but two but he wants
 man fbr rnan as partisans
 That is the very object
 of th is motion the
 very burden of it and
 nothingelse Why object to the
 bill as it came from
 the House when one man
 is named in regard to
 whose pol itics I never
 heard if it is not
 for party consider ations What
 is his speech Who has
 dragged parties into the Senate
 here and urged that man
 for man should go into
 the bill as corporators because
 of party feeling as if
 men could not build a
 railroad unless they were Democrats
 I stated that I had
 nothing to do with the
 names that were put in
 this bill and never knew
 who they vere until the
 bill came here But the
 most extraordinary statement is made
 here that Mr John Moore
 is not a partisan Why
 sir I know Mr John
 Moore very well and a
 bitterer partisan there is not
 in the State He used
 to be Lieutenant Governor of
 the Slate have no objection
 to his Ile is a
 good Inan going into this
 railroad company but you will
 find that he was at
 all your party meetings for
 the last twenty years As
 the men who have already
 been selected have been selected
 without reference to party certainly
 so far as I know
 anything about it and my
 colleague was consulted and l
 was not if men are
 to bc added because of
 polit icai considerations I have
 named two gentlemen because my
 colleague has narned two but
 I am well enough satisfiZ
 l with the bill But
 he gets up a dispute
 as to Mr Wcntworth s
 politics and he says he
 is the champion of Rc
 publican ism Well I arn
 not disposed to discuss Mr
 Wentworth s politics nor do
 1 carc whether he is
 in the bill or not
 John Moore is a Demo
 crat Thero arc but four
 mums there and if Mr
 Wentworth is such a partisan
 that you are afraid of
 him take him out and
 put in somebody else that
 the Seriator fronl fllinois I
 prefer however should not select
 party rncn for Inc But
 he says that Mr I
 lamilton is a party Xian
 and hc speaks of the
 railroads 110 a person Illinois
 who knows its politics as
 I do who has traveled
 all over the State and
 on all the railroads and
 has seen the influence of
 the railroads in clcc tions
 operating acrainst the Republican party
 cverywhere who has scen the
 Democrats carried on frec tickets
 all over thc State when
 Republi cans have been paying
 their it is to Ine
 a most astonishing accusation But
 I do not want to
 go into thcsc partisan questions
 and I am sorry they
 are dragged in here in
 reference to a great measure
 like this for the building
 a Pacific railroad I look
 upon it as a very
 small Inatter and i was
 quite willing that the names
 should remain as they were
 The names were selected I
 presume without any reference to
 party and I am williF
 g they shall stand as
 they are now But since
 In y colleague has talked
 about party and putting in
 partisans if there is any
 importance to bc attached to
 it when hc puts in
 his two party men to
 whom I do not object
 if others are to go
 in let I 1is two
 men cro in but let
 Mr Ogden and Mr Farnham
 also go in who are
 men that ought to be
 in the bill irrespective of
 any partisan considerations whatever Mr
 DOUGLAS Mr President 1 do
 not wish to prolong this
 debate There is nothing more
 objectionable to than a debate
 of this kind upon party
 politics on a bill of
 this descrip lion I went
 to iny colleague and told
 him that out reference to
 party Ihappen to know they
 were selected with reference to
 party W heri I was
 consulted it was stated that
 they had selected William B
 Ogden on the one side
 and waited a man on
 the other I gave them
 John Moore He is just
 as unobjectionable as Mr Ogden
 He isa Democrat Mr Ogden
 is a Republican John Moore
 is out of offce Mr
 Ogden is a Republi can
 member of the Legislature now
 the nominec of his party
 at the last election I
 reckon he is not without
 politics He was seiectcd for
 the purpose of voting for
 my colleague and he dis
 charged the duty Then they
 want to put in two
 men who have no claim
 on earth but as partisans
 John Wentworth and N P
 Judd men that 1 have
 reason to believe would never
 allow an engi neer or
 a contractor or a subordinate
 to work on a railroad
 they had control of if
 they did not avree with
 them in politics if they
 could prevent it I havc
 never known more unscrupulous men
 in politics than they are
 Mr TRUMBULL Why not take
 Wentworth Out if you want
 to do so Mr DOUGLAS
 Ah now he says that
 Went worth is not a
 good Republican of his stamp
 and Judd is He is
 willing to take Wentworth out
 Why is hc not willing
 that I should take Judd
 out If he is not
 governed by politics why not
 Ict Judd come out as
 well as Wentworth The reason
 is this is as good
 a Republi can as colleague
 but he is the enemy
 of my colleague and Judd
 and Wentworth both are mortal
 enemies of myself That is
 the difference My colleague wishes
 to get Wentworth out as
 a matter of personal revenge
 on Wentworth because he cannot
 control him in his party
 I scorn all this Strike
 thcm all out leave the
 State without any and I
 shall be satisfied Put in
 a man that is not
 objectionablc on the score of
 politics and I shall be
 satisfied I repeat I will
 not vote to put in
 a man that my colleague
 says is an im I
 will take Mr Ogden or
 Mr Ham proper one ilt0E
 or Mr Farnham They are
 Republicans but they are railroad
 men as well as Republicans
 or I will take men
 on the other side I
 consider this effort to keep
 the preponderance in that State
 asa deliberate attempt to turn
 the Pacific railroad into a
 partisan scheme 1 felt bound
 to protest against this party
 scheme in the beginnill did
 it privately to my colleague
 because I did not want
 it to come publicly into
 thc Senate the tenacity with
 which my colleague insists upon
 a Republican majority in that
 board shows me I that
 the information I received was
 right shows me that it
 is a scheme to make
 a party machine out of
 the Pacific railroad and that
 the interests of the road
 are to be sacrificed for
 partisan ur I will vote
 for equalizing it and if
 t ere poses IS any
 suspicion of party politics in
 reference to tbc narncs in
 other States I will vote
 to equalize them in cvery
 instancc so that they cannot
 be It is not accidental
 that used for party purposes
 I have a reason to
 be this thing has been
 done It has more in
 it than lieve that it
 is a design appears upon
 the face of it And
 yet my aversion to uttering
 a word on party politics
 in connection with the railroad
 induced me to go my
 coileague and point out this
 objection and ask him quietly
 to consult with his Republican
 friends and adjust I hope
 the Senate now will strip
 this the nmtter bill of
 a party character The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr in chair Is
 the Senate ready for the
 qnes tion on the arnendment
 proposed by the Senator from
 Caiifornia Mr BENJAMIN 1 am
 at in voting upon this
 amendment and dcsire to know
 whether it would be in
 order to move fora special
 committee with power to send
 for persons and papers to
 examine this question that has
 arisen between thc two Senators
 from Illinois The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Chair thinks not without
 committing the bill to them
 at this looked as if
 was a party machine so
 far as the same time
 IHinois was concerned and I
 proposed to him privately not
 to have a word in
 the Senate to strike out
 all but two men or
 else put in two on
 a sidc or three on
 a side and pledged him
 that would not name a
 man that he objected to
 that hc might veto any
 man that was narned IVIy
 object was to cret those
 that had no politics or
 to neutralize the politics but
 hc would not consent He
 talks about these men being
 selected with Mr BENJAMIN I
 have not the information to
 enable me to vote The
 Senators disagree with each other
 in relation to some of
 these individ uals If we
 could get at the facts
 of the case by a
 proper and thorough investigation it
 would be probably a very
 profitable use of the powers
 of the Scnatc The bill
 as it now stands provides
 for certain commissioners to receive
 subscrip tions and allows anybody
 that chooses to j01n them
 As the bill originally stood
 before the 524 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 23 amendment that
 I had the honor to
 offer was adopted it seemed
 to me very much like
 a job it had all
 the föatures of a job
 and if I had wanted
 a personal interest in the
 bill I do not know
 that could havc devised a
 better scheme than draw ing
 up the bill just as
 it was drawn by which
 I would name friends to
 whom all these grants were
 to be made by Congress
 and then give them the
 power to let in such
 parties as they should pick
 out If I had a
 direct personal interest in getting
 into a job of this
 kind I think I should
 consider that a very ingenious
 and satisfactory mode of accomplishing
 the object The bill looked
 to me exactly that way
 and I therefore offered the
 amendment which the Senate thought
 proper to adopt But now
 since that amendment has been
 adopted of what earthly consequence
 is it if you have
 any names in the bill
 at all or have them
 all Democratic orall Republican Everybody
 now has a right to
 join the scheme The only
 ques tion that will ever
 be asked ofa man who
 wishes to subscribe is whether
 he has got the money
 to put up and hence
 I cannot for my life
 conceive tn what way this
 party question can come up
 But as the Senators from
 Illinois do seem to at
 tach importance to it and
 there is something prob ably
 concealed tinder it which the
 rest of the Sen ate
 cannot see and upon which
 I for one an I
 totally unable to vote without
 further investiga tion I wish
 some gentleman skilled in the
 rules of the Senate would
 provide the means by which
 we can have a full
 report on the subject bcfore
 being called on to vote
 arming the committee of course
 v rith full powers to
 get this important in formation
 and spread it before us
 For myself I do not
 under f shall have to
 decline to vote stand tho
 subject suffciontly Mr DOUGLAS I
 nm satisfied the Senator fronl
 Louisiana does not understand it
 and not Qildcrst andil gr
 it it might havc becn
 propcr ihr him to have
 remained silent or to have
 come out rnaking openly instead
 of are other su bjcc
 ts that cotnrnitte es n
 igllt as well in vc
 sti ratc as the one
 to which he re ers
 Iscorn the that thcrc is
 anything under this I wish
 to strip this thåt chose
 to engage in it bill
 of every provision that makes
 a job for any body
 and strip it of cvery
 feature that makes it a
 political machine and put it
 into the hands of railroad
 men to manage it upon
 railroad princi ples and not
 with a view to politics
 and then we can have
 a Pacific railroad I protest
 against every partisan feature every
 private feature that makes a
 monopoly of it I hrow
 it open to all the
 people of the United States
 and I am satisfied I
 am willing now that the
 Senate shall vote on the
 propositio n to insert the
 two additional names of corporators
 offered by the Senator from
 California having the bill in
 charge that will equalize it
 or to equalize it in
 any other way for the
 sole If my col purpose
 of depriving it of politics
 league says that any one
 of the men offered is
 objectionable I will waive him
 This is all I have
 to say PRESIDING OFFICER put
 the question on the amendment
 and a division was called
 for Mr BENJAMIN 1 do
 not understand that any objection
 was made to thc motion
 of the Sen ator from
 California by anybody Mr DOUGLAS
 Will the indulge me an
 instant A friend suggests to
 me that after thc explanation
 of the Senator from Louisiana
 I owe it to him
 to say that the imputation
 which Havin0 misappre I made
 was unwarranted hcndcd the tcnor
 of his remarks a friend
 suggests i that that statement
 is duc to hirn and
 whatever is due under thc
 circunxstances of course I take
 pleasure in tenderinm Mr G
 WIN Is the question on
 inserting the names I offered
 beyot ld what has been
 stated in open Seriate and
 that is the design of
 stvripping the bill of its
 party I scorn the itnpu
 tation and I would character
 scorn myself if I base
 enough to make such I
 say it had the appearance
 of party and I wish
 to strip it of that
 by equaliz He says cannot
 conceive how a man could
 possibly feel any interest sincc
 his tunend I voted for
 his amendment ment was adopted
 to open it to the
 whole world so that it
 should not be Mr BENJAMIN
 from certainly did not hear
 what I said or his
 remarks are very extraordinary PRESIDING
 OFFICER sen ator litinois rive
 way to the Senator froxn
 Louisiana Mr DOUGLAS Certainly Mr
 BENJAMIN 1 adopted coa d
 conceive of no ment had
 naxues off Mlquiriuo in the
 carthly Y notivc ror jcrsons
 to bc inserted in this
 bill Inight an in terogt
 that no Elian could conceive
 I said prior to the
 ad o l tion of
 the anu nchnent I conceive
 of some motive Senators migh
 t I never said tliat
 have in 100 K ing
 into he names since the
 l iil has been ch
 uutt d in that resoect
 any Senator possii fy could
 have any dishonest I do
 not know whct he r
 the Senator an motive but
 the line of his remarks
 rne or not I will
 not indicate either a misapprehension
 or saw what sir I
 desire to hear the Senator
 fur ther before J say
 anything rnore Mr DOUGLAS well
 sir all I have to
 say on that point is
 that I have avowed In
 y purpose i to be
 to strip it of its
 partisan character drew I that
 inference from the face of
 the itself I had approached
 my colleague and asked him
 pri vately to c orrect
 it so as not to
 have thc matter thought that
 the brought before the Senate
 Senator from Louisiana intimated that
 there was an 10t crest
 somewhcrc IM BENJAMIN Not so
 Mr DOUGLAS Then of course
 1 have nothing to sav
 on that point but I
 supposed him to nake t
 ho insilluatton I voted for
 the amend ment of that
 Senator so that it should
 be impossi Lor any Senator
 or of wealth to have
 an interest which i as
 not cquaily open to every
 man The PRESIDING OFFICER That
 is the question before the
 Senate Mr POLK I should
 like to know what the
 nanuus are l he amend
 Pho PRESIDING OFFICER ment is
 to insert the names of
 Virffil Hickox and C L
 I iigbee of Illinois on
 a division the I he
 question bein r taken ayes
 V rerc thirteen and when
 the noes we re culled
 for several Seriators said Give
 it up PRESIDING OFFICER The

 iU TMBULL How can it
 adopted by thirteen votes PRESiDING
 OFFICER The Chair derstood that
 the neoativc side gavc it
 up Mr ERIJMB JLL 1
 lid not give it up
 Mu DOUGLAS My will either
 I protest a yainst his
 right to Sit it or
 vote his seat uud destroy
 a quorunl and then say
 he does not Rive it
 up The OFFICER is only
 but thcre we rc ifpstly
 a quorum present thirteen Senators
 voting Those all voted in
 the aflirlnative and the uhair
 understood fron l what was
 said that the negative side
 gave it up Si ill
 the a rnendment is not
 carried a majority of a
 a l trn and the
 question must be put again
 Mr Is there a dispute
 about these other names Mr
 rrRUMBULL 1 will state that
 this is of the Senator
 from California to add the
 two party gentlemen to those
 already in tho bill from
 the Sta tc of Illinois
 I also a motion to
 add two other Qyentlemen not
 however but as very proper
 persons to as into bill
 I he vote IS now
 on the amendment of thc
 Senat or fron k California
 to add the nan cs
 of these two partisans to
 the bilL I think the
 bill is well enough as
 it is Thcrc arc names
 enough in it and thc
 narucs were inscrte l without
 any party intent as far
 as I know anything about
 it fact I did not
 know MY hose names xvcre
 in it u 10 til
 I saw the bill after
 it had been brought here
 from the House OF Representatives
 I think it would be
 just as well to leave
 the bill as it is
 but if these two names
 be put in then I
 insist on two others o
 oing in IVIr DOUGLAS Mr
 Mr GWIN Will the Senator
 permit me 1 wish to
 ask the Senator frotn Illinois
 the other side docs hc
 say that propose these two
 names as part y Inen
 Mr TRUMBULL No that the
 Senator frorn pronoses the amendment
 for that reason but the
 speech of my colleague shows
 the Mr GWIN say in
 show that so far as
 1 am concerned my name
 ought not to be brought
 into consideration in this matter
 that I consulted both the
 Senators frorn Illinois and I
 stated when I offered the
 amendment that they had differed
 in opinion and I left
 it to the Senate Mr
 TRUMBULL Undoubtedly the Senator from
 California had no such design
 I am speak I inM
 merely of the effect of
 the speech Mr DOUGLAS I
 will try to harmonizc this
 matter I s vill ask
 the Senator from California to
 withdraw his motion to insert
 those names and substitute for
 it a motion to strike
 out the two partisans named
 in the bill to wit
 Tohn Went worth and N
 B Judd leaving in two
 railroad men for Illinois Mr
 G WIN I am rather
 afraid I shall get into
 a scrape if I make
 any motion of that kind
 Mr DOUGLAS If the Senator
 withdraws his amendment I will
 make it Mr G WIN
 I withdraw the amendment Mr
 DOUGLAS I move to strike
 out John so that it
 will Wentworth and B Judd
 stand then with two gentlemen
 from Illinois Mr Hammond and
 Mr Moore to wham nobody
 objects Mr TRUMBULL 1 trust
 that will not be done
 Mr LANE I believe it
 is in order to move
 to amend the amendment Mr
 DOUGLAS Oh no Mr LANE
 I want to strike out
 another name Mr DOUGLAS That
 can be done after wards
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on the amendment of
 the Senator from Illinois to
 strike out the two names
 mentioned by him Mr DOUGLAS
 On that 1 ask for
 the yeas aud nays The
 yeas and nays were ordered
 IV lr YVILSON i wish
 to make a suggestion to
 the Senator from California who
 takes so much interest in
 this bill As the Senate
 has adopted an amendment that
 Icts every man in tho
 United States into this enterprise
 w no chooses to encracre
 in it why is it
 necessary to put anybody k
 nan le in tho bill
 The suggestion I want to
 make is Illis had not
 the Senate better order the
 vote put ting in those
 gentlemen from the State of
 New Y 07k to be
 reconsidered drop this whole question
 and let the names stand
 as they came from the
 I louse of Representatives in
 the bill Mr DOUGLAS No
 sir 1 satisfied that those
 namcs werc packed for partisan
 purposes and I do not
 meun that this shall be
 a party chine Mr BRAGG
 I can give a good
 reason think to the Senator
 frotn Massachusetts whv some names
 ought to go there and
 why the names ought to
 be thosc of proper persons
 The reason which E gavo
 to thc Senate the other
 day sub scant ia ly
 and I bcq to be
 excused for repeating it is
 this the tit le tb
 the property and the bonds
 set aside by this bill
 ihr the building of the
 rail road docs not vest
 until certain acts of Incorpo
 ration arc passed and until
 the parties arc incor poratcd
 and in the noe an
 time they go on aud
 select the lands on whole
 line of tl 0 railroad
 locate the lil le and
 report it to tbc President
 and when they become incorporated
 and build fifty miles of
 railroad then thov get the
 right to the bonds and
 the lands So the Senator
 will see that it is
 very Important to have proper
 persons nan led ill the
 bill Mr WILSON well then
 1 think the sen ator
 from Iiiinois had bcttcr not
 ve to strike out thcsc
 names but to add sornc
 other n es Do not
 let PS strike out names
 that the I louse of
 Representatives have put in I
 care However fino about it
 and shall not consume the
 time of tile Senate upon
 it Mr DOUGLAS If the
 other side of the House
 will add proper namcs to
 equalizc it so as to
 deprive the zneasure of a
 party character 1 will agree
 to it Mr GYVIN I
 have a word to say
 in reply to what the
 Senator from Massachusetts statcd So
 far as arn concerned I
 never sewgcst cd one name
 in either House and I
 only offered the amendment at
 the suo cyestion of other
 Senators I should have taken
 the bill as it carne
 t he House of Representatives
 if I could get it
 but at the sug estion
 of Senators I proposed to
 insert the names of men
 who it was supposed would
 be eminently useful in starting
 this great enterprjsc 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 525 I would
 adopt the suggestion of the
 Senator from i Government for
 party purposes in regard to
 the Massachusetts if in my
 judgment it did not Pacific
 railroad You have either got
 to equalize it or leave
 it with a party character
 probably interfere with and jeopardize
 the bill Mr FITCH There
 is some force in what
 the Mr SIMMONS 1 never
 for a very high Senator
 from Massachusetts says We can
 well office and i do
 not know the politics of
 people all insert additional names
 The very object sought I
 ovcr this country I supposed
 this bill was made for
 by the Senator from Illinois
 Mr DOUGLAS up of railroad
 men and capitalists in the
 House svould not be attained
 by striking out names these
 gentlemen have entered into an
 association and understand each other
 there is a clause of
 the bili which permits them
 to let in other corpo
 rators but they cannot vote
 out those whose names we
 insert That course therefore will
 be the only one which
 will attain the object sought
 by the Senator from Illinois
 Mr WILSON I would suggest
 then to the Senator from
 likinois or to the Senators
 from ll linois that they
 drop this matter and that
 they arrano e such names
 as they can agree upon
 to go into the bill
 and present them here and
 we svill take whoever they
 want Mr DOUGLAS stated to
 the Senate and repeat again
 that I have proposed to
 my col league that he
 and his Rephblican friends may
 acyree upon one name two
 names or three names as
 few or as as they
 please and submit thun to
 us and if they are
 not objectionable we will takcthem
 and we in turn will
 submit names to them and
 they may reioct any that
 are objec tionable and tl
 ley IY ay either have
 one man that is not
 obnoxious or two 01 three
 as they please I am
 willing to leave out the
 Stale or none at all
 entirely All I ask is
 that it shall be equalized
 or all stricken out I
 proposed this privately to my
 colleague because I did not
 want to bring it he
 fore the Senate Mr I
 RUMBULL I think there was
 great force in what thc
 Senator fi oun Louisiana said
 a few minutes acro i
 thought his remarks were very
 appropriat e on this alternpt
 to bring in con siderations
 of a party character upon
 a bill of this kind
 but now it is proposed
 here and I am sorry
 to sce the Senator from
 Massachusetts proposing it that we
 criter into a bargain one
 Democrat and one Republican Mr
 WILSON 1 did not say
 so Mr TRUMBULL 1 want
 nothing to do with I
 want good men in this
 bill Who such a thing
 ever talked about the politics
 of t hese men until
 my colleague dragged it in
 here I am willing that
 thc bill should stay as
 it is hat is not
 sat isfactory to my colleague
 He says sorne of these
 men are party men I
 disagree with him as to
 their boing Republicans but he
 wants to select for us
 Reymblicans We have got ill
 here that he says are
 Republicans Strike out whoru you
 plc ase but if you
 want a selection ot Re
 13 1i licans suppose you
 are not going to select
 I have t nld him
 if he for us orn
 the other side wants to
 strike out t l le
 name of Wentworth to nannc
 his man and put him
 in his place and then
 you will have an equal
 number of Democrats and Repu
 N r I OUGLAS i
 will try to agroc on
 this I now tnove to
 strike out both of the
 partisans in the bill from
 Ilfinois and t l lcn
 leave it a man on
 each side Mr SIN IMONS
 I wish to suggest the
 impro priety of having the
 yeas and nays on striking
 out men s nanu s
 which were put in here
 proba blv without any design
 and putting them on trial
 here and voting them out
 of an incorporation when they
 know nothing about it and
 have no chance to defend
 thcrnsclves You propose to select
 out herc some mcn whose
 names have been inserted in
 this railroad bill as fit
 to attend to the starting
 of the road to try
 them and turn them out
 on the yeas and nays
 when tnoy are not here
 1 think it is iknproper
 and to defend themselves Representatives
 to give character to the
 enter prise and confidence to
 those who are to put
 it m operation I have
 got four names here that
 at the request of tho
 Senator from California was going
 to propose so as to
 have somebody in each State
 togive character and to start
 the thmg That is all
 the reason I have for
 it I hope of all
 things that we shall not
 enryac e in this busi
 ness of picking out names
 and reflecting upon men who
 have been selected perhaps without
 their knowledge though I do
 not know anything about that
 Why shall we make reflections
 upon them because they happen
 to be on one side
 or the other of politics
 I would not give acent
 for It this stock is
 to be a man s
 politics in this bill opened
 to everybody to be subscribed
 for all over the country
 how are you going to
 prevent men of both parties
 frorn going into it If
 they have the money to
 pay they will como in
 if they want to do
 so It is very unpleasant
 to talk about the party
 politics of men whose names
 arc in u bill like
 this and especially to have
 a vote about it them
 out of the concern and
 an effort to drive when
 perhaps they have been written
 to to have their names
 putin without any particular desire
 on their part and all
 this because they do not
 If they had happen to
 suit sm nebody s politics
 not in I should not
 have cared anything about it
 but I do not want
 t o turn them out
 Mr W LSON 1 understand
 the motion to be to
 strike out two names on
 which the yeas and navs
 have been ordered I hope
 the Senator from Illinois will
 not put itin that form
 and that ve shall not
 strike out anybody s name
 be his party politics what
 they may and if he
 wants the yeas and nays
 upon the admissioh of the
 names proposed by the Senator
 from California let the question
 be taken in that way
 I will vote for tho
 admission of any respectable naan
 in A mcrica be his
 polities what they may into
 this that any Senator desires
 to have Inserted bill Now
 a Single word in regard
 to the advice I gave
 which is not taken that
 tille two Senators from Illinois
 should arrange thig rnatler not
 rnean that they should arrange
 it on political grounds but
 that they might have sotnc
 consult ation and rnelltion such
 names from Illinois as they
 thought would con tribute to
 the building of this road
 and I will vote cheerfully
 for w l ioever they
 propose Mr BENJAMIN Will the
 Senator permit me to ask
 him a question Mr TRUMBULL
 Certainly Mr BENJAMIN It is
 whether he has any objection
 to these names Mr TRUMBULL
 None to the individuals but
 if you put these in
 I muSt propose as men
 to insert others I think
 we had better leave thre
 bill as it is Mr
 FITCH 1 think the remarks
 of the Sen ator from
 Illinois Mr TRUMBULL are ofa
 vei y refreshingly disinterested character
 politically I Ie objects to
 the proposition of his colleague
 to insert two other names
 because as he alleges they
 are partisan politicians in other
 words be cause they are
 opposed to himself when a
 perusal of the names already
 in the bill will satisfy
 any gcntleman that partisan politics
 has had an over whelming
 influence ih the selection of
 these names grom beginning to
 end Mr GRIMES Will the
 Senator tell me the politics
 of any one of the
 four from the State of
 Iowa Mr FITCH 1 do
 not pretend to know any
 tiling about Iowa but I
 presume if the Senator hinnself
 was consulted he took good
 care to in sert staunch
 Republicans Mr GRIMES The Senator
 from Iowa was not consulted
 nor any man in the
 Senate so far as he
 knows in regard to the
 Iowa names which I know
 the present politics of are
 in the bill and he
 is u Democrat only one
 of the men Mr So
 far as those in Indiana
 are concerned they are all
 Republicans and yet I recotynize
 the propriety of the names
 of three of them being
 there because they arc railroad
 men and I believe them
 to be very fair men
 I hard think they would
 permit their partisan po itics
 to control their action in
 the management of this con
 l here is another who
 is certainly not the ccrn
 man for the place unless
 he is put there as
 a par tisan politician If
 the motion of the Senator
 from Illinois is carried I
 shall move to strike out
 his and insert another Mr
 TRUMBULL Is in order to
 move to amend the tunendment
 by adding two narnes more
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 He thinks it is in
 order to move the thinks
 not addition of any other
 names as an amendment to
 the bill but not by
 way of amendment to the
 amendment Mr IIRUMBULL If the
 vote can be taken upon
 these two names may it
 not be taken upon halfa
 dozen The PRESIDING OFFICER It
 may be Mr rl RüMBULL
 Then move to amend the
 amendment by adding the names
 of William I B Ogden
 and Henry Farnham the names
 I men Nrr I OUGLAS
 I wish the Senator to
 un do E stand that
 I have made that proposition
 to my tionéd before colleaguc
 two or three times before
 the bill camel Mr DOUGLAS
 I ask whether you call
 go and urged him to
 acn ee to some mode
 of it so as to
 avoid a controversy in the
 He would not do it
 Senate The question being taken
 by yeas and nays upon
 the amendment of Mr DOUGLAS
 to strike out the names
 of John Wentworth and N

 So the amendment was rejected
 Mr DOUGT AS I now
 renewthc amendment on indefinitely adding
 names in that way It
 so I can keep on
 adding names to those proposed
 by my colleague and so
 on Ccrtainly if his amend
 ment is in order we
 can amend that by adding
 other names The vote must
 be taken it seems to
 nu i on adding the
 two names which I have
 pro posed and then on
 the two names proposed by
 him You cannot vote on
 thc four at once The
 question now is whether the
 two names proposed by me
 shall be inserted Mr DOOLITTLE
 1 want to inquire of
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 DouG1 xs whether the two
 men he has named are
 railroad rnen cap italists in
 Illinois I do not know
 the n en myself but
 the other two names suggested
 by his col league i
 do know Mr DOUGLAS They
 arc both very respect ablc
 gentlemen They are not obnoxious
 like oftbeSenator from California to
 insert the names the two
 I move to strike out
 but very respecta ble gentlemen
 and if my colleague had
 proposed hope the Senat 01
 from Illinois will not pursue
 of Virgil Hickox and C
 L Higbce of Illinois to
 see whether the Senate is
 willing to equalize the to
 insert the two named by
 him I should agree I
 do not know the men
 it to it at once
 The only point is that
 I object Mr DOUGLAS If
 the Senator will help me
 matter by this addition not
 to thc men themselves but
 to the attempt to IVIr
 TRUMBULL am very sorry to
 take to vote in two
 men so as to deprive
 it of its par up
 any ruore tirne in regard
 to this matter but I
 give this measure a partisan
 character as far as tisan
 character I shall be contex
 t I do not want
 Illinois is concerned I have
 reason to believe to strike
 out any names but this
 refusing to strike trust those
 names NV ill not be
 inscrtcd after the II scene
 we have had in the
 Senate to day No that
 they put in and selected
 and conned out partisans when
 the Inotion is made thQf1
 body thought of rnaking a
 party bill out Of this
 over for that express purpose
 and I cannot con refusino
 to add men to balance
 it when that Ino t
 iou is made and talking
 acrainst party will not do
 Every man lio will not
 go for equalizing it and
 thereby strippin it of its
 partisan charac ter makes a
 record in favor of a
 political machine for this railroad
 Ithere is no use in
 trying to It is an
 attempt to make this a
 polit disguise it icar machine
 to prostitute the revenues of
 this that I anl aware
 of until In y colleague
 dragged it ceive why there
 is such pertinacity in my
 col in here and I
 think when names are Ijroughtin
 for league s ad herence
 to them unless it is
 fora party the purpose of
 having one Democrat and one
 Re prtrpose M r TRUMBULL
 I know my colleague s
 II publican on each side
 we had better discounte b
 Icavc the bill as it
 i persistency determined to have
 the last word nanc e
 the wh020 thincr came from
 the I loase of Representatives
 in that h and to
 state things in a way
 that creates a wrong I
 trust these names will not
 bc inserted impression upon the
 country He has been told
 i respect 526 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 23 repeatedly to
 day and I tell him
 now again for the last
 time that if he desires
 to have two Dem ocrats
 there and two Republicans he
 may take outa man that
 he says is a Republican
 and equal ize it and
 let him hold his peace
 about partisan feeling if ho
 is not willing to do
 it He can make them
 equal turo and two at
 any moment he de sires
 to do so He can
 put either of his men
 in place of Mr Wentworth
 so far as I am
 con cerned and I have
 told him so halfa dozen
 times Then it is not
 to equalize that is not
 what you want put it
 upon some other ground If
 you want to make them
 equal you can make them
 equal so far as I
 am concerned at any moment
 But he wants to add
 two persons I make no
 ob jection to Mr Hickox
 or Mr Higbee as gen
 tlcmen but neither of them
 is a capitalist They are
 both politicians One of them
 used to have some connection
 with a railroad I believe
 as a sortofft eightagent but
 they arc respectable men and
 I have no objection to
 them as Individuals Mr DOUGLAS
 I do not wish to
 move to strike out I
 was willing to leave in
 the names t hat were
 in the bill and to
 add a sumcient num ber
 to equalize them between the
 two parties If my colleague
 now will move to strike
 out any one or will
 designate which one of the
 Republi cans may be stricken
 out then if that will
 satisfy him I will move
 to strike him out and
 put a Democrat in his
 place Let him designate the
 man of the three who
 shall be stricken out and
 I will make the motion
 Mr TRUMBULL 1 have told
 vou repeat edly that you
 might strike out Mr Wentworth
 if you wished Mr DOUGLAS
 Then I withdraw the pre
 v oas amendment and movo
 to strike out John Wentworth
 and insert Viroil I liclcox
 Phe qucst ion being put
 on the amendment a division
 was called for Mr GREEN
 want to know if the
 question is not divisible so
 as to Five Wentworth it
 y I believe the rulc
 is in filling blanks that
 the questioy shall first be
 taken on the longest titne
 or the distant day Wentworth
 cer Laughter tainly is loncyest
 Inan Mr DOUGLAS supposed that
 this would be taken as
 a compromise in which all
 would I want to put
 an end to the contro
 acquresce Mr HALE have not
 been in during the whole
 this debate but il strikes
 Ine that this is thc
 smallest fight ever lcncw in
 t he Senatc It looks
 to me to bc in
 over great measure vidious 10
 strike out Mr Wentworth s
 nante single him out Now
 I know nothing about who
 these gentlcrnen are and I
 do not care but it
 to ine to be rather
 a mnall business for the
 Senate of the I Jnited
 States to si ont one
 of and strike out I
 his ntune these p ontiemen
 from It would sect to
 in I ply that there
 was something about hinl that
 was so in that hc
 vas not fit be na
 in an act of incorpo
 ration forc I shall vote
 i Mr GREEN 1 should
 like to know if it
 would bc ilnvidious to single
 the in out how they
 ever got singled in Laughter
 Who did it MG HAILE
 wei MG President 1 do
 know plead not guilty to
 anything about it Mr GREEN
 I acquit him the Senator
 is not serted In looking
 over the list I find
 that the State of Arkansas
 has no representative what ever
 There is one branch of
 the road terminat ing on
 the western border or that
 State and I wish to
 present the name of Albcrt
 Pike not know what his

 BILL Mr COLFAX I now
 call up the amendments of
 the Senate to House bill
 No 714 establishing certain post
 routes Mr Speaker these are
 amendments offered by the Senate
 which are merely for the
 establishment of post routes and
 I presume it is needless
 to have them read Most
 of them are for post
 routes in the frontier States
 The amendment of the Com
 mittee on the Post Offce
 and Post Roads to those
 amendments is of the same
 character They are not for
 any overland service but entirely
 for in terior post routes
 and routes local in their
 char I move that those
 amendments bc cone acter curred
 in together with the amendment
 of the House r I
 here was no objection and
 it was ordered accordingly Second

 shall be understood to cmbrace
 within its true scope and
 meaning the omces of the
 three Assist ant Postmasters General
 entitling each to a messenger
 at an annual salary of

 out the intention of the
 law that all bureau omcers
 receiving a sal ary of
 3 000 per year shall
 have a messcno cr As
 these Assistant Postmasters General are
 now confirmed by the Senate
 they rank vith the heads
 of bureaus The amendment was
 concurred in Sixth amendment of

 be it further enacted That
 letters which have been advertised
 under existing laws eide section
 twcaty six act of March

 of March 3 1851 shall
 be returned to tl le
 Post Oflice Departinent aa dead

 be excepted tbc operation of
 this act und pro vidcd
 further That said letters shall
 be re turned under regulations
 to be prescribed by the
 Postmaster General Mr COLFAX Statistics
 that have been col lected
 by the Post Office Department
 show that of the advertised
 letters that are called for
 at all over ninety per
 cent are taken out the
 first month and but very
 few the succeeding two months
 tlut they are retained This
 provision diminishes the time that
 they are to be kept
 before being sent to the
 dead letter office from three
 months to two months Cllhe
 amendment was concurred in Seventh
 amendment of the Senate SEC

 enacted That the unclaimed rnoney

 with or without valuable inclosures
 Provided I l åt said
 officer shall inake a de
 tailed report of his proceedings
 to Congress during the next

 amounts to about six thousand
 dollars per year and is

 enacted hat all letters returned
 fronr tbe dead letter ofticc
 there shall bc charged the
 usual rates of postage to
 be pollectcd on delivery and
 accounted för by postmasters in

 postages Mr COLFAX The obvious
 necessity for this mnendmcnt will
 be apparent when I state
 that when dead letters are
 returned no postage is I
 send up the E letter
 of the chief clerk in
 that office which will charged
 for that return although in
 additi0i to their carriaoe in

 servant Hon SCHUYLER COLFAX Mr
 COLFAX This refers to an
 amendment i adopted in 1854
 on motion of the late
 Senator subjected to much trouble
 in hunting up the send

 the same is hereby repealed
 Provided He shall pay such
 allowances as may have been

 Mr COLFAX The House at

 refused to concur It is
 an amendment repeal in that
 amendment ing the law authorizing
 the Postmaster General to pay
 extra pay to postmasters of
 separatintr offices which are intermediate

 Rees and ordinary offices Gentlemen
 will re member the debate

 so as not to surprise
 them The amendment was non
 concurred in Twelfth and thirteenth

 urn Mr COLFAX Thcsc provisions
 were rec ora mended by
 the late Postmaster General M
 l Holt They would savc
 to t he Treasury of
 the United States per annurn
 But aft n consider atiou
 of the matter by the
 Post Oflice Committcc of the
 House I am instructed by
 them to say that they
 do not fecl ut libcrty
 to recomnnend to the Llouse
 concurrence in the arncudinents sirous
 as they are to make
 rctrenc hnnent in this department
 they fear the provisions n
 figllt have postal service the
 elfcct to disarrange the cntirc
 of the country Tililey reduce
 thc rates of coni pensution
 on first class railroads from
 to pcr reduction of thirt
 y threc second class roads
 frorn 101 to per reduction
 twenty per cent and on
 third class red roads f
 ron 55 to inile a
 If it vv ere ccrtain
 that the of twenty per
 c e nt mails would
 be carried by all these
 roads that the niftil systen
 l would not be deranged
 we would have cordially a
 concurrence but there is very
 great doubt with the present
 of inails and the stalc
 of the railroads at the
 present time whether such a
 sweeping reduction rnight not lead
 to a slate of affairs
 which the I louse would
 dislike to see inaucyurated Mr
 STOUT I would inquire of
 the gentle man from Indiana
 whether it is not in
 the power of the Postmaster
 General to make these reduc
 ti0i iS without any authority
 of law Mr COLFAX It
 is not except by changing
 I the classes into which
 the raih oads are divided
 Mr HOARD Will gentleman the
 distinction between a first and
 second class rail road Mr
 COLFAX The distinction is somewhat
 an arbitrary one The Postmaster
 General makes the distinction founded
 upon the bulk of the
 Iliails and ra to of
 speed NJ_r SHERMAN I hope
 the amendincnts WiM be concurred
 ilÄ think they are very
 good M r BRANCH I
 ui ldcrstood the gentleman from
 ndial a to say that
 the committ ce recom mcnd
 a non concurrence shall not
 therefore express my conviction that
 if this amendment is adopted
 and becomes a law Congress
 will have to make some
 other provision for carrying its
 mails than over at least
 a portion of the railroads
 It not only reduces them
 to a compensation totally inadequate
 to the services rendered and
 for which they could not
 afford to render those services
 but it totally changes the
 whole policy of the Gov
 ernment in relation to the
 classification of rail roads Heretofore
 the classification has been not
 according to the quality of
 the railroad nor ac cording
 to the speed of its
 trains but with sole reference
 to the bulk and importance
 of the mails carricd It
 is something new so far
 as I under stand our
 legislation for us to undertake
 to con form the rates
 of speed to the classification
 In addition no one can
 read the proposition and not
 be convinced that if wre
 adopt speed as the basis
 of classification the distinction it
 proposes to make in the
 rates of pay is alt0
 ether unjust and unequal To
 the first class of roads
 it pro poses to pay
 200 per mile per annum
 for a speed of twenty
 miles an hour to second
 class roads eighty dollars for
 seventeen miles an hour and
 to third class forty dollars
 for twelve miles an hour
 If we pay 200 a
 mile to roads which run
 twenty miles an hour I
 submit that eighty dol lars
 a mile is altogether inadequate
 for a road that runs
 seventeen miles an hour I
 have some practical acquaintance with
 this subject and I assure
 thc chairman of the Com
 mittee on the Post Offcc
 and Post Roads that if
 this amendment is adopted in
 my opinion all the roads
 which are now carrying the
 mails as second and third
 class roads will throw down
 the mails and refuse to
 perform the service Whether thcy
 do so or not they
 ought to do so if
 thcy have any regard for
 their ox vn intci est
 Mr BURNETT to ask the
 I wish to know the
 dif10rence man a question between
 the price no yv paid
 to railroads carrying thc mails
 and other first class transportation
 Mr BRANCH am not able
 to answer the interrogatory of
 thc gentleman It can bc
 an no doubt by t
 hc chairman of the Com
 mittce on the Post Ofiicc
 and Post R ondN have
 some acquaintance with thc rates
 paid to railroad corn punios
 but no practical acquaintance with
 the rates paid for any
 other 1110dc of trailsportation Mr
 SHERMAN 1 can answer the
 gentle expressed a desire that
 this man s question arnendment
 should bc concurred in and
 will state the reason for
 such concurrence T hc pres
 ent rates paid to railroad
 companies for transport the are
 about seven times the rates
 paid for ordinary transportation and
 they arc about throe times
 the rates paid for express
 transpor tation and they arc
 totally out of all proportion
 to any other kind of
 transportation The Gov u nlnont
 ha s uniforlnly paid to
 railroad compa nics as as
 to everybody else a higher
 rate It is said that
 these than is paid to
 railroad companies will refuse to
 carry the mails unless t
 hey get their own price
 I will leave them to
 the public opinion of their
 own neighborhoods and there is
 not a railroad company in
 the United States which will
 not compelled to carry the
 nrails at the rates fixed
 by law Public opinion will
 compel them to carry the
 mails at reasonable and fair
 rates Thc rat es fixed
 by this amend Incnt which
 Was prepared by tho Post
 master tleman from Ohio But
 I will not violate the
 spirit of the remark in
 respect to driving a free
 horse and will not persist
 in it now Mr BRANCH
 In a few moments I
 shall yield the floor The
 gentleman from Ohio I ap
 prehend will find himself very
 much mistaken if he supposes
 that public sentiment in any
 State where railroads have been
 built not out of the
 Federal Treasury nor by grants
 made to them by Congress
 out of the common property
 but where they havc been
 built by the private means
 of the citizens or out
 of money contributed by the
 treasuries of those States I
 say he is very much
 mistaken if he supposes that
 in any such case as
 that public sentiment will compel
 them to carry the mails
 for an inadequate compensa tion
 Where we have built railroads
 out of the common means
 of the United States there
 may be some reasons for
 attempting to reduce them to
 In many of the older
 States of those low rates
 the Union we have built
 railroads out of our own
 means We expect our railroad
 companies will demand of the
 Government an adequate and fair
 compensation for carrying the mails
 and we will not countenance
 them in demanding anything Bat
 if you undertake to confine
 them to more the rates
 in this bill for second
 and third class ser vice
 I assure the gentleman from
 Ohio that there is not
 a single State among those
 of which I have spoken
 where the public opinion will
 cunpel thein to carry the
 mail at thcsc rates It
 has long been a matter
 of complaint amonæ railroad companies
 that your firstand second class
 pay is unequal and unfåir
 Under the existing law the
 first class pay is 200
 a mile and the sec
 ond class pay is 100
 a mile You might perhaps
 appropriately take something from those
 receiv iv 200 a mile
 and give it to those
 heretofore re cuving 100 a
 mile But instead of doing
 that you go m the
 opposite direction and propose to
 leavc those who are now
 receiving the highest price in
 the receipt of what they
 now get but to reduce
 still lower the compensation of
 those who are already receiving
 too little proportionately Another point
 in the case Mr Speaker
 is that this amendment proposes
 to regulate the rate of
 speed on all the railroads
 in the United States It
 may appear to gentlemen who
 are not familiar with the
 subject that tlle ratc prescribed
 is a very low onc
 Twenty miles an hour including
 stop pæres is regarded in
 the reoion of country with
 which I am acquainted as
 a high rate of speed
 Twenty miles an hour including
 stoppages is equal to between
 twenty five and thirty miles
 ac tuai running speed We
 regard twenty five miles an
 hour as very rapid running
 So far from au thorizing
 the Postmaster General to require
 rail road companies to run
 twenty five miles an hour
 I would if I had
 the power make a law
 in every State that no
 railroad ccnnpany should exceed tb
 ai speed in any casc
 with trains bearing human life
 upon them without special license
 from a board or ofiiccr
 specially appointed for that duty
 It is wrono in principle
 for Congress to undertake to
 control the runnh g spccd
 of railroads all over the
 United States There is no
 propriety in it but if
 you do undertake to control
 it you ought not General
 is considerably in excess of
 the ordinary I express transportation
 rates and oven at the
 rates prescribed by this amendment
 these railroads rct a larger
 amount than IS paid to
 Adams s or any other
 express company If wo fix
 the com ponsation ata reasonable
 rate public opinion will compel
 the railroads to carry the
 mails ata reason able rate
 Mr EDWARDS was recognized by
 the Chair Mr MAYNARD 1
 desire to make a su
 lvll EDWARDS 1 have the
 floor I think I llave
 thc floor Mr BRANCH 1
 yielded to the gentleman from
 Kentucky IM BURNETT to ask
 u question and to the
 o entle Inan from Ohio
 Mr SHERMAN to answer it
 1 now resume the floor
 The SPEAKER The Chair supposed
 that the gentleman from North
 Carolina had yielded Being in
 that mistaken the gentleman the
 floor will proceed to require
 so high a rate of
 speed as is required for
 first class roads by this
 amendment Mr CURTIS What is
 that speed Mr BRANCH The
 speed is twenty miles an
 hour including stoppages the actual
 running specd being at least
 twenty five miles an hour
 in order to fuifill these
 conditions I would say nore
 upon this subject but for
 the fact that the chairman
 of the Cornmittce on tho
 Post Ofhce and Post Roads
 states to the House that
 t he committee a non
 concurrence in the amendment I
 hope it will be non
 con curred in and I
 should not have made these
 re marks but for the
 fact that I feared one
 of those that common occurrences
 in regard to the blii
 we upon careful consideration should
 reject the amendment and in
 a week or ten days
 wc should find it put
 back in thc bill by
 sorne committee of conference without
 the knowledge of the House
 I hope that the amendment
 will bc rejected that the
 chairman of the Committ ee
 on the Post Offce and
 Post Roads wiil watch it
 hereafter and see that it
 is not put in the
 bill by a committee of
 conference without at least calling
 the attention of the House
 to the fact I intended
 when it was first read
 I will simply II remark
 in reference to what was
 said by the gen from
 North Carolina Mr BRANCH has
 so iülly THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
 PUBLISHED BY JOHN C RIVES
 WASHINGTON D C THIRTY SIXTH
 CONGRESS 2D SESSION discussed this
 amendment that any remarks from
 me see n to be
 almost unnecessary but sir hav
 ing had some experience in
 relation to railroad contracts and
 this amendment having been sus
 tained by the high authority
 of the gentleman from Ohio
 Mr SHERMAN I feel disposed
 to I make a remark
 or two upon the subject
 opposed to the first part
 of this amendment proposes to
 regulate the speed of railroads
 and to fix a mininu
 u tn speed I believe
 that the Post master General
 has sufficient authority upon that
 point already and I concur
 with the gentleman from North
 Carolina in saying that I
 do not bc lieve it
 is expedient to compel the
 Postmaster General to require a
 rate of speed of at
 least twenty five miles an
 hour on any road which
 is receiving first class pay
 I think ve may well
 leave that subject to the
 Postmaster General under the powers
 that he now has Then
 Sir in relation to thc
 second part of the amendment
 the compensation for carrying the
 mails I believe with the
 gentleman from North Carolina who
 speaks for the South ns
 it is termed while I
 speak for the North that
 thc rail roads will decline
 to carry the tnails on
 every route where you reduce
 their compensation to eighty dollars
 and forty dollars where they
 are now receiving one hundred
 dollars and fifty dol lars
 Take a railroad twenty five
 miles long and what is
 the compensation proposed by this
 bill One thousand dollars a
 year This is an unimportant
 item in the business of
 railroads When you compel then
 to observe all the regula
 tions of the Post Office
 Department to carry the mcsserwcrs
 of the Post Ofiice Department
 froe of charge and to
 run at such times as
 the Postrnaster General may you
 subject them to all these
 regulations 1 000 a year
 for carry ing the mails
 on twenty five miles of
 road is an unimportant matter
 compared with the other in
 terests of the road rl
 he present compensation has been
 fixed after a controversy between
 the Post Oflice Depai lment
 and the railroad cotnpa nies
 and has been acquiesced in
 after much diffl cult y
 and it seems to mc
 that it is altogether inexpedient
 to attempt to disturb those
 arrange 1 hope ments at
 this time by new legislati01
 1 therefore that this amendment
 will not be con curred
 in Mr MAYNARD The remarks
 of the gen tlcman froun
 New Hampshire have superseded the
 necessity of about all I
 intended to say It is
 very manifest that this is
 a subject which he has
 It may be that in
 vest crated and understands in
 the part of the country
 where the getlLlernan from Ohio
 Mr SHERMAN lives twenty five
 miles or even thirty or
 forty miles an hour may
 not be an excessive rate
 of railroad speed built as
 the roads are for the
 most part over level coun
 try where they can be
 made straight and are not
 subject to the effects of
 the obstructions that occur in
 the mountainous parts of the
 country This is not the
 case in the part of
 the couritt y from which
 I come where the railroads
 are built through the gorges
 and chasms of the mountains
 and winding among the hills
 and where such a rate
 of runnino would at least
 at the present season of
 the year be extremely hazardous
 T hc char acter of
 the roads obliged to be
 built the charac ter of
 the soil through which they
 are built the effect of
 the season loosening the foundations
 of the earth without being
 cold enough to solidify them
 by freezing make the rapid
 speed contem this tunendrnent not
 only unsafe not plated in
 only perilous but at times
 impracticable The effect of these
 amendments upon the groat thoroughfare
 leading from this city to
 New Or leans in almost
 a direct geo rrapbical line
 would be for a large
 portion of the year to
 reduce the compensatiÖn to eighty
 dollars and probably forty dollars
 per mile As has been
 well remarked by the gentleman
 froin New I lampshire amount
 of compensation is a matter
 of no sort of consequence
 in the business of the
 more import ant railroads compared
 with the travel and trans
 It is a mere a
 mere incon portation siderable item
 It has becn well said
 that the 34 FRIDAY JANUARY
 25 1861 transportation of the
 mails does not rest on
 the same footing as any
 other kind of transportation The
 railroad companies now carry Adams
 s ex If the trains
 conne up in time very
 well press if not there
 are no penalties nor forfeitures
 in curred So of the
 carriage of passengers and their
 baggage But if in transporting
 the mails there be a
 failurc to come up to
 the time specified in the
 schedules then penalties are incurred
 which not only take away
 all compensation for the service
 performed but may extend beyond
 that Again as has been
 well said also bjT the
 gen tleman who has preceded
 me the railroad com pany
 arc obliged to provide a
 post offce in their cars
 to set it apart for
 the business of the mail
 and for that alone to
 exclude all other matter and
 all persons excepting those who
 are immediately connected with the
 transportation of the mail These
 are expenses that are incurred
 by no other sort of
 business done on the railroad
 I have some knowledge of
 the subject for it has
 been my fortune to be
 more or less connected with
 rail road operations through my
 own section of the country
 for several years and to
 be interested to a small
 extent in more than one
 of them as a slock
 and I do not hesitate
 to declare it as my
 holder opinion that with the
 rates of compensation and the
 rates of speed prescribed in
 these proposed amendments you will
 have your mails thrown out
 by the roadside and the
 postmaster will be left to
 get them along by horse
 service by mule service by
 ox service or as a
 matter of fact by no
 service at all Thcrcfore without
 multiplying words on this subject
 I will say that am
 utterly opposed to I consider
 them to the proposed amendments
 be unwise injudicious a sort
 of Procrustean bed which is
 to eave the Postmaster General
 no dis cretion in making
 his contracts in different por
 tions of the country but
 to compcl him to bring
 the postal service all over
 the country through the mountains
 and across the prairies to
 one comn lon standard This
 is not only impractica in
 my opinion in tbc lughcst
 degree absu rd Mr COLFAX
 I do not wish to
 occupy t be morning hour
 to morrow as well as
 to day willi this bill
 and therefore I move the
 previous ques tion Mr WASHBURNE
 of Illinois h hope the
 gentleman from Indiana will not
 persevere in his demand for
 the previous quest ion on
 this section of the bill
 It cerlainly involves a very
 important principle The section may
 be right in itseff but
 yet there is a very
 serious question which arises whether
 or not the railroad conil
 anies will do the service
 for the sums proposed I
 do not want to delay
 the matter but I should
 like a little time to
 examine it and there are
 but five minutes left now
 till the special order comes
 up desire to give notice
 also that I propose to
 offer as an amendment to
 onc of the sections a
 proposition which the House passed
 upon half a dozen dif
 ferent times last session to
 restore the mail scr vice
 that was cut down by
 the late Postmaster General Mr
 COLFAX If the gentleman from
 Illinois had listened to 11
 y remarks he would have
 found that the Post Office
 Committee concurred witli him in
 recommending a non concurrence with
 the Senate in this section
 It has been argued on
 both sides ably think the
 argument is tvell nigh exhausted
 I trust the previous question
 will be sustained Mr BURNETT
 1 hope the gentleman wilk
 not insist on the demand
 for the previous ques tion
 I think thc amendment of
 the Senate ought I think
 there are reasons or to
 be concurred in it Under
 the law under which vx
 e are now act incr
 the Postrnaster General has no
 diseretion none whatever and it
 is hiffhly important there should
 be some regulation by which
 he can con trol the
 transportation of the mails on
 railroads The Inatter is of
 deep interest to the country
 and as we are wishin
 a few minutes of the
 expiration of the mortiing hour
 i do not see any
 reason for the previous question
 NETV SERIES NO 34 Mr
 COLFAX If the House wants
 to liave any further debate
 it can vote down the
 previous question I think the
 question is well understood on
 both sides The SPEAKER ordered
 tellers on the previous question
 and Messrs MAYNARD and VANDEVER
 were appointed The House divided
 and the tellers reported ayes
 94 noes 32 So the
 previous question was seconded and
 the main question ordered Mr
 BURNETT 1 believe we are
 entitled to a separate vote
 on this section I call
 for a divi Sion of
 the question The SPEAKER The
 amendment be di vided The
 question will be first taken
 on the first section The
 question was taken and the
 first part of the amendment
 was non concurred in rl
 he question was then taken
 on the second part of
 the amendment and it was
 non concurred in Fourteenth amendment
 of the Senate SEC 15
 and be it further enacted
 That it shall be law
 t ul Or persons known
 as regular dealers in newspapers
 and periodicals to receive by
 naik such quantities of either
 as they nay require and
 to pay the postage thereon
 as they tnny he received
 at the same rates as
 regular subscribers to such publications
 Mr COLFAX I desire to
 give a brief expla nation
 of this amendment It is
 recommended on the petition of
 newspaper dealers and it will
 tend to increase the revenue
 of the Department The Post
 Offce Committees of both Houses
 recom mend concurrence in which
 the Post Offce De partment
 agrees Mr SICKLES I offer
 the following as an amendment
 to the amendment Protided That
 the Postmaster General be authorized
 to establish a daily or
 senii daily delivery of lett
 ers and news papers by
 carriers throughout a circuit at
 nine mikes from the City
 flan of the city of
 New York under the supervis
 ion of the postmastcr ot
 New York whenever in liks
 judg nient the reveruue fronn
 such service shall defray t11C
 ex penses thereof Mr PHELPS
 nothing say in regard to
 the pending amendment to the
 amendment but I desire to
 inquire of the gentleman from
 Indiana the necessity of the
 fifteenth section Cannot your regular
 newspaper dealers receive their pack
 ages now at the same
 rates as regular subscribers provided
 they do not exceed a
 certain weight Such I understand
 to be the law now
 Mr COLFAX I will explain
 in a moment the necessity
 for this section For a
 newspaper deafer to obtain the
 advantages of the present postage
 law he must subscribe for
 the same number of papers
 weekly for the en tire
 quarter He might desirc to
 take for instance a hundred
 copies of the New York
 Ledger one week two hundred
 copies another week three h
 undred the next week and
 but one hundred thc fourth
 week but he is unable
 to do so under the
 present law The con sequencc
 is that this kind of
 business is thrown outside of
 the mails into the hands
 of the express companies This
 provision which meets the cor
 dial approval of the Post
 Office Committee is that all
 newspaper dealers shall receive their
 packages paying pro rata for
 each package at the time
 at the same rate as
 regular subscribers Mr PHELPS The
 explanation of the gen tlcman
 from Indiana convinces me that
 the amend ment should not
 bc adopted T hc proposition
 is to permit newspaper dealers
 to receive what cvcr quantity
 of papers and maoazines they
 may desire each day or
 each week by paying pro
 rata at a reduction of
 fifty per cent I he
 gen ttcman remarks that the
 packages of the news paper
 dealers are novv carried by
 express compa nies ask him
 whether the postarre on macazines
 actually pays the cost of
 transportabion at this time I
 understand that it does not
 I understand that the actual
 amount of postage collected from
 su bscribcrs for any one
 of thie magazines of the
 United States does not really
 pay the cost of trans
 portation Wo have reduced thc
 rates of postage and made
 them extremely low for the
 purpose of encouraging thecirculationofmagazinesandnews 530
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 23
 papers A letter which weighs
 less than h lf an
 ounce pays three cents postage
 while a maga zine which
 weighs perhaps six or eight
 ounces pays less than the
 letter does Now the post
 ages upon the letter newspaper
 and magazine mail combined do
 not meet the expenditures of
 the Post Offce Department by
 three or four mil lion
 dollars per annum prefer therefore
 my self that the newspaper
 and periodical dealers shall obtain
 their papers and periodicals in
 future as they now receive
 them by express rather than
 lumber up the mails with
 matter which does not pay
 the cost of transportation Mr
 COLFAX The gentleman from Missouri
 has not I think perfectly
 compre iended the facts on
 whieli the amendment is founded
 Under the contracts now existing
 entered into by the De
 partment for carrying the mails
 the contraétors are required to
 carry the mails whatever they
 may be This requirement is
 included in what are called
 star bids Under the old
 system of carrying the mails
 in two horse coaches föur
 horse coaches the contractors were
 not required to carry rnore
 than twelve hundred pounds in
 each four horse coach Under
 the present sys tem however
 they are required to carry
 the mails whatever they may
 be so that if they
 are required to carry these
 newspaper and periodical mails as
 they will be without any
 extra pay the postages received
 will add so much to
 the revenues of the Department
 Mr PHELPS Let me make
 one inquiry of the gentleman
 from Indiana Does notthis amend
 ment reduce the rates of
 postage upon this class of
 mail matter Mr COLFAX It
 does not Mr PHELPS rilhcn
 the gentleman from In diana
 and myself have misunderstood each
 other in that respect Mr
 COLFAX We have or I
 have been mis understood at
 least Mr PHELPS The newspaper
 and maga zine i vhich
 now go through the mails
 pay a dif ferent ratc
 of postage This amendment as
 I understand it reduces them
 to a uniforrn rate and
 will enable the dealer in
 magazines to receive them at
 a rate of fifty per
 cent less than they now
 pay Mr COLFAX I le
 does not now pay postage
 upon them nt all for
 the reason that he can
 re ce_ive them nt chea
 pcr rate through the express
 Upon this subject the Postmaster
 General says It is proposed
 to permit regular dealers in
 newspapers and periodicals to receive
 by mall such quantities of
 either as they require and
 to pay the postage on
 receipt ut the galnc rates
 ns regular subgcribers to stich
 publications Tho object and propriety
 of this will be readily
 perceived Mr JOE IN COCHRANE
 1 desire to say a
 word at this point It
 seems to me that the
 rea son applicable to the
 support of this amendment is
 the rc a enn which
 as properly applies to the
 re duction of the postages
 to su bscribors It seems
 that the subscriber now frequently
 procu ves his pa a
 different avenue than that pro
 vided in the Post Olüce
 I should have said consumers
 rather than subscribers T hc
 consumer finds that he can
 obtain better fa cilitics for
 procuring his paper th rough
 the dealer than through tho
 post office This amendment provides
 simply that the dealer shall
 be able to obtain his
 papers and periodicals through the
 mail at a cheaper rate
 than they have heretoforc been
 able to obtain them It
 provides that instead of being
 compelled to relinquish to the
 express com panies the office
 of con vcying the reading
 matcrial over the country this
 tunendmcntis to provide as I
 believe cheaper rate of transportation
 ikn reading matter than can
 be furnished by the ex
 press companies It is certainly
 clear that the reason is
 quite as good for the
 adoption of this amcndment as
 applied to the subscriber as
 when applied to the dealer
 of periodicals and I think
 therefbrc that the amendment should
 be adopted by the House
 as well as the amendment
 proposed by my colleague Mr
 SICKLES in regard to the
 carrying of the mails within
 nine miles circuit in the
 city of New York The
 amendment to he amendment was
 adopted The amendment as amended

 PHELPS Thatis 1 believe a
 tion to increase the rates
 of postage to the Pacific
 designed I suppose to meet
 the additional ex pense of
 the overland service Mr COLFAX
 1 will state to the
 gentleman from Missouri that this
 amendment is recom mended by
 the Post Ofice Department and
 by the Post Offce Committee
 The present postage law was
 made with the understanding that
 the Califor nia mail was
 to bc carried by the
 Isthmus and it was therefore
 n ovided that all letters
 carried a distance over t
 n oe thousand miles shall
 pay ten cents postage But
 we have now in existence
 an overland mail by what
 is known as the central
 route from St Louis or
 St Joseph to Placerville California
 Many of the letters carried
 over that route goin a
 distance of less than three
 thousan l miles only pay
 three cents postage This amendment
 designs merely to provide that
 all California letters shall pay
 ten cents I will merely
 add that the amendment meets

 we seem to forget that
 we have a country We

 organ izations and forget that
 we have a Union and
 a Constitution in peril of
 destruction While we stand here
 idle the people weep and
 tho nations look upon us
 with scorn and contempt i
 cannot pick up a paper
 in which our tardy action
 is not denounced as treason
 to the cause of human
 liberty Convinced as I am
 that we are not likely

 reasonable proposition now before us
 a constitutional majority and bearing
 in mind that not one

 which yet remain with us
 marked the period as an
 c ra in the progress
 of humanity Over its pleasing
 realizations what nature was not
 joyous Of its magnificentprom isings
 who was not gladly hopeful
 To us of America the
 picture was the brighter because
 with pardonable pride we saw
 ourselves reflected in it our
 principles recognized though not wholly
 adopted and our example and
 institutions meas urably followed and
 reproduced The throes of that
 classic and suffering people as
 in agony and blood they
 disowned the despot and clamed
 and won their freedom awakened
 our warmest sym patl ües
 and our brother feeling strengthened
 as we saw in their
 heroic leader rare virtues which
 place him near the side
 of Washington Externally all was
 well Withinourselves how much to
 call fbrlh thankfulness The nation
 was never richer stronger or
 more prosperous A bountiful crop
 had filled our garners relieved
 in debtedness and driven away
 the shadow of former revulsion
 Trade was active Our matchless
 land and water ways were
 crowded Our population were busy
 Wealth flowed in from Europe
 as it had rarely done
 before and labor in cvery
 occu pation wps adequately paid
 Under such circum stances on
 the 6th day of November
 last nearly five million American
 voters in the exercise of
 the most precious right of
 citizenship cast their ballots for
 the Chief Executive of the
 nation A night passes and
 another day The flashing wires
 announce the choice and good
 citizens re sume their duties
 With the next rising sun
 come mutterings and threatenings dissonant
 and un natural Gradually they
 swell higher and higher until
 they arrest and absorb attention
 as they shrilly penetrate the
 remotest corners of the land
 Crossing the Atlantic and reaching
 alike ancient friends and ancient
 enemies there comes back a
 united and beseech ing remonstrance
 against so horrible a purpose
 so monstrous a crime as
 the disruption of this Government
 Two veeks pass around and
 on ali sides business is
 paralyzed crops remain unmoved banks
 suspend exchange is practically stopped
 securities even those of the
 Government reach nominal prices and
 the whole fabric of trade
 totters every citizen being more
 or less a loser Patriots
 within the country combine to
 check tho maddening torrent of

 five States haveah cadyyieldcd to

 were adopted some of those
 States stand tremblingly before it
 It threatens to en which

 section of the Republic Such
 a Representatives back to lend
 their aid in this great
 work of compromise Even if
 it were for no other
 purpose we should consult our
 people on the question of
 the course to be pursued
 against the seceding States Beforc
 we begin a bloody civil
 let us consult the people
 and hear their voicc and
 carry out their determination For
 myself I have voted uniformly
 for the consider ation of
 almost every proposition for compromise
 I am willing my peoplc
 which has been offered I
 love my country and should
 pass on my acts I
 am ready to make any
 sacrifice which will prc serve
 that glorious Union which has
 made us the i speak
 greatest and freest nation on
 the carth by the indulgence
 of my colleague and I
 cannot ure Mr MONTGOMERY Mr
 Speaker 1 have I think
 that a proposal to make
 to this House every irnpartial
 observer who has witnessed our
 deliberations since the commencement of
 the ses sion will admit
 that there is nothing like
 unity of sentiment nor concurrence
 of opinion amoncr us The
 votes had on the various
 propositions I of compromise presented
 tous from time to time
 t abundantly prove that there
 is not the slightest probability
 that a constitutional majority can
 bc obtained for any proposition
 which will restore harmony and
 peace to our distracted country
 Day after day is spent
 in the delivery of speeches
 i of which only tend
 to increase our troubles now
 elaborate this proposition I submit
 it for the I consideration
 of the Housc as a
 peace offering which requires no
 sacrifice Of principle from any
 I thank the House for
 its attention and my one
 colleague for his kind indulgcnce
 Mr GROW I my collcaguc
 whether his successor is not
 already elected Mr MONTGOMERY Certainly
 and is a good Union
 man and a conservative Democrat
 But my proposition has nothing
 to do with my successor
 my proposal relates to my
 own term Mr McPHERSON resumed
 the floor Mr WASHBURNF of
 Illinois With the permission of
 my friend from Pennsylvania I
 de i sire to propound
 an inquiry to the chairman
 of the and dd fuel
 to the flame of public
 discord While we are entragod
 in this profitless controversy for
 committee of thirty three I
 wish to ask him how
 I doubt whether any speech
 that has bccn made long
 he proposes this debato shall
 be run before phenomenon so
 threatening and wide reaching should
 concentrate all thought upon itself
 It has been said we
 are in the midst of
 a revo lution It is
 more accurate to say that
 we are in the presencc
 of a vast conspiracy which
 has at length assumed the
 proportlons of revolution propose to
 examine and try to understand
 it Whcncc comes it By
 what means Whither docs it
 tend Three pregnant questions TIIE
 CONSPIRACY The blows come from
 conspirators who admit that long
 ago they laid the plan
 that carefully they have prepared
 the lucans und that such
 has bccn their life labor
 Turning to the proceedings of
 the Lcffislaturc of the Stato
 of South Carolina in 1850
 In a debate upon a
 proposition for a southern Congress
 we find thatonc member Mr
 W S Lyles said that
 the remedy for their wrongs
 was the union of the
 South and the forntation of
 a southern confedcracy Several members
 declared their purpose so to
 vote on the pendinø bill
 as to hasten the dissolution
 of the Union Mr Keitt
 said he would sustain the
 bill providing for the elec
 tion of delegates to a
 southern Congress because he thought
 it would bring about a
 more speedy dis solution of
 the Un ion In the
 sovereign conven tion of South
 Carolina recently in session one
 member Mr Parker said in
 the debate upon_ th secession
 ordinance ilhis is no spasmodic
 ort that has come suddenly
 upon us but it has
 een grad ually cu imi
 a long series of years
 It has come to that
 point when we until at

 of desire and effort while
 they were sworn offcers of
 that Government receivin compensa tion
 from it and intrusted with
 the care of its vast
 interests Had it not been
 confessed it could easily have
 been proved As far back
 as 1844 Mr Clay wrote
 to a citizen of Alabama

 1833 General Jackson in his

 the death of nullification and
 the de feat and dishonor
 of its advocates remarked as

 adds the prophetic words The
 next pretext will be the

 they have handled it let

 ITS CHARACTERISTICS The conspiracy was
 wide spread combined many powerful
 influcnccs and appropriated the apt
 agency of a secret and
 probably oath bound organization It
 apparently invaded the Cabi I
 RE K G secret and
 oath bound association the metnbers
 o which can the nselveg
 the Knights of the Golden
 Circle has existed iOr nrany
 Inotnhs throughout the cotton States
 We are intortned that as
 at pre ent ot aan
 izcd it originated in Alabama
 under the auspices of Mr
 Yancey the wnole purpose being
 the dismernberment of the Union
 We are now prepared to
 say upon authority which we
 consider entirely unquestionable that when
 N lr Yancey was in
 Kentucky last October he made
 the egtnblislnnent of thc order
 of the Knights of the
 Golden Cirelc in Ken tuclEV
 a part of his special
 business if not his chief
 business net making executive offcers
 connivers at if not participants
 in its atrocious policy It
 penetrated the Departments and used
 their machinery for its nefarious
 purposes And it has been
 suggested not improbably that the
 House and Senate Cham bers
 have not escaped defilement At
 its touch privacy was penetrated
 secret doors opened all Information
 gained and all desirable dispositions
 effec cd So intelligent were
 the guiding spirits and so
 perfect their arrangements that when
 at a given Signal treason
 lifted its head in a
 thousand quarters few supposed that
 the sudden and simul taneous
 movement was the result of
 foresight and preparation A conspiracy
 so wide complete and extensive
 never before threatened the over
 throw of the national Constitution
 and the de struction of
 human hopes and rights Jf
 judeed by its causes real
 or pretended it must be
 pronounced unjustified if by its
 characteris tics wicked and diabolical
 In every element it is
 hateftll and despicable It was
 conceived in disappointed personal ambition
 urid born of cun ning
 and calculating malignity It has
 fed and thrived upon the
 worst of passions and its
 very grossness betrays the hideousness
 of its life Its footprints
 are plainly traceable upon the
 nation s path way for
 a quarter of a century
 and noiv into this magnificent
 but uncompleted Capitol has come
 its ghastly and horrid form
 its scowling face and wrathful
 words and hating heart To
 many un suspicious of such
 depravity it has come una
 wares Others have long observed
 its stealthy creep It has
 been here before A year
 ago It moved angrily through
 these marble Halls It has
 returned tenfö d more violent
 and vicious As it is
 we must meet it either
 succumb to it parry it
 or maintain the contest necessary
 to destroy it ITS HISTORY
 This suggests the second point
 What means have brought it
 These conspirators live in southern
 States but have or have
 bad allies in l hcir

 southern heart had lution of
 the Union at the risk

 watchful of and eager for

 aided by the excitement created
 by the ruth less repeal
 of the Missouri compromise and
 the subsequent despotic Kansas policy
 of two Dem ocratic Administrations
 they are now in 1861
 as if to prove the
 continuity of their life executin
 the programme marked out in
 1851 as most eff cient
 for the destructive work For
 years they suffered for want
 of a suitable agency through
 which unsuspected to reach the
 public For ætime they were
 excluded from the Democratic party
 but they at length reéntered
 it at once its decay
 began By a gradual process
 they changed both its creed
 and policy They reversed as
 a necessary preliminary the theory
 of the very nature of
 the Government and the source
 of its powcr Jackson following
 the fathers taught that Phis
 is a Government in whieh
 all the pcople are rcpre
 sented which operates directly on
 the people individually not upon
 the States they retain all
 the power they di l
 not But each State having
 expressly parted willi SD grant
 many powers as to constitute
 jointly with the other States
 a single nation cannot fi
 om that period possess any
 right to secodc because sucll
 secession does not break a
 league but destroys the unity
 of a notion and any
 injury to that unity is
 not only a breach which
 would result frmn the contravention
 ofa compact but it is
 an offense against the whole
 Union l o say that
 any State may at pleasure
 se cede from the Union
 is to say that the
 United States are not a
 nation because it would be
 a sotecism to contend that
 any part of a nation
 might dissolve its connection wi
 th the other ports to
 their injury or ruin without
 conunitting any The southern Democracy
 of this day almost with
 unanimity assert and maintain this
 of secession while many northern
 especially Breckinridge Democrats mildly denying
 it give them aid and
 comfort by skillfully prating of
 the unconstitutionality of coercion To
 justify this form of reasoning
 they deny the popular character
 of the Government and rest
 it upon the States defining
 the relations between the States
 as a league and the
 General Government as an ao
 ent whicl cach onc is
 at liberty to discard at
 pleasure and wklich as recently
 expressed the seceders are about
 to hand over to the
 remainino partners themselves retiring Largely
 depriv ing the national Government
 of vitality they have proportionably
 exærgerated the State governments allegiance
 to which in violation of
 the precise language and the
 entire theory of the Constitu
 tion they have placed first
 in the scale of obliga
 tion From defacing the creed
 of the party they proceeded
 by an irresistible logic to
 denational jze its policy destroying
 its nobler features and supplanting
 them with either thc shadows
 of former substance or the
 denial of former attri butes
 They have denied the right
 and paralyzed the power of
 the Government to protect the
 labor of the country They
 have made of no effect
 its power to construct ri
 ver and harbor im provements
 or aid internal commerce They
 have destroyed its effciency for
 many important practical and useful
 purposes not now necessary to
 be named and have limited
 its agency to the narrowest
 fields feck convinced that no
 enoct ive measures will be
 taken by the States separately
 l he time and energy
 Of the States would be
 wasted in fruitless contest abouF
 the proper remedy and difl
 erences of opinion on this
 point would detuat any action
 at all even though all
 the consult ing States should
 favor some remedy If therefore
 the people of South Carolina
 have made np their ninds
 to with draw from the
 Union at all events whether
 joined by other States or
 not my advice would be
 to do so without wait
 ing för the action ofanyother
 St ate as i believe
 therewould be Inore probabiiit y
 tavorahle action on the part
 of other southern States after
 her secession than beföre So
 long as the several aggrieved
 States wait for one another
 their action will be over
 cautious and timid Great political
 movements to be successful must
 be bold and must pre
 sent practical and simple issues
 l here is therefore in
 tny opinion greater probability of
 toe dissatisfied States uniting with
 a seceding State than of
 their union tor the purpose
 of secession The secession ofa
 soutnern State would star tle
 the whole South and force
 the other States to meet
 the issue plainly it would
 present practical issues and exhibit
 everywhere a wider spread discontent
 than politicians have imagined In
 less than two years all
 the States south of you
 would unite their destiny to
 yours Should the Fed era
 Governtnent attenjpt to emp oy
 förce an active and cordial
 union of the wholc South
 would be instantly ef fOcted
 and a cornpiete southern confederacy
 organized All these results are
 problems which the future alone

 GLOBE 533 thus removing it
 as far as possible from
 the people and whilst by
 numerous means destroy Inx the
 centripetal tendencies in our system
 they have intensified the centrifugal
 already increased by our widened
 tcrritory arid its d ivorse
 interests by unduly elevnting the
 claims and rights of the
 States to whosc peculiar system
 as contrasted with the neation
 s they are now by
 natural conse quence attem pting
 to give extra territorial vitality
 in derogation of the ge

 of this policy embraced by
 many with that view has
 been to weaken the bonds
 of the Union and by
 a gradual but certain process
 to preparc the people sought
 to be enticed for the
 reboliious and revolutionary purposes now
 avowed On every occasion in
 every mode and on every
 sub ject save one they
 have dwarfed the policy of
 the Democratic party and left
 it a husk without life
 giving or life sustaining quality
 I have said on every
 subject save one I refer
 of course to that which
 is their chiefest pretext On
 all questions affecting slavery they
 treat the ConstiQILion with violence
 stretching it fur be yond
 its Ictter or spirit To
 this end they have adapted
 themselves successively with amazing readiness
 to every necessity of the
 hour Anx ious to break
 down the doctrine of conm
 cssional prohibition they adopted the
 theory of leaving to the
 Territorial Legislatures the control of
 the domestic institutions of the
 people That passing purpose sufficiently
 secured they denied the power
 of the Territorial Legislatures hostilely
 to touch stavery Using this
 doctrine for a tcm porary
 purpose they threw it aside
 as worthless setting up in
 its place tho dogma that
 as the Con stitution recognizes
 slavery neither Congress nor the
 Territorial Legislature can prohibit it
 and both must protect it
 am linst a hostile local
 senti ment Proclaiming the sanctity
 of compromises they repudiate all
 until that of 1850 is
 accepted such notions in 1854
 and destroy the Missouri compromise
 of 1820 which while not
 in their way was esteemed
 well nigh sacred and fit
 to bc In their for
 extended to the Pacific the
 admission of slave States they
 sought In 1858 to drag
 Kansas into the Union affainst
 the will of her people
 under a fraudulent slavery con
 stitution which did not embody
 the popular wish and was
 known to be in opposition
 to it a measure of
 wrong repudiated by the Territory
 condemned by the conscience of
 the country and after the
 act confessed by a distinguished
 supporter to have been a
 disgraceful measure which should while
 iri have been kicked out
 of Congress 1860 and 1861
 they resisted to the last
 point tho admission of Kansas
 with frec instituti01 s con
 formable to the popular will
 So wholly have the conspirators
 wielded the Democraticorganiza tion in
 their destruction of the old
 land marks set up by
 great men to be preserved
 forever As the conspirators debauched
 the creed and olicy of
 the Dem cratic party so
 they manipu ated the men
 of that party or discarded
 those 111 1844 when Van
 they could not manipulate Buren
 promised to be unyielding they
 prevented his nomination by establishing
 in the convention a novel
 and arbitrary rule till then
 unknown which transferred control of
 the party from the majority
 to the minority who have
 held it ever since and
 through it have ruled the
 country In 1847 they threatened
 the crushing out pro cess
 against all who advocated the
 Wilmot pro viso In 1848
 General Cass gained their support
 by abandoning former opinions and
 adopting new ones couched however
 in such Delphie words that
 they were interpreted oppositely in
 In 1849 50 a sagacious
 and different sections patriotic southern
 President when resisting their machinations
 wasstruck down by death In
 1852 they n om inated
 General Pierce ose an teceden
 ts and surroundings were satisfactory
 During his administration vast evil
 was done and vastly more
 prepared In 1856 they gracefully
 yielded to the necessity of
 the nomination ot Mr Buchanan
 who did not falter in
 their service until it would
 have been treasonable to go
 further In 1860 their real
 character and purpose were disclosed
 Fear ing and hating Mr
 Douglas for one act of
 dis obedience they expended every
 effort to prevent his nomination
 The two thirds rule and
 other appliances failing they kept
 the Charleston eon vention several
 weeks in session forced an
 ad iournment to Baltimore wherc
 failing to defeat in twain
 nominated a second candidate hope
 lcssly divided the Democratic party
 and com pelted a Republican
 victory Thus the Democratic party
 divided the Re publican party
 triumphant the I vhole southern
 people purpösely misled as to
 its opinions and policy and
 the fitting occasion supposed to
 have arrived for placing the
 match to the magazine the
 conspiracy was unvailed To day
 it stands before the American
 people the most hideous de
 velopment in their history or
 that of any other nation
 ITS PURPOSE AND PATH I
 proceed to the third question
 whither does it tend and
 by what path The path
 is the as serted right
 of secession the end the
 dissolution of the present IJnion
 On the other question at
 least equally important what shall
 follow disso lution there is
 great difference of opinion Some
 prefer a southern confederacy with
 a constitution much like the
 present others propose a recon
 struction of this Government with
 news guaran tees and conditions
 on the extent of which
 they again differ A l
 however I believe agree in
 sloughing off New England Others
 incline to a constitutional monarchy
 others again as foreshadowed by
 Governor Pickens of South Carolina
 to a strong ll ilitary
 governrnent There is this much
 Inelhod in their madness thcy
 agree ut the destructive part
 of their policy but largely
 differ upon the constructive no
 new experience since to pull
 down requires only brute force
 to I have heard build
 up requires great qualities it
 lately said that three things
 werc necessary in governmental construction
 Wisc mcn and thc favor
 of God this be true
 this south movement rnust have
 disastrous termination The path chosen
 is by the alleged right
 pos sessed by each State
 to secede at pleasure ft
 otn It is scarcely necessary
 to say that the Union
 this isa doctrine wholly thou
 tau thori ty against common
 sense and repudiated in terms
 by the tnost eminent of
 our statesmen Mr Madison in
 the recently published letters to
 N P Trist Esq written
 in 1832 says I partake
 of the wonder that the
 men you name should view
 secession in thc light mentioned
 Rhe essential ence between a
 frec government and a government
 not free which are mutually
 and cqual y bound bv
 it Neither of them thcrqJbre
 can have a grcater right
 io break off from the
 bargain than th e other
 or othcrs ha vc to
 hold him to it And
 certainty is nothing in the
 Virginia resolutions of 1798 adverse
 to this principtc which i
 that of connnon sense and
 ccnnmon justice The fallacy which
 draws a lifü rent conclusion
 fron them lies in confounding
 a single party with the
 parties to the constitutional cotnpact
 of the United States The
 latter having tnade the counpact
 may do what they will
 with it The turmer ns
 one of the par ties
 owes fidelity to it titl
 released by consent or absolved
 by an intolerable abuse of
 the power created In the
 same Ictter Mr Madison alludes
 to Mr Jefferson s opinions
 as expressed in his letters
 to Monroe and Carrington to
 the effect that it was
 not necessary to find a
 rWht to coerce in the
 Federal articles that being inherent
 in the nature of c
 compact Mr Madison again says
 Milny seem to have lost
 sight of the great principle
 that conipact is the basis
 and essencc of free government
 and that no right to
 disregard it belongs to a
 party till re leased from
 it by causes which the
 other parties have an equal
 right to judge In the
 event of an irreconcilable conflict
 not of rights but of
 opinions and claiuns of right
 force becomes the arbitcr he
 called upon all real friends
 of the Again Union to
 finally rally against those speculative
 orrors which assuming a practical
 character must subvert it The
 same views are found in
 his correspond ence vith Mr
 Webster and at an earlier
 date with Alexander Hamilton to
 whom pending the rat ifictuion
 of the Constitution by the
 State of New York he
 said t My opinion is
 that a rescrvation of the
 right to with draw if
 amendrnents be not decided on
 under the form of the
 Constitution within a certüin time
 is a conditional ratification that
 it does not make New
 York a rnembcr of the
 Union and consequently that ehe
 should not he re ceived
 on that plan Comnacts must
 be reciprocal this principle would
 not in such case be
 preserved The Union cannot be
 acknowledged qu hority is utterly
 repugnant both to the principles
 upon whiéli the General Government
 is constituted and the Objects
 whieti it was expressly forme
 Y to attairi The doctrine
 has never been the Supreine
 Court or by such states
 meh John Quincy Adams Clay
 Benton or Webster a doctrine
 unknown in ancient nib d
 ern and especially in those
 confederacies whose frames were so
 carefully studied by the fathers
 of our Government In 1833
 the Legislature Of Kentucky declared
 by resolution that the right
 of secesston is not only
 unauthorized bythe Cpn stitution but
 is Fepugnant to its letter
 and spirit In 1851 the
 State con vention of Mississippi
 called to consider the compromise
 measures of 1850 resolved that
 The asserted light of secession
 from the Union on the
 part of a State is
 utterly unsanctioned by the Fedeml
 Constitution Mississippi is now a
 seceding State so read ily
 are discarded opinions assumed when
 suited to a supposed emergency
 So much for the path
 which has been hewn by
 force and does not legally
 exist ITS JUSTIFICATION Now for
 the justifying reasons Mr Madison
 says a people may be
 absolved from allegiance when there
 is on the part of
 Government an intolerable abuse of
 the povv er created Does
 that abuse exist I propose
 to examine this point fairly
 waiv ing all technical points
 and therefore to con dense
 fram the papers issued by
 the convention of South Carolina
 statement of their grievances in
 justification of their action Those
 papers are two in number
 the address to the slaveholding
 States and the declaration of
 independence each prepared by a
 separate committee the former reported
 by M Memminger the latter
 by Mr Rhett both gentlemen
 in harmony with the sen
 timen t of their State
 and thoroughly familiar with the
 causes of complaint The former
 paper is the more elaborate
 opens with a statement that
 the one great evils from
 which all other evils have
 flowed is the over throw
 of the Constitution of the
 United States the Government being
 no longer free but a
 des potism such a Government
 as our fathers resisted nn
 1776 It assumes a parallelism
 between the Now I have
 taken the pains of examining

 the cracics of which ve
 have any knowledge tnany Greek
 confederacies did the right of
 secession exist In so Car
 as we can trace their
 fundatnental principles smne rare cases
 an unfaithful member Inay have

 the rnost itnporl aliL of
 all these cont edera cies
 and in that which received
 the most co nplete organiza
 tion resembling in nnany points
 our own in tile Achæan
 League there existed no right
 ofsecession and this is proved
 by the following case when
 the had obtained the supretnacy
 over Hellas and Greece was
 little more than a province
 of R01ne the N tolians

 connmssioner Gallus to solicit permis
 He sent Lhe n to
 the Sen Sion to secede

 the scccssionists obtained at Rome
 the permission to withdraw no
 leading case I suppose for
 Americans The Amphictyonic Council afiowed
 of no secession It was
 Pan Hellenic and never tneant
 to bc The medie al
 leagues ot the Lombard cities
 o the Swabian cities and
 or the Rhenish cities permitted
 no spontaneous withdrawal but the
 fortunes of the fiercest wars
 waged against them by the
 nobility would occasionally wrench off
 a member and produce disruptions
 The great lanscatic League which
 by its powertUl union of
 distant cities be can e
 one of the most efficient
 aøents in civilizing E uropo
 and whicb as Mr Huskisson
 stated in Parliament carried trade
 and manuthcture into England knew
 nothing ofseces Sion until the
 year 1630 when the princes
 greedy for the treasures of
 her cities had decreed her
 destruction and forced many members
 to secede This is no
 leading case either The Swiss
 Confederacy the Germanic Federation knew
 and know nothing of secession
 nor did the United States
 of the Netherlands so much
 studied by sotne of our
 frtuners and by Washington among
 thern admit the with drawal
 of auy ingfe State AIE
 these conféderacies consisted of a
 far looser web than ours
 None had a federal govermnent
 comparable to ours yet they

 complaints of South Carolina and
 the colonies and sustains it
 by asserting that the northern
 States having the majority in
 claim the same power of
 omnipotence in legislation as the
 British Parliament the s encral
 welfare being the only limit
 to the legislation of either
 that the southern States are
 taxed f0 the benefit of
 the North and that the
 representation of the southern States
 in Congress is useless to
 protect them a ainst taxation
 It also complains that for
 the last forty years tho
 people of the South have
 been taxed by duties on
 imports not for revenue but
 for an object inconsistent with
 revenue to promote by prohibitions
 northern interests in the promotion
 of their mines and manufactures
 and that of the taxes
 collected from them three fourths
 are expended at the North
 thus impover ishing the former
 and enriching the latter This
 exhausts one branch of the
 arcyument To all which it
 may be answered First That
 the Constitution so far from
 being has administered upon sub
 overthrown stantially the same principles
 making due al lowance for
 thc imperfect10P and errors incident
 to all human affairs from
 the orcanization of the Government
 to the present time During
 it the Supreme Court has
 changed less frequently than any
 other department of the Government
 and for many years a
 majority of its judges have
 been from the southcrn Statcs
 The tendency of its decisions
 also has within thc last
 thirt y years been more
 and more narrowinff down to
 wards the standard of the
 South Carolina school as is
 known by every student of
 our polities Be sides the
 general legislation of the country
 has been closely confined and
 in repeatcd instances has been
 nullified by the interposition of
 the ex ecutive power which
 I las without material excep
 tion Ijeen in the hands
 or under the control of
 the southern Statcs Second I
 hc attempted parallel fails because
 the colonies were not represented
 in Parliannent nnd tho southern
 States are represent cd iFI
 Congress precisely in proportion to
 their claims and in ac
 cordancc with thc provisions of
 the Constitution It fails also
 bc ratificd by all and
 binding all cause the British
 Parliament is omnipotent and the
 Congress is limited as all
 admit by the grants of
 the Constitution which the Supreme
 Court has interpreted with much
 severity and uniformity Neither is
 the parallel more happy as
 t o results than ns
 to thc principle for although
 it is asserted representation of
 the southern States is that
 thc useless to prolect thern
 against taxalion I lenge any
 one to point out case
 in whic b meas urc
 of taxation has been resisted
 by the South and enforced
 by the North l herc
 is no such casc But
 if werc it would not
 necessarily relieve the southern States
 from their allegiance be justified
 they mtn st bc able
 to point out an intolerable
 abuse I hat is impossible
 clailncd parallelisvn not existino it
 is easy to sec the
 two parties essen tinlly diffin

 llC allusion to the tariff
 question is wisely restricted to
 the last forty years since
 prior to that Lime South
 Carolina Representatives made voted for
 protective tariffs Mr Callioun an
 able speech in this blouse
 in favor ot the tariff
 act of 1816 and South
 Carolina and other south ern
 members supported it against the
 protest of New England Neither
 is this the cornplaint which
 the people of thc South
 can mal e for they
 have never been united in
 favor of a purely reve
 nue tariff No protective tariff

 a remarkable and for the

 humiliating fact that the present

 delegation in Congress of whom
 one is known to have
 declared himself opposed to all

 in favor of direct tax
 ation Furthermore for the lust
 fourteen years the changes in
 our tariff system have becn
 from cine reduction to another
 and complaint is less justified
 on this point now than
 at any former period Besides
 it is not true that
 northern in terests have been
 solely protected by our tariffs
 forin all the southern interests
 of sugar tobacco ånd hemp
 to say nothing of the
 iron interest of the South
 havc been largely protected Thus
 this petulant complaint disappears being
 if an o lönse not
 exclusively a northern one if
 a ben eflt to any
 interests not exclusively to northern
 Fourth It is complained that
 hc taxes col lccted among
 them are not expended among
 them I have no rneans
 of knowing what amount of
 money has bcen expended by
 Government for various purposes in
 the southern States but I
 do not recall a single
 instance in which aid was
 re fused to an important
 work because located in a
 Southern State As to thc
 fortifications erected by Government most
 of which are now in
 the possession of scccdiog States
 a report made a few
 years ago showed that 13
 366 000 had been ox
 pended upon them and it
 is known that these works
 were completed and strengthened others
 commenced and that in the
 last three years large sums
 have been spent upon public
 buildings in Charleston New Orleans
 and other southern cities As
 to the other phases of
 this pctty com plaint I
 commend attention to the subjoined
 ex tract from a speech
 made in the convention of
 South Carolina When we complain
 in the agtrt eayate or
 in general terms when ve
 say that the E ievanees
 ot South Carolina are ibnud
 in the fact t hat
 the i reasury hag been
 depleted by Ill cgal and
 in undue proportion adlilinistered to
 the North I question whether
 we are quite safe in

 that we lilay go too

 sc assertions too strona tunen
 t Their last grievance has
 reference to thc slave quest
 ion While complaining orthc congressional
 prohibition of slavery ft orn
 the Territories a policy inaugurated
 by the consent of Virginia
 and other slaveholding States al
 tho beginning of the Government
 and now 01 ly contemplated
 to a limited oxtcnt by
 any party the address charges
 that the purpose of the
 party is the Int crfin
 ence with slavery in the
 slaveholding States in spite a
 complaint also prospective but Inade
 of the distinct and emphatic
 declarations to the contrary in
 the Chicago and by Re
 it is safe to say
 Indeed publicans everywhere that the
 Republican members of will cor
 sent with substantial unanimity to
 initiate proceedinßs by which such
 a prohibition shall be inserted
 in the Constitution should it
 appear that this cornplaint is
 sincerely and not hypo critically
 made The declaration of independence
 of South Carolina touches this
 subject in detail alleging First
 That tllC laws of the
 Genera Government fail to make
 effective and valuable the fao
 itivc clause of the Constitution
 Sccond That fifteen States have
 enacted laws nullify the laws
 of Congress or which cither
 prevent their execution Third I
 hat r Lincoln has boon
 choson Pres citizenship certain persons
 who by the supremo law
 of the land are incapable
 of becoming citi zens Fifth
 That after the 4th of
 March next the equal rights
 of the States will be
 lost and the slaveholding States
 will no longer have the
 power of self preservation To
 all these it is easily
 answered In not a single
 case has the fugitive slave
 law been rendered inoperative but
 in every case it ha
 s been executed and generally
 without disorder that it has
 becn more faithfully executed than
 cer tain corresponding laws in
 the southern States and that
 in no case has an
 alleged slave escaped except when
 adjudged free by ihe commissioner
 That thc legislation of the
 fifteen States named proves the
 imputations cast upon them false
 or if they have the
 appearance of truth there is
 no reason to doubt that
 the laws will be revised
 and placed in proper shape
 but if this were not
 so there is a remedy
 for the case in the
 Union and under the Constitution
 That the election of au
 adverse President has always hitherto
 been peace fully acquiesced in
 by those now victorious that
 the mere election is not
 an offense that tbc opin
 ions of the President elect
 ave grossly misrepre sented and
 perverted in the State papers
 before named that if disposed
 he could not do what
 in wrongfully attributed to him
 and that as the next
 Congress would be constituted the
 President rrhaE would be powerless
 to control the question of
 citizenship is One of constitutional
 law which tribunals have been
 specia y erected to decide
 And that the last complaint
 is a pre diction not
 a fact a prediction not
 founded on a true statement
 of past or present occurrences
 and with no probability or
 possibility of realiza tion Such
 are their proclaimed grievances and
 com plaints such also in
 brief the facts which prove
 them groundless or if to
 any extent real remc diable
 within the Union Never did
 vebel peoplc It would be
 won so flimsily justify themselves
 derful if any one believed
 their reasons satis factory or

 the members of the convention
 felt the weakness of the

 the declara and their cause
 tion lVIr Maxcy Gregg objected
 that it was silen ö
 on thc tariff and the
 unauthorized expenditures of Government while
 it laid the main stress
 upon the incomparably unimportant point
 relative to fuffitive slaves and
 the laws northern Stateß in
 relation thereto I Ie flutber
 protested against weakening their cause
 by confining themselves to these
 miserable fugitivc slave law s
 Mr Keitt defending the address
 and its omission of the
 tariff reminded Mr Gregg that
 all of South Car olina
 s Representatives in Congress had
 voted for the present tariff
 With regard to the fugitive
 slave law of whose non
 execution compkaint is made Mr
 Keitt said he had very
 great doubts about the propriety
 of thc fugitive slave law
 and MI Rhett said hc
 had doubt of its cot
 tslitu tionality and had expressed
 it wrhen a member of
 l ouching the so called
 personal the Senatc liberty bills
 Mr Wardlaw thought the stress
 too much the laid upon
 thorn gave the address Judge
 Withc appearance of special pleading
 intimated very distinctly that the
 causes stated were not sufficient
 to secure his natnc to
 the ac t of secession
 but he signed it by
 reason of other causes not
 stated which X vero controllincr
 Looking over the proceedings of
 the conventi0h and the Legislature
 I can find but the
 additional causes stated anywhere and
 present them so as to
 make their case comple te
 One is named in the
 report of a committee of
 the Senate of the State
 namely that the people of
 the slaves holding States pay
 two thirds of the revenue
 of the country In tile
 same spirit the Mayor of
 New York in his latc
 mcssaec claims for that city
 that it contributes in revenue
 two thirds of the expenses
 of the United States These
 two self exaggerating authorities thus
 account fop one third more
 revenue than is received and
 re lieve the bulk of
 the population of the country
 alt agency in supporting the
 Government Another is stated by
 Judge Withers and is to
 the effect that a jury
 in Pennsylvania about thir teen
 years ago failed to find
 a true verdict in a
 casc of death arisi ng
 out of the recapture of
 slaves And another he statos
 thus in his rcpovt the
 Moorehead of Kentucky Conrad and
 Barroxv of Louis Fourth That
 certain States have elevated to
 committee on the relations of
 the slaveholding l otal votc
 ycas lana 5 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 535 States The dissatisfaction
 with the Government is not
 attributable to anything in its
 structure but to the false
 glosses and dangerous misinter pretations
 and perversion of sundry of
 its provis ions even to
 the extent in one particular
 of so covering up the
 real purposes of certain legisla
 tion meant to protect domestic
 manufactures in one section as
 to estop the Supreme Court
 in its opinion from judicially
 perceiving its real design This
 completes the dreary catalogue as
 made by the champions of
 disunion How piti ful the
 list But it was the
 best possible Not one has
 the ring of reality not
 one will bear the test
 of fact Several members expressed
 dis satisfaction With the papers
 but none could strengthen them
 and they were adopted Thus
 they stand upon the page
 of history challengincr criticism and
 judgment being as remarkable for
 sophistry in argument as inaccuracy
 in statement What the verdict
 of mankind will be who
 can doubt upon reading this
 paragraph from the speech of
 Judge Withers uttered immediately before
 sionil g the ordinance of
 secession think it every member
 of the convention should draw
 up an indictnnmtt against the
 people of the unfaithftil con
 federate States and you Inight
 have any number of ad
 dresses upon that subject you
 would probably find no ttvo
 oe ry nearly alike Since
 therefore every one s taste
 aud judg ment cannot be
 answered if there be no
 substantial objec tion to thc
 addresses beiöre us as I
 think t here is not
 it is proper to vote
 for them and shall do
 so Surely those grievances cannot
 be very actual or well
 defined which no two of
 one hundred and fifty five
 members ofa convention elected for
 the Such con purpose did
 or could agree in stating
 iö sston is itself complete
 as an arraignment and condemnation
 of South Carolina and defense
 of the Government sought to
 be overthrown I turn willingly
 from this mortifying cxhibition of
 maddened unen sccking to pull
 down the pillars of the
 Republic I say maddened for
 what else induced this passage
 in their address it now
 too late to reform or
 restore the Government of the
 United States Ail confidence in
 the North is lost in
 the South l he thithlcssness
 othalfa century has opened a
 gult of separation betwccn thetn
 which no promises or engagements
 can fill Thus has South
 Carolina shut the door against
 reconciliation asserted independence and begun
 the attempt to establish upon
 reactionary princi ples a new
 govcrnmcnt with a basis antagonizing
 it to ail European Powers
 whose recognition they expect to
 purchase by promises of profitable
 trade Let us for the
 sake of the past if
 not the possi ble future
 and more in sorrow than
 in anger screen from further
 view the petulance prejudice tho
 unholy ambition and headlong and
 hatred desperation of the present
 masters of South Caro lina
 is the atlomalous position of
 havmg complaints without foundation grievances
 with out actuality sufferincr without
 wounds oppres Sion without burdens
 and apprehensions with out reason
 The other secedii lg States
 wisely profiting by the example
 of South Carolina held their
 con ventions with closed doors
 having published no report of
 the debates on the adoption
 of theii or dinances of
 secession and have prudently re
 frained from attempting to give
 a detailed state ment of
 their grievances This also is
 significant Every step in this
 treasonable movement betrays the conscious
 guilt of its participants ITS
 INEVITABLE FAILURE As Mr Speaker
 I have thought of the
 possi ble destruction of this
 Union and forecasted the manifold
 and terrible afflictions which must
 en sue I have been
 overwhelmed with dismay at the
 depth and darkness of the
 abyss toward whose is unfathomed
 bnnk we have been tending
 and unfathomable By none of
 us or ours be the
 attempted measurement cvcr made But
 will this ican unity which
 is one of the great
 facts of his tory thus
 committinc a crime against humanity
 All races feel this yearning
 union and many have strugglingly
 and for years vainly sought
 it To us it came
 early and without difficulty for
 we encountered few or no
 disturbing causes and hence we
 value it too lightly MT
 hat the home feeling is
 to the individual national unity

 perennial beauör fills him with
 noble emoaions and fits him

 Cornbining the macr nanimit y

 preserve this Government because they
 love its liberal institutions which
 in their compactness vigor efficiency

 Mr 1 AwEs in tho

 MARTIN of Virginia I hope
 the gen tleman from North
 Carolilia will yield me the
 floor for a few moments
 Mr WINSLOW Certainly sir Mr
 NELSON i think 1 addressed
 the Chair before the gentleman
 from North Carolina did and
 that I am entitled t

 to me for a moment
 Mr NELSON 1 will if

 SPEAKER tcnwore When two gen
 tlemen address the Chair at
 the sarnc time it is
 customary for the Chair to
 declare which shall speak first
 Mr NELSON But 1 addressed
 the Chair first Tl he
 gentleman The SPEAKER pro tentpm
 e from North Carolina Mr
 WINSLOW has been assigned the
 floor Mr NELSON Yes sir
 but the Chair as signed
 it to him with the
 knowledge that I had I
 did address the Chair first
 spoken first spoke before the
 gcntlcman from North Carolina I
 ask the Chair and I
 therefore demand the floor whether
 he did not hear me
 speak in the first in
 stance Mr WINSLOW 1 could
 settle the question in a
 morncnt if the gentleman alludes
 to me when he says
 he demands the floor Mr
 NELSON I demand it because
 I spoke before the gentleman
 from North Carolina Mr WiNSLONV
 I hen thc Speaker m

 there is no use in
 showing an V temper about
 it Mr NELSON Well the

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 24
 The SPEAKER pro te npore
 The question is Shall the
 decision of the Chair stand
 as the judgment of the
 House Mr NELSON I call
 for the yeas and nays
 I want to know whether
 there is a quorum pres
 ent to decide this question
 The SP BAKER pro tempore
 stated that the yeas and
 nays were not ordered only
 ei ht members voting therefor
 Mr NELSON I ask fora
 count on the other side
 I want to see how
 many members are presente Tellers
 were ordered and Messrs ALDRICH
 and SPINNER were a pointed
 Mr BOCOCIPC There is am
 very sure a misunderstanding in
 regard to thissubject which if
 removed there would be no
 need of havirv a vote
 on the appeal taken by
 the honorable gen tleman from
 Tennessee The gentlelnan rose and
 said he demanded the floor
 on the ground that he
 had addressed the Chair first
 The gentleman from North Carolina
 was under the irnprcssion that
 that demand implied some constraint
 upon him that it required
 him to yield the floor
 Now 1 am very sure
 that the gentleman from Tennes
 sce meant nothing of that
 sort Mr NELSON No sir
 MI BOCOCK Thcgentleman from Tennessee
 could not have prevented the
 gentleman from North Carolina from
 getting the floor and if
 the floor were awarded to
 him from taking it I
 am sure therefore that the
 gentleman from North Car olina
 and the gentleman from Tennessee
 misun derstood each other The
 gentleman from Tennes see did
 not mean to put the
 gentleman from North Carolina under
 any constraint in the matter
 The gentleman from North Carolina
 thought he did Now the
 gentleman from Tennessee did not
 mean anything of the sort
 I am very certain the
 gcntlernan from North Carolina Vill
 yield him the floor without
 a word Mr NELSON Of
 1 did not mean any
 reflection on the gentleman from
 North Carolina I demanded the
 floor because I noticed the
 gentle man from Pennsylvania when
 hc concluded Ifis speech and
 addressed the Chair before the
 gen tteman from North Carolina
 did I mean no dis
 respect to him I demanded
 to be rccognized because I
 was entitled to the floor
 Mr BOCOCK I have had
 some little expe rience servino
 in the chair for other
 Speakers and for the prescnt
 Speaker and if the gentlcman
 from Tennessee had had the
 same experience in this House
 he would know that it
 is almost im possible for
 u Speak cr to ascertain
 precisely which member addresses hirn
 first A presiding officer in
 consequence perhaps of a desire
 to alternate the floor between
 both sides has his eye
 directed to a particular part
 of the House arid may
 very in nocently award floor
 to a gentleman on one
 side of the House while
 in fact a gentleman on
 the btrher side did actually
 address him first Mr NELSON
 I have no ohiection to
 tho gentlcrnan from North Caroiina
 who is my senior In
 years and my senior on
 this floor speaking before me
 and if thc Speaker will
 assign me the floor after
 the gentleman from Nortli Carolina
 shall have addressed the House
 I will yield my claim
 Mr WINSLOW When the gentleman
 rose I was on the
 point of doing perhaps a
 rash thino Waiviug my right
 to the floor would have
 been perhaps inconsistent with my
 duty in rc gard LO
 some matters which desire to
 explain Allow me now to
 confirm what the gcntletnan from
 Virginia Mr Bococre has said
 in regard to recognizincr members
 1 here is no more
 em barrassing part of the
 Speaker s duties than that
 of assigning the floor Tl
 he gentleman from Ten nessee
 ought to know that in
 these cases the Chair must
 decide which gentleman has the
 floor Gentlemen want to know
 what time they are øo
 inff to speak and the
 matter is generally arranged beforehan
 d and assented to on
 both sides I presume the
 Speaker did not hear the
 gentle man from r Pennesse
 e when he ad lressed
 the Chair It is natural
 that the Speaker should look
 in the direction where the
 member who was next to
 think that five rninut es
 private con speak sat versation
 with the gentleman from Tennessee
 would settle this question Mr
 NELSON It is not my
 design to reflect on the
 Speaker not at all I
 had no desire to cast
 any reflection on the gentleman
 who is occu pying the
 chair I merely insisted on
 my right because I thought
 I spoke before the gentleman
 from North Carolina Mr WINSLOW
 Iam sure if the gentleman
 from Tennessee will let the
 matter pass over two words
 from me will satisfy him
 The SPEAKER pro tempore Does
 the gen tlcman from I
 ennessee withdraw his appeal Mr
 NELSON 1 do withdraw appeal
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE If the
 gentleman from North Carolina will
 give way I will move
 that the House do now
 adjourn Mr MARTIN of Virginia
 1 have the by the
 courtesy of the gentleman from
 North Carolina Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 Then 1 withdraw the motion
 CHILDREN OF WILLIAM HUMPHREY Mr
 MARTIN of Virginia 1 move

 Mr McKNlGHT Is there any
 report ac companying that bill
 Mr MARTIN of Virginia Yes
 sir there is Mr ALLEY
 1 object Mr MARTIN Virginia
 Oh no hope not Mr
 ALLEY There are not a
 dozen members I know nothing
 about the merits of the
 gentleman s bill but it
 is my duty as a
 repre sentativc of the people
 to see that no busil
 ess is dorie when there
 are not a dozen members
 present Mr COLFAX I vv
 i l suggest to the
 gentle man from Massachusetts that
 he may acommo date the
 gentleman from Virgil ia and
 at the same time not
 violatc the l rinciple he
 has stated by al lowing
 the bill to come beföre
 the House and the previous
 question to bc ordered on
 it before we adjou rn
 It can then be acted
 on in ahe morning when
 a full House is prescrit
 Mr ALLEY I Will not
 object to that The bill
 was then taken up The
 SPEAKER pro tempore declared the
 ques tion to be upon
 ordering the main question Mr
 PHELPS object There is no
 qnorurn here and the House
 has no right to transact
 business without It may be
 a merito rious case if
 so I will vote for
 it to morrow but I
 will not give Iny consent
 that it shall be taken

 CRITTENDEN 1 am charged with
 the duty of presenting to
 tho Senate a memorial from
 a number of citizens of
 Guernsey county Ohio praying for
 the passage of the resolutions
 which I introduced some time
 since ask that the memorial
 be read 1 think it
 is but a proper respect
 to the memorialists The Secretary
 read it as follows To
 the honorable members of the
 Senate Qf the United States
 and House of Represéntatives together
 convened The undersigned citizens Guernsey
 county in the State of
 Ohio without respect to party
 believing the time has corne
 that 01nething must be done
 and that speedily to save
 our country fro eternal ruin
 We therefore respectfully ask your
 honorable body to pass the
 Crittenden resolutions or sorne other
 plan that will be satisfatoryto
 a majority of the American
 citizens and forever put to
 rest all ground of dispute
 betwccn the North and South
 on the slavery queston The
 memorial was ordered to lie
 on the able RED RI
 VICR RAFT Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas I call the atten
 tion of the Senate to
 the fact that a few
 days since at my earnest
 solicitation they fixed upon to
 day for the consideration of
 the House resolu tion in
 relation to the raft of
 the Red river It is
 a joint resolution which has
 been here for some considerable
 time have on several occasions
 sought to get it up
 It was made the special
 order for to day at
 one o clock but as
 there are other matters of
 very great importance that gentlemen
 will wish to bring up
 at that hour I should
 be glad if the Senate
 would consent that the joint
 resolution be taken up now
 and disposed of The motion
 q vas agreed to and
 the Senate as in Committee
 of the Whole resumed the
 consid eration of the joint
 resolution H R No 43
 giving the assent of Congress
 to certain acts passed or
 to be passed by the
 Legislatures of the States of
 Arkansas Louisiana and Texas or
 of any two of them
 in relation to the raft
 of Red river and for
 other purposes the pending ques
 tion being on the amendment
 of the Senate Com mittee
 on Commerce to add at
 the end of the ioint
 resolution the following sand provided
 further That the United Statcs
 shall havé the right at
 any time after the expiration
 or ten years to take
 possession of the work by
 paying to the cotnpany the
 amount of the expenditure with
 seven per cent interest The
 amendment was agreed to Mr
 TRUMBULL Mr this joint resolution
 was up the other day
 I stated thal if no
 one else did so I
 should call the atten tion
 of the Senate briefly to
 some of its features I
 regard it as an unconstitutional
 measure do not think that
 the Congress of the United
 States has authority to pass
 a bill of this character
 It is in my judgment
 a bill authorizino companies to
 tax the commerce of the
 country upon one of its
 navigable streams YVhen the state
 of Ark ansas and the
 other Statos borderin r upon
 the Mississippi river x vcre
 admitted into the Union and
 even in the treaty which
 wc made when we acquired
 that country it was expressly
 provided that thc Mississippi river
 and all tbc navigable streams
 flowing into it should be
 forever free to the citizens
 of all the States without
 any tax duty or impost
 of any kind The navigation
 of all these streams was
 to be free and yet
 here is a provision to
 allow the levying of duties
 upon vessels which shall navigate
 one of these streams I
 think that alone furnishes an
 unanswerable objection to the passage
 of this bill The Constitution
 of the United States does
 authorize States with the consent
 of Congress to ray duties
 on tonnage The language is
 this No State shall without
 the consent of Congress lay
 any duty ot tonnage keep
 troops or ships of war
 in time of peace enter
 into anv am eernent or
 compact with another State or
 witha föreicvn Power The first
 section of this joint resolution
 pro That the assent of
 Congress be and the same
 is hereby given to any
 acts that have been or
 Inay be passcd by the
 Legislatures of the States of
 Arkansas Louisiana and Texas or
 ofany two of them having
 for their object the in
 provetnent of the navigation of
 Red river by t i
 e relnoval of the raft
 therefrom I do not think
 it vas in the contemplation
 of the frarncrs of the
 Constitution to give in advance
 an unlimited authority to the
 States to pass any law
 which they might think proper
 in regard to tonnage duties
 The next section providesfortheco lection
 of thc tonnage duties but
 the first section provides that
 the assent of Congress be
 and the same is hereby
 given to uny acts L
 lat have been or may
 be passed Now does this
 Senate know what acts have
 been passed by these Lcgislat
 urcs in regard to the
 improvement of this ri veu
 Or if you do know
 what acts have been passed
 have you any knowledge as
 to what acts may be
 here after passed Are you
 prepared to give your assent
 to any acts which these
 States 0k any two of
 them may pass in regard
 to this river I sup
 pose that the Constitution if
 it means anything means that
 the assent of Congress is
 to be given understandingly That
 would be after these three
 Legislatu res or any two
 of them had passed acts
 for the improvement of this
 river and submitted them to
 Congress and then Congress could
 under the Constitution give its
 assent I have only read
 the first scction of the
 joint resol u tion I
 he next section provides that
 So soon as any company
 incorporated by the States afore
 said or any two of
 them for the purpose shall
 have re moved thc obstructions
 to navigation in Red river
 caused by the raft and
 have rendered the same navigable
 and not before the said
 States or any two of
 them tnay through the said
 cotnpany under and in accordance
 with and in the mode
 provided by the acts incorporating
 the same for the benefit
 of the cornpany and to
 reirnburse to it it s
 ex penditures in removina said
 raft levy and collect by
 way of commutation tor duties
 or tonnage tolls upon all
 boats or other water crafts
 ascending or descending said river
 and passing through the portion
 thereof that shall so have
 been itnproved and rendered navigable
 not to ex ceed the
 following stuns that is to
 say filly cents on and
 för each bale of cotton
 and twenty five cents on
 and for each barrel of
 goods wares and merchandise wherewith
 such boats or craft may
 be laden and t hat
 this privilege rnav continue until
 the expiration of thirty years
 from the 9th day of
 March anno Domini 1860 Thus
 it is proposed to give
 the assent of Con gress
 in advance to any acts
 which may be passed by
 these States for the improvement
 of this river and to
 the collection of tonnage duties
 under the acts incorporating these
 companies about which we know
 nothing It seems to me
 it would if constitutional be
 a very dangerous species of
 legislation I think it was
 never in tended when tbe
 Constitution was framed to give
 the assent in advance in
 this way What does the
 Constitution amount to Why should
 we not insert in the
 Constitution itself a clause that
 the States may collect tonnage
 duties if we are pre
 pared to gi ve this
 authority without knowing what we
 give to what extent or
 anything about it Now sir
 I am not willing to
 pass a bill of this
 character without knowing what the
 acts of the Legislature may
 be and without knowing what
 the terms of incorporation Of
 this company are I do
 not know that I should
 be willing to pass it
 at all This presents briefly
 the objection l have to
 the bill It is setting
 a precedent which may he
 applied to any of out
 rivers The State of llli
 nois and the State of
 Iowa may ask next year
 or this year to iinprove
 the Mississippi river around the
 rapids Would the citizens of
 Minnesota be willing that we
 should tax every bur rel
 of flour and every bale
 of goods that went up
 and down that river to
 reimburse SONIC company that would
 undertake to improve it under
 an act of incorpo ration
 from Illinois or Iowa Would
 Illinois and Iowa be willing
 to pay toll to Tennessee
 and Arkansas for any improvements
 that they might make or
 to Louisiana for any improvements
 which a company authorized by
 her Legislature might make at
 the mouth of the Mississippi
 river And is all the
 commerce of the Northwest to
 be taxed by each State
 past which the Mississippi runs
 I think such provisions would
 be irr the very teeth
 of all the acts under
 which the States bordering on
 the Mississippi river have been
 ad mitted into the Union
 and all the treaties made
 with foreign Powers when we
 acquired jurisdic tion over that
 river I am not willing
 for one to establish this
 precedent Having cålled the attention
 of the Senate to the
 matter I do not wish
 to delay theiraction or to
 take up their time in
 discussing it Mr DOUGLAS Mr
 President 1 have not been
 able to examine critically the
 joint resolu tion before us
 with a view to its
 phraseology to sec whether in
 its details it is precisely
 what it should be but
 upon the general principles in
 volved 1 have no doubt
 of the propriety of the
 measure My mind has been
 directed to this sub ject
 for many years and this
 I believe to be the
 true policy upon which our
 rivers should be im proved
 and the only mode in
 which they can be economically
 and properly improved The prop
 osition is simply to allow
 the States through which the
 navigable part of the Red
 river passes to im prove
 its navigation and to assess
 such tolls as are necessary
 to pay the cost of
 the improvement No other States
 are interested in it except
 Lou isiana Arkansas and Texas
 and they desire to improve
 it for their own benefit
 For many years they havc
 been waiting for Congress to
 remove the Red river raft
 and other obstructions to the
 navigation of that river We
 have appropriated a good deal
 of money but our system
 of appro pmation has been
 to give an amount of
 money that will enable the
 Department to commence the work
 pay the salaries of the
 engineers and buy the implements
 necessary for the removal of
 the raft and when they
 have fairly begun the work
 the appropriation becomes exhausted and
 the work is abandoned until
 another appropriation can be obtained
 I have often h ad
 reason to say and I
 believe it to be true
 that in this way every
 dollar s worth of work
 we have done costs us
 ten dollars in money Now
 if these States are will
 ing to take the improvement
 of these rivers into their
 own hands why not let
 them do it The illustration
 that my colleague gives by
 way of objection to the
 measure does not hold good
 He says suppose Illinois and
 Iowa should by joint action
 attempt to improve the Missis
 s ppi and levy a
 tax upon the commerce either
 of Minnesota above or Tennessee
 below would the people there
 be satisfied Sir I never
 would give consent to the
 improvement of the Missis sippi
 unless we joined in that
 assent each one of the
 States bordering on the Mississippi
 My proposition for the improvement
 of that river has been
 to alloW each one of
 the States bordering upon it
 to appoint a cornmissioner and
 let the whole of the
 commissioners constitute a board having
 charge of the improvement So
 upon the Ohio river There
 being six States bordering upon
 that I am willing that
 each of the six should
 appointa commissioner that the six
 com missioners should constitute a
 board and let them make
 the improvements and collect the
 tolls ne cessary to pay
 for them So the Illinois
 river being wholly within one
 State I hold that the
 State of Illinois is the
 most competent power on earth
 to improve it and so
 in every other case where
 a river is wholly within
 the limits of a State
 let that State take charge
 of it Where there are
 two States bordering upon it
 let the 538 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 24 two act
 in concert and where there
 are more than two let
 all those bordering on the
 river be associated togethcr for
 that purpose You will then
 have just such regulations as
 are suited to the navigation
 of the river You will
 have it in the hands
 of practical men interested in
 steam boats and navigation who
 will manage it You will
 have the money expended by
 men whose capital is at
 stake and who have a
 pecuniary in terest in having
 it correctly managed I believe
 ifwe adopted ibis system we
 should get rid of the
 vexed question of appropriations from
 the public lh easury for
 the improvement of rivers T
 hc principlö is not a
 new one It was intro
 duced at the beginning of
 this Government it has been
 applied in many of the
 States have not now bcfbre
 me a list but I
 once collected a list of
 the States for whom Congress
 had passed laws giving the
 assent of the United States
 to the im provement of
 their harbors and rivers by
 the im position of tonnage
 duties Massachusetts once had laws
 of this kind Pennsylvania Maryland
 Virgi nia South Carolina and
 Alabama and prob ably other
 States have had the assent
 of Con gress given them
 from time to time for
 the im position of tonnage
 duties fbr the improvement of
 theiu rivcrs and the cntrance
 of their harbors Mr BENJAMIN
 If the Senator from Illi
 nois will excuse me I
 wish to recall to his
 mem ory that it is
 only three or four days
 since we passed a similar
 bill for the port of
 Baltimore at the suggestion of
 the Senator from Maryland Mr
 PEAiw E n Mr DOUGLAS
 1 am obliged to the
 Senator for calling my attention
 to it I came in
 just as that bilk was
 being read and thought it
 was a re newal of
 thc old law but was
 not certain Early in the
 history of this Government probably
 in tho last century a
 bill was passed to cnable
 the State of Maryland to
 levy tonnage duties in the
 port of Baltimore It was
 renewed from time to time
 up to 1850 or 1851
 I thiF k that was
 the last renewal when it
 was continued perhaps for ten
 years and the other day
 as I am now in
 formed the bill was again
 renewed Mr BENJAMIN And passed
 both I louses Mr DOUGLAS
 Why cannot we give the
 assent of this Government to
 tbc improvement of Red river
 for the benefit of the
 people rcsidil g upon it
 as well as to the
 improvement of the cn trance
 of Baltimorc harbor for the
 benefit of the commerce and
 the people interested in that
 har It is a simple
 proposition and I think it
 is It comes within the
 very letter of a correct
 one the Constitution and if
 gentlemen will look into the
 debates of the convention that
 framed the Con stitution they
 will find that this clause
 giving the right to levy
 tonnage duties with the assent
 of the United States wus
 incorporated for the express purpose
 of making improvements of rivcrs
 and harbors According to my
 recollection of tho de bates
 the clause was first suggested
 by George Mason of Virginia
 and hc stated that the
 neces sity ofincorporating thc provision
 would bc found t in
 the absolutc necessity for the
 improvement of the harbors and
 rivers in Chesapeake bay He
 wanted thc powcr o iven
 to Virginia to levy ton
 nagc duties for these improvements
 He offered a provision unconditionally
 giving this power even without
 the consent of Cofigt ess
 Mr Madison according to my
 recollection and speak only frorn
 a recollection of many years
 objected that the unconditional power
 of a State to levy
 tonna e duties for the
 improvement of rivers and harbors
 would be liable to abuse
 inasmuch as it might in
 terfere with the general powerofCongress
 to regu late commerce throughout
 the whole country and hc
 said that while it was
 proper to give the power
 to each State to irnprove
 its rivers arid harbors by
 tonnage duties the exercise of
 that power should be in
 subordination to the general power
 of the of improvements rather
 than for expenditures from the
 national Treasury Whenever such ap
 propriations are made from the
 national Treas ury you make
 simply a job for Government
 officers under the charge of
 men we qualified for other
 duties but very poorly qualified
 for these I would rather
 have one dollar of money
 ex pended under the direction
 of an old steamboat captain
 or pilot or a man
 interested in the steam boat
 business who is watching the
 expenditure than ten dollars expended
 under the Government engineer who
 feels that it is a
 hardship to take him out
 of the regular line of
 his profession and assign him
 to a business which he
 knows no_th ing about I
 trust as a matter of
 economy that we may resort
 to this system get it
 out of the Federal Government
 and get it into the
 hands of those who are
 immediately interested in it and
 I hope as a matter
 of peace among the people
 interested in these local improvements
 that we shall allow them
 to make them It is
 well known that this Government
 will never remove the Red
 river raft Is M then
 fair or just thät we
 should withhold our consent that
 the people themselves may improve
 it at their own expense
 while we refuse to im
 prove it ourselves The improvement
 should be made the raft
 should be removed Have we
 a moral right to refuse
 to remove it ourselves and
 at the same time refuse
 to permit those who are
 interested in it to remove
 it I will not go
 into an argument to show
 the importance of this work
 The Senator from Arkansas Mr
 J 011Ns0N the other day
 in a few brief remarks
 made It so plain that
 no man can fail to
 comprehend its im portancc He
 showed that the cost of
 transport ation over the few
 miles of this raft was
 about twice as much as
 it would bc from Boston
 by Way of New Orleans
 up to the raft T
 hc cost of transportation across
 the few miles of this
 raft is nearly as much
 as it would be from
 New Orleans to Liverpool Mr
 BENJAMIN Five times as much
 I vlr DOUGLAS Five times
 as much I am told
 Is it right that they
 should be compelled perpetually to
 submit to thesc burdens rnercly
 because we have the arbitrary
 power and will neither permit
 thetn to do it themselves
 nor do it from the
 Federal Treasury I do not
 go into a discussion of
 the details 1 merely vindicate
 the general principle involved in
 giving our assent to tonnage
 duties on these local works
 which are to be done
 by those who are intercsled
 in them relieving the Federal
 Treasury to that extent and
 benefiting the people interes ted
 to the same extent Mr
 BENJAMIN Mr President 1 wish
 to say few words in
 relation to one or two
 of the points made by
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 T RUMI BULL w h
 ich his colleague has notanswered
 In the first place sir
 the obicction is made that
 the passage of this bill
 wonl f be an interference
 with that free navigation of
 the Red river which under
 the laws of the United
 States is accorded to all
 its citizens The answer to
 that is simple and obvious
 T herc is no in
 Red river at the place
 where this improvement is to
 bc made T hc point
 is precisely in the same
 condition and subject to the
 same rules and principles which
 govern Congress in relation to
 the falls of the Ohio
 at Louisville T hc Ohio
 river is free to all
 citizens of the Union for
 its navigation but there was
 no navigation at the falls
 and Congress pro vided means
 for creating a navigation there
 and charged the vessels that
 used this artificial means of
 navigation and has done so
 for a long series of
 years Mr CLARK Will the
 Senator permit mc a moment
 to Inake an inquiry I
 understood the honorable Senator from
 Illinois to state that we
 were prohibited from doing this
 by some treaty regulation of
 commerce The result of the
 dis i I stipulation do
 not find any such stipulation
 cussions between these two eminent
 men and I want to
 inquire of the honorable Senator
 from others who participated in
 them was that the Louisiana
 if hc knows of any
 power was to be given
 by the assent of Congress
 Mr BENJAMIN The treaty of
 cession of so that the
 paramount authority to regulate com
 Louisiana provided that the navigation
 of the Mis Inerce being
 this Government the Statcs must
 sissippi river should bc forever
 free exercise the right to
 collect tonnage duties for Mr
 CLARK I do not find
 any such provis river and
 harbor improvements in subordination ion
 in the treaty I may
 have overlooked it to that
 paramount authority Mr BENJAMIN It
 certainly however Irvas Now sir
 aru glad to sec this
 question arise in the acts
 for the admission of Louisiana
 and the I believe that
 the States most interested in
 in other States bordering on
 the river ternal navigation whether
 upon the lakes or the
 Mr CLARK I understand it
 to be in those rivers
 and bays ought to apply
 for this system i I
 acts and not in the
 treaty Mr HEMPHILL 1 think
 some previous treaty between Spain
 and the United States not
 the treaty of cession providing
 for free navicration Mr CLARK
 had the treaty of cession
 be fore me but I
 did not see it Mr
 BENJAMIN This is providing for
 still freer navigation of rivers
 leading into the Missis sippi
 instead of obstructing it It
 is providing for the citizens
 larger privileges of navigation than
 those that they now enjoy
 The canal around the falls
 of the Ohio was not
 an infringement on the right
 of the citizens to the
 free navigation of I the
 Ohio butit gave them further
 navigation than that which they
 had before Mr COLLAMER And
 they paid tolls for it
 Mr BENJAMIN And they paid
 tolls Con gress has from
 time immemorial gathered tolls from
 those vessels that used that
 precise improvem ment and none
 others This bill provides for
 the levying of tolls on
 such commerce as uses this
 particular improvement and nonc other
 Nobody bound to use this
 improvement that does not choose
 to do so Nobody has
 any power of navi gation
 there now because there is
 none This bill proposes to
 create a navigation where nonc
 preexists and to charge those
 who use this new mcans
 of for the use of
 the improvc ment thus created
 There was another point made
 by the Senator from Illinois
 and that is that by
 the first section of the
 bill Congress is called upon
 to assent in advance to
 any laws passed by these
 different Legislatures without examination To
 that I reply that Congress
 has no interest whatever in
 that question The first section
 of thc bill simply points
 to the measures to be
 used for removinff the raft
 the second section provides for
 that which touches the toll
 Now so far as the
 removal of the raft is
 concerned certainly the three States
 bordering upon the stream having
 a direct interest in the
 removal of the raft having
 the best knowl cdgc of
 the difficulties and the best
 means of ob viating those
 diffculties are the parties who
 should be intrusted with the
 devising of the necessary and
 proper means for the removal
 Why could you not Intrust
 the of the throe States
 with the same discretion as
 to devisinffrncans of removing this
 raft that you would be
 willing Lo trust to a
 board of engineers When Congress
 provides for tho removal of
 an obstacle to naviffa tion
 it does not direct what
 means are to be em
 ployed It leaves that to
 a board of engineers or
 to the War Department Now
 the first seet ion of
 this bill does nothing more
 than confer that discretion on
 the Legislatures of the States
 provides that under the acts
 of the States they may
 use such means as they
 may deem proper for removing
 the obstacle Next comes the
 question upon which Congress has
 a right and an interestin
 intervening It is as to
 the levying of the toll
 MI hat does the second
 section provide It provides suffc
 ient guards to enable C
 ogress to see that the
 discretion vested ates shall not
 be abused It provides that
 th Legislatures of the States
 who arc best competent to
 judge of the cost of
 this work and the burden
 which commerce will bear for
 the pur pose of carrying
 it out may levy such
 tolls as are necessary for
 that purpose but it does
 not give them unlimited pöwer
 It limits the toll Illimits
 the toll to an not
 exceeding fifty cents per balc
 of cotton and twenty fivc
 cents per barrcl of merchandise
 The States will not go
 to this limit if the
 work will be done cheaper
 and Congress says by the
 bill that it is not
 willing to let any body
 go higher if the vvork
 cannot be done for that
 We are therefore prccisely under
 the terms of the bill
 exercising that discretion which we
 ought to exercise in all
 legislation of this character The
 Senator from Illinois Mr DOUGLAS
 sug gested with conclusive force
 that there must be somewhere
 in this Government a power
 to exer cise the functions
 which arc required for the
 pros perity of the people
 All powers that do not
 lie in the General Government
 are certainly vested I in
 the Statos or in tho
 people There has been for
 a fong series of years
 a powerful party in this
 country opposed or principle to
 the exercise by the General
 Government ofa power over naviøa
 bic streams of improving tfrem
 of appropriating from the Federal
 I reasury and many who
 believe in the power believe
 it however extremely inju dicious
 to exercise it Now none
 can deny that 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 539 under the
 Constitution Congress has a right
 to permit two or morc
 States to make a compact
 upon any legitimate subject and
 nonc can deny that a
 toll imposed for the use
 of an improvement is not
 a tax a duty or
 an impost That distinction is
 as old as the languacre
 A tax duty or impost
 means a contribution exacted by
 the Goverrnnent for its revenue
 purposes It is a sum
 imposed upon the people to
 be paid into the common
 Treas ury for common purposes
 A toll is a contribu
 tion imposed upon a party
 who makes use ofa particular
 improvement intended to reimburse the
 cost of making that improvement
 There is the clear distinction
 inherent in the very terms
 themselves and familiar to all
 who ever think on the
 subject This then is not
 a tax nor a duty
 nor an impost It is
 a toll a toll for
 the use of an im
 provement intended to reimburse the
 cost of the improvement levied
 only upon thosc who choose
 to use the improvement the
 proceeds not going into a
 common treasury for the revenue
 purpose but appropriated exclusively to
 the direct im provement for
 which the toll is levied
 It is exactly like a
 tax for wharfage for the
 use of a wharf No
 man ever contended that the
 price paid in a harbor
 for fastening a vessel to
 a wharf was a tax
 or a duty ot an
 impost or that the contribution
 levied upon a bale of
 merchandise or a barrel of
 goods for transportation across a
 wharf in a harbor was
 a tax or a duty
 or an impost It is
 in its nature a toil
 a toll imposed upon the
 article for the use of
 the improvement paid only by
 those who choose to use
 it the pro ceeds going
 not into a common treasury
 for com mon purposes but
 exclusively appropriated to the particular
 object So then do not
 by authorizing this legis lation
 trench in any degree on
 that principle of the Constitution
 which prohibits the levying ofa
 tax duty ot impost either
 on exports or im It
 is In legal tech It
 is no such thing ports
 nical language a toll no
 morc no less The levying
 of a contribution of that
 kind for that pur pose
 is as old as the
 foundations of the Govern I
 have never heard it before
 disputed and ment I trust
 that the equity of this
 case is such as will
 recommend it to the favorable
 consideration of the Senate and
 sccurc tho immcdiate passage of
 the bill Mr BAKER I
 shall be very happy Mr
 President to support this measure
 lb has long been my
 opinion that the General Government
 should have improved Red river
 and in the fail ure
 to do that I am
 quite willing to do thc
 next I ander stal ld
 that this is really a
 meas best thing ure with
 the consent of all the
 States whose in terests can
 be affected to improve the
 navigation of Red river nosv
 so impeded by the raft
 as to render it comparatively
 useless if not entirely so
 above that point That it
 proposes a duty a tax
 an impost a toll I
 do not care which on
 those who use the improvement
 and nobody else I suppose
 is the fact in the
 case There are no States
 to be interestcd except thosc
 who agree there is no
 commerce to be interfin ed
 with except the commerce belonginff
 to these States and as
 I understand it nobody clse
 can by possibility complain I
 am very happy thercforc to
 yield my assent to such
 a proposition I do not
 think there can be any
 constitutional objection in the way
 but if it were not
 Illite so certain in the
 light of the instructive though
 brief debate which has been
 had I should still yield
 my assent to I am
 one of those who do
 not be the nteasure lieve
 very much in these doubtful
 and difficult constructions of the
 Constitution to prevent its being
 a great instrument of good
 rather than of restraint upon
 the enterprise and energy of
 the people I have been
 unwilling so far as the
 Pa cific railroad is concerned
 to yield any sort of
 con fidence to the class
 of objections made of a
 con stitutional character which would
 limit the power of the
 Government to construct the greatest
 work ever conceived in the
 world for the benefit of
 the this case but in
 all others where I can
 in my poof way wiéld
 the Constitution as a beneficent
 broad instrument of good stimulating
 the energy and enterprise of
 our people in every section
 of the country and I
 fondly hope that the assent
 which I trust Congress will
 yield now to meas ures
 for the benefit of Arkansas
 and Louisiana rnay be only
 one of a series of
 assents which Con gress may
 give to measures for the
 benefit of these States to
 a thousand coming generations Mr
 CHANDLER Mr President the sen
 ator from Louisiana says this
 is a toil Now sir
 I am opposed to establishing
 toll gates on the navigable
 waters of these United States
 I am opposed to this
 toll If you may establish
 a toll gate on the
 Red river you may establish
 a toll gate at the
 tmuth of thc Mississippi river
 indeed a bill has already
 passed through the committee of
 the Senate and through this
 body authorizincr the establishment of
 a toll gate at the
 mouth of the Mississippi river
 I am opposed to this
 whole system of toll gates
 upon our navigable waters Sir
 if you may establish a
 toll gate at the mouth
 of the Mississippi river you
 may establish a tou gate
 wherever there is a snao
 or a sawyer from there
 to the falls of St
 Anthony How do we know
 but that the State of
 Mississippi may to day have
 established a toll gate upon
 her borders and cstablisheel a
 bat tery to cnforce her
 tolls Such sir is the
 report of our newspapers that
 a battery has absolutely been
 established above Vicksburg on the
 Mississippi river and that ves
 sols are absolk ttelv there
 brought to and required to
 pay toll Sir I am
 opposed to this The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Senator from Michigan
 will pause The Chair must
 call up the unfinished business
 of yesterday at tllis hour
 one o clock havino arrived
 Thc unfinished business is the
 Pacific railroad bill I beg
 to sug Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas gest that this is
 a prior order to that
 and it was taken up
 before the hour of one
 for the purpose if possiblc
 of disposing of the subject
 matter The VICE PRESIDENT that
 this joint resolution was a
 special order for onc o
 clock but the Pacific railroad
 bill being the unfinished business
 of yesterday takes pre cedcncc
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas Then
 1 move to postpone that
 order Mr G WIN I
 hope the Senator will not
 make that motion but will
 propose to pass over the
 railroad bill informally and go
 on with this fora fib
 w minutcs The VICE PRESIDENT
 If be consent the presellt
 business can be continued Mr
 rl RUMBULL 1 0bject unless
 the sen ate vote to
 proceed with it I Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas Did 1
 under stand the Senator from
 Illinois to object Mr TRUMBULL
 1 am in favor of
 taking up the Pacific railroad
 bill at onc o clock
 and thcreföre object to the
 continuance of this meas ure
 to put the railroad bill
 oat of the way Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas I submit
 the motion that the Pacific
 railroad bill be passed by
 informally until this matter be
 disposed of which I have
 reason to think from the
 expression of opinion that I
 find around the Senate will
 not consume much time I
 think not over halfan hour
 Mr CLARK Wii the Senator
 from Arkan sas allow me
 to inquire if it wili
 not answer his purposc to
 fix it for half past
 twelve o clock to morrow
 chance to make a technicalobjeetion
 which throws it off and
 compels me necessarily to appeal
 to the Senate to go
 on with the consideration cf
 what is a matter in
 behalf of fifty thousand people
 who ask of you no
 expenditure whatever I hope the
 Senate will poslpone the consideration
 ofevery thing clse and go
 on with this joint resolution
 which was the prior order
 for to day Mr HEMPHILL
 Texas has a greater in
 terest in this measure than
 any other State and I
 hope the Senator from Illinois
 will withdraw his objection It
 will take but a very
 short time to dispose of
 this measure I think I
 believe a majority of the
 Senate are in favor of
 it Mr TRUMBULL A majority
 of the Senate can certainly
 settle it If they prefer
 to continue this subject instead
 of taking up the Pacific
 vail road bill 1 have
 no other objection to offer
 ex cept that I think
 the railroad bill is more
 import ant 1 will make
 one remark as I am
 up in reply to what
 the Senator from Arkansas has
 said do not know why
 hc should have made those
 remarks There was certainly no
 occasion for them Mr JOHNSON
 of Arkansas 1 only made
 them The VICE PRESIDENT Does
 the Senator from Illinois yield
 to tho Senator féom Arkansas
 Mr TRUMBULL After have made
 a state ment I will
 I certainly have never opposed
 any thing that came from
 Arkansas or the Senatorfrom Arkansas
 because it came from there
 I made no opposition of
 that kind I stated very
 briefly thc points that struck
 me as objectionable They did
 not apply to the Red
 river particularly They applied to
 the general improvement of any
 of these rivers by States
 in this way 1 think
 tbc inference which he drew
 that I had any other
 motive than the public good
 was wholly unwar ranted Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas I will
 consume I merely allude to
 no time in replying to
 tl lat it as a
 misfortune that belongs to me
 will say no more about
 it Thcre was no disposition
 on my part to wound
 the feelings of the Senator
 Mr WILSON The Pacific railroad
 bill 1 believe is the
 subject now before us is
 it not The VICE PRESIDENT
 Tho Senator from Arkansas has
 moved that its consideration be
 postponed in order to continue
 this subject IVh WILSON 1
 rnove that it be postponed
 until two o clock The
 VICE PRESIDENT It is moved
 that the consideration of the
 Pacific railroad bill be postponed
 until two o clock Mr
 BAKER Unless this subject be
 sooner disRosed of he motion
 was agreed to Mr CHANDLER
 Mr President it was the
 system to which I was
 more opposed than to this
 particular case This may be
 an exceptional case do not
 know but it is but
 I am totally opposed to
 the system of establishing such
 toll gates and It will
 be evident to every per
 tonnage duties son at all
 acquainted with the navigation of
 the Mississippi river that there
 are obstacles to that navigation
 all the way up from
 its mouth even as far
 as the Falls of St
 Anthony and wherever there is
 nn obstacle an attempt of
 course will be made to
 establish a toll gate and
 to collect large rcvenucs And
 sir the casc is similar
 upon the lakes am opposed
 to the adoption there of
 a system of I assure
 the I port duties and
 tonnage dues and toll gates
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas Senator
 that at half past twelve
 o clock to morrow we
 shall have to encounter the
 same difficulties and we shall
 have to go over all
 this debate again Mr CLARK
 1 am desirous to help
 the sen I ator from
 Arkansas and only want to
 take that course which will
 lead to the least difficulty
 I shall go for bis
 measure I am aware of
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas that
 and I thank the Senator
 I appreciate it very much
 for I arn far loss
 fortunate with others at can
 stand I whole people governed
 and acting as I suppose
 least with the Senator from
 Illinois upon that principle and
 applying it as far as
 I his opposition very well
 as long as it is
 based on questions of conscience
 fThrough the six years can
 I am not disposed to
 seek for restraints in the
 Constitution acrainst a rneasure so
 obviously of his service here
 I think I havc never
 brought conversation the othei day
 with the largest ship owner
 upon the lakes he told
 me that the estab lishment
 of this systcrn was equivalent
 to the passage ofa law
 in these words Resolved That
 from now henceforth no navigation
 of these waters shall be
 permitted that all the cormnerc
 e of those great lakes
 shall be done by rail
 That was a remark madc
 by the heaviest ship owner
 on the lakes to day
 It is impossible in the
 nature of things that commerce
 can be hampered by this
 system of tonnage duties Why
 sir take a single case
 Mr BENJAMIN Will the Senator
 permit me to ask him
 question forward a moascu e
 connected x vith the interests
 Mr CHANDLER Certainly wise and
 tending to benefit of grcat
 States I am very glad
 that there is a measure
 of this l of my
 State that f have not
 been so unfortunate Mr BENJAMIN
 I will ask him whether
 the Congress of the United
 States did not only and
 I do it as to
 come in conflict with some
 special feeling or kind to
 which I can give my
 assent now expressing the reason
 why I do it as
 an I conscientious view of
 his and in this instance
 authorize in his own State
 the construction Ofa evidence that
 I am disposed to do
 so not only in i
 that Senator will not even
 consent to waive the canal
 around the falls of the
 St Mary s 540 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 24 which
 isa public navigable stream but
 give seven hundred and fifty
 thousand acres of land to
 his State to make the
 canal and authorize it to
 levy tolls besides Mr CHANDLER
 Certainly it did sir That
 was not a navigable place
 at au It was similar
 to the canal around the
 Niagara falls Mr BENJAMIN Is
 notthat river navigable Mr CHANDLER
 It is a different case
 en tirely I do not
 wish to make any factious
 oppo sition to this joint
 resolution it may be an
 excep tional case but I
 am opposed to the whole
 system of port and tonnage
 dues and toll gates Mr
 WILSON I agree with the
 Senator from Michigan in regard
 to the system as a
 general system and regret that
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 DOUGLAS should have advocat ed
 it to day 1 believe
 it is a system to
 which he is very much
 wedded I do not believe
 in it as a general
 sys tem and therefore in
 voting for this measure I
 do not give my assent
 to that system But here
 is a navigable stream that
 has been obstruc ted by
 a raft There is no
 navigation there now and every
 year is adding to the
 impossibility of re If something
 of this kind had movmg
 that raft been done years
 ago perhaps the raft might
 have been removed and the
 river be now clear But
 the navigation of this river
 has been destroyed and the
 question arises how can the
 navigation be opened Congress will
 not do it We all
 know that We therefore propose
 to authorize these States to
 do it through a company
 I believe we owe it
 to the people wl i0
 reside in that section of
 the country to have this
 river made navigable if they
 can do it I shall
 vote for it as a
 just measure II stands in
 my judgment alone there is
 no other case like it
 In any other part of
 the countr Mr bOUGLAS Mr
 Presi ent 1 regret that
 any remark I made on
 the general system should opcratc
 against this particular bill I
 was induced to make tiiose
 remarks in reply to my
 colleague who had illustrated his
 position by a reference to
 the IVIississippi river and thereby
 seen led to render it
 necessary me to answer his
 objection I hc point involved
 is simply whether we shall
 allow the local authorities to
 make an improve ment so
 as to render the river
 navigable where it is not
 now navigable It is navigable
 up to the raft and
 above the raft but there
 is no navigation across the
 raft We might grant latid
 for a rail road around
 the raft or we might
 authorize the removal of the
 raft and the buildi1P of
 locks and dams Or any
 other mode by which It
 can be done The question
 is simply in what manner
 we overcome the obstacle of
 this portage Now I am
 not willing to recognize the
 principle that the States may
 not connect the navigable waters
 above and below a portacye
 either by a canal and
 im pose a tax or
 tolls or in any other
 mode My own Slate is
 interested in that question The
 Illi nois rivcr is navigable
 to a point within onc
 hun drod miles of Chicago
 T hc lakes are navigable
 to within one hundred miles
 of that same point Here
 is a porta ffc and
 across that navigation used to
 bc ca rried in small
 boats up the Illinois river
 and through Desplains Mud Lake
 into Chicago harbor I llat
 is one of the portages
 that is dc clared by
 the ordinance of 1787 and
 the compact I admitting Illinois
 into the Union to be
 forever free Yet we have
 spent in making a canal
 across that very portage which
 by the terr ns of
 the compact is to be
 forever free of toll and
 have collcctcd tolls upon it
 If we have not a
 right to do that then
 we are to lose the
 sum of 10 000 000
 I hold that a canal
 and the impo sition of
 tolls to improve navigation is
 not in conflict with the
 provision that you shall not
 levy taxes or duties upon
 the navigation Mr DOOLITTLE If
 the honorable Senator will allow
 me it has been decided
 in the courts again and
 again in all those northwestern
 States that such tolls are
 not in violation of the
 compact nor of the Constitution
 Mr DOUGLAS 1 am very
 well aware of that but
 yet the obiection is being
 urged hcre notwith standing that
 aecision A similar case has
 been cited by the Senator
 from Louisiana There the navigation
 of tl le lake is
 complete up to the foot
 of the rapids It is
 complete in Lake Superior Here
 is a mile or two
 of a rapid that is
 not nav igablc We have
 authorized a canal around it
 and the taxing of tolls
 by which a ship now
 can go from Buffalo to
 the head of Lake Superior
 and back It pays no
 toll where the water was
 nav igable by nature It
 pays toll on the artificial
 im provement to connect them
 The same is true of
 all the canals of Ohio
 between the lakes and the
 Mississippi Those were portages free
 by the compact and yet
 we have got canals on
 them The one connecting the
 Wabash and Maumee rivers was
 a portage free by compact
 yet we have canals over
 It This is only giving
 our assent to do what
 has been done in Ohio
 Indiana and Ill inois in
 regard to improvements that have
 fifty or a hundred million
 of capital involved I am
 not willing to acquiesce in
 an argument that declares that
 that was wrongfully done and
 that that cap ital is
 not secure nor am I
 willing to withhold from the
 States o Arkansas Texas and
 Louisi ana the same privileges
 that we have exercised with
 so much usefulness to ourselves
 in our own States 1
 will noteprolong the debate because
 a vote is more im
 ortant than a speech Mr
 CLARK Mr President it seems
 to me that the objection
 to this bill arises from
 a con flict between the
 two systems Here is one
 party in the Senate who
 assert that Congress has alone
 the power to remove these
 obstructions and an other party
 that assert that the States
 alone should do it and
 between the two this bill
 is in danger one contending
 that it shall not be
 done by the States because
 Congress ought to do it
 and the otheu that the
 States ought to do it
 and that Con gress ought
 not to do it Now
 sir i am in favor
 of both of these systemsin
 different cases I think there
 are some improvements which Congress
 ought to make to rivers
 and harbors and I would
 cheerfully vote for them I
 think there are other improvements
 that when the States arc
 willing théy may be permitted
 to make and this is
 one of those because here
 Congress has once attempted it
 and has failed to do
 it Now Congress failing to
 do it ought we to
 prohibit the States from doing
 it Not at all this
 inquiry I want to ask
 him which he would I
 rather have a toll gate
 on the Red river permit
 ting vessels to ffCt through
 on paying toll or a
 perpetual obstruction of twelvc miles
 in length which vy ill
 never let a vessel through
 He says I hc does
 not want to hamper commerce
 I low can he effectually
 hamper It more than by
 letting this raft lie there
 Now sir I am entirely
 agreed that this is one
 of the cases if ever
 a case could arise where
 we ought to permit the
 States to do it Here
 is a raft twelve miles
 in length which obstructs the
 navi gation to a very
 great degree The river is
 an important one to these
 States and now the ques
 tion is whether we shall
 forever put a barrier across
 that river twelve miles in
 length or let these States
 remove it I am entirely
 in favor of letting the
 States do it and i
 do not find any pro
 vision in any or the
 treaties of the United States
 with any other Government which
 prevents it have cxanlincd the
 treaty with Great Britain of
 1783 I havc exaruincd the
 treaty with Spain of 1795
 and I have examined the
 treaty of cession of 1803
 and I do not find
 anything in either of these
 trcaties that prohibits us in
 any way from grant ing
 this privilege to the States
 It seems to me that
 if these States desire this
 improvement in the river an
 improvement ata point so remote
 from the mouth of the
 river where foreign commerce would
 not be likely to go
 wo ought to allow them
 to make that improvement It
 may be suggested that the
 commerce of another State will
 be taxed Perhaps that would
 be so but as the
 raft now is the commerce
 of other States is absolutely
 pro hibited from passing there
 and hence I go for
 removing the raft or permitting
 these States to remove it
 and open the commerce to
 these States Mr CHANDLER I
 am not surprised that the
 Senator from New Hampshire should
 call me to account for
 my views upon commerce He
 lives upon a river which
 is navigable for canoes at
 high water and terminates I
 think about twenty four miles
 above where he lives His
 views of navigation are evidently
 confined to the Merrimac river
 He evidently does not under
 stand that there are two
 thousand miles of navi gation
 above the Red river raft
 that there is a country
 capable of making nineteen or
 twenty States largerthan the one
 he represents that there is
 to be a commerce there
 greater than the present commerce
 of all New England before
 many years shall have passed
 He is not aware of
 the fact I that the
 toll that is allowed to
 day by this bill which
 perhaps would be only sufficient
 to pay a fair interest
 upon the expense at this
 time may amount even in
 ten years to 10 000
 000 Why sir when I
 first removed to Michigan I
 do not like to say
 how long ago for it
 is a good while twenty
 seven years acro the same
 tonnage duty that you aiiow
 in this bill on the
 Red river raft would not
 have made it an object
 to clear out the St
 Clair flats and to deepen
 the channel but to day
 that same tax would amount
 to more thall fifteen million
 dollars per annum The Senator
 cannot understand these figures because
 they cannot be based upon
 the river where he lives
 What does he know about
 the commerce of the Northwest
 Why sir it is the
 commerce of the Merrimac river
 that he is describing 1
 am not surprised Mr CLARK
 and Mr HALE both addressed
 the Chair The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr in the chair The
 Senator from New Hampshire Mr
 HALE Which one The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The one fur thest
 from the Chair Mr HALE
 Mr President Mr CLARK Allow
 me one moment Mr HALE
 Oh no Mr CLARK I
 think you should allow me
 Mr HALE After me think
 understand this case Mr CLARK
 1 think 1 do too
 Mr HALE Mr President I
 want to recon cile all
 these views if I can
 a_nd think we can enlist
 the Senator from Michigan by
 an amend ment which I
 propose to send to the
 Chair inckudv ing the St
 Clair flats Laughter I think
 if that were put in
 it would silence him I
 confess sir I am sorry
 very sorry to hear these
 belittliug remarks made upon the
 State of New Hampshire in
 regard to New Hampshire and
 her rivers and bthee uas
 sshe may In that respect
 I will place her before
 the world and challenfre admiration
 for her over all the
 other States of the Union
 by announcing that Lhoug h
 her streams are srnall she
 produced the Senator from Michigan
 Laughter Mr CLARK f do
 agree sir that live upon
 the side of a sinalt
 river on which they pay
 toll Right by the side
 of that river the Senator
 from Michigan was born within
 a stone s throw of
 it I understand very well
 his objection to tolls They
 built dams across the river
 ill early times and pcevented
 him from catching shad and
 ever since he has been
 opposed to toll Laughter Mr
 TRUMBULL Mr President for the
 ben efit of my friend
 from Wisconsin Mr DOOLIT TLE
 and also for the benefit
 of the Senator from New
 Hampshire Mr CLARK I desire
 to call their attention to
 the condition on which these
 States were admitted into the
 Union I under stand the
 Senator from Wisconsin to say
 that the courts have decided
 that the levying of tonnage
 duties is a different thing
 from the collecting of I
 wonder if the courts have
 ever decided that this language
 does not includc toll I
 read from the act of
 Congress Mr DOOLITTLE Perhaps the
 Senator from Illinois was not
 in his seat when I
 made the re mark and
 he may have misapprehended me
 My remark was that the
 Federal courts in the north
 western States had decided that
 where improve ments have been
 allowed upon those rivers which
 by the ordinance of 1787
 were made free im provements
 upon falls or over portwres
 and tolls have been allowed
 to be collected it is
 not a vio lation of
 the compact nor of the
 constitutions of those States Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 can very well
 conceive that the building ofa
 canal around the falls of
 a river would not be
 an interference with the navi
 gation of the river It
 would be a very different
 thing from this apprehend Mr
 DOOLITTLE Allow me to inquire
 of my friend what is
 the difference between building a
 canal around the falls and
 cuttirpa canal through a raft
 o logs twelve miles long
 Mr TRUMBULL one think isånimprove
 ment made upon the land
 he other is an attempt
 to make an improvement in
 the river itself and to
 charge toll for it But
 I will read for the
 in formation of the Senator
 from Wisconsin and his courts
 the condition on which these
 States came 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 541 into the Union
 and I should like to
 hear his an swer to
 that or the answer of
 the Senator from New Hampshire
 either Louisiana was admit tcd
 into the Union upon this
 condition Provided That It shall
 be taken as a condition
 upon which the said State
 is incorporated in the Union
 that the river Mississippi and
 tbe navi rable rivers and
 watcrs lead ing into the
 same and into the Gulf
 of Mexico shall be comanon
 highways and brever free as
 well to the inhabit ants
 of the said State as
 to the inhabitants of other
 States and the Territories of
 the United States without any
 tax duty impost or tou
 therefoc imposed by the said
 State It vas on this
 condition that Louisiana came into
 the Union and Arkansas came
 in on a sim ilar
 condition Mr HEMPHILL Are you
 certain that Ark ansas came
 in on that condition Mr
 TRUMBULL Yes Arkansas came in
 on similar conditions I have
 not the Arkan sas act
 before me but I think
 you wili finda sim iltu
 provision in the act for
 the admission of Ark ansas
 Now what is this bill
 It provides that the assent
 of Congress be and is
 hereby given to any acts
 that have been or may
 be passed by the Legislatures
 of the States of Arkansas
 Lou isiana and Texas or
 of any two of them
 Any two of these States
 may make a provision for
 the collection of tolls on
 this river without the con
 sent of the other Texas
 and Arkansas can make a
 provision för the collection of
 tolls on this river Without
 the consent of Louisiana and
 Louisiana came into this Union
 on condition that no tolls
 should ever be irnposed upon
 any of thiese nav igable
 waters Louisiana and Texas can
 pass the act and collect
 tolls without the consent of
 Arkansas or without the consent
 of the people of Wisconsin
 or the consent of the
 people of Illinois or of
 any other State Are you
 going to violate these conditions
 Is the Senator from New
 Hampshire who says he cannot
 find it in the treaty
 prepared to violate this condition
 as to these States I
 think sir you will find
 by ref ere nce to
 the treaties that they do
 make provision I have looked
 to the treaty with Great
 Britain and I find that
 there a provision is made
 in regard to the Mississippi
 river and the condition on
 which Louisiana came in is
 now to be violated and
 violated vithout the consent of
 Louisiana for Arkansas and Texas
 rnuy pass an act of
 in corporation and collect these
 tolls without her consent But
 sir the substantial and as
 I think unan swerable objection
 to this bill is that
 it is man ifestly unconstitutional
 The bill is framed presume
 so as to meet this
 clause of the Consti tution
 which I will again read
 No State shall without the
 consent of Congress lay any
 duty of tonnage keep troops
 or kn tilnes of peaee
 enter into any am eenoent
 or co npact with another
 State or with a Power
 or cnaarre actually or in
 such illiminent langer as will
 not adlihit of delay Now
 what do you propose here
 Yo u propose not after
 having seen the lc gislation
 of these tl n ce
 States or of any two
 then or any one of
 them to pass an act
 granting your consent but you
 propose to repeal this clause
 of the Constitu tion advance
 and to declare your assent
 in advance to any act
 they may pass Would you
 be will ing to vote
 for a law to day
 to allow one of these
 States to enter into treaties
 with a foreicn nation It
 is all in the sarne
 clause No State shall without
 the consent of Congress enter
 into an aøteernent or ctnnpact
 with any other State or
 with a foreign Power Would
 you give that consent in
 adyance to enter into a
 compact with another State or
 with a foreign Power or
 would you first see what
 the compact was and then
 give your assent We have
 no evidence here as to
 what acts of incor poration
 may have been passed by
 these States and surely we
 do not know what may
 hereafter be passed I find
 that this objection was so
 well expressed in a debate
 which took place in this
 body in 1852 by thc
 Senator from Delaware Mr BAYARD
 the chairman of the Committee
 on the Judiciary that I
 beg leave to read a
 few sentences frorn what he
 said upon that occasion He
 placed it as it seems
 to me in an unanswerable
 light and I am sorry
 not to see him in
 his seat to day for
 1 am sure this bill
 could not pass this body
 with his of this measure
 is this to give a
 common sense or a legal
 whichever you please construction to
 that provision SD as to
 carry out its object and
 intent you must necessarily require
 that the act to be
 done whether it is tho
 irnpo ition of a duty
 or the entering into a
 compaer witli a Stat c
 of this Union or the
 entering into a compact with
 a tbrei2n State or the
 raising of troops in time
 of peace or of a
 naiv in time of peace
 the act to be done
 rnnst be done by thö
 State and be submitted to
 Congress for its ratification be
 fore any authority can bc
 given That is the point
 The act must be done
 by the State and be
 submitted to Congress for its
 ratification before any authority can
 be given Why Otherwise the
 principle of this amendment this
 authority on the part of
 Conaress that at it will
 by a tnere majority it
 can dispense With a general
 restraining clause in the Constitution
 disabling the States from the
 exercise of these powers cannot
 conceive that to bc the
 con struction of this clause
 of the Constitution I need
 not detain the Senate further
 because every gentlrrnan when the
 point is presented can nake
 up his own mind upon
 it To me it seems
 perfectly clear and could 1
 take tlrne to compare this
 with other provisions of the
 Constitution I think t could
 make it perfectly clear to
 others that the effect of
 the amendinent would be this
 by a simple legislative act
 you atten pt to alter
 the Federal Constitution reinoving generally
 as to the States a
 re striction which is placed
 upon them All the authority
 given to you is only
 to assent to the aet
 of the States when they
 have acted Here you propose
 to remove generally as to
 these States a restriction placed
 upon them by the Constitution
 without know ing what their
 acts of legislation are be
 I think therefore that the
 bill is unconstitutional Besides it
 is a VIO lation of
 the conditions on whic h
 Louisiana came into the Union
 and without the consent of
 Louis iana because vou do
 not require her consent to
 this improvement for any twro
 of these States mav make
 it It is a violation
 of the cotnpact on which
 Arkansas came into the Union
 because you do not require
 her consent l exas and
 Lou Isiana may make the
 improvement under the pro visions
 of this bill True it
 may be said that their
 consent wilt be given I
 am speaking of the legal
 effect of the measure not
 as to the fact am
 arguing the constitutional question the
 power of Congress to pass
 such an act as thi
 It may be true that
 all these States would assent
 to it hut that does
 not alter the constitutionality of
 the measure at all I
 have said all that I
 desire to say upon this
 point I have called the
 attention of the Senate to
 it If they tl link
 proper to pass the hill
 under cn eutnstances it passes
 acrainst m V vote and
 I have 110ti ling furt
 her to say in regara
 to it Mr CLARK I
 desire to make a suggestion
 iFI regard to the act
 admitting Louisiana as the Senator
 from Illinois has called my
 attention par ticularly to that
 I have no difüculty at
 all vitb that act There
 the condition is imposed upon
 Louisiana that she shall not
 lay any toil upon a
 navigal le streaun within her
 lirnits Who imposed that condition
 The Congress of the United
 States Now the State of
 Louisiantm jointly with Arkan sas
 and Texas comes to Congress
 and asks Con gress to
 release that condition for this
 particular ff Congress agrees to
 release the con l u
 rpose dition what objection can
 there be Is ita vio
 lation ofa condition to release
 it to give permis sion
 That it seems to me
 is a full answer to
 that point Mr TRUMBULL Let
 me ask the Senator from
 New Hampshire if he gives
 no force to the language
 in that condition which guaranties
 a right to all the
 people in every other State
 and if without having Louisiana
 s consent to release it
 he is willing to impose
 these tolls We have not
 the consent of Louisiana Louisiana
 has not asked for it
 He assumes that The provisions
 of the bill he is
 about to vote for allow
 it to be done in
 spite of Louisiana That is
 my objection Mr CLARK 1
 have not looked at the
 details of the bill but
 I have no difiiculty in
 dealing with the suggestion the
 Senator makes in regard to
 the other States in this
 way here is a river
 entirely shut up by this
 raft closed to all other
 States and it is for
 the benefit of the other
 Statos that it should be
 opened and their assent may
 be pre sumed to have
 it opened for the benefit
 of their commerce Mr DOOLITTLE
 so seldom that 1 occasioni
 to differ with my honorable
 friend from assent entertaining the
 views which hc did when
 i lilinois that perhaps as
 differ with him upon this
 question it will be respectful
 to him and a a
 measure Involving the same principle
 was up duty to myself
 that I should state the
 grounds on He then said
 l he objection which I
 entertain to the constitutionality which
 I do difiör from him
 and give my support to
 this measure The Mississippi river
 is one thing the Red
 river is another The Mississippi
 river is a great navigable
 stream in which very many
 States are interested It is
 national in its character throughout
 The Red river is one
 in which two or three
 States are more specially in
 terested and therefore in consenting
 that the States of Arkansas
 Texas and Louisiana may I
 join in the improvement of
 the Red river I by
 no means commit myself to
 the doctrine that Congress has
 no power to improve a
 river which is national in
 its character like the Mississippi
 or the St Clairflats in
 which my honorable friend here
 Mr CHANDLER feel so dccp
 an interest as well as
 the citizens of the State
 which I in part represent
 I make no distinction sir
 between tolls and duties to
 be imposed upon any such
 improve ment but the point
 which I make is that
 the tolls which are proposed
 to be levied are not
 tolls upon the navigable waters
 of Red river at all
 The proposition is to levy
 a toll upon an artificial
 nav Igation to be created
 and which does not now
 exist All the navigable waters
 of the Red river which
 now exist may be used
 by all the citizens of
 the United States and when
 they come down to this
 raft if they choose not
 to employ the arti ficial
 navigation they can make their
 portages around it as they
 now do They can navigate
 the waters above and navigate
 the waters below but the
 toll which ve consent by
 this act to have imposed
 upon any navigation is not
 upon the navigable waters of
 this river in their natural
 state but upon the artifieial
 navigation to be cre ated
 There is no distinction in
 my judgment between a canal
 which shall be cut around
 a raft of logs or
 a canal which may be
 cut directly through a raft
 of logs or a canal
 around the falls ofa river
 so far as the right
 to levy tolls is con
 cerned There is no violation
 of the treaty with France
 or Spain no violation of
 the Constitution of the United
 States no violation of the
 acts con senting to the
 admission of these States into
 the Union for the language
 of those treaties the lan
 guage of the ordinance of
 1787 and the language of
 the act consenting to the
 admission of these States is
 substantiallv the same I wikl
 read the language which is
 uséd in the ordinance of
 1787 i he navigable waters
 leading into the Mississippi and
 St Lawrence and the carrying
 places between the same shall
 be connnon highways and forever
 free as well to the
 inhabitants of the said Perritory
 as to the citizens of
 the United States and those
 of any other States that
 Inay be adrnitted into the
 Contöderacy without any tax impost
 or duty therefOr Mr President
 this was fundamental upon the
 admission of Ohio as a
 State into the Union and
 so of Illinois Indiana nnd
 Wisconsin Since this I debate
 has arisen I have not
 had time to send for
 many authorities bearing on this
 question but I have one
 to which I will refer
 the Senator from Illinois it
 is in the third volume
 of McLean s reports the
 case of Palmer vs Commissioners
 of Cuyahoga cotinty arising in
 the State of Ohio The
 point decided by the court
 was that l hc provision
 in the ordinance of 1787
 that certain navigable waters shall
 be common highways and forever
 free c does not prevent
 the improvcment of the navi
 gation of said waters by
 a State The ordinance referred
 to these waters in their
 natural state If they Shall
 be im proved by slack
 water navigation or otherwise a
 reason able toll for the
 increased facility w iild not
 violate the ordinance Mr TRUMBULL
 lhope the Senator from Wisconsin
 will allow me to make
 an answer to that at
 once as he is reading
 it The answer is Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 was going to
 read one or two sentences
 further Mr TRUMBULL The answer
 is this that case refers
 to an improvement made by
 a State withoutauthotity from Congress
 as I understand it and
 of course that is not
 what the Senator from Arkansas
 is seekil g by this
 bill He is seeking to
 do something that a State
 could not do without authority
 from Congress Mr DOOLITTLE The
 answer to that is simply
 this if the Red river
 ran through the State of
 Arkansas and the raft was
 within the State of Arkansas
 i tunertake to say Arkansas
 could do it and without
 the consent of Congress either
 but because the river is
 bounded by several States and
 Arkansas cannot do this alone
 and Arkansas desires to enter
 into an arrangement with two
 other States by which they
 can do it jointly therefore
 it is necessary that the
 consent of Con 542 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 24 gress
 should be given because without
 the con sent of Congress
 Arkansas could not agree with
 Texas or with Louisiana to
 expend the money in this
 joint work of cutting a
 channel through this raft I
 have read all that is
 necessary to show that the
 imposinz a duty upon artificial
 navigation created by a State
 is not an interference with
 the navigable waters of the
 Mississippi or the nav icyable
 waters flowing into the lakes
 I suggest in answer to
 one objection which is made
 by the Senator from Illinois
 Mr TRUM BULL and in
 which perhaps there is some
 force that we propose to
 consent now to any acts
 of incorporation which may hereafter
 bc passcd by these States
 that it Ilia y be
 proper to insert a pro
 viso in addition to the
 one which has already been
 inserted providinff that no discrimil
 lation shall bc made among
 the citizens of the United
 States which would be a
 limitation upon anv supposed power
 that might bc exercised by
 those States against the interests
 of other citizens and we
 should all stand precisely upon
 the same footing I will
 suggest Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 to the Senator in whose
 views I concur in every
 respect and I am very
 glad he has expressed them
 that I would wish if
 it will mect with his
 own a proval that thc
 resolution might not be embarrassed
 by further amendment It is
 utterly impossible that these three
 States can ever be brought
 to such a step as
 that of drawing a dis
 crimination either agamst one class
 of persons or one class
 of States or one class
 of goods that are to
 be carried there There are
 not less than fifty thousand
 people who arc dependent upon
 this improvement and they are
 now suffering for the and
 I asstune that it is
 impossible want of it there
 can be any partial legislation
 in reference to 1 be
 cxisten cc of tho corporation
 this nuttter which it is
 lesigncd shall be in force
 to rernovo the raft is
 already limited to thirty years
 By an amendment already adopted
 the power is con ferred
 on the President at thc
 expiration of ten years if
 the Government of the United
 States shall choose to do
 so to take possession of
 the work upon simply paying
 the expenditures that have been
 made and seven per cent
 interest All these provisions would
 protect the in terest to
 which tbc Senator alludes But
 I do not rise for
 the purpose of entering into
 I have so often any
 debate upon the resolution seen
 in this Chamber those who
 are extremely anxious to pass
 measures that affect their constit
 ucnt s destroy them by
 themselves entcrino ex tensiveiy into
 the debate and thus provoking
 it from others that I
 am forwarncd against it and
 am not inclined and will
 not consent to go into
 the more particularly as I
 conceive it the debate to
 bc now entirely unnecessary The
 question has been debated by
 those who are twainst the
 r and certainly at greater
 measure at some len Ft
 h tongth than by any
 one that advocates the pas
 sage of the joint resolutiojn
 We ha ve now the
 as su rance of he
 Senator fronl Illinois Mr I
 RUM who chiefly opposes this
 n icasure that hc has
 said all that he wishes
 to say on tile subject
 I trusiand and of his
 sincerity_l have no doubt Vive
 to the Ineas hope ho
 will adhere to it and
 ure itself a fair orportunity
 to bc passed or to
 be rei ected Mr TRUMBULL
 1 am willing to vote
 Under these Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas circumstances I appeal and
 I think I l ave
 some right to appeal to
 those who are in favor
 of the measure itself to
 permit a vote to be
 taken since there remains but
 a few mihut cs more
 of the time to which
 this measure is limited by
 order of the Sen I
 ask that the serise o
 tlie Senate be taken ate
 1 think feelinx such an
 il lterest us I do
 in this measure that I
 have forborne and have consumed
 as little time as any
 one have ever known on
 this I beg that we
 may have a vote floor
 Mr HEMPHILL merely wish to
 say that my constituents are
 very deeply interested in this
 REPORT ON PUBLIC LANDS Mr

 ident COMMITTEE SERVICE Mr FESSENDEN
 Senate to excuse me from
 serving on the special com
 mittee which was raised upon
 the sukject of the tariff
 I learned this that I
 was named I wish to
 bo cxcuscd frotn on that
 committee serving on it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr in the
 chair The Senator from Mainc
 rcqucsts to be excused from
 serving on the special committee
 on the tariff bill The
 question being put the Presiding
 Offcer stated that there was
 no vote in the affirmative
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 move that
 the Vice President fill the
 vacancy The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair heard no res onse
 in the amrmative on tbc
 vote Mr DOU LAS 1
 voted ay That was the
 response Mr FESSENDEN Perhaps 1
 ought to state I do
 not wish to avoid any
 labor that the reason is
 properly to be imposed upon
 me but I am on
 the Committec on Finance which
 requires a great deal of
 my attcnlion at the prescnt
 time and must necessarily do
 so and my health is
 really so poor that I
 tun unable Lo do the
 additional labor would do it
 with great pleasure if I
 could but I am unable
 to do so The motion
 was agreed to Mr FESSENDEN
 1 move that the Vice
 President be authorized to fill
 the vacancy The motion was
 agreed to and Mr COLLAMER
 was appointed ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr GYVIN I move that
 the Senate proceed to the
 consideration of the Pacific railroad
 bill It was laid aside
 for the purpose of disposing
 of the joint resolution which
 has just been passed Mr
 CRITTENDEN The motion 1 believe
 is to take up the
 railroad bill The PRESIDING OFFICER
 That is the motion bcfore
 the Senate It was postponed
 untit two o clock but
 the Senator from California moves
 tn t ake it up
 at the present time Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 do not know
 much about the order ot
 business and of course I
 have no dispute on t
 l tnt subject but I
 would inquire if the resolutions
 whicfi I sorne time ago
 had the honor to submit
 and which vere the subject
 of our proceedings on the
 day before yesterday are not
 unfinished business also and prior
 in point of time to
 the railroad bill The PRESIDING
 OFFICER l hc Chair stato
 that those resolutions were the
 special order but that the
 Pacific railroad bill being the
 unfin ishcd business yesterday takes
 prccedcnce of that as a
 special order and was in
 order at one o clock
 but by a vote of
 the Senate was postponed until
 two o clock in order
 that the discussion might proceed
 upon the joint resolution which
 has just passed Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 am satisfied then with
 the decision of the Chair
 and I now move that
 that bill be postponed in
 order that the Sen ate
 may proceed to take up
 the resolutions to which I
 have referred Mr President I
 think that those resolutions considering
 the subject to which they
 refer and considering the condition
 While I am up sir
 1 desire to say another
 word On a former day
 in the Senate while we
 were in secret or executive
 session made some remarks on
 subjects then before the Senate
 It was in se I
 understand that something pur cret
 session porting to be a
 speech of mine delivered on
 that occasion was published a
 day or two afterwards as
 the speech delivered by me
 on that occasion do not
 know that anybody would be
 so fairly the object of
 suspicion as I would be
 myself for having connived at
 or authorized it or assisted
 in its publication Ido not
 think any of my brother
 Senators would suspect that I
 had any agency in this
 publication I however take this
 occasion and feel it perhaps
 a duty to myself 1
 0 say that I not
 only had no part or
 agency whatever in it but
 I consider it a violation
 of the rulesof the Sen
 ate and the publication ought
 to be looked upon as
 spurious I have not seen
 it I have not read
 it and never intend to
 read it nor willingly to
 I will give no hear
 a repetition of its contents
 countenance to anything published so
 spuriously and in violation of
 all the rules of the
 Senate I disavow it all
 It do not know what
 it contains is not made
 by any authority that is
 entitled to credit or belief
 I have heard casually that
 I am represented with having
 in t hat speech advocated
 strongly indeed fiercely the policy
 of coercion in respect to
 the seceding States Mr President
 I did no such thing
 and you know it I
 did say that in my
 judgment the Congress of the
 United States had the POWER
 but the exercise of it
 was always a question of
 expediency apd that there might
 be cases to which that
 power was plainly applicable and
 where it ought to bc
 exercised and nobody can be
 at a loss to imagine
 such cases arising in either
 States or Territories If the
 District of Columbia were to
 undertake to secede and give
 us notice that having resumed
 her ancient sovereignty she desired
 us to aban don the
 Capitol does any man suppose
 that the Govcrnment could acquiesce
 in such a proceed ing
 or that if persisted in
 it should not employ force
 to put it down Certainly
 not I expressly said that
 now was not the occasion
 or the time for the
 application of any doctrine or
 policy of coercion but by
 some misunderstanding 01 other of
 the publisher of this supposed
 speech of mine I tun
 represented as a determined and
 fierce ad vocate of coercion
 now upon the seceding States
 I said the direct contrary
 Sir this is all I
 have now to say on
 the sub The PRESIDING OFFICER
 It is moved that the
 Pacific railroad bill and all
 other special orders be postponed
 for the purpose of taking
 up for consideration the resolutions
 introduced by the Senator from
 Kentucky Mr G WIN It
 is most unpleåsant to me
 to be opposing this motion
 whenever the Senator makes it
 but unfortunately there is a
 conflict in the order of
 business between those resolutions and
 n measure which is of
 such consequence to the State
 that I in part represent
 that I am com pellcd
 always to give it precedence
 over any other business that
 comes before the Senate if
 I do justice to tbc
 public sentiment of my State
 I am I believe in
 favor of the Senator s
 resolutions that is generally vell
 understood for I think I
 have said so about a
 dozen times but I hope
 he will let us go
 on to day and see
 if we cannot dis 1
 pose of the question now
 before the Senate think we
 can and then shall be
 willing to Dive his resolutions
 precedence if my vote will
 do so I think if
 we get until they are
 disposed of i through with
 one thing at a time
 we shall make I hope
 thereforc that the rail more
 progress road bill will not
 be postponed Mr CRITTENDEN ltwasbutafewdaysago
 that my friend s bill
 after occupying a great deal
 of the time of the
 Senate lost its place among
 the regular orders of the
 Senate We were then con
 sidering these resolutions discussing and
 debating them Instead of pursuing
 his own maxim and improvement
 and I would express some
 views of the country are
 entitled before all other sub
 jects to the consideration of
 the Senate Ido not It
 doing one thing at a
 time those resolutions were on
 the subject if it were
 not that it would per
 I feel put aside and
 somehow or other the railroad
 bill haps embarrass the passage
 of joint resolu wish to
 be importunate about this matter
 it my duty to be
 urgent and it is for
 that reason l on account
 of its great superiority to
 any con tion and 1
 prefer to keep silent rather
 than that II I have
 no doubt that I often
 make myself un sideration that
 attached to the safety of
 the Union the resolution should
 be embarrassed The joint resolution
 was reported to the Senate
 i pleasant to gentlemen who
 have favorite mcas II has
 taken precedencc as amended and
 tho amendment was concRrred ures
 by continually a king for
 the consideration W Mr G
 WIN The Senator will permit
 me to I do it
 as a matter of dut
 y I say that his
 resolutions were put aside in
 order to of this subject
 in and ordered to bc
 engrossed and tho joint res
 olution to be read a
 third time It was read
 the hope the rai road
 bill will be postponed and
 those take up the tariff
 another question entirely II Mr
 CRITTENDEN am speaking of a
 resolutions taken up and acted
 upon third time and passed
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE time
 antecedent to that The Senator
 inquircd of the Chair if
 the railroad bill was a
 special order and was told
 it was not that it
 hud lost its place but
 i say somehow or other
 by some parliament ary proceeding
 all very proper no doubt
 it is I do not
 complain of it again the
 spec il order but the
 gentleman is speaking of precedence
 in the order of business
 The resolutions were pre cedent
 to his bill but they
 have somehow lost it However
 I have said all I
 desire to say on this
 matter Mr GWIN The way
 the Pacific railroad bill got
 precedence was by a majority
 of the Senate votino to
 ta ke it up Mr
 CRIT I ENDEN Yes sir
 Mr DOUGLAS Let us find
 out now whether here is
 a majority to take it
 up The PRESIDING OFFICER Is
 the Senate ready for the
 question on the motion of
 the Sen ator from Kentucky
 Mr WILSON I ask for
 the yeas and nays on
 that question The yeas and
 nays were ordered Mr LANE
 Mr President 1 to say
 upon this subject I am
 in favor of a Pacific
 railroad and have always been
 in favor of a Pa
 cific raih oad bill That
 is well understood but my
 opinion is that it is
 very much more import ant
 at this time to consider
 the resolutions of the Senator
 from Kentucky They relate to
 the welfare of the country
 Something myst be done or
 we shall have no country
 and a railroad will be
 It can never be made
 I fear of no consequence
 unless something can be done
 to stop the spirit of
 dissolution that is now in
 the country I should i
 like very much to see
 the railroad bill considered to
 day but i trust it
 will bc postponed for a
 day or two until it
 can bo ascertained whether the
 Senate intend to do anyt
 hing on the important If
 they can do subject of
 which I have spoken they
 ought to do it quickly
 That is the way I
 look at it and though
 a Pacific rail I road
 man shall vote in favor
 of postponing the consideration of
 that subject and to take
 up the resolutions of the
 Senator from Kentucky The Secretary
 proceeded to caki the roil
 Mr FOOT when his name
 was called said I desire
 to say that r have
 paired off upon all these
 questions for the residue of
 this week with the Senator
 from North Carolina Mr BRAGG
 who has been culled home
 by sickness in his family
 I yielded to that request
 I may say the more
 readily from the fact of
 his having himself but recently
 extended a like courtesy to
 the absent Senatei from Maine

 and able railroad men in
 the Stato of Ohio He
 has great experience in the
 business he is a man
 of great wealth and js
 re garded as one of

 The amendment was agreed to
 Mr GWIN Now hope the
 bill will be re ported
 to the Senate Mr BENJAMIN
 I have a short amendment
 to offer to t be
 second section Mr FITCH 1
 desire to offer one to
 the first section which is
 in advance of that though
 I do not know that
 it makes any difference in
 the Sen ate whether wc
 amend the sectiops in regular
 order or not The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FOSTER Does the
 Senator from Louisiana give way
 to the Senator from Indiana
 Mr BENJAMIN Yes sir IVIr
 FITCH I wish to add
 to the names of the
 corporators residing within the State
 of Indi ana Dillard Ricketts
 James Johnson and Wil liam
 L Brown The amendment was
 agreed to N ii POLK
 I n ovc to amend
 by adding after the gentlemen
 napned in the bill from
 Missouri xvVilliam M McPherson and
 Thomas P Hud The amendment
 was agreed to Mr WADE
 only proposed just now one
 name fronl Ohio but I
 sce that most gentlemen propose
 two naines from their States
 and there fore I propose
 now to add the name
 of William Case of Ohio
 a most excellent rnan Mr
 YVILSON I sugn cst to
 the Senator that that name
 is in the bill already
 IVIr WADE Then I withdraw
 the motion Mr FOO I
 I offer the fbllowing names
 to be added to those
 already in the bill from
 the State of New York
 Martin V B Wilcoxson and
 Nathaniel Niles The ameridment was
 agreed to Mr LANE I
 now move to amend by
 striking out from the list
 of narncs from Oregon the
 name f B F Harding
 and inserting the name of
 J H Reed Mr LATHAM
 I think that was done
 yes terday Mr LANE inquire
 of the Chair whether ing
 is objectionable tone for ÉOÄsönS
 I Ado not choose to
 say anythihg about lhere and
 as had nothing whatevér to
 do with presenting these names
 I think when I orie
 man is objeétion able that
 I should have the privilege
 of hamino another who shall
 be one of the corporators
 For these reasons briefly given
 I hope the Sen ate
 will not hesitate to strike
 out the name of Harding
 and insert the name of
 Reed Mr BAKER I regret
 that it is inebmbent on
 me to say two or
 three words ås to this
 motion to strike out the
 name of Mr Harding happened
 that when I came here
 I found the railroad bill
 upon its passage through the
 other I neither inquired up
 to that moment House nor
 did I know what gentlemen
 from Oregon had their names
 inserted in the bill I
 had reason to believe and
 I do believe that the
 names which were in the
 bill were inserted there by
 the consent I believe them
 all to be his of
 my colleague I therefore did
 not think it improper to
 friends suggest the name of
 one gentleman from the State
 of Oregon and I apprehend
 the Senate will think it
 very improper to strike him
 out he having been put
 there at my suggestion therc
 be I am vcry far
 from ob some good reason
 for it jecting to the
 names that are already in
 the bill by the wish
 of my colleague and if
 among the three names that
 my colleague or tho Rcpresent
 ative in the lower House
 put in the bill there
 are any displeasing to hili
 l or if he would
 desire to substitute another narne
 for any of them or
 to add an addit ional
 name far be it from
 to raise a controversy in
 the Senate upon that point
 the gentleman whom I thonght
 it not improper to suggest
 myself Mr Harding against whom
 the endeavor is now made
 I deem it proper to
 say is a citizen of
 the highest standing He was
 the Secretary of the territorial
 organization appoin ted by the
 present Administration Hc is now
 the Speaker of the House
 of Representatives t the State
 of Oregon He is a
 man of as much char
 acter as any there or
 elsewhere a man Of indom
 itable energy and of the
 highest qualities among the men
 of our State I do
 not seek to inquire I
 am not quite sure that
 I knox v the reasons
 that prompt my col league
 to move his rejection from
 the bill sure they must
 be other than merc personal
 ones beförc the Senate will
 do that gentleman may be
 allowed the expression myself that
 dis I do not think
 I have intruded upon the
 respect Senate any personal wish
 or view of rny own
 but I corifess that I
 should feel it as an
 indignity offered to him my
 friend and to Ille which
 think neither of us deserves
 and I hope there this
 motion was put yesterday r
 IM r LATHAM I know
 the Senator inade it PRESi1
 lNG OFFICER The Chair thir
 ks this question has not
 been put N lr LANE
 That is rny recollection Mr
 CLARK I desire to ask
 the Senator if the man
 xvhose name is already in
 the bill is not a
 proper rnan to be there
 Mr LANE I will say
 to the Senator that I
 do not think hc is
 Mr CLARK I have no
 objection to striking o uLany
 unfit man but I was
 very sorry yester day that
 we got iiito the debate
 which took place and that
 anv names were stricken out
 because it seemed to be
 an imputation on the gentlemen
 would rather whose names were
 stricken out add halfa dozen
 than strike out any if
 that will satisfy the Senator
 Mr LANE wili say to
 the Senator that I was
 not consulted about the nuncs
 that should be I can
 see included as the corporators
 in Oregon no advantage that
 the name of Harding can
 be to this bill or
 to the road He has
 had I believe no experience
 in railroad making He has
 no reputation that would give
 any strength to the bilk
 Besides that 1 will remark
 that the three gentlmnen now
 mentioned in the biil are
 taken fore the Senate will
 not agree to the amendmcn
 to strike out his name
 I deem it proper to
 remark thut whether the other
 three remaining in the bill
 are gentleman that I would
 have selectcd is not now
 the ques I find them
 there They are th we
 by the tion selection of
 the gentternfn who represénted thé
 State before I camc herd
 Far be it from me
 to inquire into their personal
 or political relations to me
 or t o my friends
 or to endeavor to remove
 them and if my colleague
 chooses to add the name
 of Mr Reed although I
 confess it would not be
 my choice I shall not
 interfere in any wise with
 that Mr LANE It is
 not my wish Mc President
 to consurne the time of
 the Senate over a rnattcr
 so small as this but
 I differ very much from
 my collcaguc in rciation to
 the character of this man
 I do not kook upon
 him as standii g fair
 in Oregon at all and
 outside of the county where
 he lives he has no
 reputation that would assist this
 work shall not take the
 trouble to read from many
 newspapers that I have in
 my drawer comments I would
 not give ad on this
 man Mr Harding ditional publicity
 to them but I will
 say that he is objectionable
 to me r I he
 Senator can narne from the
 northern portion of the State
 As the no man in
 Oregon of any political party
 in p ace bill now
 stands it provides for extending
 the road of this man
 that I would not cheerfully
 accede to He says this
 man was appointed to the
 sec from the Sacramento valley
 to Portland in Ore retaryship
 of the Territory by the
 present Ad li gon With
 the name that I propose
 to insert in Mr CHANDLER
 1 desire to withdraw that
 place of Mr Harding we
 shall have two amendment and
 offer another in its place
 I wish rators living at
 the terminus of that road
 and we by the last
 Administration and I believe reap
 pointed by the present Administration
 at my in shall have
 one at Jacksonviilc in the
 southern to substitute instead of
 those the names of James
 I ask i efid of
 the State That will give
 strength to thc stange He
 was then reco rnizcd as
 a Democrat F Joy and
 B Ward of Michigan that
 the names of those gentlemen
 be inserted in bill that
 will give the road an
 advantage that it but his
 conduct recently as a politician
 has been would not have
 otherwise in the getting o
 sub I such as to
 bring down upon him the
 odium of all good Inen
 in the State and if
 the gentleman v ant s
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 scribers and having the stock
 taken and will is on
 the amendment offered by the
 Senator from II think greatly
 prcnnote the work As Mr
 I lard i to hear
 the reasons as set forth
 as I do not wish
 544 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 24 to read them myself
 I will place them in
 his hands In place of
 Mr Harding if he does
 not like Mr Reed let
 him take any other man
 let him take Mr Dryer
 of Portland an editor of
 a Republican paper who has
 made more noise about a
 railroad project than any other
 man in the State or
 at least he has taken
 a more active interest in
 at tending railroad meetings and
 in presenting the importance of
 this work than any other
 man in that State I
 believe He is opposed to
 me in politics he has
 fought against me in every
 polit ucal battle but he
 has done it Openly in
 a manly way I have
 no objection to his name
 or to the name of
 any other Republican but this
 man is a Republican claiming
 to be a Democrat He
 is in my opinion a
 dishonest man a dishonest poli
 tician dishonest in all things
 unreliable and not worthy of
 a place in this bill
 His name ought to be
 stricken out of the bill
 for it is objectionable and
 some other name put in
 I am willing to agree
 to any other man that
 thc Senator will se I
 am willing to leave it
 to him to say who
 I have presented the naune
 of shall fill the place
 Mr Reed but L am
 willing to take any other
 man in the State and
 I do not want a
 Democrat par ticularly I would
 just as soon have a
 gentleman of the opposite party
 as a Democrat if he
 is only an honest man
 and in favor of the
 work but I ask it
 as a favor of the
 Senate to me that this
 name shall be stricken out
 and the name of any
 other person inserted that the
 Senator from Ore on may
 suggest I care not who
 that other person may be
 Mr BXKER Mr President it
 is quite im possible for
 lire tt enter into a
 detail of the diff cullies
 which it is obvious cxist
 between the gen tlemun whose
 name it is proposed to
 strike out and rny colleao
 ue They are matters of
 our own local history there
 which I do not think
 posterity will be much concerned
 about which do not propose
 by any word of minc
 to put on record here
 So far as the attack
 upon the character of an
 absent gentleman is concerned J
 only reply to repeat the
 it so far as it
 affects this measarc gentlemat l
 VI nose naine is selected
 is man of unblemished reputation
 hc is as honest as
 rny colleague or myself he
 is as much respected wherever
 he is known He was
 a member of the last
 Legislature and is now the
 Speaker of its House of
 Representatives He has been in
 the most responsible offc e
 in the State for many
 years He is the leader
 oti the l ouglas Democracy
 of the State and is
 the most efficient leader that
 my dis tingmshed friend from
 Illinois has had in that
 State He is a rnan
 of pure moral character a
 character acrainst which I have
 hitherto heard no word ever
 spoken He isa resident of
 the county in which I
 live av d I know
 hirn intimately Ithat relations n
 re not those or his
 tnod grn political friendship my
 colleague I know and if
 I could say so I
 would say I regret it
 but that he has personal
 relations unkindly to the distin
 gXlQl ijom ortron is thali
 know from QI y word
 of his and mysclf will
 both live lonrr enough to
 regret that the mere question
 of a name a form
 in a bill of this
 kind should tead to a
 discussion which I think is
 unworthy of the place If
 his narne had not been
 put there and I had
 supposed that the Senator would
 endeavor to reject it I
 should for the sake of
 peace not have offered it
 but I submit to every
 gentleman of right feeling on
 this floor that now when
 this gentleman is sought to
 be rejected upon an attack
 on his moral character as
 a man and as a
 gentleman and considering was through
 my motion Lhat his name
 was pla ced there and
 considering that the rejection would
 be an attack repealed here
 and indorsed by the Senatc
 and spread wherever his name
 is known it would be
 a Ineasure so unkind to
 him and so unjust to
 me that I believe scarcely
 any Senator upon this floor
 witl be found to do
 it I close by repeating
 that far from objectincyto anybody
 the Senator has introduced I
 Yield to anybody he may
 yet introduce and if indeed
 he does in his heart
 believe that the gentlemall frou
 l Jacksonvi lc Mr Reed
 whom he proposes would aid
 in getting any stock in
 Oregon I doubt in tho
 state of our present finances
 vevy whcthcr anybody will get
 any but if hc really
 believes t lont that gentleman
 would add any weight to
 the bill or any efficiency
 to the measure I will
 gladly agree to his introduction
 I beg the pardon of
 the Seoak for de tqining
 them for a moment on
 a personal matter and shall
 say no more on the
 subject Mr LANE I do
 not intend to say another
 word I leave it to
 the Senate I know this
 gen tleman better than the
 Senator from Oregon knows him
 I have known him very
 much longer say that he
 is not trustworthy he ought
 not to be in the
 bill and I ask for
 the yeas and nays upon
 the motion Mr CLARK This
 question I believe is divis
 ible The question may be
 taken first on striking out
 the name Mr LANE I
 do not care who is
 inserted Mr CLARK I have
 no objection to putting in
 any name that may be
 proposed The PRESIDING OF FICER
 In the opinion of the
 Chair the motion is not
 divisible A mo tion to
 strike out and insert being
 madc as one motion it
 must be put as one
 The question being put on
 Mr LANE s amend ment
 it was declared to be
 rejected Mr WADE I have
 a name to be in
 serted in this bill from
 Ohio Mr LANE had asked
 for the yeas and nays
 on my amendment Mr BAKER
 I second that I have
 no objec tion to the
 yeas and nays The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Chair an nounced
 the decision but by common
 consent Oh no the yeas
 and nays may be taken
 i do not care any
 Mr LANE very well thing
 about it Mr WADE My
 colleague is not here and
 as have caused the name
 of a person in the
 north ern part of the
 State of Ohio to be
 inserted it is slwcrcsted to
 mé that there is a
 most excellent man in the
 southern part of the State
 whmn it would I move
 to insert the be well
 to put in the bill
 name of Thomns Sherlock of
 Cincinnati He is an excellent
 man and acquainted with this
 busi ness The tunendment was
 a ffreed to Mr SEBASTIAN
 i move to amend the
 bill by inserting in the
 proper place among the names
 of the corporators the name
 of Arnold Flttrris of the
 District ofColumbia This District I
 believe has no representative among
 the corporators now in the
 bill He isa gentleman in
 every way qual ified for
 the trust and competent to
 meet the re sponsible dutie
 which this position will impose
 upon him Thereföre I submit
 his name by way ot
 amendment The amendment was agreed
 to Mr CfUTTENDEN There some
 gen tlemen in Kentucky Jargely
 interested in railroad noatters and
 I begm leave to offer
 the names of the following

 CAMERON 1 hope that amendment
 will not be agreed to
 ft destroys tho feature ing
 the rails to be of
 American iron Mr BENJAMIN 1
 did not suppose there could
 be a possible objection to
 the amendment the money of
 the Government for the construction
 of the road and provide
 that American rails and American
 work shall be employed for
 it even if they cannot
 be got at the same
 price as imported articles of
 equal quality or in other
 words that we shall give
 out of the Treasury a
 sum of money as a
 direct protection to American work
 and Amen I do not
 suppose a proposition of Lhat
 can iron I supposed this
 kind was ever made before
 proviso had been omitted by
 mistake in draw I had
 no idea that it was
 inten ing up the bill
 tional Mr CAMERON 1 suppose
 it is just as fair
 that we should buy American
 iron because of its better
 quality instead of European iron
 as it is that we
 should pay a tax on
 all the sugar we use
 from other countries for the
 benefit of the State of
 Louisiana I think the gentleman
 s State has about as
 much benefit from this Government
 as any State in the
 Union and I think he
 is the last person to
 talk about protection to the
 manufac turers df this country
 The reason why the road
 should be made of American
 iron is that Amer ican
 rails are better lasl longer
 rnuch longer than any iron
 which is sent here from
 Europe Our warehouses are full
 now of foreign railroad iron
 which has condemned in every
 quarter of the world Only
 the other day an acquaintance
 of mine visited some of
 the public warehouses in New
 York and saw railroad iron
 there which had been manufactured
 in Eno land sent into
 India and there r cted
 and then sent to America
 to be sold here because
 we buy any kind of
 worthless iron provided it can
 be got at a cheap
 rate Mr BENJAMIN The Senator
 probably did not hear the
 amendment read Mr CAMERON it
 Mr BENJAMIN The is that
 it shall be obtained at
 the same price if of
 equal quality Mr CAMERON it
 read Mr BENJAMIN Then what
 has the quality to do
 with it Mr CANJIERON I
 will meet the gentleman there
 Neither he nor åny other
 man unaccus tomed to the
 article can tell until the
 iron is laid down whether
 it is of equal quality
 Iron is brought here just
 as that I mentioned as
 coming from India looking quite
 as good as our own
 iron and if the gentleman
 were a purchaser he would
 probably buy it because he
 could get it some ten
 or fifteeh or twenty dollars
 a ton less than our
 but he would find directly
 after he got own iron
 it into use that it
 was worthless The better way
 I think is to leave
 this provision as it was
 oriffin ally in the bill
 as passed by the other
 House Mr GREEN I would
 suggest the propriety of striking
 out the word American and
 insert United States Therc is
 Canada there are the Russian
 possessions there is Mexico there
 is Central America and there
 is South America all in
 America and if we intend
 to con fine it to
 iron manufactured by our own
 people Arnerican ought to be
 and Uni States iberted The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The motion of
 the Senator from Missouri cannot

 GRQEN Rdine was a stigge
 on not a motio The
 amendment of Mr BENJAMIN was

 bill as one of the
 corporators from New Jersey He
 is a man of great
 respectability and intelli ence and

 not propose to offer to

 particular at all yet since
 my col league has proposed

 worthy and excellent corporator from

 that will make for Wisconsin
 Mr DOOLITTLE Five The amendment

 agreed to Mr RICE I
 wish to make a remark
 in regard to the amendment
 of my colleague The gentle
 men proposed by him are
 all Republicans but they are
 very good men and therefore
 my col league and myself
 agree upon the selection of
 those names Mr CAMERON I
 think we haveabout names enough
 and yet I am going

 propose to add the name

 At the end list of

 words and the rest of

 OFFICER Does the sen ator
 request the Chair to put
 the question on that motion
 Oh no Mr DOUGLAS If
 there are no more names
 to be added I have
 a substantial amendment to propose
 Mr SAULSBüRY Will the Senator
 excuse me a moment I
 believe my State is not
 repre sented and L therefore
 move to add the names
 of Charles l Dupont William
 Sharp and James Povner of
 Delaware The amendment was agreed
 to Mr DOUGLAS In line
 twelve of section thir teen
 I move to strike out
 the words is hereby ahd
 insert shall be The point
 of the amend ment will
 be understood when I state
 that the bi now reads
 There is hereby granted on
 the terms and condit ns
 hereinafter mentioned to the Southern
 Pacific Railroad Cosnpany chartered by
 the State of l exas
 of which coni pany Vernon
 K Stevenson is president and
 to the assignees of said
 company every alternate section of
 land to thc amount of
 ten alternate sections per rniKe
 on cach side of such
 railroad line as said cotnpany
 may adopt from the western
 border of Texas on the
 Inost eliaibEe route to the
 eastern border of California The
 language there is that the
 land is hereby granted I
 apprehend that that would vest
 the title to all the
 land from the passage of
 the act although the road
 might never be made I
 am sure such is not
 the intention of the framers
 of the bill but I
 am apprehensive that such would
 be its legal effect Mr
 COLLAMER Has thegentlemanlooked to see
 that there is no qualifying
 clanse Mr DOUGLAS Ihave been
 through the bill and I
 cannot find any provision chan
 ina that legal construction of
 it At any rate there
 can be no objection I
 think to making the bill
 clear and specific on this
 point I am not willing
 that the land shall be
 granted on either road any
 faster than the road shall
 be completed in sections of
 fifty miles When the contractors
 shall have completed fifty miles
 on cither road through the
 public lands I am willing
 that lands shall be granted
 for the section so completed
 and not be yond that
 until they make another section
 of fifty miles I am
 not willine for instance to
 provide fora road that is
 six or eight hundred miles
 long before it reaches any
 public lands and make the
 grant applicable to that part
 of the road where there
 are no public lands thus
 consuming the land grant before
 it reaches the public domain
 at all is hereby granted
 and insert shall be grant
 ed and then to add
 at the end the bill
 a pro viso to this
 effect Provided That the lands
 appropriated in this act to
 aid the construction of said
 roads respectively shall be held
 in trust by the U
 ttitcd States and not conveyal
 or the title SATURDAY JANUARY
 26 1861 domain and then
 such lands only shall be
 conveyed as are situated on
 either side of the fifty
 miles so completed and on
 the completion of each fifty
 Iniles the lands on either
 Sidc of that part of
 the road so eompletcd shall
 be conveyed as aforesaid If
 it is the intention of
 the framers of this bill
 that the lands shall not
 be vested until so much
 of the road is finished
 as is situated through the
 public lands then this amendment
 is necessary and proper If
 the inteution of the bill
 is to vest the title
 to the land from the
 passage of the act whether
 the road is ever made
 or not I cannot support
 it Mr COLLAMER Permit me
 to suggest to t he
 gentleman that perhaps the better
 word to use there in
 speaking of the land would
 be seques tered Mr DOUGLAS
 Instead of appropriated Mr COLLAMER
 Yes sir i merely make
 the suggestion Mr CLINGMAN While
 the honorable sen ator from
 Illinois is preparing his amendment
 with his permission I desire
 to add a name to
 the list The only gentleman
 that I know in my
 State who is an ardent
 advocate of this road and
 who takes great interest in
 internal improvements is a gentleman
 who is member of our
 present Le gisiature I ask
 that his name be inserted
 Pos sibly somethil g or
 other may some dav corne
 out of it I move
 to insert the uame of
 William H Thomas of North
 Carolina The amendment was agreed
 to Mr DOUGLAS Now 1
 move to strike out the
 words is hereby granted as
 to both roads and insert
 shall be granted and then
 I will add the proviso
 The amendment was agreed to
 Mr DOUGLAS Now 1 move
 to add at the end
 of the bill this proviso
 Provided That the lands sequestered
 in this act to aid
 in the construction of said
 roads respectivöly shall be held
 in trust by the United
 States and not conveyed or
 the rifle vested in either
 ol s aid companies until
 said roads respect ivcly shali
 have been completed from thcir
 starting points to w lore
 the public lands are situated
 nor until at least fifty
 miles shall have been completed
 through the public domain and
 then such lands only shall
 be eonveycd as are situated
 on either side of the
 fitty miles so cornplctcd and
 on the cmnpJcti01i Oi each
 fifty Iniies the lands on
 either side of that part
 ot the road so completed
 shall be conveyed a s
 aforesaid The amendment was agreed
 to Mr I propose to
 amend the fourth section of
 the bill in the forty
 seventh line by Inserting after
 United States the words And
 no Inortgagc or construction bonds
 shali ever be issued by
 said company on said road
 or nyortgage or lien made
 in any way except to
 the United States So as
 to malco the clause read
 And as the work proceeds
 after the completion of fifty
 consecutive mile sections and they
 are approved as atOre said
 bonds shall be issued Cor
 each milc so coynpleted ac
 cording to the above rates
 and the issue of said
 bonds and the receipt thereof
 by the corporation or corporations
 aforesaid shall operate as a
 first mortgage lien to the
 Uni ted States on the
 road bed road rolling stock
 iron and all the buildings
 and appurtenances belonging to said
 road and all the purchases
 made ot materials or outfits
 to secure to the Unjtcd
 States the reimbursernent or the
 sums so ad vaneed and
 interest thereon by the United
 States and no mortgage or
 construction bonds shall ever bc
 issued by said company on
 said road or niortgarre or
 lien madc in any way
 except to the United States
 I hope the Senate will
 adopt this amendment I think
 it will contribute to the
 building of the road We
 propose in this bill to
 grant money and lands We
 hold out inducements to capital
 ists to go on and
 construct this road Now sir
 NEW SERIES NO 35 This
 amendment is against that We
 lenåthe credit of this Government
 to a large amount td
 this company wc give them
 labdsg and we want the
 persons that go into this
 road to pay iheii money
 into it and not to
 incur debts and getup stock
 speculations and issue bonds then
 full and throw the whole
 thing back on the Government
 I believe that if this
 amendment be adopted all the
 persons who take hold of
 this road will un derstand
 that they must put their
 money in it and they
 will go in it with
 caution with care know ing
 what they are about and
 it will keep mere speculators
 mere jobbers that class of
 men who havc ruined so
 many railroads in the Ünited
 States and destroyed the property
 of so many men ou
 t of this concern and
 bring into it men of
 experi ence of capital and
 of character I hope Ehe
 amendment will be adopted for
 I believe that if it
 be adopted it will be
 a safeguard and contribute towards
 the building of the road
 and if it be not
 adopted and we are to
 have first andA second and
 third and fourth and perhaps
 fifth class mort gage bonds
 issued on this railroad the
 jobbers and speculat ors will
 get into it the road
 will never be finished but
 break down and be thrown
 upon Government of the country
 Mr HALE I entirely agree
 with the object that the
 Senatorfrom Massachusetts aims at but
 I confess the amendment is
 new to me and I
 very much doubt the wisdom
 of means that he pro
 poses to effect the object
 The United States are to
 be the first mortgagees of
 this road and they will
 have all the security which
 that first mort gage gives
 them I think the interests
 of this cor poi atlon
 had better be left in
 the hands of those who
 manage it They will be
 more interested in it than
 anybody else This country has
 been educated and has a
 great deal of experience in
 this matter of building railroads
 and the people have learned
 by the errors of the
 past and I thmk this
 had better be left with
 them Besides as a question
 between the United States and
 all the rest of the
 World this would be bad
 policy be cause the United
 Stata being the holders of
 the first mortgage every subsequent
 expenditure of money upon the
 road is for their benefit
 as the first mortgarrco and
 tends to increase the security
 of the States and to
 render more valuable thatupon which
 they have a lien For
 that reason speaking in behalf
 of the Government of the
 Uni ted States and for
 the security which they hold
 I should be opposed to
 such a proposition as this
 Besides if after the corpörators
 have gone on and demonstrated
 to the capitalists of the
 world that by the aid
 of the Government of the
 United States they are enabled
 to build this railroad which
 of course will be subject
 to the first lien of
 the United States if capitaliSts
 will put confi dence in
 the direction of the road
 and advance money to enable
 them to build it it
 being subject to the lien
 which the United States already
 have where is the objection
 to it I confess that
 I can not see it
 Now while I entirely sympathize
 with the object which the
 honorable Senator from Massachusetts has
 in view and which he
 desires to effectuate by his
 amendment I confess that to
 my mind his amendment does
 not strike me as being
 likely to produce the particular
 effect which he desires but
 the contrary one Mr WILSON
 1 am very glad the
 Senator from New Hampshife agrees
 in the object I have
 in view but I regret
 very much that fie dissents
 from the position I have
 taken NOW sir let me
 I am exceedingly desirous that
 the road shall be say
 that if this amendment be
 adopted the men built and
 I am desirous that the
 persons I who put their
 money into the road will
 have some underta ke to
 construct it shall invest their
 means j security that their
 right are not to be
 sacrificed in it and that
 it shall not be a
 stock jobbing con i by
 the managers of the road
 by giving mortgages I have
 no doubt that the railroads
 of the and going into
 stocktiobbing operations which United States
 have cost hundreds of millions
 of have ruined so many
 roads and brought such de
 dollars more than they would
 have cost if the moralization
 upon the country The proposition
 proper system had been adopted
 to commence with in their
 construction but the plan has
 been too often to go
 into these roads issue mortgage
 bonds then second class and
 then third class vested in
 either of said emnp xnies
 until said roads respect bonds
 money at extravacyant rates ively
 shall have been cotnplcted t
 rcnn their starting points ruinin
 roads and ruining the persons
 who to the public until
 at least tiny miles shall
 have he an constructed through
 the public originally subscril yea
 the stock 35 of this
 amendment is the résult of
 the experience of the last
 fifteen years The men who
 have been I engaged in
 constructing railroads and understand this
 whole subject have advocated this
 policy and it has substantial
 v been adopted in my
 State by checks and guards
 against the old course that
 has ruined and robbed so
 many Of the families Of
 546 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 24 the country who took
 stock in roads when they
 vyiéremfirst started and afterwai ds
 found that first sccond and
 third mortgage bonds were put
 upon them so Ihat their
 property was entirely lost While
 the managers contrived to make
 something out of them Now
 sir there is not a
 man in the Senate who
 would not rather take stock
 in the road if this
 amendment be adopted than if
 it were to be left
 entirely to the management of
 the men who may have
 control of it to issue
 first second and third class
 mortgage bends as they please
 The Government grants 60 000
 000 in money and a
 large quantity of land to
 build a railroad that is
 to cost about a hundred
 million dollars and by adopting
 this amendment we ask the
 per sons who go into
 it to pay their money
 be lieve the United States
 will be much more secured
 by t he adoption of
 the amendment than they will
 be by having a set
 of men brought into the
 road who never intend to
 pay any money and who
 come in simply to get
 what the Government offers to
 get the Government honds and
 lands and then to issue
 mortgage bonds and borrow money
 and cheat everybody that puts
 money into tkne work honestly
 I tell you sir the
 good of this road if
 we are in sober earnest
 about it requires these guards
 and checks The one will
 draw capital ISts it will
 draw honest men it will
 draw mcn of the right
 stamp But if you leave
 it open to that class
 of men who have been
 the jobbers in theraih oads
 ofthigcountry men without fortune and
 too many of them without
 character yon will never secure
 the completion of the road
 I bclieve this amendment to
 be of vitul importance to
 the road and I hope
 it will be adopted The
 amendmcnt was agreed to Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 desire to offer
 one or two amendments to
 this bilk In the thirteenth
 section after the word uniting
 in the seventh line I
 Inove to strike out the
 words west of longitude 970
 and insert at or near
 the ninety seventh degree of
 west longitude In regard to
 thc southern route one branch
 of which starts from the
 west line of Arkansas and
 the other from the west
 line of Louisiana the bill
 provides that they are to
 meet by convercring lines sotne
 where west of the ninety
 seventi degree of lon gitude
 but they may not meet
 until they get to the
 Gulf of California or the
 Pacific ocean Mr l here
 is no objection to that
 amendment It makes it more
 specific Mr DOOLI I TLE
 I suppose there is no
 objection for it makes it
 definite that the point of
 meetinz be at or near
 the ninety seventh degre of
 longitude Mr HALE I wish
 my friend from Wiscon sin
 if hc undertakes to make
 it more definite would really
 do so W c cannot
 tell w hut at or
 near Lueuns It Incans sornewhere
 about there somewhere in the
 neighborhood Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 sa not to exceed two
 detyrees in either direction Mr
 I IALE b r Phat
 will do but at or
 near is very indefinite Mr
 DOOLITTLE A degree allows a
 prctty large latitude si xty
 miles Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 It does but not so
 much as at or near
 Mr DOOLITTLE say between the
 ninety seventh and ninety eighth
 degrees M r HALE There
 was some experience in the
 St ate of Illinois about
 the Central road I think
 they f oun l out
 what at or near meant
 there They took in about
 the whole length of the
 State Mr DOOLIFL TLE I
 move to amend then so
 bctween the ninety seventh and
 as to say ninety eighth
 dem ces of west longitude
 The PRESIDiNG OFFICER It is
 moved to I amend the
 bill by striking out in
 linc eight of the thirteenth
 section Ibe words west of
 longitude I ninety seven degrees
 and inscrtinc thc words between
 the ninety seventh and ninety
 eighth dcgcees of west longitude
 Mr G WIN I suggest
 to the Senator to say
 not west of the ninety
 eighth degree They may wish
 to come together before they
 get to the ninety seventh
 degree Mr DOOLITTLE That would
 defeat what I understand to
 be the purpose of mentioning
 the ninety seventh degree at
 all for if you leave
 them to meet anywhere cast
 of the ninety seventh de
 gree they may start at
 Fort Smith and run south
 through the Indian territory That
 does not effect the purpose
 at all Mr GWIN very
 well 1 have objection to
 the Senator s amendment The
 amendment was agreed to MIC
 DOOLITTLE The of first section
 of the bill as to
 thc central road now is
 uniting within two hundred miles
 of the Mis I desire
 to insert an amcndment souri
 river there to make the
 point of union a little
 more definite I have no
 pgrsonal interestin the ques tion
 as to the precise point
 where the two branches should
 meet but the great city
 of Chicago on thc one
 hand and the city of
 St Louis on he other
 may have an interest in
 it and I desire that
 a point at or near
 Fot t Kearny should be
 mentioned which makes just about
 the proper point of junc
 tion as between St Louis
 and Chicago I suppose the
 Senator from California has no
 objection to Mr GWIN Not
 at nil Mr DOOLITTLE Then
 1 move in the ninth
 line after the word river
 to insert the words at
 or near Fort Kearny so
 that it will read VVith
 two converging lines bearintr westward
 and unit inn within two
 hundred miles of the Missouri
 river at or I lcar
 Fort Kearny Mr POLK There
 has been an amendment adopted
 there I ask the Secretary
 to read it as it
 was amended then Mr DOOLITTLE
 That was in regard to
 the branch at the mouth
 of thc Kansas river Mr
 POLK I should like to
 hear the whole section read
 as it now stands The
 Secretary read it as follows
 l hat to insure the
 safe certain qnd speedy transporta
 tion ot nnails troops nnd
 public stores i t onl
 the western border of what
 is called otu western States
 by railroad to wit startil
 lg froin two points one
 on the western border of
 the St atQ of Missouri
 at the mouth of thc
 Kansas river proceeding thence up
 the valley of said river
 to Ille viein ily of
 Fort Riley and the other
 on the western border of
 rowa with two convertril lilies
 bearin r westward ltnitill within
 two hundred miles of the
 Missouri river and thence proceeding
 by a single trunk line
 Mr DOOLITTLE My amendment is
 to in at or near
 Fort Kearny after Missouri The
 amendment was agread to Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 desire to offer
 another amendinent which is more
 important pcrhaps in its provisions
 and to which desire to
 call the attention of the
 Senate my purpose being if
 we enter on this railroad
 polic y that we have
 a rail road completed through
 i do not wish to
 put into the hands of
 whoever may get interested in
 this project tho power to
 commence the road and go
 on where the lands are
 good and it is easy
 to build the road receiving
 tl 0 bonds of the
 Gov ernment finish the railroad
 a certain distance and then
 when they come to a
 point where it requires an
 expenditure of money to a
 largc amount there let the
 road stop and throw it
 back on our hands I
 therefore offer this amendment after
 the x vords in the
 forty ninth line of the
 fourth section insert sand prouided
 That thirty per cent of
 the whole amount of bonds
 ot tbe United States to
 bc a lvanecd as aforesaid
 shall bc retained by the
 Secretary of the Treasury until
 said road shall be fully
 cmnplcted throughout the whole line
 as above provided I want
 thirty per cont to remain
 in the Treas ury to
 insure thac the work will
 cro through IMr LATHAM ask
 the Senator whether it is
 understood that these bonds are
 to be kept in the
 shape of guarantee and that
 in case of a re
 on the part of the
 first company as pro vided
 in the bill they are
 to be forfeited and can
 celcd by tlk Government because
 if the title to them
 is vested in the company
 as the work pro gresses
 it seems to me that
 the amendment really amounts to
 nothing at all Mr DOOLITTLE
 The object provis ion is
 that the bonds shall be
 retaiY ed by the Sec
 rctAey of thc Treasury and
 not delivered over to thése
 corporators until the road is
 fully completed th rough out
 Mr LATHAM Suppose the road
 is not com pleted wh4t
 then Mr DOOLITTLE Then they
 will notget the bonds Mr
 LATHAM Yot u amendment does
 not state that That is
 exactly what I wanted to
 cakl attention to Mr DOOLITTLE
 If it is objectionable in
 that respect I will make
 it certain Mr LATHAM I
 suggest the addition of the
 words that in case of
 failure the bonds retained shall
 be ca by the Government
 Mr DOOLITTLE will insert at
 the end and in casc
 the road is not completcd
 the bonds so retained in
 the halids of the Secretary
 of the Treasury shall become
 forfeited to the United Sta
 tes Mr LA THAM That
 will make it complete The
 amendment was agreed to Mr
 II ALE I move that
 the consideration of this bill
 bc postponed until to morrow
 and that the Senate go

 is competent to move to

 the business regularly in order
 to be the consideration of
 the bill H R No
 714 to establish certain post
 routes with the amendments of
 the Senate thereto the pending
 amendment being the consideration of
 the seven teenth amendment of
 the Senate as follows SEC
 18 and U further enacted
 That the act or 3d
 March 18 55 entitled An
 act further to atnend the
 act en titled An act
 to reduce aud rnodify the
 rates of postage in the
 United States and för other
 purposes passed March 3 1851
 be and he same is
 hereby so modified as to
 re quire the ten cent
 rate postage to be prepaid
 on letters conveyed in the
 inail froju any point in
 the United States east of
 the Rocky Mountains to any
 St ate or Territory on
 the Pacific and fro n
 any State or I erritory
 on the Paeitie to any
 point in the United States
 east of the Rocky N
 lount ains And all drop
 letters shali be prepaid by
 postage stamps Mr COLFAX This
 amendment simply pro vides that
 the California letters or letters
 for the Pacific coast whether
 carried by the Isthmus route
 or whether earricd overland shall
 pay a uniform rate of
 tcn cents postage Upon this
 sub ject the Postmaster General
 says Under the act of
 1 35 the dtnnestic rate
 of postage för letters is
 three cents under three thousand
 miles and ten cents when
 the distance exceeds thousand nites
 I lje intention of this
 iiinitation was to secure tllC
 higher rate upon all letters
 transmitted to and frmn the
 Pacific States But since the
 establislnnent of the overland mail
 the dis tance from thc
 valley of the Mississippi to
 California heino less than three
 thousand miles Inucb of this
 correspond ence pays only the
 lower rate of three cents
 and ill order to maintain
 tbe original purpose of the
 law it is recotn mended
 that said act be so
 modified as to require the
 ten cent rate to be
 prepaid an all letters conveyed
 in the mail from any
 point ill rhe Uuitcd States
 east of the Rocky Mountains
 to any State or Territory
 on the Pacific and vice
 versa view of the expensive
 character ofthe mail From service
 to the Pacitie this rate
 is sufficiently low 1848 to
 1851 it was totty cents

 said yesterday this amendment meets
 the concurrence of the Post
 Office Department The amendment was
 concurred in Eighteenth amcndment SEC

 of the Senate by striking
 it Out and II inserting
 as a substitute the following
 Ollid be it further enacted
 I hat the Postrnastcr SEC

 further That the contractor shall
 not be required in addition
 to the letter mail to

 thirty five day schedule above
 provided for Mr COLFAX This
 is to provide for a
 daily central overland mail Mr
 W ASHBURNE of Illinois I
 wish to know whether it
 is now in order to
 move an amendment to the
 amendment of the gentleman from
 Ind iana The SPEAKER An
 amendment to the amend ment
 would be in order in
 the opinion of the Mr
 COLFAX 1 1 am entitled
 to the floor and I
 10 not yield it at
 this time I do not
 de Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 sire to take the floor
 from the gentleman from ln
 diana I merely inquired as
 questi01 i of order whether
 an amendment could be received
 Mr COLFAX I do not
 propose to take up the
 time of the House with
 any extended remarks This amendment
 brings before the House again
 the question of a daily
 overland mail upon which I
 presume every member has made
 up his mind and is
 ready to vote For many
 years the people who live
 on the Pacific coast have
 been waiting and have been
 hoping for a daily communication
 by mail with the States
 on the Atlantic coast It
 is well known that our
 mails to the Pacific are
 now carried through the territory
 of a Oreign Government exposed
 to the dangers of two
 oceans the Atlantic on this
 side and the Pacificon the
 other and to the dan
 cers of the transit through
 Central America where the Government
 has no power to protect
 the mails if they should
 be attacked I know it
 is to be met and
 I regret that it is
 to be met by my
 friend on my right Mr
 SHERMAN by an objection as
 to its expense But I
 will say in ant ipation
 of his argrt unent that
 the Post Office Cormnitt ee
 have endeavored to make the
 establishment of a daily overland
 mail on as cheapa basis
 as possible The I propositions
 which were before the House
 and before the Senate at
 the last session for estab
 lishing a daily overland mail
 contemplated an expenditure of something
 like two million dollars per
 annum while in this amendment
 it is lim Ited to
 800 000 By the Senate
 proposition the overland mail is
 to run from St Louis
 to San Fran Cisco and
 is not limited as to
 its maximum cost The Committee
 on the Post OMce and
 Post Roads desiring to compromise
 have cut off on this
 side the portion between St
 Louis and the Missouri frontier
 as we have railroads completed
 to the western frontier of
 that State while others are
 in procress of construction and
 on the Pacific side we
 have daily mail service as
 far cast as Pla cerville
 just on the other side
 of Sierra Nevada and a
 railroad from Sacramento completed nearly
 up to that town and
 therefore we have cut off
 that portion for the purpose
 of limiting and saving expense
 thereby saving at least 200
 000 addi tional cost pcr
 year We also provide in
 this that Salt Lake City
 in Utah and Denver City
 the headquarters of the emigration
 to the Pike s Peak
 recrion shall be supplied with
 a semi weekly mail by
 thesc contractors without extra expense
 It may be stated and
 indeed has been urged that
 it is impossible on account
 of their weight to carry
 the mails overland to California
 Now sir the mails have
 been weighed not only during
 the last session of Congress
 but during the pres ent
 session by the postmaster at
 New York city I can
 state to the House exactly
 what is the weight of
 California mails carried by the
 way of the Isthmils It
 amounts to I about fifty
 thousand pounds per month or
 six pounds per year divided
 into about t iö ithdu
 l sand pounds of letters
 thirty thousand poündsof papers fifteen
 thousand pounds ofnagazinesand other periodicals
 and books as as documents
 and three thousand such as
 stamps poet offce blanks envelopes
 ec The amendment requires that
 the contract02is shall carry through
 ohe thousand pounds everyday on
 the fast schedule of twenty
 days service r his will
 take through the entire letter
 and newspaper mail or very
 nearly the entire newspaper mail
 and I am free to
 say that I will vote
 for no daily overland mail
 to the Pacific that will
 not provide for carrying the
 newspaper rndil to the extent
 of one thousand pounds per
 day on the fast schede
 ule time of twenty days
 It the mail that takes
 to the new homes of
 the emigrants full news from
 the firesides wherrce they came
 As Qagazines periodicals and public
 docu mcnts do not contain
 the news of the day
 like the daily papers they
 are not required to be
 trans mitted with the same
 rapidity it provided that the
 contractors may take them through
 in the slower schedule time
 of thirty five days It
 fur ther providcs that they
 shall be allowed the priv
 ilege at their own expense
 of carrying that mail of
 magazines periodicals and public documents
 by water at leasesemi monthly
 from New York city to
 San Francisco The total cost
 of this overland service under
 this amendment will be 800
 000 We say nothing about
 the Butterfield contract running around
 by the way of El
 Paso That is a con
 yressiooal con It is a
 wasteful and ex tract hmited
 to letters travagant contract which
 the Attorney General has decided
 we cannot impair during _the
 term for which it was
 made Nor sir can we
 compel them to carry the
 newspaper mail or any portion
 of it They have the
 contract and they have the
 power to hold us to
 its provisions while it remains
 unexpired Mr Speaker in anticipation
 of the ar9itnent in opposition
 to the establishment of a
 daily over land mail as
 a matter of expense I
 wish to say to those
 who design opposing the proposition
 on that ground that they
 Vill find tbe increased amount
 of expense is comparatively a
 mere bagatelle The cheapest cost
 of the postal service by
 steamer and through a foreign
 country and which is only
 tri monthly instead of daily
 is 350 000 per year
 The cost of tho semi
 monthly mail from San Fran
 cisco to Placerville and across
 the central route which has
 been increased by order of
 the Depart ment for mails
 to Fort Kearny on this
 side and to Washoe and
 Carson Valley on the other
 is 208 000 per year
 and as the weekly service
 to the Pike s Peak
 region now costing per year
 must be eventually still further
 increased to semi weekly making
 nearly forty thousand dollars per
 year then you have 600
 000 paid out exclu Sive
 of Butterfield per year for
 the service we have now
 to California and Pike s
 Peak when wp have only
 a tri monthly service around
 by the Isthmus exposed to
 all the dangers of going
 through a foreign country exposed
 to dangers of war in
 comparison with 800 000 for
 a daily service each way
 across the center of the
 conti nent thirty times a
 month instead of three and
 five days quicker There is
 still another reason We are
 receiv ing 50 000 000
 year in specie from California
 It comes now by the
 way of the isthmus 1
 need not say if we
 should bb involved in war
 with a forcicrn country that
 that specie and the mails
 could not be safely carried
 by the way of the
 Isth The Government of the
 United States would be compelled
 to do what the Government
 of Great Britam does now
 in Australia where it furnishes
 a military escort for the
 gold which comes down from
 the mountains some five or
 six hundred miles to Melbourne
 on the coast for shipment
 We would need to have
 this gold of the country
 The country could not do
 without It has already saved
 us from one ruinous it
 revulsion and mitigated the evils
 of another We would have
 to protect its transit across
 the cen ter of the
 continent if we were in
 war with a for eign
 nation by a military escort
 If we establish a daily
 overland mail to California it
 will follow that the contractors
 will build stations all the
 way through for their stock
 and for the drivers and
 others in their employ as
 well as for the protec
 548 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 24 tion of the mail
 itself against any atte npt
 that may be made by
 savages or robbers for its
 cap ture You will bv
 this peaceful proposition es tablish
 a cordon of posts across
 the continent without one cent
 of expense added to your
 mili tary appropriations And if
 unfortunately and unhappily the country
 should be inv ol ved
 in war this treasure would
 be compelled to come across
 the centcr of the continent
 and for that purpose we
 will have thcse stations already
 prepared to our hands We
 will have daily transit across
 the continent and these posts
 provided in advance by which
 in a few days we
 could provide pro tectlon for
 the safety of this treasure
 Mr Speaker the people of
 California and the people of
 the Pacific coast have waited
 for this beneficent proposition long
 They have waited hopefully I
 grant that the Treasury is
 in a straitened condition but
 if you wish to bind
 the Pacific States more closely
 to the Union and the
 Atlantic States to make them
 faithful the Union loving members
 of this Confederacy there is
 nothing you can do that
 will incite and increase their
 patriotism mope than to give
 them what they have a
 right to demand a daily
 con nection with the States
 on the Atlantic coast from
 which they are so widely
 separated It will be more
 potential than any bands of
 either iron or WASHBURNE of
 Illinois I have an amendment
 which i move to come
 in after the amendment of
 the Committee on the Post
 Offce and Post Roads Mr
 COLFAX Let me say before
 the gen tieman from Illinois
 introduces his amendment that I
 am authorized by the Committee
 on the Post OMc c
 and Post Roads to accept
 as a modi fication OF
 the amendment of the committee
 an amendment to be ofhn
 ed by the gentleman from
 Texas Mr HAMILTON increasing the
 service upon the southern route
 at a cost 80 000
 so as to give a
 semi weekly service through that
 State from to New Orleans
 provided of course the States
 of Louisiana and Texas re
 main in the Union as
 I sincerely trust they may
 Can the gentleman answer whether
 they will Mr HAMILTON The
 gentleman would seem to require
 me to declare here what
 would involve a heavy responsibility
 upon me but in unswer
 to his question I can
 only say a s one
 of the citizens of Texas
 and one of her Representa
 tives upon this floor that
 I hope she is not
 going I believe to withdraw
 herself from the Union since
 Congress has disposition to treat
 her fairly as member of
 this Confederacy we have gone
 far toward keeping her in
 the Union and I will
 take great pleasure when I
 return to my peo plc
 in saying that so long
 as Texas is treated in
 tl rc Inanncr she has
 been by this Congress il
 Will bc much to her
 advantage to remain where she
 I trust she will If
 she should withdraw from the
 Union I take it she
 could get no advant age
 under the amendment I atn
 about to offer even if
 there were no proviso attached
 to it For one I
 declare if l exas withdraws
 from the Union she has
 no right to have rnaii
 facilities at the ex pense
 of the General Government Mr
 COLFAX I want if shc
 secedes that the Postmaster General
 shall havc the same right
 to strike down that service
 thal he has exercised with
 regard to the service near
 Pensacola The Clerk read Mr
 HAMILTON S amendment as ti
 llows That the Postmaster General
 hereby directed to extend the
 existing rnail contract on route
 No 8076 in the State
 or I exas so that
 it will expire with connectinrv
 route No I 2578 known
 as tbc Butterfield route provided
 it can be done at
 an additional expense not exeeedint
 per annunr and provide for
 a semi weekly connection with
 the city of New Orleans
 Mr COLFAX I accept that
 as a modification of the
 pending amendment adding to it
 these words But the Postmaster
 General shall have the same
 author itv over this as
 over all other routes Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois I offer
 the following amendment And the
 Postmaster General is hereby directed
 to reöx the causes far
 discontinuance or curtailment of the
 postal service on inland routes
 since the 4th day of
 March 1859 and to restore
 all sucl parts Gf said
 service as cali be restored
 with a due regard 10
 the publie interest and the
 circumstances of each case whether
 such discontinuance c r ctl
 tanmentsvas upon contract then in
 toree or were takiDÉ on
 the nM1k ing Of new
 contracts Provided hat lhe reszorat
 icn or increased seryice hereby
 contemplated sbåll be With the
 assent of the contractor in
 each case or in pursuanee
 of his contract Mr Speaker
 thatamendment brmgs up to some
 extent the question which was
 before Congress at the last
 session in reference to the
 reéstablish ment of the mail
 service which had been discon
 tiöued by the Postmaster General
 It will be recol lected
 that this House by many
 votes nearly two thirds passed
 an amendment to one of
 the appropriation bills directing the
 reestablishment of the mail service
 which had been discontinued IThe
 Senate persistently rcfused to concur
 in that amendment and upon
 the Iasi day of the
 session for the purpose of
 preventing the bill being lost
 the Ilouse finally receded Now
 sir the amend mcnt which
 I have sent to the
 Clerk s desk and which
 has been read does not
 propose n per emptory reéstablishmcnt
 of the mail service but
 in viex v of the
 action of the Post Offce
 Depart ment it directs the
 Postmaster General to reopen all
 of the cases and in
 his discretion to reestab 1ish
 the postal service where the
 public interest requires it That
 is the whole extent of
 this amendment and I do
 not believe it will be
 objected to by a single
 member of this House Mr
 BURCH 1 do not believe
 ment of the gcnt leman
 from Illinois is in order
 to this post route bill
 which m ve have now
 under con sideration and inasmuch
 as I cannot sec why
 the gentleman should desire to
 load down that section of
 this bill which refers to
 the overland mail route to
 which his amendment is offered
 I raise the point of
 order that the amendinent is
 not germane and also that
 it is new legislation Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois It isentirely
 germane to this post route
 bill for that is the
 sub ject we are legislating
 about Mr CRAIG of Missouri
 Allow me to ask the
 gentleman from Illinois whether the
 existing law does not confer
 upon the Postmaster General that
 authority Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 No sir I will say
 to thc gentleman Mr BURCH
 that i have no objection
 to his umendment per se
 but object to its being
 attached to this bill Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois Would the
 gentleman frorn California raise a
 point of order for the
 purpose of preventino the Postmaster
 General from reéstftblishing tl ese
 routes Mr BURCH Asl said
 before i have no 0b
 jeclion to the passage of
 the gentleman s amend ment
 in the proper place On
 frequent occasions last x vinter
 I voted for amendments similar
 to this and also as
 a member on the Committee
 on I coöperated with the
 Post Office and Post Roads
 them iii all efforts to
 restore and reéstabligh the mail
 service in all sections of
 the United States but I
 object to t now because
 I do not believe that
 we should load down the
 provision for an overland nvail
 route to California with this
 prop osition I differ with
 Mr WASHBURNE oflllinois the gentleman
 from California for instead of
 load ing down the overland
 mail I think this a
 mend will do Inorc than
 anything else to help it
 along Mr BURNETT Allow me
 to ask the gen I
 desire to know tleman from
 Illinois a question whether the
 Postmaster General has not now
 discretion necessary to enable him
 to restore any of the
 mail service which in his
 judgment he thinks ought to
 be restored this matter until
 I hear objection made to
 it but if objection shall
 be made I will take
 occasion to answer it Mr
 COLFAX I coöperated with my
 friend from Illinois during the
 last session as he very
 well knows for amendments of
 this character but I must
 say to him that I
 cannot continue that contest during
 this scssion We found that
 the Senate vere hostile to
 our proposition and that it
 almost resulted in the defeat
 of the Post Offce appropriation
 bill Upon the bill now
 under con sideration we have
 an accumulation of post routes
 for the last three years
 This post route bill has
 been killed year after year
 by amendments placed upon it
 once by a proposition for
 the increase of postage being
 placed upon it and on
 another oc casion for want
 of time Now I am
 desirous that all the members
 of this House who have
 post routes in their interior
 reffions and who desire where
 settlements have gone to have
 the mails follow them should
 have this bill pass The
 Sen ate have put on
 a number of amendments and
 we havc concurred in them
 in substance The only material
 tunendrnent to this bill is
 that which re lates to
 the overland mail which the
 Senate pre sented in one
 x vay and which the
 Post Offce Committee of this
 House have this morning in
 a modified förm presented to
 the House I fear that
 it we put into this
 bilk the amendment of the
 gentleman from Illinois it will
 tend to break down this
 bill in the Senate Further
 than that I will say
 to the gentleman that what
 he proposes now can be
 done by the I understood
 him and I Postmnstcr General
 have understood other gentlemen to
 take the cn ound that
 the Postmaster General has once
 taken up these cases and
 tl iat his successor cannot
 reéxamine them I grant that
 that is true in some
 respqc as in cases of
 claims under contracts extra ay
 settlement of postmasters accounts c
 but It is not true
 in regard to the enlargement
 or curtailment of the mail
 service upon any exist ing
 post routes of the country
 That is within the power
 of the present Postmaster General
 and it will be within
 the power of his successor
 think we ought to have
 confidence that the incom ing
 Administration will do what justice
 requires and that the wants
 of the people will be
 attend I Mr PHELPS lhave
 merely a word to say
 We find ourselves oftentimes involved
 in diff culty because of
 amendments which are added I
 to our bills by the
 Senate which ought not to
 be I added I am
 of opinion that policy requires
 that upon a bill establishing
 post routes through the country
 no other or further legislation
 should be placed upon it
 that it should stand very
 much like appropriation bills In
 those bills we propose to
 appropriate so much money as
 iS required by ex istlng
 laws So in bills establishing
 post roads we purpose to
 establish by law such post
 roads as we believe are
 now necessary in addition to
 those already established But the
 misfortune is that upon this
 bill you have provisions relating
 to the postal system for
 providing for the rate of
 speed at which the service
 shall be performed the rates
 of postage the mode of
 conveyance and you have other
 provisions which are entirely incon
 gruous to the subject matter
 of the bill That in
 volves us in diffculties and
 oftentimes it has led to
 the defeat of the post
 route bill These are reasons
 which present themselves to Mr
 WASHBURN E of Illinois That
 is the me and which
 dispose me to oppose much
 of the very question propounded
 by the gentleman from legislation
 in this bill while I
 mtgllt feel disposed Missouri and
 which I desn e to
 answer The to sustain the
 same measures were they independ
 Postlnust er General has made
 his decisions upon ently presented
 to me In a bill
 rclatmcr to post all of
 these cases They are matters
 upon which ages and to
 the regulation of the Post
 Office and according Department exclusively
 I mioht have been dis
 the Department has already acted
 to the rules which have
 always governed the De i
 i posed to agree to
 them The proposition sub partment
 the qucstion is now res
 adjudicata and mitted by the
 gentleman from Illinois and which
 the present Postmaster General or
 any subse is now tho
 proposition immediately under discus sion
 was one considered during the
 last session quent one would
 say should you go to
 him and of Congress and
 because of the deföat of
 the Post ask him to
 restore this service that his
 predo cessor had already acted
 upon the matter and Offce
 appropriation bill the Postmaster General
 refused to restore the routes
 and he must be governed
 by that action of his
 predecessor And this is one
 of the reasons why desire
 that this discretion shall be
 vested in thc Postmaster General
 in order that he may
 take up all these cases
 anew examine them and wherever
 he be lieves the public
 interest required that additional mail
 service should be put on
 or restored that he may
 have the power to do
 it 1 will not consume
 the time of the House
 upon was compelled to reduce
 the service in nrany por
 tions of the country Still
 as he possessed the pov
 er to restore it whenever
 there was money p3ae ed
 at his disposal without our
 authorizing him to do so
 I was unwilling then as
 I am now by a
 mandatory act t o direct
 him to restore the service
 where he does not consider
 it his duty to do
 so Mr WASHBURNE 0f1ilinois What
 does the gentleman mean by
 mandatory act Mr PHELPS If
 I understand the amendment 1861
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE of the gentleman
 from Illinois it directs the
 Post the 1st of next
 July of 21 677i524 to
 suppiy Mr GROW Mr master
 General to restore the service
 wherever he deficiencies In addition
 to that you have already
 Government to protect thé pioneers
 who settle I do not
 know the exact passed a
 deficiency bill of nearly two
 million the wilderness even under
 the hom eSt eadÉ Itii9
 had discontinued it which makes
 it 23 000 000 The
 Committee of as much itsdutyto
 guarrd them against the langua
 e of the amendment Mr
 V ASHBURN E of Illinois
 The gen Ways and Means
 will have within a week
 to and the wild beast
 as it is to protect
 the be afrth It merely
 directs him to ex reporta
 bill to borrow 23 000
 000 unless the stone of
 the gentleman from TennesSee s
 tleman is mistaken tariff bill
 shall pass which itself au
 thorizes a loan amine those
 cases and in cases where
 the public interest requires it
 he is permitted to restore
 the Shall we under such
 circumstances provide for service Mr
 PHELPS 1 have sated the
 spirit of the It is
 the duty of the Postmaster
 amendment General without uny such
 provision to examine and see
 whether an Increased mall service
 should be performed in any
 section of the country and
 if he believes that the
 mail service of any of
 the Union should be increased
 it is his du to
 increase it provided he has
 the means at hlS disposal
 to pay for that service
 I say then that the
 provision of lhe amendment submitted
 by the gentleman from Illinois
 is in its nature mand
 atory It is mandatory it
 requires him to restore the
 mail service which he has
 discontinued and it can receive
 no other construction if it
 shall be come a law
 We have Mr Speaker otheramendments
 upon I have not had
 time to examine them this
 bill nor shall I express
 any opinion in relation to
 them except this that it
 becomes the duty of the
 rnem bers of this House
 and of the other branch
 of Congress to look well
 to the expenditures they are
 about to authorize You must
 first inquire as to your
 means Are you willing to
 increase the mail service of
 the country beyond its present
 limits when you have to
 go Into the market arid
 borrow money at ten and
 twelve per cent per annum
 Already the expense of the
 mail service of the United
 States exceeds by some four
 or five million dollars the
 revenue derived from that branch
 of the public service When
 we adhered to the old
 rule that the expenditures of
 the De partmentshould not exceed
 the receipts the postal servicc
 of the country was gradaaåly
 extended according to the wants
 and necessities of the com
 munity I cannot sanction the
 provisions con tained in these
 amendments and before the bilt
 is disposed Ofs I may
 perhaps present my views in
 regard to some of them
 Mr SHERMAN Mr Speaker regret
 very much to be compelled
 to oppose the amendment proposed
 by the gentlemgn from Indiana
 but a sense of duty
 compels me to do so
 I am as much in
 favor of postal service to
 California and daily mail routes
 of railroads and telegraph s
 as any man living And
 yet it is utterly idle
 it is crim inal for
 us now to be considering
 sullieets of this character when
 we are borrowin r Inoney
 at the rate of twelve
 per cent We have to
 provide 23 000 000 for
 deficiencies by the 1st of
 July We have to pass
 before this session closes loun
 bills to the amount of
 near fifty million dollars It
 seems to me to be
 idle and to talk about
 increasing thc postal scrvice of
 the country under such circumstances
 Now I would be willing
 to extend to Califor nia
 all t he service that
 is needed She now has
 tri monthly service by the
 Ist hmus of Panama and
 semi we ekly on the
 southern and northern routes Mr
 BURCH The gentleman will find
 that the ocean service is
 to be discontinued Mr SHERMAN
 1 do not desire to
 be inter ru ted Ir
 COLFAX The gentleman ought to
 let me correct him about
 a question of fact There
 is no semi weekl service
 on the central route Mr
 SHERMXN If the gentleman had
 lis tened to me he
 would have found that I
 was not mistaken There is
 tri monthly service by the
 Panama route there is weekly
 service on the northern route
 and weekly service on the
 south ern route making semi
 weekly service overland and we
 have other routes Now it
 seems to me that our
 fellow citizens in California can
 get along a little while
 longer in the strait in
 which we are involved and
 that we should not now
 embark in increasing the expenditures
 of the Government Let gentlemen
 remember once for all that
 for expenditures after the 1st
 of July we have to
 pro vide for 30 000
 000 more even if all
 the political troubles which now
 overhang us should pass away
 in peace And sir if
 war should come we do
 not know bow much more
 we should require I trust
 then that my friends will
 not press these propositions to
 increuse the expenditures I will
 with Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 draw my amendment to the
 amendment of the entleman from
 Indiana I do not wish
 to link its fate with
 the fate of that amendment
 but will offer it to
 some other part of the
 bill Mr GROW Proposing to
 vote for this ovct land
 route I desire to say
 a word or two in
 ex 1 deprecate the practice
 planation of my vote which
 has grown up within the
 last two or three years
 of attachinrr legislation of all
 sorts to the general post
 route biif by the Senate
 thus com peliing us to
 legislate upon bill that no
 one has any substantial objection
 to in the first instance
 on all kinds of controverted
 questions WI file I am
 opposed to that system we
 are compelled now to act
 these anlemlments It costs the
 Governmcnt at present as under
 stand it aside from the
 Butterfield route about six hundred
 thousand doi ars for mail
 service to r 1 he
 Butlerficid route is fixed thc
 Pacific coast by law and
 need not cntet into the
 consideration of this question one
 way or the other Six
 hun dred thousand dollars are
 spent now nearly one half
 on the sea service and
 the other half on the
 overland route Mr Speaker I
 am opposed to spending one
 cent of moriey water communication
 betwcén the Atlantic and Pacific
 coasts so long as we
 have a vast interior continent
 to develop When we send
 mail facilities throucrll that wilderness
 we are opening up emigrant
 lines of travel and pro
 viding thetn with better protection
 than forts and armics can
 cive the settlers Then why
 send ships over two oceans
 to carry the mails to
 the people who inhabit the
 Pacific coast when by carrying
 the mails overland you furnish
 facilities for ihc development of
 the interior and the pro
 teclion of emigrants and of
 t he hardy pioneers who
 are day by day fii
 inx up our vast wilder
 nesses Two hundred lhousand dollars
 a year additional is required
 to furnish a daily mail
 ser vice to the Pacific
 overland and thus secure these
 desirable ends Why should vvre
 hesitate to give for a
 necessary purpose when benefits Is
 it not the of t
 l is kind arc to
 rcsalt from it duty of
 the Government to furnish the
 same fa c i ities
 to an equal numbcr of
 people with cqual business with
 equal attachment to the country
 wherever their homes may be
 Because a great wilderness intervenes
 between the settlements on the
 Atlantic and the half million
 people on the Pacific slope
 a wilderness inhabited only by
 sav agcs and wild beasts
 is not the obligation of
 the Government to those people
 the same as to any
 other half million of our
 people living on the At
 lantic coast or the Gulf
 of Mexico well then Mr
 Speaker 200 000 additional expenditure
 will give to the Pacific
 slope with its half million
 people paying annually not less
 than of revenue to the
 Government from customs alone daily
 mail filcilities such as I
 we furnish the people elsewhere
 And while doing that what
 else shall we accomplish By
 placing mail stations along the
 emigrant routes between the Atlantic
 and the Pacific you will
 guard the hardy pioneers seeking
 new homes better than it
 could be done in anv
 other way for a mail
 sta new adventures which will
 cost not less than I
 tion established and guai led
 by private enter 300 000
 a year additional Until yesterday
 there l prise is worth
 more as a shield and
 protection were lying on the
 desk of the Secretary of
 the to settlements and to
 emigrants than fortifications Treasury between
 two and three million dollars
 of and soldiers drafts which
 had not been paid because
 there was Mr MAYNARD I
 would ask the gentleman no
 money in the Treasury 10
 pay them and which whether
 it would not be belter
 to postpone the are only
 now bein r paid by
 selling Treasury notes abolition of
 this water communication with Caii
 at a rate of interest
 of nine per cent He

 or threc years until we

 operations of the homestead bill

 which has been printed showing
 that he will want a

 what it may cost the
 Governments icanx citizen and his

 or in one of thé

 Mr HINDMAN Does the gentleman
 in speaking of protection by
 the Govei ntnent pro pose
 to extend it to property
 as wellas persons Mr GROW
 1 do certainly 1 know
 no dig Linetion betsveen them
 But l suppose the gen
 tleman meant to bi ing
 the nigger into controversy There
 is hardly any subject that
 comes up here in which
 the nigger does not appear
 and certain men aæ now
 trying to break up thp
 Union because they care more
 for the rights of property
 as they call it thanthey
 do for the rights of
 man 1 want the Government
 to protect thé rights of
 men the hearthstones arid firesides
 of those who have gone
 forth to people the wilderness
 and build up the great
 empires which to day span
 the continent abd has made
 this country the wonder and
 admiratiOn offthe world do not
 see why this Governmen t
 is not as much bound
 to give tothe people on
 the Pacific the same benefits
 and facilities as it gives
 to an cqual number of
 people living in the old
 portions ot the country Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri I ask
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania whether
 the establishment of these mail
 stati0i 1s ail the way
 across the conti nent at
 every fifteen miles will not
 lessen our actual annual Indian
 expenses enough to make it
 a matter of economy Mr
 GROW I am afraid the
 gentleman from Missouri has not
 listened to my remarks A1nless
 indeed hc wished me to
 repeat what I have said
 thinking perhaps that that was
 on that point the only
 thing I have said of
 any consequenCe 4 So I
 said Mr Speaker that these
 sta I repeat it tions
 along t he mail routes
 were worth more to protect
 the emicrant lines Of travel
 tl nan forts a nd
 armies the protection of which
 the Government is bound to
 give and docs give For
 ten years past i have
 seen Army appropriation bills passed
 by this House appropriating from
 ten to fifteen million dollars
 part of which was to
 build forts the frontiers and
 nobody objected to the amount
 for Arnny expenses And appeals
 have been made for years
 past to increase the Army
 For what To protect the
 emigrat lines of i ravel
 And yet one recrirnent costs
 the Government more money than
 the entire overland mail service
 wouid and when you have
 raised that regiment it ig
 worth but little in comparison
 with the mail roüte for
 the protection of emigrants and
 pioneers I wan ted to
 state the point of my
 argument over again for the
 benefit of the gentleman from
 Missouri and because I think
 that he appreciates It costs
 now that portion of my
 statement 600 000 to send
 the mails to California lcaving
 out the Butterfield route altogether
 200 000 more will give
 a daily overland mail to
 the Pacific coast carrying all
 the mail matter in less
 time than it is carried
 now by water The only
 ques tion is shall we
 appropriate 200 000 a year
 morc for the purpose of
 furnishing these daily mail communication
 thus accomplishing three things which
 it is the duty of
 the Government to furnish to
 the people first to give
 mail facilities alike to an
 equal number of people of
 equal business second to defend
 the settlements in the wilder
 ness by planting all through
 it those mail stations as
 nuclei of defénse and third
 togive protection to the emigrant
 on his lines of emigration
 against the savages The Government
 is bound in good faith
 to the people everywhere to
 protect their lives and homes
 whether on the spot where
 they are born or in
 their new hömesän the western
 wilderness Mr MOORE of Kentucky
 I move to amend by
 striking out of the proviso
 at line seventeen the words
 at least semi weekly and
 inserting in lieu thcreof the
 words daily so that it
 Will Provided Ki hat the
 contractor sh dl supply Denver
 City and Great Salt Lake
 City daily without extra Charge
 I have no speech to
 make by way of enforeiffg
 550 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 24 my amendment and I
 only ask permission to apply
 to it the speech made
 by the gentieman from Pennsylvania
 Mr Gnow It applies as
 much to Denver City and
 Salt Lake City as it
 does to California Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania As 1 intend
 to vote against this amendment
 just as my col league
 Mr GROW intends to vote
 for it I desire to
 say a word or two
 about it I admire the
 elo quence which my colleague
 always displays in grouping together
 thesc glittering generalities about the
 hardy pioneer when it comes
 to a ques tion of
 barren lands Does my colleague
 mean to say that when
 this overland mail route isestab
 lished the post boys at
 the stations are to fight
 the battles of the nation
 against the savage and to
 protect the emigrant Why sir
 wherever you have established a
 post route you have so
 far been obliged to send
 soldicrs to protect them Wherever
 through those barren wilds you
 send your mails you have
 to send your troops to
 guard them The very fact
 of cstablishin2 stations for a
 daily mail line will increase
 the necessity of sending soldiers
 there to guard them also
 Cali fornia and Oregon are
 now pretty well provided with
 postal facilities considering their distance
 and the newness of the
 country both overland and by
 sea I do not know
 what gentlemen mean by speaking
 of the Butterfield route as
 if that were ignored altogether
 I suppose itgoes somewhere I
 know we pay largely for
 it And I think it
 better to wait till that
 service is done away with
 before we begin to incur
 any more expense in this
 way I agree with the
 chairman of the Committée of
 Ways ttnd Means that to
 be now increasing the expenditures
 of the Government 200 000
 in one place 300 000
 in another and an indefinite
 sum to establish postal routes
 with an army to guard
 them is madness on the
 part of those who look
 to retrenchment and reform and
 who look to carrying orHhe
 administration with the money of
 the Government för the next
 year If our debt now
 vere all collected cer tificates
 and all I doubt not
 Lhat it would amount to
 There are 63 000 000
 now regis tered We arc
 asked for 20 000 000
 more imme diately Before next
 July if we provide properly
 foc the grave exigencies of
 the country we shall be
 in debt to the amount
 of 150 000 000 And
 yet we see on the
 part of members on this
 side of the House who
 are to have the responsibility
 even more recklessness in extravagance
 than is seen on t
 he other side where members
 arc I must say more
 economical if left to themselves
 and if the Executive were
 not to interfere wit h
 them Gentlemen on this side
 and perhaps I ought to
 reproach myself among others sit
 here with indifference while is
 voted to r exas one
 day to establish a new
 army to be turned against
 ourselves the moment Texas chooses
 to find CALUSe to scccdc
 while for moonshinc privileges will
 come up in the House
 before long Hore fs 200
 000 niore and God knows
 how much more wc will
 vot e away I his
 Government is now overwhclmcd in
 debt and if you go
 on at the present rate
 you will not be able
 to carry on the Governmcnt
 for another year without bank
 ruptcy and protest I am
 amazed that tbc party which
 has the organization of this
 House and which is in
 some measure responsible to the
 country for the business of
 legislation should be still ut
 this particular crisis asking to
 increase expenses My colleague calls
 on us to give facil
 ities to our hardy pioneers
 Our pioneers are in dustrious
 and meritorious men and ought
 to have proper mail facilities
 They now have them If
 the country were in a
 condition to spend money rather
 for ornament than use rather
 to traverse a wilderness of
 two thousand miles than to
 sup ply mail facilities in
 the old parts of the
 country if you had the
 money to do that I
 should not have so much
 objection to thc gentleman squan
 dering it Yet gentlemen talk
 about accomplishing this object without
 regard to expense when the
 coun try is a beggar
 when you have not a
 dollar for your cornmon necessaries
 when you have not a
 farthing to pay the debts
 that you owe It looks
 to me more like a
 liberal expenditure with the view
 of a more inevitable bankruptcy
 of the Gov ernment than
 anything else But 1 do
 hope that the suggestions of
 the chairman of the Committee
 of Ways and Means who
 has looked seriously into and
 is well informed upon the
 condition of the finances of
 the country I say f
 hope the sug gestions of
 the gentleman from Ohio will
 be taken mto consideration when
 a further enlargement of the
 expenses of the Government is
 to be made Mr QUARLES
 1 will inquire whether the
 morning hour has expired The
 SPEAKER It has not Mr
 CURTIS When I first came
 to Congress four winters ago
 I found that the overland
 mail and the mails via
 Panama to California were being
 carried on at an expenditure
 of some two million two
 hundred thousand dollars Since that
 time we have been constantly
 reducing the expenses of that
 service until the present time
 it has been cut down
 to an extent which including
 the Butterfield contract will amount
 in the aggre gale t
 o something less than two
 million dollars I am informed
 that it reaches only 1
 400 000 So that all
 this talk about increased drafts
 upon the Treasury cannot apply
 to this California mail service
 for as I have said
 we have been con stuntly
 reducing the expense of that
 service for the last three
 years This therefore cannot be
 included in the process by
 which the gentleman from Ohio
 says we are bringing the
 Government in debt But there
 is another point of view
 to which I wish to
 call attention The settlements along
 the line of this central
 route have been greatly in
 creased since I first came
 to Congress The gold mines
 of the Rocky Mount ains
 havc bccn discov ered and
 it is due to the
 people who arc there that
 mail facilities shall be furr
 ishcd to them The settlements
 have been extended up the
 Black river some two hundred
 miles and they receive their
 mails from this central route
 It also furnishes mail facilities
 to thc settlers at the
 Washoe mines which have been
 discovered since first came to
 Congress so that there is
 a necessity for a daily
 overland tnail to Califorl liz
 l existinu now which did
 not exist formerly This then
 is a question between the
 Panama mail con tractors and
 the overland mail contractors It
 is a question whether ve
 shall build up the ocean
 line by Panan a or
 whether we shall build up
 a great overland route through
 the heart of our own
 country It is a strife
 between two great lines one
 a water line and the
 other a land line It
 is a strifö between capital
 and the pioneers of the
 West That is what the
 strife is It is a
 strife which commenced here last
 year and which is goinT
 on now Shall we decide
 it in favor of thc
 parties who will carry the
 mail through a foreign country
 or in favor of those
 who will carry it through
 the center of our country
 I am for building up
 the interior of our country
 I aun for the central
 route As shown by the
 gentleman from Pennsyl vania IMP
 GRow I this is a
 mere question whether we shall
 pay this money to Vanderbilt
 of New York or to
 the thousands of our citizens
 who will be benefited by
 its being carried by the
 overland route I have watchcd
 the progress of this California
 mail scr vice for years
 with interest and I assert
 that the change which is
 now proposed instead of increas
 ing the expenses of the
 Government will reducc thoso expenses
 The gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr
 STE speaks of this overland
 route being through a wilderness
 of two thousand miles which
 it will require the Army
 of the United Stat es
 to protect Why sir we
 have a mail service there
 already and it requires no
 arrny to protect it The
 people of the various posts
 are able to protect themselves
 Mr MAYNARD 1 desire enter
 a disclaimer to the remarks
 of the gentleman from I
 he remark of the gentleman
 whether so Iowa intended or
 not would bear the construction
 that those of us who
 have expressed an opposition to
 the discontinuance of the ocean
 mail service to California were
 in some way interested in
 secur ing from the Government
 certain benefits perqui sites or
 advantages to Commodore Vanderbilt I
 will not speak for the
 otheu gentlemcn who have expressed
 their opposition to that discontinuance
 It may be that this
 is the case with the
 venerable gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr
 STEVENS it may be that
 this was the motive of
 the gentleman froin Ohio the
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means Mr SHERMAN
 it may be that such
 was the fact with my
 friend from Missouri any contract
 for carrying the mail overland
 or by Panama Mr CURTIS
 I am glad the honorable
 gentle man from Tennessee has
 called my attention to the
 remark to which he refers
 if it will bear any
 such construction as he has
 given to it Cer tainly
 nothing was further from my
 purpose than to impute any
 such motives to the gentleman
 from Tennessee and I here
 enter the same disclaimer in
 respect to all the other
 gentlemen I merely desired to
 express my hope that this
 House wiil not continue a
 system which I believe to
 be wro g I prefer
 that our mails for the
 Pacific sh I be carried
 through our own territory DISTURBED
 STATE OF COUNTRY The SPEAKER
 The morning hour havin expired
 the Chair states that the
 report of the committee of
 thirty three comes up for
 consider ation as a special
 order upoY1 which the genLle
 man from North Carolina Mr
 WINSLOW is entitled to the
 floor Mr WINSLOW 1 have
 not sufficiently covered my voice
 to be able to address
 the House to day and
 I shall have to throw
 myself upon the indulgence of
 gentlemen to afford me an
 op portunity of addressing them
 at some subsequent period Mr
 RUST addressed the House an
 hour Hij remarks and other
 proceedings connected there with will
 be published in the Appendix
 Mr FERRY Mr Speaker 1
 recognize to day but two
 parties in thiscountry the party
 of law and order and
 the party of revolution the
 party which would preserve the
 Federal Govern ment and the
 party which would destroy Government
 the unionists and the disunionists
 The rapid growth of the
 latter organization w hich cmerging
 from the lurking places of
 conspiracy a little more than
 two months ago has in
 that short space of time
 become dominant in several of
 the States and has led
 thousands of citizens into open
 rebellion acrainst the Government re
 quires of us a careful
 scrutiny into the avowed reasons
 for so unnatural a revolt
 and an impar tial investigation
 of its origin of the
 objects of its leaders and
 of the results to which
 it tends On the other
 hand the absolute necessity which
 ex ists for the maintenance
 of social order demands of
 us that we ascertain and
 adopt the most eflÄ t
 ive methods for the preservation
 of the social fab ric
 The considera ti011 of the
 measures reported by the majority
 and minority of the committee
 neccssarily involves thc inquiries which
 I have just indica ted
 In tbe manifestoes published by
 tbe disunion ists for their
 own justification I find various
 cir cumstances assigned as furnishing
 sufficient rea sons for rebellion
 The first is that Abraham
 Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin have
 been elected President and Vice
 President of the United States
 Was there any violation of
 the Constitution any infringement of
 the law in the mode
 of accom plishing that result
 Nonc whatever The result then
 is not in itself suåcient
 cauSO fot disunion But it
 is said that Abraham Lincoln
 dislikes slavery and is of
 opinion that it will ultimately
 disappear from the Republic George
 Washing ton the first President
 of the United States held
 thc same views So did
 John Adams so did I
 homas Jeflérson so did James
 Madison so did James Monroe
 Clearly then this is not
 cause for disunion lb is
 urged however that Mr Lincoln
 thinks that slavery ought not
 to expand into free terri
 tory So did President Jefferson
 when he ap proved the
 act to enable the people
 of Ohio to form a
 State constitution with an express
 provision to prevent the expansion
 of slavery into the future
 State So did President Madison
 whén he ap proved the
 act to enable the people
 of Indiana to torm a
 Statc constitution with the same
 restric tion So did President
 Monroe when with his I
 approval the same conditions were
 imposed upon i the admission
 of the State of Illinois
 So did Pres I ident
 Jackson when be approved the
 act organ i izing the
 Tl erritory of Wisconsin including
 the present States of Wisconsin
 and Iowa with an express
 prohibition of the existence of
 slavery therein So did President
 Polk when he signed the
 act to establish the territorial
 government of Oregon with the
 same wise prohibition imposed Mr
 PHELPS They can speak for
 themselves upon the inhabitants and
 future States of that but
 for myself I desire to
 disclaim any interest in I
 erritpry How then can the
 opinions of Pres 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE I pectations were
 spent in ceaseless and successful
 ident Lincoln upon this subject
 justify a dissolu efforts to
 unite the slaveholding interest as
 a single tion of the
 Union combatant in the political
 arena Is was neces But
 we are told that the
 number of the free States
 is increasing more rapidly than
 that of the sary first
 of ail to defy the
 sentiment of the civilized world
 and to overturn ali the
 convic slave States that in
 process of time the former
 wilLcompose three fourths of all
 thc metnbet s of tions
 of thc people of the
 South in order to the
 Union and will then so
 amend the Constitu tion as
 to secure the abolition of
 slavery What if liberty is
 oulstripping slavery in the march
 of cmpirc Wii you feltm
 the indomitable ener gieg of
 freedom till it shall limp
 and halt along at the
 slow pace of bondage How
 can the fre c States
 acquire the apprehended preponderance When
 all our territory is organized
 into States when Kansas Nebraska
 Dacotah Washington Pike s Peak
 New Mexico Arizona Utah and
 the Indian reservation shall be
 members of the Union with
 constitutions such as Jefferson l
 vould approve there will be
 but twenty scvcn States acrainsb
 your fifteen and you are
 already author ized to add
 to yournumberfourmorefrom Texas Unless you
 extend our dominions foreign ac
 quisition it is impossible witli
 the States that will be
 formed out of our present
 territory to ac quire the
 three fourths requisite to amend
 the Con stitutionin this respect
 This apprehension ceases then to
 be a cause för rebellion
 We arc told howcver t
 hat the free States will
 nöt hesitate when they are
 strousr enough to vio late
 the Coustitution Such an ar
 ument is a simple insult
 it is tho bald pretense
 OF traitor seeking a cover
 for his treason If it
 provos any thing it demonstrates
 that no concession that can
 be niade will reach the
 root of the difficulty It
 is urged finally that the
 pcoplc of the north ern
 States have cnacte l laws
 which ave termed personal liberty
 bills and which interfere with
 the effective operation of the
 s atute for the ren
 dition of fugitives from service
 1 inquire into t hc
 fact and I discover that
 in order to prevent abuse
 of process under the rendition
 act which is so constructed
 as to be peculiarly liable
 to such abuse the Leqislatures
 of some of t he
 nort bern Stales have tlfi
 own guards around the freedom
 of their people but with
 only two or three possible
 ex ceptions without in any
 wise contravening tbc Constitution or
 the laws ofthe United States
 My own State is arraigned
 look at her statute and
 find an act l vhose
 purpose seems to be to
 prevent abuse of process and
 Lhe reduction of freemen to
 bondage and which in no
 dcgrcc impairs thc rights of
 claimants under the rendition law
 I ask if any case
 has occurred in any State
 where a claimant has lost
 the services of a fugitive
 through the intervention of process
 under a personal lib erty
 bill and I learn that
 not a single instance of
 the kind lias happened But
 it is added that northern
 ministers preach establish among them
 the dogma that slavery in
 Itself is right a moral
 social and political good He
 made tho effort and the
 result has been ac complished
 while the nations have stood
 aghast as they listened to
 this new gospel of bondage
 proclaimed from the very temples
 of liberty Fearful sacrifices have
 been made in the course
 It was a philo of
 this revolution of opinion sopl
 ical necessity that its success
 should over throw the liberties
 cf those who participated in
 it and in accordance with
 that necessity freedom of speech
 freedom of thc press and
 freedom of clections the very
 elcments of civil liberty were
 onc after tbc other given
 up It was desirable in
 the second place to Imbue
 thc southern mind with theories
 of government bv which treason
 might be made honorable and
 éebe lion cease to be
 a crime The mischievous heresy
 of secession was revived and
 after many years of denial
 and dis pute adopted as
 a fundamental axiom in south
 crn politics To cornbine the
 elements of political powcr in
 the slavehoidiny States was a
 more difficult task The genius
 pa riot ism und popularity
 of M Clay were the
 chief obstacles to be overcome
 They were overcome in the
 presidential election of 1844 nd
 the first act in the
 drama of disunion was acc
 0kü phished by the at
 i exalion of Ti exas
 under the immediate auspices of
 Mr Calhoun Additional strength was
 gained by the slavehold interest
 in t tme Generat Govcrnment
 and a vast territory acquired
 for the expected southern confederacy
 T hc war with Mexico
 for the ex tension of
 that territory to the Rio
 Grande and for still farther
 acquisitions to the westward was
 It accomplished both purposes the
 second act but tbc cxpectcd
 advantage to the slaveholding interest
 in the re rions beyond
 the Rio Grande was frustrated
 by the genius of Clay
 and the firmness of l
 aylou Enough however had been
 accom plished to hasten the
 purposes of the disunionists the
 political par They were to
 be found nn both ties
 of that day The time
 had arrived for con ccntruting
 their encroies They chose the
 Dem oct atic party as
 then instrument and between 1850
 arid 1852 the forces of
 disunion were gathered In the
 latter year thc into that
 oturanization total destruction of the
 Whig party vas accom It
 was necessary further to break
 up plishcd the unity of
 tbc Democracy There was one
 statute which was than any
 other dear to the country
 The Missouri compromise was northern
 editors write and northern orators
 speak second only to the
 Constitution in the affections A
 proposition for its repeal was
 against slavery to tue pe
 ople of the North and
 of the people that thus
 the norLhern mind i as
 become so de I suggested
 The disuuinnists eagerly seized upon
 the project and the outrage
 was consurnmated moralized as to
 prefer freedom to bondage Let
 then southern ministers editors and
 orators Thousands of Democrats rn
 the free States Ipft come
 and answer those of the
 North no mob their party
 ranks forever A scemtng indorse
 shall tar and feather hang
 or shoot them it their
 mcnt of the legislation of
 1854 was octaincd by the
 union of the combined South
 with u few of efforts
 shall prove fruitless the evils
 of free spcech the border
 northern States in the election
 of Mr and a free
 press are beyond remedy I
 have now considered the avowed
 reasons for Buchanan But it
 had become cvidcnt that the
 young and vigorous party which
 had sprung into this rebellion
 and on a fair examination
 of them existence upon the
 repeal of the Missouri com
 I am constrained to say
 that they are utterly friv
 olous and such as in
 themselves could never promise a
 party which combined all the
 best ele have moved the
 people of any Stato to
 sedition mcnts of the old
 political organizations of the North
 and would have speedily taken
 power and revolt The causes
 lie deeper and I now
 proceed to unfold them Disunion
 in its present shape is
 of thirty years growth although
 until the 61 1 of
 November last it may be
 traced to the it expanded
 in the dark workings of
 a single mind disappointed of
 a cherished ambition when John
 C Calhoun lost the hope
 of being the successor of
 Andrew Jack son Though destitute
 of the highcst qualities of
 statesmansiiip Mr Calhoun had nevertheless
 the sa acity to perceive
 the yet unconscious strength of
 what has since been called
 the slave how existing compactly
 in one section of the
 country and embracing a pecuniary
 intercst so vast that the
 mind is unable to grasp
 it if its political capacities
 could be brought to act
 as u in the other
 section it would be potent
 to rule and how if
 severed from all parties it
 might be after the diaappointment
 of his ambitious ox ful
 position at the South but
 for the despotism which had
 destroyed all freedom of elections
 there would be likely to
 succeed in 1860 A made
 up case was smuggled into
 the Supreme Court which proceeded
 to expound the Constitution in
 a man ner that compelled
 cvcry patriotic it u ist
 in thc land to blush
 for very shame Slavery was
 made national by judicial construction
 and that con struction was
 cnforced in the Federal territory
 at the p001t of thc
 bayonet The disunionists mean They

 inét the Gov ernment which
 they had first4 robbed and
 then betrayed Disunion was preparing
 fori its eon summation The
 infamy of the Dred Scott
 decision had destroyed the confidence
 of na tion in the
 Supreme Court The infamy of
 the Lecompton bill and the
 boundless corruption vhich was everywher
 e revealing itself stroyed the
 confidence ot the nation in
 the execu tive administration The
 Republican party had from thc
 beginning been mobbed and shot
 and stran gled out of
 the southern States The same
 fate must be got ready
 for the Union portion of
 the Democratic party The great
 political convene Lions to make
 nominations for the Presidency were
 coming on That of the
 Democratic party Was tosbe held
 in Charleston the very hotbed
 of treason The leaders of
 disunion contFiVcd to be appointed
 delegatesto it They demanded the
 adop tion of principles which
 no northern Democrat could sanction
 without betraying his eonstitu ency
 dcfiling his own conscience and
 dishonor ing himself As was
 expected and desired the con
 vcntion was broken 1 n
 to fragments The Democrats who
 stood by the Union were
 driven to nominate n candidate
 from the northern section of
 the Republic while the disunionists
 formed themselves into a compact
 party prepared to sweep the
 Southern Stutes Then followed a
 political canvass such as the
 country had never before witnessed
 The action of the disunionists
 in the convention had insured
 the success of the Republican
 party T bey had now
 four months before them in
 which under the pretense Of
 opposing that result they might
 inflame the pop ular mind
 up to the pitch of
 treason and dismem berment of
 thc Union No man in
 all the South with here
 and there an exception along
 the north ern borders could
 open his lips in explanation
 of Republican principles No man
 could defend them there without
 thé certainty ofa violent death
 The disunionists thus bad the
 field to themselves so far
 as the accomplishment of their
 immediate purposes was The whole
 South was Inundated with one
 foul reeking deluge of false
 hood The objects the principles
 the very per sons of
 Republicans wcre libeled day by
 day for four long months
 Men who had sat in
 Con gress with the Republican
 candidate for Vice President as
 fellow Democrats and who there
 fore knew the falsity of
 what they said inflamed the
 worst passions of the southern
 mob by the assertion that
 Mr Harniin was a mulatto
 The poison of asps was
 under their lips their tongues
 would sct on fire the
 course of nature and were
 themselves set on fire of
 hell The loyal men of
 the South who perceived the
 tendency of cyents stood aghast
 at what was occurring around
 them They could not deny
 these aspersions without be ing
 denounced as the apologists of
 abolition The iTuorant populace wondered
 believed were in flamed and
 thus made fit for the
 designs of the conspirators The
 clection took place and re
 sulted as everybody knew it
 must do Forthwith the revolution
 was precipitated While the minds
 of men were thus heated
 by passion engen dcred by
 misrepresentation the Issue was forbed
 upon them ill the seceding
 States willi no time that
 demonstrates both the insincerity and
 the incapacity of the mana
 yers What now are the
 objects of those who have
 led this movement to its
 present condition I an swer
 in part the complete overthrow
 of demo cratic institutions and
 the establishment of an aristocratic
 or even monarchical government The
 disciplcs of the Calhoun school
 have learned to distrust the
 people to hate universal suffrage
 and to believe in aristocracy
 Amor g the leaders of

 in my opinion is the
 real orio in of the
 present revolt and such are
 the motives which inspire its
 leaders I do not say
 that all who arc participating
 in the rebellion share these
 feelings Thousands of honest men
 have been deceived by thö
 promoters of revolution and verily
 think that they are st

 what is the result to
 which all this tends The
 first thing vhich it proposes
 to accomplish is the dis
 menibet ment of the Republic
 and this it claims the
 right to do c vithout
 the consent of the Fed

 loyal States but as an
 exercise of the plain constitutional
 powers of the disloyal States
 The advocates of this dogma
 would hide the guilt of
 rebellion and the blood and

 soft spoken phraseology of secession
 T bey have dug the

 sight of thc civilized worid
 when slavery shall have ceased
 to recog nize that banner
 as its emblem t has
 been said indeed that the
 dismernber ment which have been
 considerinr is not the only
 one that may occur and
 sundry gentlemen whose homes are
 to the northward of Mason
 and Dixon s line but
 whose principles would seem to
 have sprung from a more
 congenial southern soil have expressed
 an anxiety to escape from
 a further union with New
 England I do not won
 der when such expressions fall
 from the lips of any
 one who in this age
 of the world and bred
 amid free institutions has nevertheless
 consented to become the apologist
 of slavery But sir what
 would this nation be without
 the New land influence which
 has permeated its whole I
 fé Go out from her
 borders and follow the parallels
 of latitude westward to the
 Pacific Wherever alnng your pathway
 you find mingled in their
 justest proportions reverence for law
 and love of civil liberty
 wherever you find the hiøhestsocial
 order resting securely upon the
 broadest democ racy wherever industry
 is most prevalent and reaps
 the most ample rewards wherever
 villages cluster thickest and churches
 most abound and school houses
 stand most frequent wherever Christianity
 assurnes her purest fortn and
 edu cation is most widely
 disseminated there sir cverywhere there
 you behold the foot prints
 of New England And at
 home among her mount ains
 and along her valleys dwells
 to day a people unsurpassed
 in everything that makes a
 nation great by any peoplcon
 this arth Cast by accident
 upon a bleak and comparatively
 sterile region they found themselves
 confronted by the hostile ele
 ments of nature and defied
 and conquered them They have
 turned the rock y hill
 sides into stnooth pasture fields
 and the desolate swamps into
 fair meadows They have chained
 the rushing rivers and compelled
 them to drive the machinery
 of a thousand manufactories whose
 product is borne by their
 commerce to the farthest regions
 of the globe I hey
 have dotted the land all
 over with villages where the
 hum of industry never ceases
 except for the old New
 England Sabbath rest Their government
 is the purest democracy the
 world ever saw their social
 order its perfect as any
 that ever prevailed in human
 society From every hill top
 you can count the spires
 of many churches in every
 hamlet the school house free
 rl he people who dwell
 there to all has its
 place are quiet loyal law
 abiding men pursuing their avocations
 in peace and dreading commotion
 and But the blood of
 the rold fronsides is civil
 strife in their veins and
 in their minds the memories
 of Marston Moor mingle with
 those of Lexington and Bunker
 s Hill The impulse which
 lies deep est in their
 Ilearts is not the miserable
 fiction nis called honor but
 the living and eternal verity
 of duty at whose call
 they will if need be
 lay down the implements of
 peace and vaik as calmly
 up to the cannon mouth
 ag they now do to
 their daily toil Sir the
 United States of America can
 not afford to lose New
 England and the sons of
 New England scattered all over
 the broad North and West
 cannot sun ler the tie
 which binds them t o
 the hearth stone of civil
 liberty on this westerj continent
 But I anl wandering from
 my purpose I have now
 considered tbc avowed reasons for
 this rc volt its real
 origin the object of its
 authors and the results to
 which it It remains for
 me to ascertain if I
 can the most effective methods
 for its suppression Great changes
 in the con dit ion
 of affairs have occurred since
 the early sessions of the
 committee When we first met
 no State ultemptßd to withdraw
 from the Uniofi no Federal
 property had been seized and
 confisdated no Federal forts captured
 no rebel cannon fired upon
 the national flag Six weeks
 acro we might properly have
 discussed alleged grievances it may
 now be appropriate that pre
 liminary measures ofa different character
 be taken If I have
 correctly judged of the origin
 and char acter of this
 sedition it may well be
 doubted whether there is not
 more need of the intervention
 of the judicial and executive
 departments to which alone belong
 the trial and punishment of
 crimes than of the legislative
 But the subject is before
 Congress and we are asked
 to compromise And to compromise
 what Not questions of financial
 commercial or indus trial policy
 but our convictions of moral
 recti tude onr love of
 liberty our reverence for duty
 This is what constitutes the
 grave character of the In
 matters of revenue in issue
 now before us matters of
 finance in all matters of
 mere expedi ency concessions and
 compromises may safely enough be
 made but I know of
 only one ruie of civil
 conduct when moral duties are
 necessarily brought into the field
 of political action and that
 rule IS to do right
 To Ingraft upon the Consti
 tution an express recogmtion of
 property in man and to
 pledge the power of this
 Government un alterably for the
 preservation and protection of that
 property in all the Federal
 Territories where slave labor can
 be profitably employed would be
 in my judgment a monstrous
 iniquity abhorred of God and
 deserving the execration of the
 civ ilized world T hc
 gentleman from Virginia Mr MILLSON
 reprobates the phrase property in
 man and in the next
 breath claims to have won
 a victory by the decision
 in the Dred Scott case
 whose cardinal principle is the
 recognition of this very I
 turn to the laws of
 his own property in man
 State I find there thät
 a slave is a chattel
 per sonal a thing to
 be sold atauction to be
 devised by will to de
 scend by inheritance to be
 bought and sold to be
 levied upon in execution and
 I am asked to consent
 that Lhe Constitution of the
 United States shall be so
 changed I will not say
 amended ns to o on
 unalterably forever foster ino nourishing
 and protecting this svstem in
 Territories which by the organic
 law ofa Span ish Repubiic
 were to be always free
 Such is the proposition of
 the venerable Senator from Ken
 lucky substantially reproduced in the
 resolution suggested by the gentleman
 from Louisiana Sir I cannot
 accede to it The authority
 of that Sen ator is
 of no avaii in a
 question of this character and
 nothing that has occurred since
 my associa tion with Congress
 has filled me with such
 pro found regret as this
 last act of his long
 useful and honorable public life
 Why sir do gentlemen think
 that the freemen of the
 North are all knaves and
 hypocrites as well as cowards
 For six years have the
 sup porters of Mr Douglas
 been denouncing this idea of
 protection to slave property in
 the Territories Because their leader
 deserts them do you expect
 that they too will repudiate
 the principles which have rown
 to be a part of
 their intellectual be irry For
 six years havo the supporters
 of Mr Lincoln been strivincr
 to seeure those Territories from
 the pernicious influences of the
 system of bondage They have
 been doing this because they
 thought it best for the
 whole country that such a
 result should be attained best
 for the Ter ritories best
 for posterity they have been
 doing this because they thought
 that the extension of siavery
 by the national authority would
 bring down the vencreance of
 Heaven upon a guilty land
 because they saw that wherever
 the institution was most powerful
 civil liberty whose elements as
 I have before said are
 freedom of speech free dom
 of the press and freedom
 of elections could not exist
 And in all this they
 have been ex ceedingly in
 earnest They have won a
 great victory they hnvc elected
 a President of like po
 liticalfaith with themselves and now
 you gravely ask them to
 turn their backs upon all
 their past professions to rcnouuce
 the principles by whose u
 tterancc tbcy have obtained power
 and to make themselves a
 mockery and a hissing to
 the whole civilized world because
 thp defeated party threat ens
 a rosort to arins When
 they comply with II that
 request sir the time will
 have come to level down
 Bunker s Hill I he
 chairman of the select committee
 of this I House has
 reported a series of measures
 the first of which is
 a joint resolution for an
 amendment to the Constitution of
 a somewhat different char I
 will read it as reported
 acter ART XII No amendment
 of this Constitution having for
 its object any interf rcnce
 within the States with the
 relation betwe en their citizens
 and those described in sec
 ti011 second of Lhc first
 article of the Constitution as
 all other persons shall ori
 inate with a21Y State that
 does not recognize that relation
 within its own limits or
 shall be valid without the
 assent of every one of
 the States co npos ing
 the Union Is it possible
 to listen to these words
 without a feeling that we
 are ashamed of what we
 are doing Observe the circumlocution
 the awkwardness of construction the
 involutions of meaning What is
 it all for Sir it
 is because you are putting
 slavery into the Constitution beyond
 what the fathers did Do
 you say that they too
 described bondage by a circumlocution
 I answer they did no
 such thing They intended that
 their Con stitution should contain
 no Federal recognition of slavery
 and they went directly to
 the accom plishment of that
 intention by designating every human
 being in the land as
 a person Why put 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBB idbS this
 piece of patch work upon
 the sober fabric of their
 construction I am told that
 it is only intended to
 prohibit a future amendment of
 the Constitution havinø for its
 object any interference x vith
 slavery in the States and
 then I am asked do
 you wish to in terfere
 with slavery in the States
 or do you wish to
 amend the Constitution so as
 to accomplish that result I
 do not neither do I
 intend to es tablish a
 national bank or initiate direct
 taxation but I cannot see
 that it follows therefrom that
 I should amend the Constitution
 so as to forbid such
 enactments Is there no other
 subject of concern in this
 Republic but slavery Shali the
 organic law be liable to
 change in its bearing upon
 the great commercial manufacturing aad
 agri cultural interests upon matters
 of peace and war upon
 the relations of Government to
 the people ahd yet we
 now erect slavery into the
 one great overshadowing principle which
 we purpose to declare before
 God and man shall be
 immutable and eternal Slavery which
 the fathcrs laid out of
 sight as an unholy thing
 we drag from its de
 cent concealment and placino it
 upon the pedi ment of
 the Constitution take mutual oaths
 that there it Shail stand
 forever In doing this we
 overthrow that equality of the
 States of which we have
 heard so much for we
 deny to a majority of
 the members of the Union
 even the capacity of sUggesting
 amendments upon so sacred a
 subject Sir the Constitution of
 the United States needs no
 changc in favor of slavei
 y I will stand by
 it as itis will accord
 to every interest all its
 rights and I am amazed
 that the very parties who
 have been roudest in their
 lip devotion to the funda
 mental law should be the
 very first to demand its
 radical alteration The existence in
 the south ern States of
 groundless fears engendered by will
 fu t falsehood is no
 reason for a change m
 the Constitution Every precedent of
 change is dan gerous dou
 bly dangerous when occurring in
 times of hi rh political
 excitement or amid the turmoil
 of civil commotion oroffered to
 appease the wrath of armed
 rebels against all government and
 all social order I shall
 not vote for the amendment
 The next proposition is An
 act for the admis Sion
 of New Mexico into the
 United States of America When
 the preparation of this bill
 was first suggested in the
 committee some weeks ago assented
 to it When the bill
 itself was reported to the
 committee I withheld my assent
 Nearly every southern gentleman had
 repudiated it and we were
 assured that instead of being
 a measure of peace it
 would add to the existing
 irritation I am therefore left
 to decide whether as an
 act of ordinary legislation it
 ought to re have until
 very recently ceive my support
 believed that a fair convention
 of the people of that
 Territory would frame a constitution
 pro hibiting the existence of
 slavery within the future State
 But the report of the
 chairman of the comlliittee proceeds
 entirely upon the supposition that
 New Mexico is of course
 to be a slave State
 and his remarkable speech in
 the House the other day
 is of the same tenor
 An e stract from his
 report will éxhibit my meaning
 This Territory was organized in
 1850 By it s organic
 law the I erritorial Legislature
 was authorized to enact laws
 was provided in the saine
 and report thein to Congress
 act that if Congress should
 disapprove the laws thus made
 they should be null and
 void In the year 1859
 the rrerritorial Legislature of New
 Mexico established slavery in that
 Ilerritory This law was disapproved
 at the last session of
 Congress by a vote of
 the House but the Senate
 have not yet acted on
 the bill and so the
 law of the Territory not
 having been annulled by both
 Houses of Congress remains in
 full force and slavery now
 exists by law in New
 Mexico It is further provided
 by the act of 1850
 that New Mc x ico
 when she is admitted into
 the Union shall be admitted
 with or without slavery as
 her constitution may ordain The
 committee now propose to admit
 New Mexico into the Union
 as a State orr an
 equal footinw with the original
 States Bv this course the
 faith of the nation pledged
 in the act of 1850
 will be preserved and the
 Territory lying south of the
 paranel of 360 30 will
 be disposed of and the
 subject natter of controversy removed
 t rmn the jurisdiction of
 the Federal Govehment Thus all
 clailned by the South will
 be obtained while the northern
 portion of our remain in
 Territory will be subject to
 such law as the Constitution
 and Congress may fürnish for
 its government By this adjustment
 of the present territory of
 the Union including the territory
 of ali the States it
 will be Iöund that the
 area of the free States
 and Territories including all north
 of the line 360 30
 contains 1 648 779 square
 miles and a population of
 19 036 739 inaking a
 population of about eleven and
 five tenths to the square
 inile The area of the
 slaveholding States including New Mexico
 is 1 094 504 square
 miles with a fOderal population
 of about nine and seven
 tenths to the square mile
 By this arrangement of all
 the territory now possessed by
 the Uni ted States when
 New Mexico is admitted if
 admitted as a slave St
 tte that possessed by the
 slaveholding States will be greater
 in proportion to federal population
 than that occurned by the
 non siaveholdlng States and Territories
 I lle cormnittee are at
 a loss to conceive what
 more than this can be
 dernanded or desired by the
 South The import of this
 language is unmistakable and it
 indicates purposes which are wholly
 foreign to my settled convictions
 of duty Mr Speaker we
 acquired this territory from Mexico
 That Republic feeble and distracted
 though she was had yet
 had the wisdom to prohibit
 the existence of bondage throughout
 all her possessions It would
 be a great wrong and
 an Undying disgrace for the
 Government of the United States
 either by conquest or by
 purchase to obtain free terri
 tory to be carved into
 slave States The people intended
 by the recent eleption to
 be secure against the accomplishment
 öf such a purpose The
 mode in which this measure
 is presented to us seems
 calculated to frustrate that intention
 It is true that no
 one in voting for the
 bill votes for the report
 but the report nevertheless is
 justly received by the country
 as explaining the bill and
 foreshadowing its results If those
 results should fail of accomplishment
 if the constitutional con vention
 should after all prohibit the
 existence of slavery may not
 the South with some reason
 say that your scheme of
 conciliation was a juggle and
 a cheat and fan the
 fires of revolution into a
 still wider flame The ohjections
 to the bill as a
 measure of or dinary legislation
 are insuperable I learn from
 very high authority that theopcopleöf
 New Mex ico do not
 wish its passage that they
 arc a sparse population scattered
 over an immense area five
 times as large as the
 State of New York that
 they are separated from communication
 with each other by waterless
 deserts and vast mountain ranges
 that they are poor and
 unable to bear the expense
 of a State government and
 that they prefer for the
 present to remain under the
 fos terillg care of the
 Federal power I learn more
 over that the population of
 American origin does not amount
 to a thousand in numbers
 that of the remainder there
 are but three or four
 thousand freemen of unmixed Spanish
 descent while the residue is
 made up of peons and
 Indians of more or less
 mixed blood To compel such
 a people so situated to
 form a constitution and come
 into the Union would be
 eminently unwise 1 shall vote
 against the bill The committee
 have reported an amendment to
 the present law for the
 rendition of fugitives from service
 The President in his message
 had cm phatically condemned the
 statutes known as per sonal
 liberty bills and had even
 declared that without their repeal
 no human power could save
 the Union It was very
 plain that the Pres ident
 had never read the laws
 of which he was speaking
 but so far as my
 own State is con cerned
 f have always been willing
 to repeal the particular statute
 alluded to whenever the Fed
 era Government should take away
 the evil which that statute
 was wisely enacted to guard
 against I am happy to
 say that the bill reported
 by the committee will in
 my judgment accomplish that purpose
 The act of 1850 was
 peculiarly liable to abuse of
 process of the worst description
 even that whereby a freeman
 might be deprived of his
 liberty against th is evil
 a portion of the free
 States have legislated in the
 manner complained of The present
 amendment though not so perfect
 as I could have wished
 does yet contain such pro
 visions as to create a
 moral impossibility that any freeman
 can be reduced to bondage
 under its op eration The
 question is not however whether
 I x vould vote for
 it as an original proposition
 but whether I will consent
 to the amelioration so far
 of the existing law I
 shall cheerfully give it my
 support and upon its passage
 by Congress will join in
 the recommendation to the people
 of my State for the
 repeal ofa statute whose longer
 con tinuance will have become
 unnecessary T hc committee has
 rcportcd one other measure of
 specific legislation It is as
 follows Be it enacted by
 the Senate and House of
 Representatives of the United States
 of Jmerica in Congress assembled
 That every person charged by
 indictment or other satisfactory evidence
 in any State with treason
 felony or other crime conunitted
 within the jurisdiction of such
 State who shall flee or
 shall have fled from justice
 and be found in another
 State shall on the demand
 or the executive authority of
 the State from which he
 fled upon the district judgc
 of the United States of
 the district in which he
 may be found be arrested
 and brought beföre such judge
 who on being eat isfied
 that he is the person
 charged and that he was
 within the jurisdictiåh of such
 State at time such erihié
 was committed of which such
 Zharge shah be ptimaffacie e
 vi dence shall deliver Ilfm
 uptobe removed tothegtate hav tng
 jurisdiction öf the crime and
 if any queguon igf e
 shati arise during such may
 bé tåkéO On exceptions by
 writ of error to the
 Oircuit eourt t There is
 no action Of the Committee
 which l more deeply regret
 than the report of this
 bill regard it as an
 attempt at fugrant usurpation by
 the Federal Government of poweis
 that belong only to the
 Statesi By the theory Of
 Our system the highest duty
 Of the State authoritv is
 to protect the person of
 the citizen The bill before
 the House strikes down the
 very capacity to perform that
 duty Its legal effect is
 to sus pend the writ
 of habeas corpus frem the
 State ju diciary in all
 cases of requisition for the
 surrender of alleged criminals and
 to wrench from the State
 executive functions which have been
 exercised thereby for sixty four
 years in order to devolve
 those functions upon a Federal
 iudge appointed by the President
 of the United States and
 hold ing office for life
 I believe its practical opera
 tion will be disastrous for
 instead of the trifling differences
 which now exist between certain
 GOV ernors it tends to
 collision between the Federal and
 State authorities which ought if
 possible to be carefully avoided
 Nor do I approve the
 objectofthe bill It has been
 very generally held by the
 Governors that no surrender should
 be made upon a requisition
 for the commission of an
 act which was not a
 crime by the laws of
 the State on whose execu
 tive the requisition was made
 I believe that de cision
 to be right It is
 expected to reverse it by
 the judgment of the Federal
 courts as now consti tutedA
 The object for which the
 reversal is sought is mainly
 that requisitions upon indictments for
 what are called offenses against
 slave propefty and for the
 publication of such printed matter
 as the laws of certain
 States maydenominate incen diary shall
 be made effective by the
 surrender through the Federal judges
 of the persons ac cused
 Indictments have been found against
 cit izcns who had never
 been in the jurisdiction where
 the crime was alleged to
 have been committed at all
 the only presence therein being
 such as was derived by
 construction from the mailing by
 the accused ofa newspaper in
 the State of New York
 to a friend or subscriber
 south of Mason and Dixon
 s line and the bill
 as far as possible sanctions
 this infamous practice by providing
 that the mere finding of
 the indictment shall be primafacie
 evidence before the Federal judge
 of the presence of the
 accused at the place where
 the crime is alleged to
 have been committed Every man
 shall be presumed to be
 innocent till his guilt is
 proved is the maxim of
 the common law the bill
 reverses it squarely I have
 nothing to say of the
 laws which the citizens of
 the slaveholding States may choose
 to make for the preservation
 of their system of society
 but I must protest against
 the practical extension of those
 laws all over the Republic
 through the intervention of the
 Federal courts Mr Speaker I
 have now stated very fully
 the course which I intend
 to pursue regarding the propositions
 submitted by the chairman of
 the committee It remains for
 me to consider what ought
 to be done for the
 preservation of the Re It
 is a question Involving at
 this hour public terrible responsibilities
 Good men brave men wise
 men may well hesitate and
 doubt But sir there is
 a principle which will guide
 us safely in It is
 simply to do right The
 the darkest hour one great
 revelation of history which above
 all others exhibits its awful
 presence amid the changes of
 rising and of falling nations
 is that God governs in
 the affairs of men and
 that the people who deliberately
 trample upon His eternal law
 cannot prosper It is because
 I have learned this that
 I dare not make another
 compromise with slavery And why
 should we compromisc The people
 have elected a Péesident of
 signal in tegrity and holding
 just and constitutional opin ions
 Forthwith armed rebellion springs up
 all along the Gulf and
 with saber brandished in our
 faces and bayonet pointed at
 our breasts demands compromise Other
 States catching the infection threaten
 to join the insurgent ranks
 unless we compromise Compromise what
 sir Not a pe tition
 for redress of grievances has
 been laid üpon our tablc
 but the soft appliances that
 are brought to bear upon
 this great Government are drilled
 troops and loaded cannon 554
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 25
 The venerable Senator from Rhode
 Island re marked in his
 place the other day I
 am afraid to compromise lest
 I demoralizc the Government I
 share in that fear Suppose
 we yield sacrifice the moral
 convictions of the North and
 the re volted States return
 to their allegiance the tariff
 bill of the gentleman from
 Vermont is taken from the
 table of the Senate and
 passed forthwith the hosts of
 sedition are rallied secessim again
 raises its hideous front and
 amid the clangor of arms
 souiuling from the Gulf the
 industrial inter estSof the nation
 are immolated upon the altars
 of treason Will Pennsylvania stand
 halting and trembling then Aftcr
 peace has been restored by
 the new surren4er the homestead
 bill is reached upon the
 Calendar of the Senate guns
 roar from Fort Moultrie bayonets
 bristle at Pensacola bat teries
 are planted 011 tho banks
 of the Mississippi and amid
 shouts of compromise the Govern
 ment yields orwe more and
 the free cmiTrant of every
 section is sacrificed to the
 plantation On which side will
 tl le Northwest be then
 A compromise now is but
 the establishment of sedition as
 an clementary principle in our
 system Let the slaveholding States
 renounce their mis chievons heresy
 of secession let them return
 to their allegiance let them
 propose as the only usc
 ful amendment to the Constitution
 an express provision therein that
 no State shall withdraw from
 the Union without the consent
 of all its mem bers
 let them then make known
 in the respect ful manner
 due to every Govefnment what
 arc their desires and I
 have no doubt that ample
 secu rity will be givcn
 for all their rights and
 even in terests But so
 long as open rebellion on
 the one hand and threatened
 rebellion on tho other are
 the means of redress relied
 on there is no course
 left for the Government but
 the vindication of its dignity
 by an exhibition ofitsstrengtli Sir
 there never was so wicked
 a rebellion since the angels
 revolted as that which now
 threatens to devastate this fair
 land A country such as
 God never be fore gave
 to apy people a Constitution
 the envy and thc admiration
 of tbc world a freedom
 cotn bined in such just
 measure with civil order as
 no other nation was ever
 blessed withal a past full
 of glorious recollections a present
 wherein plenty is pouring her
 richest bounty into the lap
 of peace a future glowing
 with immortal hopes thcsc all
 these are to be thrown
 away and the hell fires
 of civil war to be
 kindled up that a l
 oombs may be lord of
 the ascendant it Georgia or
 a Rhett realize his visions
 of ambition in South Carolina
 Others may do as they
 choose I for one dare
 not compound with a treason

 ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY On motion
 of Mr SLIDELL it was
 Ordered l hat when the
 Senate adjourns to day it
 be to meet on Monday
 next SURVEYOR GENERAL OF WASHINGTON
 Mr BRIGHT 1 offer the
 followinæ resolu tion and ask
 for its consideration now Resolved
 Ithat the Connnitree on Public
 Lands he in structed to
 inquire into the expediencv or
 restoring the salary o the
 surveyor general of Washington i
 erritory reduced by the aet
 March 3 1855 said restoration
 to take effect roll thc
 1st July 1855 and to
 report by bill or other
 wise I wish to call
 the attention of thc chairman
 of the Committee on Public
 Lands to this resolu tion
 There was a reduction of
 tbc salarv of the surveyor
 general of Washington Territory made
 some four years since by
 amendment offered by the Scnator
 from Arkansas and so construed
 as to reduce the salary
 of the surveyor general when
 it was not intended The
 Senator from Arkansas recollects the
 case I believe Mr JOHNSON
 of Arkansas Is it matter
 that is reported here The
 PRESIDING OFFICER It is a
 resolu tion of inquiry Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas ask that
 it be read again I
 did not hear it The
 Secretary again read the resolution
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas I
 can give no answer in
 regard to it now or
 as to the propriety of
 any step in relation to
 it Mr BRIGHT 1 do
 not ask any answer now
 but simply that the committee
 investigate the matter The resolution
 was agreed to GEORGE 11
 GIDDINGS Mr WIGFALL 1 wish
 to call up a joint
 resolution which the Post Offc
 e Comn ittee re ported
 a few days ago It
 is House joint resolu tion
 No 62 for the benefit
 of George H Giddings Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 should like to
 hear it read that I
 may know what it is
 The Secretary read thejoint resolution
 with the amendment of the
 Committee on the Post Offce
 and Post Roads Mr TRUMBULL
 Ido not know that 1
 have any object ion to
 the passage of th s
 joint resolu tion do not
 know anything about it but
 I would suggest that as
 to day has been assigned
 for the consideration of private
 bills whether it is not
 proper and right that we
 should take them in their
 order and not call them
 up in this way out
 of their place Let every
 person havin y a private
 claim on the Calendar have
 a fair chance Mr GREEN
 Let me suggest to the
 Sena tor from Illinois that
 this is not on the
 Calendar at all Mr FESSENDEN
 It ought to be Mr
 WIGFALL This is a joint
 resolution that was passed by
 the House of Representatives 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBfi 565 and
 referred to the Committee on
 the Post Office and Post
 Roads of the Senate and
 by that com mittee reported
 back some two or three
 days ago with a recommendation
 that it be adopted Mr
 TRUMBULL Then of course it
 is on a much later
 case than a great many
 others There are a great
 many private claims here which
 were reported upon favorably some
 time ago but upon which
 we have never acted and
 I ask the Senator from
 Texas if he thinks it
 is quite fair thus to
 take recent cases out of
 their place to the preju
 dice of those that have
 been long ready for con
 sideration Mr WIGFALL If it
 gives rise to debate 1
 withdraw it Mr TRUMBULL 1
 suppose this case must be
 on the Calendar I have
 not looked at the Cal
 endar to ascertain and indeed
 I know nothing about the
 case I am making no
 opposition to it on its
 merits 5 but in justicc
 to other claimants I insist
 that we ought to proceed
 with the Calen dar in
 order I think that is
 fair to all claimants Mr
 GWIN we cannot get io
 the Calendar until one o
 clock Mr HEMPHILL The Senator
 from cali fornia says we
 cannot get to the Calendar
 until one o clock We
 are now in the morning
 hour which is often devoted
 in part to such business
 It is not usual to
 object to the consideration of
 such a joint resolution in
 the morning hour and I
 do not see any reason
 why this resolution should be
 made an exception Mr TRUMBULL
 It is on the Calendar
 I object to making an
 exception as this day has
 been assigned to private bills
 I understand it is on
 the Calendar Mr HEMPHILL But
 it can be discussed in
 the morning hour and then
 the Calendar will come up
 Mr TRUMBULL If we commence
 the cali ing up of
 private cases in the morning
 hour I sup pose every
 Senator will try to get
 the floor to havc his
 particular case taken up Mr
 WIGFALL Is there anything else
 to be done in the
 morning hour If there is
 anything that it stands in
 the wav of Mr TRUMBULL
 Let me if it would
 be in order to move
 to proceed to the considcra
 tion of the Private Calendar
 at this hour If it
 would I make that motion
 that we proceed to the
 consideration of the Private Calendar
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The opinion
 of the Chair is that
 no motion of that kind
 can take precedence of a
 motion to take up this
 joint res olution until one
 o clock Mr FESSENDEN 1
 object to this mode of
 proceeding I have had billé
 on the Private Cal endar
 during the session which I
 had a desire to bring
 up but I refrained from
 doing so because I thought
 it should take its course
 and other gen tlemen have
 done the same Mr WIGFALL
 1 withdraw my motion PRIVATE
 CALENDAR Mr TRUMBULL 1 renew
 mv motion un less there
 be other morning business that
 we proceed at once to
 the consideration of the Private
 Calendar Mr LANE I believe
 the unfinished business or the
 business that has precedence if
 I recollect aright is the
 bill reported from the Committee
 on Military Affairs the other
 morning for the relief of
 Dr McCormick Mr FESSENDEN That
 is on the Private Calendar
 Mr LANE It was being
 considered when the hour for
 the special order arrived some
 days ago If taken up
 now it can and it
 was passed over be disposed
 of before one o clock
 I think it will not
 take fivc minutes The committee
 were unan imous in the
 opinion that the bill ought
 to pass They directed it
 to be reported with a
 recom mendation that it do
 pass and I trust there
 will be no objection to
 its being taken up for
 it can be passed in
 two minutes and then we
 can proceed with the Calendar
 Mr TRUMBULL 1 suppose the
 bill referred to by the
 Senator from Oregon is on
 the Calendar know noth and
 we shall reach it in
 its order ing of the
 bill Mr LANE How are
 we to get at the
 Privaie Calendar before one o
 clock Mr HALE The Senate
 can take it up Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 my motion that
 we proceed at once to
 the consideration of the Private
 Calendar Mr LANE If the
 Senate choose to take up
 the Private Calendar now I
 will withdraw my The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Oregon
 can insist on his motion
 if it is his pleasure
 so to do The bill
 he refers to is unfin
 Ished business of the moroning
 hour but as he withdraws
 that question now before the
 Senate is Shall the Private
 Calendar be taken up at
 this time The motion was
 agreed to ROBERT STOCKTON The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr in the
 chair The Chair will state
 to the Senate that thcrc
 are sundry bills and joint
 resolutions upon the table which
 have had their third read
 ing and the question now
 is upon their passage The
 first is the joint resolution
 H R No 39 directing
 the accounting offcers of the
 Treasury to settle the accounts
 of the late Robert Stockton
 quartermaster On the 19th of
 June 1860 it was read
 the third time and postponed
 The question now is upon
 its passage The joint resolution
 directs the proper account ing
 offcers of the Treasury Department
 to settle the accounts of
 the late Robert Stockton of
 New Jersey an assistant quartermaster
 and forage master in the
 war of the Revolution and
 pay to his legal heirs
 and representatives such sum as
 may be shown due upon
 suffcient proof of his service
 as quartermaster and for damages
 done his property by the
 American Army Mr TEN EYCK
 At the last session of
 con gress that resolution was
 amended by the Seriate striking
 out an allowancc for certain
 property that had been destroyed
 which the heirs of this
 oflicer claimed to be satisfied
 for The resolution was put
 upon its final passage thus
 amended simply providing for the
 settlement of the accounts of
 this officer It seems that
 very recently amon his papers
 in the garret of his
 former residence there were some
 accounts found showing as the
 committee that reported the bill
 supposed somc few thousand dollars
 perhaps not exceeding three or
 four thousand dollars due to
 him from tho Government The
 claim was not presented in
 consequence of these papers never
 having been discovered by his
 family until a late period
 The resolution as said was
 put upon Its final pas
 sage and it was discovered
 upon the call of thc
 yeas and nays that there
 was not a quorum pres
 ent but of the Senators
 voting for that resolution a
 large majority were in favor
 of its passage and it
 would liave passed had there
 been a quorum present The
 Senator from New York Mr
 KING interposed some objcctions to
 the resolu tion and upon
 his motion it was amended
 and I then understood his
 objections were waived Mr KING
 I remember thc case as
 it was presented last year
 and in its present shape
 I certainly think the resolution
 ought to pass The amendments
 were adopted I think Mr
 TEN EYCK Yes sir The
 joint resolution was passed JOHN
 ERICCSON The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 bill S No 132 from
 the Court of Claims for
 the relief of John Ericcson
 was on the 4th of
 May 1860 read the third
 time and the question now
 is upon its passage Mr
 HALE This bill has been
 heretofore before the Senate and
 the papers in the case
 are I very voluminous I
 hold them in my hand
 examined them once and I
 was satisfied that the bill
 ought not to pass and
 I submitted my views to
 the Senate and the honorablc
 Senator from Louisiana Mr SLIDELL
 also had something to say
 upon it and upon that
 the matter was post poned
 I am perfectly satisfied the
 bill ought not to pass
 and I wish it to
 go over until I can
 have time to examine the
 papers I move to postpone
 its consideration The motion was
 agreed to O 11 BERRYMAN
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The bill
 S No 205 from the
 Court of Claims for the
 relief of O H Berryman
 and others was on the
 4th of May 1860 read
 the third time and the
 qucs i tion now is
 on its passage It directs
 the Sedrétary Of thc to
 Otway H Berryman andthé0t héF
 åhd crew of the United
 States schooner Onkahye 20 664
 69 being the balance of
 the prizemöney obtained by the
 Capture of they bark LauFehS
 by that schooner in 1848
 the money to be distrib
 uted among the offcers and
 crew in such propor tion
 as shall be designated by
 the bf Élae Navy according
 to the provisions of the
 sixth section of the act
 of April 23 1800 entitled
 An act for the government
 of the Navy of the
 United States Mr SLIDELL Let
 us hear the reportin that
 case The SECRETARY On the
 1st of February 1858 Mr
 POLK made the following adverse
 report Mr POLK There is
 an adverse report in that
 case Is that the last
 report Mr GRIMES 1 move
 that the bill be poned
 indefinitely Mr POLK that adverse
 report is the last report
 I think the best way
 is to concur in it
 Mr GRIMES Any way to
 get rid of do not
 want to hear that long
 report read Mr POLK will
 say to Senators that I
 rec ollect investigating the claim
 two or three years ago
 when I was upon the
 Committee on Claims and l
 was satisfied that it was
 one which Congress ought not
 to pass I move therefore
 that the bill be indefinitely
 postponed or perhaps it would
 be better to concur in
 the adverse report Mr HALE
 That would be better Mr
 POLK Then 1 move that
 the adverse rc ort be
 concurred in Ir IVERSON I
 will suggest to the Senator
 that perhaps this report of
 the committee may not be
 the report to which he
 refers There an impression on
 my mind that the Committee
 on Claims since the Senator
 from Missouri was a member
 of the committee have probably
 made a favorable report and
 if that report be concurréd
 in of course the bill
 will be passed and the
 Sen ator will not accomplish
 his object Mr POLK asked
 if that was the last
 report and understood it wag
 The PRESIDING OFFICER There was
 no response to the Senator
 s inquiry from the Clerk
 s desk The Chair however
 understands that the report which
 the Clerk was about to
 read is the last report
 The question is on the
 motion of the Senator from
 Missouri to concur in the
 report of the Committee on
 Claims Mr HALE Before that
 question is taken I wish
 that the conclusion to which
 the committee camc may be
 road by tho Secretary do
 not ask that the whole
 report be read The Secretary
 read as follows The committee
 after a careful consideration of
 the cage concur substantially in
 the opinion delivered by Mr
 Jus Liec Blackford that thc
 clai nants have no right
 against the Government and they
 reccnnmend that the bill fbr
 the re lie ot O
 I I Berryman and otherS
 do not pass I hc
 opinion ofJ udge Blacktörd is
 hereto annexed as part of
 this report Mr HALE Then
 the question will be Shäll
 the bill ass The BRESIDING
 OFFICER That is the question
 unless there be some special
 motion Mr HALE Let it
 be ut The PRESIDING OFFFCER
 The question is on thc
 passage of the bill The
 bill was rejected SAMUEL V
 NILES PRESIDING OFFICER The bill
 S No 94 for the
 relief of Samuel V Niles
 was on the 4th of
 May 1860 read the third
 time and the question now
 is on its passage The
 Secretary read the bill which
 directs the Secretary of the
 Treasury to cause to be
 paid to Samuel V Niles
 360 for services as a
 temporary clerk in the General
 Land Offce in 1849 and
 1850 Mr KING Is there
 a report in that case
 Mr TRUMBULL 1 see by
 the Calendar that that bill
 was postponed The Secretary read
 the report from which it
 appears that the claim is
 for ninety days services as
 a clerk in the General
 Land Offce from March 9
 1849 to June 30 1850
 being the number of Sundays
 between thosc periods at four
 dollars per diem amounting to
 360 Mr Niles appcarg to
 have been appointed a temporary
 clerk m the General Land
 Offce on the 9th of
 March 1849 under the provisions
 of the act of August
 26 1842 no extfa cldrk
 for copy l vhich provides
 that ing shall receive more
 than thHce dollars per day
 656 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 25 or for any other
 service more than four dollars
 per day for the time
 actually and necessarily employed Under
 this provision as appears from
 a letter of the late
 Commissioner Wilson the accounting offcers
 rejected the per diem for
 Sun days This construction of
 the law the Commis sioner
 thinks is entirely erroneous By
 the act of March 3
 1849 the Commissioner of the
 Gen eral Land Offce was
 authorized to continue three temporary
 clerks during the recess of
 Con gress until the patents
 for bounty lands should be
 issued the clerks to be
 paid out of the contin
 gent fund On the 8th
 of March 1849 the day
 preceding the appointment of Mr
 Niles three clerks were appointed
 in accordance with that provision
 at the same rate of
 pay namely four dollars per
 day and to perform like
 duties as those performed by
 Niles These three clerks as
 is stated received the per
 diem for Sundays Judge Young
 then Commissioner and who made
 all the appointments referred to
 says The facts as to
 the services of Mr Niles
 are correctly set forth I
 appointed him a clerk in
 the Land Offce at the
 time stated at the same
 rate of com pensation promised
 to Messrs Whitney mega and
 Lucas and fully intended that
 no distinction should be made
 between them and that he
 should receive the same emoluments
 in every particu lar granted
 them including the Sunday per
 diem The ground of distinction
 taken by the Comp troller
 seems to have been that
 the three clerks named were
 appointed under the special provis
 ions of the act of
 1849 which relieved them from
 the operation of the act
 of 1842 and that the
 Com missioner had promised them
 the Sunday per diem The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 Shall the bill pass The
 question being put there were
 twelve votes in thc afirmative
 and several Senators said Give
 it up The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The bill does not pass
 Mr IVERSON I understood that
 the other side gave it
 up Mr HALE No no
 you gave it up Mr
 IVERSON 1 believe the Senator
 from Rhode Island Mr SIMMONS
 reported the bill He is
 not in the Chamber at
 present and I sug gest
 out of consideration to him
 that it be not decided
 now Mr KING The proper
 disposition has been made of
 it Mr GREEN The twelve
 who voted did not give
 it up Mr CLINGMAN 1
 hope by con sent the
 bill will lie over until
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 comes in Oh no J
 Then I will make a
 motion to reconsider Mr HALE
 You voted with the minority
 Mr SLIDELL I move to
 reconsider Mr HALE I voted
 with the majority and iC
 Mr SIMMONS wants it reconsidered
 when he comes in I
 shall make thc motion Mr
 SLIDELL I move the reconsideration
 now Mr HALE Let us
 vote on it at once
 Mr HUNTER 1 desire the
 motion to n sider to
 be entered The PRESID NG
 OFFICER It vil be entered
 JOHN H WHEELER The next
 bill on the Calendar was
 the bill S No 270
 for the relief of John
 H Wheeler which on the
 4th of May last was
 read the third time the
 question now being on its
 passage poses to direct the
 Secretary of the Treasury to
 pay to John H Wheeler
 late minister resident of the
 United States at Nicaragua 5
 715 20 in full for
 losses by exchange for property
 destroyed at Granada expenses incurred
 In taking testi mony at
 San Juan del Norte and
 for relief ex tended to
 distressed American citizens crossinrr the
 Isthmus during the interval between
 October 1854 and October 1856
 Mr KING Is there a
 report in that case Mr
 MASON There is a report
 accompanying the bill which can
 be read if any Senator
 asks it I reported the
 bill myself The Secretary read
 the report from which it
 appears that a party of
 American citizens while crossing the
 Isthmus en route from California
 to New York were attacked
 by the natives at Virgin
 Bay on the of Nicaragua
 on the 19th of October
 1855 some of whom were
 killed and oghers wounded and
 robbed while at the same
 time another party of hostile
 natives strongly armed were collected
 at San Carlos on the
 other side of the lake
 Thus hemmed in by hostile
 forces on both sides and
 cut Off from access to
 either ocean they applied to
 the memorialist then minister resident
 of the United States at
 that place for protection and
 rehef which was promptly forded
 comfortable quarters procured and food
 supplied them two hundred and
 fifty in number for two
 days and nights It further
 appears that under instructions from
 the Department of State dated
 October 23 1854 the memorialist
 was rc quired to aid
 Joseph W Fabens Esq a
 commis sioner appointed for that
 purpose m collecting information and
 taking testimony at San Juan
 Greytown in relation to the
 conduct of the pcr sons
 who assumed political control over
 San Juan del Norte and
 also with regard to the
 claims against our Government on
 account of property destroyed bv
 thc late bombardment of that
 place by Captain Hollins of
 the United States Navy that
 in the performance of this
 service he was engaged for
 more than two months away
 from his proper res idence
 and necessarily subjected to great
 incon venience and additional expenses
 amounting to the sum of
 273 98 In the fall
 of 1856 by recall from
 the Depart ment of State
 Mr Wheeler returned to the
 Uni ted States as was
 then supposed on a temporary
 visit On that occasion he
 left at the legation personal
 property to thc valuc of
 over two tbou sand dollars
 this property was destroyed by
 the allied forces of Guatemala
 Honduras San Sal vador Costa
 Rica and a part of
 Nicaragua On his departure for
 Central America he was in
 structed by the Department of
 State to draw upon London
 for his salary and the
 contingentexpcnses of the legation and
 for that purpose a credit
 was opellcd for hirn with
 Messrs Baring Brothers On his
 arrival in Nicaragua it was
 found imprac ticablc to negotiate
 draTts on London he had
 therefore to make an a
 ent here who drew on
 London and for a time
 deposited in New York or
 Washington in Nicaragua these drafts
 could only be negotiated at
 the reduced value of the
 cur rency of the country
 in which the peso or
 dol Jar was worth only
 eighty cents for each real
 dol lar drawn for The
 amount of his drafts from
 October 1854 to October 1856
 was 14 706 and consequently
 the loss incurred by him
 was 2 941 20 These
 statements are supported by testimony
 filed with the memorial and
 may be summed up thus
 1 Reimbursement for amount expended
 in the maintenance and protection
 of distressed American citizens crossing
 the Isth mus 500 2
 Amount of expenses incurred while
 taking testimony at San Juan
 del Norte 273 98 3
 Value of property destroyed atGranada
 2 000 4 Loss in
 exchanges 2 941 20 total
 5 715 18 Mr MASON
 The testimony the report I
 suppose nced not be read
 unless some gentleman desires it
 ThePRESIDINGOFFICER Then theques tion Will
 be on the passage of
 the bill Mr MASON The
 testimony is there and 1
 suppose the testimony which satisfied
 the com mittee would satisfy
 the Senate Any Senator can
 call for the reading of
 it if he wishes to
 hear it read Mr HALE
 Will not Senator from ginia
 be kind enough to state
 the principle of pub lic
 law upon which we are
 to pay for the property
 the minister left there during
 his absence I un derstand
 by the report there was
 2 000 worth of property
 destroyed by the revolutionary gov
 ernment duril his absence Mr
 CLINGMAN If the Senator will
 allow me I will make
 a statement know that Mr
 Wheeler came here I saw
 the correspondence for I once
 had occasion to investiTate this
 claim in the other House
 as chairman of the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs and I
 was cognizant of it pre
 viously He was called here
 bylettcr for consult ation with
 the State Department After he
 came here and had been
 here for some time there
 were matters goinø on that
 were supposed to require his
 presence they suddenly concluded to
 recall him He had no
 more idea of being recalled
 at the time he came
 here than I havc of
 being re called from the
 Senate to day He left
 his prop eFty in that
 condition and after being here
 some two three four or
 five months perhaps Mr Marcy
 and President Pierce concluded that
 he might be withdrawn that
 the existing condition of the
 country did not require his
 return and he was recalled
 in that way and in
 the mea n time his
 property left there was destroyed
 I know that fact and
 I may say further that
 I think the claim is
 well founded 11t was investigated
 by a com mittee in
 the other House and the
 committee were unanimously of the
 opinion that it ought to
 1 was then a member
 of the committee pass Mr
 HALE I am not answered
 It is not stated whether
 the property was destroyed by
 the Government by a revolution
 or by a mob and
 I wish to know if
 it is within the principle
 of public law laid down
 by the authorities Mr MASON
 I am not aware of
 any prin ciple of public
 law by that technical name
 under which this claim as
 a demand vould be paid
 but the committee places it
 01k the principle of publicjuétice
 and public right rhe facts
 stated In the report show
 that this minister under the
 guarantee which always belongs to
 a minister in a country
 and which he carries from
 his own Government that he
 will be protected in his
 right of person and property
 while he is abroad as
 their minister left his property
 in Nicaragua and the revolutionary
 forces in Nicaraoua l do
 not know whether I should
 call them revolution ary forces
 but the Government of Nicaragua
 in union with the public
 authorities of the adjacent Central
 American States in putting down
 Waiker commuted this depredation on
 ihe property of the minister
 destroyed his house and burned
 his property Now the principle
 upon which the committee allowed
 it was that it was
 incumbent upon the United States
 always to provide for the
 safety of the persons and
 property of their min isters
 abroad by a reclamation if
 it is destroyed upon the
 Government that makes it not
 a recla mation by the
 minister but a reclamation made
 by the Government Under these
 considerations the committee thought if
 there was no written public
 law which would authorize it
 it was principle and duty
 resulting from the relations subsisting
 bet vecn the minister and
 thc Govern ment Mr HALE
 I have looked over this
 report somewhat hastily I do
 not see any evidence in
 the report of that loss
 at all Mr MASON The
 evidence was before the committee
 and I prcsumc it will
 be found in the I
 have not seen the report
 since it was report made
 Mr HALE I have looked
 over it and have not
 secn it Mr M ASON
 The evidence is there I
 can as sure the Senator
 in the form of proof
 taken in the town of
 Granada x vhere the depredation
 was com mitted I have
 not seen t he report
 since it was made which
 was at the last session
 I can only vouch for
 itseaccuracy now from knowing that
 it was carefully made Here
 is a statement of Mr
 R J Darden made under
 oath and a certificate of
 John Granger recorder of the
 land offce that Mr Darden
 is a man of truth
 Mr HALE What does hc
 say Mr MASON I le
 says this On the attack
 of the allicd forces of
 Guatemala San Salvador and Honduras
 on the city of Granada
 on the 19th Octobcr 1856
 the plunder burning of hou
 ses and murder ofall Americans
 was proclaimed Many fell victims
 among them two preachers of
 the Gospel a young cliiid
 of Mr Sinith of New
 York Mr Lawless a merchant
 and others The legation house
 over which the American flag
 waved where the wives or
 Americans had fled fOt satety
 was assaulted i he house
 being strongly barricaded resisted the
 attack while a severe active
 and destructive fire from a
 few of the Nicaraauan army
 was very fatal to the
 assail ants Had they succeeded
 in effecting an entrance no
 age sex or condition could
 have escaped The door was
 per törated with balls and
 the fiag riddled by their
 shots Col onei Wheeler though
 prostrated by sickness was enabled
 to preserve quiet among his
 numerous guests and discoun tenanced
 every offensive effort except in
 self preservation On his leaving
 Granada his house was destroyed
 all bis furniture stores and
 library were burnt up entailing
 a loss of more than
 two thousand dollars to the
 knowledge of this amant The
 health of Colonel Wheeler by
 the diseases of this climate
 and exposure of his position
 completely failed and I was
 compelled to accompany him home
 This is not the whole
 of the evidence in the
 case The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question is Shall the bill
 pass Mr HALE 1 am
 not willing that it shall
 do not want to interpose
 any factious opposition to this
 bill but Ido not want
 to introduce a new principle
 here If it is by
 the law of nations or
 by public law the duty
 of the Government to protect
 private property of its minister
 I am willing to go
 to that extent in this
 case I under stand the
 chairman of the Committee on
 Foreign Relations not to affrm
 that to be the case
 But sir it will lead
 to another thing Is not
 the Gov ernment bound to
 protect all its citizens just
 ex actly as much as
 it is bound to protect
 its public ministers and their
 property There were min isters
 of the Gospel there This
 was a minister plenipotentiary Can
 there be a discrimination made
 between ministers plenipotentiary and min
 isters of the Gospel between
 ministers of State ånd ministers
 of religion If thiS sum
 is due this gentleman now
 according to the practice of
 the Government I am willing
 to pay it but if
 it is not I am
 not willing I do not
 want anew prin ciple in
 this Government nor an invidious
 distinc tion introduced I will
 state further I remember that
 within a year or two
 I do not Mow but
 it was a year wo
 a very keen and very
 int0rcsting discussion occurred here between
 the venerable Senator from Rhode
 Island Mr SIMMONS and a
 Senator from Georgia not now
 on the floor Mr TOOMBS
 in relation to this subiect
 of exchanges I do not
 remember what the facts elicited
 at that time were but
 I know there was a
 good deal of discussion as
 to what the duty of
 Government to its foreign ministers
 was in relation to this
 very question of exchange whether
 they were obli yed to
 meet all that loss or
 whether a portion or any
 part of it should fall
 upon the minister and whether
 that was taken into consideration
 in paying him his salary
 The venerable Senator from Rhode
 Island of course I give
 way when he gets up
 and shall be glad to
 hear him on the subject
 Mr SIMMONS 1 was paying
 no attention to this subject
 but I will state that
 there wras a report made
 by the Secretary of the
 Treasury Mr Guthrie some five
 or six years ao o
 making bitter complaints in relation
 to this enormous charge for
 exchanges and when on another
 sub iect at one time
 ventured to allude to the
 ex change paid to ministers
 and consuls at China which
 was about two fifths They
 could invest their money at
 three dollars for the Dound
 ster ling and I suppose
 do so to day I
 le last time I saw
 a quotation it was at
 six and seven That was
 within a penny of what
 it was then I never
 believed they were entitled to
 it but there was a
 Senator sitting near me then
 who had a particular friend
 in China and whose salary
 I understood afterwards was promised
 to be raised but the
 did not raise it and
 he concluded to hold on
 to this exchangc to make
 the salary good That is
 ait as far as that
 subject went Mr HALE The
 honorable Senator from Rhode Island
 says he was not in
 his place and does not
 know exactly the position in
 which the i question of
 exchange has presented itself and
 if I may be allowed
 a pnoment or two I
 will state I it to
 him This is a bill
 to remunerate the min istcr
 at Nicaragua for exchange on
 London He was paid some
 14 000 in drafts and
 I think the bill proposes
 to pay him between two
 and three thousand dollars for
 exchange Mr TRUMBULL Two thousand
 dred dollars Mr HALE Two
 thousand ninc hundred exchange on
 14 000 of drafts on
 London Mr SIMMONS Did hc
 draw the drafts for his
 pay on London That is
 very strange that he should
 go to London to get
 his pay when he I
 would not pay it was
 so much nearer home that
 is all I can say
 1861 as that and I
 am glad of it but
 therc is no such ill
 state in regard to the
 item for löss of property
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 557 Mr
 HALE 1 take issue there
 Mr GREEN They would pay
 forthat What respect will be
 shown to any of your
 foreign min isters if by
 revolutionary action or governmenüxl I
 action you permit their houses
 to be pillaged at pleasure
 What sort of a Government
 will we be and what
 sort of representatives can we
 have subject to be imposed
 upon insulted and pil laged
 at the pleasure of any
 Government If that Government receives
 your minister that Gov ernment
 receives your minister under the
 guaran tees of international law
 and the minister s house
 is to be sacred If
 the Government does wrong our
 Government must hold it to
 a proper account ability and
 responsibility and if it fails
 to do it it must
 still protect the minister and
 make good what it failed
 to exact from the other
 Government I On the other
 point about this exchange that
 has been settled The Attorney
 General gave an opinion upon
 that not long since and
 the Gov ernment has been
 acting upon it all the
 time MT hen a minister
 goes abroad the insteuctions generally
 say to him You may
 draw on the Sec rotary
 of State for your quarter
 s salary or you rnay
 draw on London or some
 place where the Secretary of
 State has made arrangements to
 meet these drafts If you
 get a prerfiium you have
 to pay it into the
 Treasury if you sustain a
 loss the Treasury is to
 make it up to you
 This is the uniform practice
 of the Government and if
 you will go to the
 accounts of i h Robert
 C Schenck from Brazil you
 will find that he sustained
 a heavy discount and that
 the Government made it up
 to Mr HALE And a
 great deal more besides IVIr
 GREEN That was on adifferentaccount
 for a new mission up
 the Paraguay I understand It
 depends upon the instructions of
 the Secretary of State as
 to the point where a
 minis ter but wherever he
 sustains a loss the Government
 always makes it up If
 he gets a oremium the
 Govcrnmcnt always deducts that premium
 II is equitable it is
 fair and it is just
 Mr HALE Mr President 1
 am obliged to the Senator
 from Missouri for the information
 he gives me but I
 am not convinced I do
 not un derstand the principle
 of public law to be
 what he states it to
 be He says that the
 flag protects the minister s
 house just as much as
 if it was in the
 city of Washington am not
 going to con trovert that
 but I deny utterly the
 other posi tion that the
 Government is bound to protect
 the property of its citizens
 in the city of Washington
 or anywhere else when it
 is destroyed by a pub
 lic enemy The only principle
 that this Govern ment has
 ever acted on upon that
 point sincc I have been
 a member of this body
 is this that where property
 is destroyed because of or
 on account of its usc
 by the forces of the
 country then it shall be
 paid fbr For instance if
 the army goes and takes
 possession of a man s
 dwell ing house and soldiers
 are quartered in it or
 mu nitions of var are
 deposited there and in conse
 qucnee of such occupation of
 it the cncmy destroy it
 then the Government pays for
 it That is just as
 far as they ever have
 gone and I think that
 the citizens of northwestern New
 York who lived at Buffalo
 and a great many other
 places on the northwestern frontier
 during the last war with
 Great Britain know very well
 that that is the extent
 to which the Government has
 gone Mr GREEN Let me
 ask the Senator a ques
 tion Mr HALE Certainly Mr
 GREEN Was this a public
 oncmy of the United States
 Was it at x var
 with the United States Was
 Nicara nÄa at war with
 the United States I ask
 further if the city of
 Baltimore tears down the housc
 of Mr Revcrdy Johnson is
 not that corporation bound to
 pay for it and has
 it Mr GREEN There no
 one single not done it
 ple of international law more
 firmly and expli Mr HALE
 1 will tell you If
 the citly fixed and understood
 than this that the domicile
 of the minister constitutes by
 relation a i ture of
 Maryland passes a law requiring
 them to part of the
 domain of the nation from
 which he do it thcyare
 bound butifthcrc isno such statute
 It necessarily results that thcrc
 is an im I as
 that they are not bound
 I tried to get Con
 hails munity and the mere
 fact that there is a
 flag staff gress to recognize
 t hat doctrine by a
 bill which reading föt ihe
 purpose of offering an amendment
 cept the local law s
 adopted by the States Mr
 CLINGMAN Will the sen _
 ator allow me to refer
 to a precedent not unlike
 this Mr HALE Certainly Mr
 CLINGMAN Some years ago citizens
 of New Orleans destroyed the
 property Of the Spanish consul
 and some other Spamsh subjecte
 residing there This Government made
 redress to Spain paid for
 all the property destroyed In
 the case now before us
 which was no_t very unlike
 that there was a civil
 war prevailing in Nicaragua That
 country was not at war
 with the United States If
 Nicaragua had been at war
 with the United States the
 case would have been like
 that which the Senator cites
 as having occurred during the
 war with Great Britain on
 the Canada side but there
 was no war with Nicaragua
 and nevertheless this injury was
 sustained by anu American citizen
 We had good cause Qf
 com pkaint against that Government
 but having failed to obtain
 redress from it I think
 it is now our duty
 to make compensation I know
 it has been done in
 some cases during my time
 in Congress Where we have
 had a claim against a
 foreign Gov ernment for an
 accidental or other injury to
 our citizens and have demanded
 redress we have in some
 instances paid the claims ourselves
 I think perhaps the case
 of the brig General Armstrong
 was not unlike it where
 we had a claim against
 Portugal and because we lost
 it as was alleged by
 reason of the reference of
 it to the French Em
 peror this Government was called
 upon and did pay a
 considerable bill L Oh no
 P Mr FESSENDEN It went
 to the Court of Claims
 and the court said they
 had no claim at all
 Mr CLINGMAN That at least
 illustrates this distinction It was
 there contended that as the
 Government had acted honestly and
 fairly and endeavored to get
 the money in that case
 it was not bound to
 do anything more It had
 the claim arbitrated and the
 decision was against us and
 that it was said released
 us That was the ground
 I know on which it
 was resisted by my self
 and others There is no
 such state of facts here
 The case simply is that
 in the civil wars in
 Nicaraøua the property of our
 minister was de stroycd by
 those who were in fact
 acting under the authority of
 the Government If Nicaragua had
 been at war with the
 United States and we had
 been at war with her
 and property had been de
 stroyed the principle would apply
 which says that when thc
 Government has gone to war
 and done ali it can
 to protect the citizen and
 failed it will not make
 redress but nothing of the
 sort occurred there was not
 a war between the Uni
 ted Statcsand Nicaragua and therefore
 this stands on the same
 footing With the case that
 I ref erred to at
 New rlcans where citizens destroyed
 the property of the Spanish
 consul and we made compensation
 I think this is an
 equitable claim Mr HALE If
 the Government of Spain had
 made remuncration it would be
 analogous to this case but
 as it was not Spain
 but this Govern mcnt that
 made it on a principle
 of comity feeling bound in
 honor to do it it
 is exactly different from If
 this were an appeal made
 by the this case honorable
 Senator to the Government of
 Nica ragua the casc hc
 cites would bé a casc
 in point exactly But sir
 i do not want to
 dis_c uss the question any
 longer and I am not
 going to do so i
 move to strue out this
 clause leaving it as a
 matter of future consideration and
 then he can have his
 exchange and everything else so
 far as I am concerned
 and if it shall turn
 out that this clause can
 be sustained on principle and
 prece dent I will go
 for it otherwise not I
 move to strike out that
 part of the bill providing
 for prop erty destroycd The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The bill being
 on its passage the Senator
 must move to recon sider
 the vote ordering it to
 a third reading before an
 amendment can be entertained Mr
 HALE Then I move to
 reconsider the vote ordering the
 bill to be engrossed for
 a third I introduced into
 the Senate years ago and
 I tried and a flag
 with the stars and stripes
 floating from the whole session
 but could not get the
 Senate to it makes it
 a part of the United
 States and it is as
 much the duty of the
 United States to protect consider
 it That is nota principle
 of national law the property
 thus situated as if it
 were in the city il
 it is not a principle
 of public law nor of
 the com mon law nor
 ofany other law except tbe
 particu of Mr HALE But
 they would not pay for
 it if lap local statute
 Maryland has made such a
 law the public enemy destroyÖd
 it principle of public law
 or of any other law
 ex Mr GREEN They would
 pay for it Mr MASON
 The object of the Senator
 1 understand is to strike
 from the bill so muCh
 as allows compensation for the
 loss of property Mr HALE
 Yes sir II Mr MASON
 The committee in their report
 third item should also be
 aliowed Or it i Qbvi
 558 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 25 ously theduty of Government
 to protect its public offcers
 engaged in its service in
 the fu and unrestrained enjoy
 ment of all their personat
 and property rights at least
 against all acts of public
 törce while so engaged and
 on failure to do so
 to make good any losses
 he may have sus The
 Senator asks if there is
 any principle of public law
 which devolves upon this Government
 the duty of that payment
 I suppose he means by
 public law the law of
 nations Welli the law of
 nations is no written law
 at all There are no
 statutes passed byr nations to
 regulate tb eir inter course
 The law of nations consists
 of nothing but the usaoes
 that have grown up between
 na tions in then international
 intercourse which by comity from
 the intercourse among civilized na
 tions is caned law The
 position of a foreign minister
 in the Government to which
 he is ac credited is
 a position recognized by the
 public law or law of
 nations and Ins privileges and
 immu nities which are very
 great are accorded to him
 by this public law as
 it is called but the
 relations which subsist between him
 and his Government I doubt
 are not regulated by public
 law at all not that
 the public law and the
 municipal law of the nation
 to which the minister is
 accredited if it is a
 civilized nation and capable of
 making its authority respected would
 remunerate any min ister who
 had his property destroyed or
 his per son injured by
 a force greater than the
 Govern ment could overcome far
 molie if he had incurred
 those losses by any act
 of the Government in a
 revolutionary or insurgent condition to
 which he was accredited But
 the relations between him self
 and his own Government are
 not regulated by any public
 law and the committee did
 not put it upon that
 ground but the committee placed
 it upon the ground of
 policy and public justice as
 a duty which in then
 judgment devolved upon the Government
 sending a minister abroad and
 subjecting him to the incidents
 that pertain to a foreign
 residence when he is under
 the immediate protection of his
 Government The committee considered that
 there is a duty devolving
 upon the Govcrnmcnt to protect
 their minister first be cause
 he is a public functionary
 and secondly because that public
 functionary is sent by the
 act of the Government under
 the protection o the Government
 and subjected to the perils
 of his mission My own
 judgment is very clear that
 when it is shown that
 he sustained these losses by
 insurrection or by Government power
 or by a revolution which
 the Governmeht was not able
 to quell although this Government
 would have a reclamation against
 the Government yet the duty
 devolves immediately on this Gov
 ernment to make the loss
 good That was the belief
 of the committee when they
 reported the Then ag to
 the next item the claim
 for the loss of exchange
 therc is a report made
 by the ac counting officer
 Murray McConnell the Fifth Auditor
 which places it upon its
 true ground The Fifth Auditor
 states what is the universal
 ractice of the Governmcnt never
 doubted that I know of
 The Government engages to pay
 the minister his salary in
 the country to which I
 re is t hat is
 to say the salary of
 this minister sent probably was
 do not remember its amount
 but the law provided the
 salary and the Government undertook
 of course to pay him
 that 7 000 a year
 in the country where he
 was Mr HALÉ Understand I
 do not object to Mr
 MASON Other Senators I think
 did 0b ect JMr TRUMBULL
 The Senator from Vir ginia
 will allow me to ask
 him a question right there
 Why the necessity of coming
 to Congress if that is
 the practice of the Department
 Mr MASON I will show
 the Senator from the reportoftheAuditor
 the necessity for it That
 has been the uniform practice
 of the Government nevcr departed
 from The Government thus un
 dertook to pay this gentleman
 s salary say 7 000
 in Nicaragua The Auditor in
 speaking of why it was
 not allowed says that The
 Government was bound to pay
 Mr Wheeler in Nicaragua one
 hundred cents to the dollar
 United States coin but as
 tbe Government sent no money
 to Nicara rua to pay
 his salary and expenses he
 was forced to sell his
 drafts there and take such
 money and at suet price
 as he could If he
 had refused to take eight
 United States dimes get EO
 Ibe dollar he would have
 been forced to take a
 Nieu raguan dollar which would
 only have been Worth seventy
 Bix cents and thus his
 loss wou d haye been
 twenty four ceRts to ciie
 doilar The Auditor goes on
 to say Mr Wheeler was
 authorized to draw upon Baring
 Brothers of London for his
 salary and of course to
 get his money he was
 forced to sell his drafts
 in Nicaragua for the highest
 price he could get Those
 drafts were nomi nally wortli
 par in that country and
 were not selling at a
 discount but to enable him
 to sell his drafts at
 par he was tOrced to
 take the currency of that
 country also at par This
 currency was composed of two
 kinds one kind was a
 coin passing currently in Nicaragua
 caned adonar which contained thirty
 three per cent alloy and
 sixty seven per cent of
 pure silver compared with the
 United States coin and consequently
 a dollar oc that currency
 was only worth commercially seventy
 six cents The other currency
 of that country consisted of
 United States ten cent pieces
 eight of which was of
 greater intrinsic vatue than a
 local dollar of that country
 and thus by common consént
 eight It appeared that United
 States dimes passed Or a
 dollar Mr Wheeler sold his
 drafts at par but to
 do so was forced to
 and did take eight dimes
 or eighty cents United States
 coin for each dollar of
 his drafts thus losing upon
 each dollar drawn for twenty
 cents The Auditor goes on
 to say admitting the duty
 of the Govermnent to pay
 a hundred cents for each
 dollar of the minister s
 salary in Nicaragua when he
 was allowed to draw on
 Baring Brothers if he sold
 his drafts at par as
 he did but was obliged
 to take in payment the
 local currency which was only
 seventy six cents in the
 dollar if he took the
 dollar of Nicaragua or eighty
 cents in the dollar if
 he took the United States
 dimes he was forced to
 do so and the Government
 hav ing failed to send
 money there the Auditor says
 that according to the usage
 of the Department they treated
 that as a loss of
 exchange and where he sold
 his drafts upon London they
 allowed it But it is
 further shown in the report
 that during the first year
 the drafts of Mr Wheeler
 were drawn on Messrs Baring
 Brothers of London and subsequently
 by instructions of the State
 Department the place of payment
 was made at the Treasury
 Department and then Mr Wheeler
 drew upon the United States
 and he suffered no loss
 of exchange but he suffered
 exactly the loss which he
 had suffered when he drew
 upon Lon don to wit
 that he was obliged to
 take eighty cents on the
 dollar The Auditor however upon
 thb strict technicalities of his
 office says thus he was
 allowed twenty per cent loss
 of exchange on all his
 drafts sold in that country
 Nicaragua but on all his
 drafts drawn and sold on
 the Uni ted States he
 was not allowed any loss
 sulted the same way to
 Mr Wheeler that he lost
 twenty cents on the dollar
 not as exchange but because
 of the condition of the
 currency of the country to
 which he was accredited and
 the fail ure of the
 United States to do what
 the United Stnt es always
 undertake to do to pay
 the money to the minister
 in the country to which
 he is accredited I will
 not detain the Senate longer
 and I trust the motion
 being to strike out the
 payment for the loss of
 his property that the report
 of the committee will be
 sustained as to the duty
 of the United States to
 make that loss good The
 United States can reclaim it
 again if they think proper
 from the Government of Nicaragua
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on reconsidering the vote
 by which the bill was
 ordered to a third reading
 The question being put there
 were on a di vision
 ayes 16 noes 14 no
 quorum voting Mr TRUMBULL 1
 think there is a quorum
 here and I hope we
 shall have a recount as
 many l he motion is
 only to Senators did not
 vote reconsider for the purpose
 of offering an amend mcnt
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Another count
 is called for and the
 Chair will again put the
 question The motion to reconsider
 was agreed to ayes 19
 noes 17 Mr HALE Now
 I move to amend by
 striking out the item of
 2 000 for loss of
 property and I will state
 in about a minute and
 a half the reason I
 agree entirely with the Senator
 why I do it from
 Virginia that tho Government are
 bound to protect their ministers
 and bound to protect their
 property but I cro further
 than that and say they
 are equally i ound to
 protect every citizen that is
 there on lawful business just
 exactly as much as they
 are the minister and if
 you sanc tion this principle
 of paying for the property
 of a minister destroyed by
 a mob or an army
 i say it is utterly
 impossible to put your finger
 on any ground that will
 deter you from niaking the
 same I compensation to a
 citizen when he is there
 pur II suing lawful commerce
 The Government are bound to
 protect them alike and I
 think this will be introducing
 a novel principle and it
 is for that reason that
 i move to strike It
 out am willing that the
 rest shall be paid and
 if at any subse quent
 time it can be shown
 that there is any prin
 ciple of public law sanctioning
 it Mr FESSENDEN There is
 and there is a distinction
 Mr HALE I wish Senators
 would show wherein I am
 wrong Mr lmerelysay this if
 we send a man abroad
 aid accredit him to a
 for eign Government he is
 our agent on our business
 and maintains a very peculiar
 relation to us and I
 think we are bound to
 see that he is protected
 do not know in in
 all his rights as our
 agent regard to this particular
 case and I am only
 speak ing of the distinction
 in point of principle If
 on the contrary one of
 our citizens goes abroad upon
 his own business and establishes
 himself he takes I suppose
 common luck with other people
 who are about him and
 can expect no better than
 they have He subjects himself
 to foreign laws and he
 is no better off than
 a citizen of the place
 where he is not more
 particularly entitled to our protection
 if he chooses to put
 him self outside of it
 have never agreed to that
 but with regard to our
 minister I think he stands
 on an entirely different footing
 How far under the obligations
 of national law we are
 compelled to sustain him because
 he is our minist er
 is a dif ferent question
 but I think there is
 a manifest difference between the
 two cases The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question is on the
 amendment of the Senator from
 New Hampshire to strike out
 in lines eight and nine
 the words for property destroyed
 at Granada Mr TRUMBULL Will
 it not be necessary and
 insert three to strike out
 five thousand thousand Mr MASON
 That should be part of
 the amendment The amount is
 5 715 20 and the
 proposition of the Senator should
 include a motion to strike
 out five and insert three
 IVIu HALE very well Mr
 MASON lhope it will not
 be done Mr HALE I
 hope it will The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Does the Sen ator
 from New Hatnpshire modify his
 amendment as suggested by the
 Senator from Virginia Mr HALE
 Yes sir Mr TRUMBULL am
 inclined to think upon reflection
 that assuming the bona fides
 of this it is a
 fair transaction and I have
 no right I suppose that
 the Committee on to impeach
 it mreign Relations have examined
 into the ques tion and
 I am inclined to think
 it would be proper to
 pay for the destruction of
 that property Several SENATORS He
 came home Mr TRUMBULL His
 coming home did not alter
 it at all because he
 was called home tempo rarily
 and then was superseded in
 some way Mr MASON The
 Senatorwill allow me He was
 called buck for consultation as
 to the con dition of
 that country Everybody knows its
 unsettled condition While he was
 here the minis ter the
 country continued in that unsettled
 con dition and there was
 in fact no Government and
 the President thought it best
 to discontinue the mission He
 was herc four or five
 months Mr TRUMBULL That does
 not alter the fact at
 all Mr MASON Certainly not
 Mr TRUMBULL he sup posed
 temporarily and not with a
 view to leave the country
 and left his property there
 and if I that was
 destroyed I think it ought
 to be paid for by
 somebody and although we certainly
 have a claim upon that
 Government for it it is
 pretty hard perhaps to turn
 the individual overto that Government
 Mr BAYARD Mr President 1
 do not know that I
 understand distinctly the character of
 the present amendment but as
 I understand it I confess
 that 1 have some doubts
 in regard to it The
 proposition is to strike out
 2 000 which it is
 proposed in the bill to
 allow to Mr Wheeler for
 property destroyed in Nicaragua while
 he was the American minister
 there Iihe inclination of my
 mind is though the subject
 is one which I have
 not referred to for some
 time and I do npt
 that there speak upon it
 with perfect confidence is a
 broad distinction between the duty
 of a Gov ernment as
 regards the protection which it
 owes 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 559 to its minister or
 agent resident in a foreign
 coun try and to the
 citizen who goes there of
 his own volition The duty
 of protection to the minister
 it seems to me is
 absolute in all cases He
 is there repre senting the
 sovereignty of his country He
 is there as your agent
 The insult is to the
 nation the wrong is to
 the nation It is just
 cause of war if Alis
 property is despoiled in a
 foreign country while hc is
 nunister His person is protected
 by all nations under general
 principles of interna tional law
 He is exeml ed even
 from the con sequences of
 crime committed in a foreign
 juris diction as personal to
 himself because he stands as
 the representative of the country
 and surely standing in that
 relation he is entitled to
 the full measure of protection
 In one sense you tnay
 say that it is his
 own volition that hc is
 there but it is at
 vour command and as your
 aoent that he goes There
 must be greater sanctity therefore
 in this relation and a
 greater obligation in the Government
 to protect the minister while
 there on its own account
 on account of the dignity
 and character of the nation
 than it can possibly owe
 to every citizen that goes
 abroad merely on his own
 volition for the transaction of
 his own pri vate business
 The duty of Ibe Government
 is to protect him abroad
 to enforce his rights no
 doubt but that duty cannot
 go to the extent of
 I involving the country in
 war or at all hazards
 redressing him if the Government
 is unable to obtain redress
 from the Government which inflicts
 the injury But as regards
 the public Illinister I think
 it is That is my
 present impression I speak not
 with certainty think that the
 usages of natiohs that the
 precedents of nations woåtd show
 that in alk cases where
 a foreicyn minister I representing
 his Government in another country
 has his property despoiled in
 that country you have the
 undoubted ri rhtofreclamation upon that
 Government for his person and
 his property ought to be
 sacred in their eycs They
 are bound to protect him
 because he stands there as
 the rep resentative of the
 United States of America sovereignty
 is represented in his person
 and if I that be
 so then it seems to
 me you unquestion ably in
 an cases of that kind
 ought to remunerate your minister
 and look to the föreicn
 country for redress because when
 hc is there in his
 person you are there I
 may be mis That is
 the view I take of
 it taken but I tl
 iinlc that is the general
 principle of law as applied
 to the usages of nations
 therefore disposed to vote acainst
 a motion to strike out
 that part of the bill
 but f confess that there
 are parts of this bill
 w hicll strike me with
 surprise although the evidence may
 be all cor am unable
 to understan l on what
 prin rect ciple it could
 be if the currency of
 Nicaratyua was so depreciated as
 to occasion a loss to
 t hc party there eight
 dimes passing fora dollar that
 a bill of the United
 States minister on Bt u
 ing Brothers cannot understand would
 not sell above par it
 seems to me the depreciation
 of the it rency there
 would necessarily cause thc bill
 to command a premium when
 it was drawn upon a
 I can I country where
 the currency was higher not
 understand the transaction though it
 appears that the testimony certifies
 the fact but it is
 con trary to all the
 ordinary results in such cases
 The amendment was rejected there
 bein r on a division

 was ordered to be for
 a third reading and was
 read the third tilYIQ Anderson
 late acting chargé d affaires
 of the Uni ted States
 at Paris 1 657 6
 the amount of the between
 the salary received by him
 as secretary of legation at
 Paris from April 1 to
 November 29 1837 and that
 ailowed to a chargé d
 affaires Mr HALE That is
 outlawed It is twenty three
 years old Read thc report
 The Secretary read the report
 from which it appears that
 Mr Anderson was appointed secre
 tar y of tbc legation
 of the United States at
 Paris in 1836 under General
 Cass our minister at that
 Court that in March 1837
 on the departure of the
 minister for the Mediterranean and
 the Holy Land hc was
 presented to the Court of
 Louis Philippe as chargé d
 affaircs of the United StateS
 ad interim and that from
 that time till the return
 of General Cass to his
 post a period of eight
 or ninc months the entire
 duties responsi bilities and expenses
 of Ahe legation devolved upon
 him These statements of the
 memorial are substan tially sustained
 by a letter from the
 Secretary of State dated February
 20 1855 which says appears
 from the records and files
 of this Depart mcnt that
 Mr Anderson acted as chargé
 d affaires of the United
 States at Paris from the
 1st of April until the
 29th of November 1837 Regard
 this claim as being fully
 within the principle kiere tofore
 established in similar cases the
 Committee on Foreign Relations reported
 a bill for the relief
 of the clai nant Mr
 HALL Will chairman tell us
 when this claim was first
 presented It is twenty three
 years old Mr MASON It
 was presented within the last
 three or four years according
 to my recol lection But
 will teli the Senator the
 reason why it was not
 presented before do not know
 the gentleman who is the
 claimant at all He is
 a geiltleman in New York
 I think but it was
 made known to me by
 his friends tl iat durincr
 the timc hc vas rcpresentino
 our country abroad and for
 many years afterwards he was
 i man in very affluent
 circun lstances wh ich subsequent
 misfortunes of one kind or
 another changed and reduced him
 almost to destitution at d
 knowing as I am informed
 by his friends that this
 allow ance was always made
 hc made the claim Mr
 HALE I do not know
 whether it is worth while
 to oppose this bill The
 facts as I under stand
 arc something like these twenty
 three or twenty four years
 acro General Cass wras the
 minister of this country to
 the Government of France Some
 of our national vessels wore
 there and the General took
 a pleasure trip in tbc
 Med i terrancan It was
 highly proper and I do
 not want to be understood
 as throwincr any censure upon
 that But probably as a
 matter of favor to his
 secretary hc let him play
 minister while he wras on
 his tour That is the
 whole of it sir After
 the thing had slumbered over
 t venty years or twoi
 t y years at least
 it wag found out that
 there has been a practice
 of fraying clüi1Y1s of this
 If sort but that practice
 has not been uniform I
 have understood the action of
 the Government the Goverrlrnent have
 set faccs latterly acyainst clanns
 of this sort Why sir
 there is upon your Calendar
 a bill of a similar
 character to compensate your Secretary
 of the Senate Mr Dickens
 for services of precisely similar
 charac tcr and thcu e
 is a report of thc
 Court of Claims but the
 Government have refused in favor
 of it I do not
 mean while he was forei
 rn to pay it minister
 but while hc was clerk
 in the office of Mr
 FOSTER I ask for the
 yeas and nays onc of
 the Departments he discharged the
 duties by recent statUte The
 secretary of legation wag allowed
 a salary of 2 000
 the charge d affai es
 was allowed a salary of
 4 000 and Ahe pi
 actiee has been svhere the
 secretary was appointeachargé d affaires
 ad interim and was aceredited
 too the court to discharge
 the duties of such to
 ailow him the salary of
 chargé d affaires for the
 time he per formed those
 duties deducting from it his
 2 000 Mr HALE And
 deducting the excess from the
 salary of the minister Mr
 MASON Not that I am
 aware of I presume not
 Mr HALE It ought to
 be Mr MASON Now this
 letter of the Secre tary
 of State says It appears
 from the recåds and files
 of this Department that Mr
 Anderson acted as chargé d
 affaires of the United States
 at Paris from thc 1st
 of April until the 29th
 of No veniber 1837 Tbc
 reason for it IS very
 manifest A secre tary of
 legation has no position Whatever
 in the country to which
 a minister is accredited He
 holds no intercourse with the
 Government and is subject to
 no heavy expenses in consequence
 of his place there but
 a chargé d affaires is
 in a very different position
 The records of the Depart
 ment are full of instances
 of necessary expenses devolved on
 him which in the humbler
 character of secretary he would
 not have to meet and
 it has always been usual
 with the Government to allow
 Mr HALE This repoi t
 does not state that he
 was appointed by the Government
 and I do not think
 he was but was presented
 by General Cass a mere
 complimentary thing undoubtedly The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question is on
 the passage of the bill
 The question being put there

 to the State of Georgia
 or its lawfully authorized agent
 the sum of 35 555
 42 with interest upon the
 sum of 22 222 22
 from the 1st of January
 1858 so far as the
 State of Georgia has paid
 or lost that interest this
 payment being for moneys paid
 by Georgia to Peter Trezvant
 on account of supplies purchased
 by the agents of Georgia
 of Robert Farquhar for the
 troops of Georgia in 1777
 then quartered near Savannah in
 a state of great des
 titution under the command of
 Generat James Jackson Mr KING
 Is there u report accompanying
 the bill The PRESIDING OFFICER
 There is Is the reading
 of the report called for
 Mr KING Yes sir Mr
 GRIMES Let the bill lie
 over Mr KING I have
 no objection to that but
 if the bill is to
 be considered I should like
 to hear the report Mr
 IVERSON If the Senator will
 allow me I can make
 a very brief explanation of
 the case During the revolutionary
 war the continental troops then
 besieging Savannah Savannah then being
 in the posscssion of the
 British Govern ment were in
 a great state of destitution
 and by an order of
 the Governor of Georgia the
 com missary or quartermaster general
 of that State was authorized
 to purchase supplies for those
 troops Under that authority he
 entered into a contract with
 Robert Farquhar who was a
 Scotch merchant residiifg in the
 city of Charleston and he
 purchased from Robert Farquhar a
 large num ber of supplies
 consisting of provisions and cloth
 ing for the troops then
 stationed near Savannah under the
 command of General James Jackson
 af terwardsGovernorofthatState After the war
 was ended Farquhar presented his
 clailik to the State of
 Georgia A difficulty occurred and
 he brought his action in
 the Federal courts against the
 State of Georgia PendinR that
 action in the Federal courts
 the State of Georgia passed
 a joint reso lilt ion
 pledging itself to pay the
 judgment that might be recovered
 if any should be recovered
 in the action The case
 finally went to the Su
 preme Court of the Un
 ited States as every lawyer
 will remember the casc of
 Chisholm executor of i Farquhar
 against the State of Georgia
 and the question as to
 the jurisdiction of the Supreme
 Court to bring a sovereign
 State before the Fed eral
 tribunal was there debated at
 great length and decided by
 the Supreme Court in favor
 of the jurisdiction of the
 court and judgment against the
 State of Georgia was affrmed
 That case as Senators will
 remember gave rise to the
 eleventh amendment of the Constitution
 After this judgment however the
 State of Geor gia still
 declined to pay the debt
 She however under a resolution
 issued certificates to Robert Farquhar
 or the executor of Farquhar
 for the amount of this
 claim what were called Govern
 ment certificates I think in
 sums of 1 000 each
 Some of them were taken
 up others remained unpaid until
 a very late period Within
 the last ten years the
 State of Georgia by a
 bill agreed to pay the
 balance of that claim and
 paid to this man Trezvant
 the subsequent executor of Far
 quhar Chisholm having died the
 whole amount of the claim
 The evidence shown among the
 papers is that the State
 has paid the claim and
 at the time of payment
 it amounted to 35 000
 or about that sum The
 State of Georgia paid the
 claim in bonds running up
 to ten years She has
 not entered a claim against
 the Federal Govern ment until
 she paid the last of
 the bonds All the bonds
 have been extinguished with interest
 and now she comes upon
 the Federal Government or did
 come upon the Federal Government
 at the last session and
 asked that this amount be
 re funded back to her
 That is the dimple state
 ment of the case Mr
 KING There is considerable disturbance
 and irregulai ity in the
 State of Georgia I under
 stand and there might be
 some difficulty in de termining
 to whom this money should
 be paid I think this
 proposition had better lie over
 1 move that it be
 postponed Mr IVERSON I have
 not a word to say
 on that subject It is
 for the Senate to say
 whether they will acknowledge this
 debt and pay it to
 the State of Georgia or
 not I do not know
 that the circumstances under which
 the State of Georgia is
 now placed make any difference
 whatever as to the obligation
 of the Federal Government to
 pay but if the Senator
 and Senators on the other
 side think that makes a
 difference the State of Georgia
 does not comc here to
 beg for the money The

 PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED BY
 JOHN C RIVES WASHINGTON D
 r C THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS
 2D SESSION todian of the
 public property at Erie Pennsyl
 vania from April 8 1857
 to December 16 1858 inclusive
 From the report which was
 read it appears that in
 1853 the memorialist was appointed
 local acent and engineer for
 the improvement of the harbor
 at Eric Pennsylvania at a
 compensation of 120 per month
 by Colonel Abert corps topo
 graphical engineers with the approval
 of the Sec retary of
 War When the appropriation for
 the work became so far
 exhausted as to render it
 necessary to suspend operations Mr
 Lints was continued in service
 as custodian of the public
 property pertaining to the harbor
 at a reduced compensation of
 two dollars per day He
 now claims 1 236 compensation
 for his services as custodian
 from the 8th of April
 1857 to the 16th December
 1858 inclusive no part of
 which he avers has ever
 been paid him The correct
 ness of the account is
 admitted by the omcer in
 charge of har bor improvements
 on the lakes but an
 offset is made to the
 amount of 815 14 being
 the value of a certain
 amount of timber which dis
 appeared or was lost whilst
 in charge of Mr Lin
 ts The memorialist prays that
 this shall not be charged
 against him inasmuch as the
 timber was carried away and
 lost by storms in part
 and in part was stolen
 neither of which he was
 able to control He received
 no pay after the 8th
 of April 1857 because the
 appropriation for the im provement
 of the harbor at Erie
 had been ex hausted previous
 to that date Mr BURNETT
 1 would inquire whether there
 is any communication from the
 Department in reference to this
 claim The SPEAKER Nothing has
 been presented to the House
 Mr BABBITT 1 to state
 that this claim underwent the
 investigation of the committee of
 the Senate and passed the
 Senate upon their re port
 The claim has also undergone
 an investi gation of the
 Committee on Naval Affairs of
 the House It passed both
 committees unanimously Mr BURNETT 1
 think in cases of this
 character where a party has
 been acting under the authority
 of any one Department of
 this Govern ment there ought
 always to bc furnished from
 that Department a letter showing
 the character of the service
 and the reason why the
 Department could not audit and
 pay the account Mr BABBITT
 All these documents were before
 the committee Mr BURNETT must
 object to the request of
 the gentleman and I call
 for the regular order of
 business The SPEAKER The first
 business in order is the
 call of committees for the
 report of bills of a
 private character The SPEAKER then
 proceeded to call the com
 mittees commencing where the call
 last left off TIKEODORE ADAMS
 Mr WALTON from the Committee
 of Claims reported back Court
 of Claims bill No 102
 for the relief of Theodore
 Adams which upon his request
 was ordered to be printed
 and recom mitted to the
 Committee of Claims JONAS P
 I EVY Mr WALTON 1
 am directed by the Com
 mittee of Claims to report
 a ioint resolution for the
 relief of Jonas P Levy
 ana to ask permission to
 put the same upon its
 passage I will state that
 in 1854 the claim was
 reförred to the accounting officers
 of the Treasury for settlement
 and was allowed by the
 First Auditor but disallowed by
 It has since been before
 the First Comptroller the Court
 of Claims and rejected for
 want of cvi dence The
 petitioner alleg s that there
 is evidence MONDAY JANUARY 28
 1861 this same claim wkieh
 was referred to the Com
 mittee on Foreign Affairs and
 receive d no favor before
 that committee I do hot
 know how this bill comes
 now to be reported from
 the Commit I presume that
 it must have been tee
 of Claims reported back from
 the Committee on Foreign Affairs
 and referred to the Committee
 of Claims The claim is
 a very large one indeed
 and has some features about
 it that render it eminently
 proper that it should bc
 carefully considered be tore it
 is passed upon by the
 House If I am not
 mistaken it involves as much
 as 100 000 and probably
 more and under these circumstances
 I move that thc bill
 be referred toa Committee of
 the Whole House Mr WALTON
 1 wish to say that
 had the Committee of Claims
 undertaken to report upon the
 merits of the claim on
 the evidence now in the
 case Suvc should have concurred
 with the Commit tee on
 Foreign Affairs but wc simply
 propose to give him an
 opportunity of producing additional evidence
 which he says is In
 the Departments and which hc
 can produce That is all
 we propose We do not
 allow the claim I understand
 the gentleman Mr BRANCH from
 Vermont to state that this
 claim was before the Committee
 on Foreign Affairs Mr HUTCHINS
 It was Mr BRANCH 1
 hesitation then in saying that
 the bill ought to go
 to a Committee of the
 Whole House on the Private
 Calendar I believe that one
 of the grounds upon which
 thc Comn iitlec on Foreign
 Affairs rejected tho claim was
 that it had been time
 and again rejected by committees
 of this Tlouse and no
 further statc ment l t
 hinlc would be necessary to
 convince the House that it
 would bc improper to put
 the bill on its passage
 without considcration in a Com
 mittee of the Whole House
 Mr PHELPS The resolution under
 consid eration contains an appropriation
 and must ne cessarily go
 to a Committ ce of
 the Whole House I object
 to its considcration now Mr
 WALTON The gentleman is mistaken
 Tho appropriation was made in
 1854 The res olution provides
 for a reéxamination Mr PHELPS
 Let the joint resolution be
 read If I understand it
 it directs the accounts to
 be set tled and paid
 at the Trcasury according to
 the provisions of a certain
 act of Congress therein named

 the joint resoluti0Y1 It requires
 thc accounting offccrs of the

 Jonas P Levy for indemnity

 to the late board of
 commissioners on claims arrainst Mexico
 and that the amount if
 any which said accounting officers
 shall find to be due
 to said Jonas P Levy
 shall be paid to hilli
 as per act of Congress
 of August 3 1854 Mr
 SHERMAN which Mr Whittlesey pronounced
 a fraud after full ex
 amination Mr PHELPS I express
 no opinion in refer ence
 to the claim The SPEAKER
 There is no question that
 the joint resolution contains an
 appropriation and the resolution must
 go to a Conunittee of
 the Whole House and wili
 be printed with the report
 Is the report ordered to
 be Mr BRANCH prin ted
 The SPEAKER Yes sir Mr
 BRANCH I would object to
 its printing I do not
 think that Congress if it
 is not too late ought
 to put the Government to
 any further ex t pcnse
 in examining this claim in
 the Department to sustain the
 claim and the The SPEAKER

 with a recommendation that it

 Arnold Harris and Samuel F

 be put upon its passage
 The bill was read It
 provides that Arnold Harris and
 Samuel F Butterworth sureties of
 William E Kendall late deputy
 postmaster at New Orleans shall
 be released from all claims
 the United States have against
 them or either of them
 as such sureties and it
 directs the Secre tary of
 the Treasury to cause any
 judgment which may have been
 rendered against said parties or
 either of them as sureties
 of said Kendall to be
 canceled and satisfied of record
 as to such sure ties
 or either of them Mr
 PALMER I object to the
 consideration of that bill I
 understand that the Judiciary Com
 mittee had it under consideration
 at the last ses sion
 and reported against it The
 SPEAKER The gentleman from New
 York will understand that this
 is the regular order of
 business and a single objection
 cannot defeat It makes no
 appropriation its consideration I desire
 to explain rvfr CRAIG of
 Missouri the bill in one
 word to the House Mr
 PALMER 1 understand the bill
 does make nn appropriation and
 I ask that it shall
 be I ask further that
 the report made last ses
 read Sion by the Judiciary
 Committee unanimously against the bill
 be also read If I
 am entitled to Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri the floor I
 think I can satisfy the
 gentleman from New York that
 the bill should be passed
 The SPEAKER Let the bill
 bc read so that the
 House may understand it The
 bill was read It releases
 Harris and Butterworth sureties of
 Kendall from all claims which
 the United States may have
 against them or either of
 them as such sureties and
 directs the Secretary of the
 Treasury to cause any judgment
 rendered against Harris and Bu
 tterworth or ei ther of
 them as sureties of said
 Kendall to be can celed
 and satisfied of record If
 tho gentleman Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri from New York will
 now allow me to speak
 for a moment I will
 then yield the floor to
 him This bill was passed
 unanimously or nearly so by
 the Senate last session It
 was reported unani mously from
 the Post Office Committee at
 this i understand that it
 was before the Judi session
 ciary Committee at the last
 session and that that comrnittee
 reported that there was no
 law in ex Istence for
 releasing this judgment They there
 fore as the gentleman states
 reported adversely these parties The
 fact are these Mr Speaker
 became the sureties of the
 postmaster at New Ore leans
 That postmaster was charged with
 embez zlement was indicted and
 removed from office After he
 had been removed these parties
 called at the Post Offce
 Department and demanded to know
 the amount of their liability
 Mr HICKMAN 1 should like
 to make an I desire
 simply to know inquiry of
 the Chair how it happens
 that after this bill was
 properly referred to the Judiciary
 Committee at the last session
 and returned with an adverse
 report it has becn referred
 this session to the Committee
 on the Post Offce and
 Post Roads I wish to
 know whether that is regular
 way of reachirw business of
 this kind I will state
 to the Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri gentleman from Pennsylvania that
 it was referred on motion
 by order of the House
 to the Post Office Committee
 These parties were informed at
 the Post Office Department that
 the defaulting postmastcr at New
 Orleans had madc them liable
 for I believe 11 000
 They paid it in cash
 Afterwards and after the defaulting
 postmaster had absconded from the
 country and taken up his
 abode in Mexico it was
 discovered at the Post Office
 Department that there was a
 further lia bility of about
 six thousand dollars For that
 further liability these patties have
 been sued and judgment recovered
 against them This bill is
 to release the sureties from
 this judgment When I attempted
 to call up this bill
 the other day the gentleman
 from Tennessee Mr THOMAS objected
 to it and I believe
 I am atithorized by that
 gentleman to say that he
 has since investi gated this
 matter and that he not
 only withdraws who reports the
 bill will consent to have
 the report which was made
 unanimously by the Judiciary Committee
 at the last session read
 I will leave the matter
 to the determination of the
 House Otherwise shall feel compelled
 to move that the bifl
 be rereferred to the Judiciary
 Committee Mr CRAIG of Missouri
 I will not object to
 the readingof the report Mr
 COX Let the report that
 was made in favor of
 it in the Senate be
 also read and then both
 sides of the case will
 have been presented Mr PALMER
 I have no objection to
 that Mr THOMAS I desire
 to make one remark The
 gentleman from Missouri Mr CRAIG
 is entirely correct in what
 he says about my opin
 ion I objected to this
 bill the other day not
 be cause I was opposed
 to it for really did
 not know anything about the
 case Being determined however to
 inform myself about it I
 read not only the reports
 but the evidence and I
 came to the conclusion that
 the bill ought to pass
 I shall therefore vote in
 favor of it The report
 of the Senate Committee on
 the Post Office and Post

 read as follows The Comrnittee

 of New rlcans as his
 sureties in the penal sun
 of 60 000 On the
 7th May 1855 Kendall was
 dismissed froin the otice of
 postmaster at New Orleans was
 arrested charged with having robbed
 the n rails was indicted
 tried and acquitted After his
 arrest and before his trial
 his account was stated by
 the Post Oflice Department showing
 a balance hill as postinaster
 at New Orleans of 10
 839 19 l his he
 Kåilcd to pay any account
 was presented to Kendall part
 of it Early in January
 1856 your ynernorialists were called
 upon by the Post Office
 Department to pay up the

 Kendall On the 7th Jan
 uary 1856 your mcmorinlist S
 F Butterworth deposited the United
 States assistant treasurer at New
 York the sutn of 5
 000 to the credit of
 this account on the 19th
 of JanuaYy 1856 he deposited
 in like manner the further
 stnn of 1 950 and
 on the 21st January 1856
 your memo rialist Arnold Harris
 deposited with the Auditor of
 the Post Office Departinentat Washington
 the sum of 3 88919
 being the balance claimed by
 said account to be due
 frotn Kendall as postmaster at
 New Orleans to the United
 States Soon after this Kendall
 was tried by a jury
 at He inxmediately left the
 New Orleans and acquitted United
 States and went to Mexico
 vhere he now resides After
 he had thus lef t
 the IJnited States on the
 18th day of Scptmnber 1856
 your mernorialist Samuel F Butter
 worth received a letter from
 the Auditor of the Post
 Office Dcpartlnent see copy annexed
 informing hirn that in making
 out the account against Kendall
 an error had been and
 that there was still due
 tile Department froin Kendall the
 sum of 5 365 47
 When the account was first
 stated by tho Departlnent showing
 a balance against Kendall of
 f0 839 19 hc Ken
 dall insisted that there was
 no such amount due frotn
 him and that the claim
 was Inade Inerely to present
 him as a dethulter and
 thus prejudice his case bciOre
 the jury Your Inelnorialists not
 doubting his staternents and certain
 of his innocence paid the
 claim without investigation as soon
 as it was presented to
 them and they did this
 to insure Kendall a thir
 trial and because they knew
 that all of his available
 means were required by him
 to prepare for his defense
 but your memorialists listinctly state
 that if the Department had
 at first claimed a balance
 of 16 204 66 as
 due from Kendall they certainly
 would not have paid that
 large stun without investigation and
 legal resistance unless first indemnified
 by Kendall or his relatives
 By direction of the Governnlent
 suit was instituted wrainst Kendall
 whose last known placc of
 residencc was in Missouri and
 your memorialists in the United
 States circuit court of Missouri
 to recover this last clairned
 bal ance of 5 365
 47 process was served at
 the late residence of Kendall
 your memorialists appeared by attorney
 and suffered judgment to be
 obtained against them by default
 Vhe only explanation or rather
 excuse given by the Post
 Office Department for the arave
 error in renderin the first
 account against Kenualk för a
 sun of 5 965 47
 less than was really due
 the Government was the tact
 that the clerk who Inade
 out the account was intemperate
 Your nunnorialists ask the Congress
 o the United States to
 release t hern from the
 payrnent ofthc judgment rendered claim
 of 5 365 47 was
 made known to either of
 your mew moriaiists A farther
 fact your memorialLsts present Kendall
 charged with a high crime
 was vigorously prosecuted extraordinary means
 were used to procure his
 conviction the United States district
 attorney at New Orleans was
 not deelncd equal to tbc
 occasion other distinguished counseE was
 employed who boasted that he
 was to receive a fee
 og 5 000 from the
 Government in the event of
 Kendall s con victim l
 o meet this unjust persecution
 and monstrous proceeding on the
 part of the United States
 Kendall was compelled to expend
 large sums of money to
 retain the ser vices of
 Senator BENJAMIN and other eminent
 lawyers to procure the attendance
 of important witnesses and to
 conduct iris defense to a
 successfdl issue more than his
 life his honor and his
 liberty were involved in the
 con test not a particle
 of proof of guilt was
 produced he was acquitted The
 moneys thus expended by Kendall
 but for the action of
 the Government would have constituted
 a means of paying any
 real balances due from him
 as postmaster By the oppressive
 action of the Covermnent he
 was deörivetL of these means
 Under these circumstances your memo
 rialists submit that his sureties
 ought not to be called
 on to make good the
 moneys thus expended The above
 facts considered your memorialists ask
 such relief as the Congress
 of the United States may
 deem just and proper S
 F BUTTERWORTH ARNOLD HARRIS objection
 but believes the bill ought
 to pass and against thenn
 as above stated and they
 assign as a sufficient Subsequently
 a letter from one of
 the petitioners in reply to
 an inquiry from the committee
 was submitted which is as
 follows NEw YORK March 20
 1858 DEAR SIR A memorial
 from Arnold Harris and Inyself
 as sureties of William G
 Kendall late postmastcr at Nc
 v Orleans has been referred
 to the Committee on the
 Post Office and Post Roads
 of which you are chairman
 We omitted to state in
 that memorial anything in relation
 to the capacity of Mr
 Kendall at the time of
 his acquital to pay or
 secure the amount clainwd as
 due the Post Offce De
 partment from _him It may
 be said that unless we
 can show that Mr Kendall
 could have been forced to
 pay we lost nothing by
 his departure Crotn the country
 I he tact is that
 Mr Kendall possessed a valuable
 property at Biloxi Mississippi represented
 to be worth over twe
 ve thousand dollars which property
 he settled upon his wife
 before he left the country
 and proceedings are now pending
 in the United States circuit
 court in behalf of the
 United States to set aside
 this settlelnent and to subject
 this property to the satisfaction
 of the judgment rendered against
 Kendall r Had we known
 of the existence of this
 large claim against us as
 sureties of Kendall before his
 departure from the country we
 certainly could by the application
 of the sub l rcasury
 I have compelled Mr Kendall
 to apply this property to
 the payment of this clann
 instead of settling it on
 his wife T nere can
 be no doubt ot this
 Mr Kendall would have exhausted
 his own property not only
 hut also that ofhis relatives
 rather than have suffered the
 penalties of the law as
 a defaulter I an with
 great respect vour obedient servant
 SAIVIÜEI F BUTTERWORTH The facts
 alleged by the memorialists are
 sustained upon inquiry l he
 parties appeal to the equity
 of the Government to protect
 thexn from a loss caused
 by the laches of one
 of its When these parties
 became sureties they reasonably looked
 with reliance upon the guards
 which the laws ere ated
 against default of its officials
 for their protection They had
 a right to expect correct
 and accurate accounts to be
 kept by the Government quarterly
 settlements and such prompt resort
 to the vigorous and suffcient
 means o enforcing pavment of
 balances as the sub Treasury
 law pro vided I hey
 had aright also to expect
 early and accurate notice of
 any default that t hey
 might employ the usual means
 of securing themselves frorn damages
 it appears that through the
 fault of the Government no
 matter t rmn what cause
 they were deceived as to
 the amount doe to the
 Government by Mr Kendall and
 were not apprised of a
 different state of the account
 and of a further balance
 claimed until the principal had
 disposed of his property and
 left the jurisdiction of the
 United States If the Government
 had used the proper care
 and diligence his departure would
 have been prevented and in
 ail reason able probability the
 atnount recovered I he Goverrnnent
 It alone could know the
 was the custodian of the
 accounts true state of indebtedness
 the sureties could only know
 through the Governinent When upon
 being iniOr1ned by the Government
 ofthe halance owing they generously
 etune forward and paid the
 amount from their own private
 means they had a right
 to regard their obligation as
 discharged and to discharge their
 minds frotn any further vigi
 ancc in the transactions of
 Mr Kendall I hus by
 the default of the Govermnent
 they have suffered a danlage
 and although the case is
 not one which would secure
 them irnmunity in a court
 of law yet it presents
 a fair case tkfe clemency
 and consideration of the Government
 The comrnittee t hink that
 the Government Inay properly relax
 its strict leaal claim and
 in consideration of the large
 amount already voluntarily paid by
 these sureties and the injury
 caused to them by the
 lach es of its own
 officers re lease them fronn
 further liability They accordingly report
 a bill for the relief
 of the petitioners Mr PALMER
 The report just read is
 one that was made by
 the Post OMce Committee of
 the I now ask for
 the reading of the report
 i Senate of the Judiciary
 Committee of this House made
 at a subsequent date I
 hope the House will give
 its attention to the reading
 of the report After that
 I shall feel it my
 duty to call for the
 yeas and nays on the
 passage of the bill reason
 such request the fact that
 by the action of Mr
 HICKMAN I desire to make
 an inquiry pass at once
 intemperate clerk in tbc Post
 Office Mr PALMER f am
 not disposed to discuss they
 have been dcprivcd of all
 reniedy against ofthe Chair Does
 this matter now come up
 prop lisnlissed the merits of
 the bill now and if

 Mr HICKMAN I understood this
 matter to language surreptitiously smuggled
 as applying have been called
 up some days since to
 any member of the Post

 was objected to then and
 Mr PALMER Oh no did
 not intend to returned It
 is regularly before the House
 apply it to anybody in
 particular I used it be
 The adverse report of the
 Judiciary Committee cause 1 cannot
 find that anybody knows how
 it of last session was
 read came before the Post
 Office Cornmiltee Mr COLFAX I
 wish simply to vindicate the
 Mr CRAIG of Missouri It
 camc rcgularly Post Office Committee
 for the report which it
 has before the committee made
 on this subject I desire
 to state in advance Mr
 PALMER The chairman of the
 com that it was referred
 to the Post Offce Committee
 mittee just stated he did
 not know how it came
 I knew nothing of the
 without my knowledge there bill
 being before the committee until
 it was handed Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE If the gentleman to
 us by our clerk I
 desire also to state that
 I from New York will
 suspend a moment I think
 understand that both these claimants
 differ from a single explanation
 will show how this bill
 has me in politics very
 widely indeed But I have
 reached its present stage of
 progress As I un never
 been governed in my public
 course by per derstood it
 the bill originally came from
 the Sen sonal or political
 considerations nor do I intend
 ate through the action of
 the Post Offce Com I
 therefore approached the consideration to
 be mittee in the Senate
 It was placed upon your
 of the bill as a
 matter of equity understanding table
 here and upon the House
 going to the busi that
 the Judiciary Committee reported that
 as a ness on the
 Speaker s table it was
 taken from the matter of
 law these parties were liable
 There Speaker s table and
 referred as I supposed to
 is no question I believe
 that as a matter of
 law the Post Offce Committee
 That however did they are
 liable but as a matter
 of equity the not prove
 to be the fact It
 was in fact referred Post
 Offce Committee recommend the passage
 of to the Judiciary Committee
 The Judiciary Com of this
 bill And why The Post
 Office Depart mittee acted upon
 the bill and reported adversely
 ment instituted two suits acrainst
 the postrnaster That report was
 laid upon the table At
 a subsequent period of time
 one of the gen at
 New Orleans for whom these
 partics were se tleman interested
 in the claim and whom
 I be curities onc for
 robbing the mails the other
 for lievcd to be entirely
 reliable stated to me that
 there defalcation The sureties came
 at once was newly discovered
 evidence which would give and
 paid every cent which the
 Post Office Depart a new
 aspect to the claim and
 asked me to have ment
 demanded The postmaster was tried
 for the adverse report taken
 from the table and re
 the crime charged upon him
 and was acquitted ferred to
 the Post Office Committee I
 consented All that the Post
 Office Department demanded to do
 so and in open House
 I rnade t hc motion
 from the sureties was 10
 538 and that sum the
 which was acceded to by
 the Housc and the sureties
 paid The principal afterwards went
 to bill was taken froin
 the table and referred to
 the Mexico where he now
 resides at Tehuantepec Post Offce
 Committee upon thc allegation that
 I believe There was u
 little account for 2 38
 newly discovered testimony would be
 produced for stamps in regard
 to which there svas some
 Whether there has been any
 new testimony pro little diffeulty
 but that was all Subsequently
 duced before the Post Ofiiee
 Committee or not I however
 the Post Offce Department stated
 that am not aware I
 simply state in addition that
 the clerk who made up
 these accounts was intem I
 have not conferred with any
 member of the Post perate
 and had made a mistake
 and after the post Office
 Committee upon thc subject master
 had left the country the
 sureties were in I had
 almost made Mr MORRIS of
 Illinois formed that there was
 a further sum of five
 or six up my mind
 to oppose at this stage
 of our pro thousand dollars
 due Suit was entered against
 ceedings any bill for private
 relief bt_lt looking them for
 the recovery of that sum
 and on that to the
 one now under consideration I
 merely wish suit the judgment
 was rendered which it is
 now to state that it
 seems to me eminently just
 and proposed by this bill
 to cancel it will receive
 my sanction and cordial support
 Nowr I say that if
 the Government does not Mr
 HICKMAN Without employ competent officers
 it ought not to make
 ter into the merits of
 this bill it is suflic
 icnt for innocent parties suffer
 for their incompetency I me
 to say that 1 object
 to this kind of practice
 in ask W hether it
 is just for the Government
 after the House r I
 his bill was disposed of
 by the Ju these sureties
 had paid in gold all
 that we de diciary Committee
 so far as that committee
 could mandcd of them and
 after the principal has gone
 dispose of it And if
 the gentleman frorn New off
 to come forward a year
 or two afterwards ork or
 any other gentleman was dissatisfied
 and ask them to pay
 an additional sum II strikes
 with thc action of that
 committec in the case thc
 me that it is not
 and therefore i concurred in
 the proper course in my
 judgment would have been report
 of the Post C ffcc
 Committee although I to have
 brought the matter before the
 House for do not doubt
 that as a legal proposition
 these par the final action
 which they invoked It is
 not ties are of course
 liable to the Government necessary
 for me to designate the
 steps taken in Mr PALM
 FIR The gentleman from Indiana
 transferring the jurisdiction of the
 case to another says something
 about personal and political con
 committee in this House as
 surreptitious it is siderations as
 though he supposed such consid
 enough to say they were
 new unusual and unfhir erations
 influenced me in my course
 in regard to Now Mr
 Speaker there is no bill
 of a private this bill
 nature which has corne before
 the Judiciary for Mr COLFAX
 Not at all their consideration
 which has received more de
 Mr PALMER 1 know nothing
 of the per liberation or
 careful investiffation than this very
 sonnet or the politics of
 the claimants in this bill
 i It has been considered
 according to my nor do
 I vant to knosv anything
 about them l o recollection
 at least three or four
 times upon the noe it
 is enough to know that
 in my judgment application of
 thc gentlemen thcrnselves who arc
 this claim is unjust and
 illegal The Judiciary interested in
 this bill and in every
 instance it was Committee the
 proper tribunal before which the
 disposed of adversely to their
 prayer Tbc bill claim should
 properly come have reported that
 has been taken from thc
 Speaker s table as I
 arn it is unjust and
 illegal i now told under
 the pretext or ifthat be
 too harsh Mr Speaker there
 are hundreds and thousands u
 word under the allegation that
 new evidence of claims coming
 before the House which arc
 be has bccn discovered which
 will go to the relief
 of yond all question Ineritorious
 m their character against which
 noman can raise any objection
 what the petitioners YVhat the
 nature of that newly I
 discovered evidence may be the
 gentleman from ever yet they
 cannot obtain the ear of
 the House New York Mr
 COCHRANE has not condescended at
 all while we find this
 bill surreptitiously smug to inform
 us Nay I think he
 has admitted this gled from
 the proper committee to which
 it had and brought up
 here in advance of the
 hundreds II Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 If the gentleman and thousands
 of just and legal claims
 now pend will permit me
 I will say that I
 did not state the ino
 on your Calendar but wliich
 cannot be passed nature of
 the newly discovered evidence for
 thc j reason that I
 was not then and am
 not now because the House
 has not time for their
 consid eration Sir I call
 the yeas arid nays upon
 the aware of its nature
 I stated rnost distinctly that
 If it is to pass
 I want my II I
 received it upon the credibility
 of thc gentleman passage of
 the bill who informed me
 vote recorded against it and
 if other gentlemen arc in
 favor of pawing such a
 bill as this und Mr
 HICKMAN Then Mr Speaker no
 new evidence hag been discovered
 and the case stands at
 this moment precisely as itastood
 when it was considered these
 different times by the Judiciary
 Committee and received the judgment
 of thgt committee I do
 not speak of my own
 X pinion but in the
 judgment of that might say
 perhaps in the View of
 each indivi ual member of
 the committee it was a
 case enw tirely devoid of
 all merit without legal defense
 and standing devoid of equity
 I say this case hav
 ing been over and over
 again before the Commit tee
 on the JUdiciary is brought
 up in violation of all
 the proper precedents of this
 House and put before another
 committee because the per sons
 favorable to the bill knew
 beforehand what the action of
 that committee would be upon
 the claim I do not
 state this recklessly because our
 committee were implored time and
 again when these different actions
 were had upon the claim
 to report it back to
 the House and have it
 re ferrcd to the Committee
 on the Post Office and
 Post Roads because they would
 reportfavorably upon the bill Now
 sir if that is to
 be the standard of legis
 lation in this House upon
 private bills all thatis necessary
 to do is to find
 some committee which will report
 favorably upon them and then
 pass them through the House

 LEAK E We have fallen
 upon evil t imps But
 yesterday as it were and
 there was not a solitary
 gcntleman a membcr of this
 I louse not a citizen
 of the then United States
 of Amer ica who could
 not have boasted that in
 the face of the world
 he belonged to a country
 whose flag vas an ample
 guarantee of all his rights
 and that in all sections
 of the world that flag
 carried with it a passport
 to respect in the eyes
 oi ull for eign officials
 But yesterday and our country
 was floatino in the fi_lll
 tide of successful oxperirnent In
 all branches its industry it
 was unusually prosperous and extraordinarily
 happy l hcre ken could
 see to was nothing as
 far as lit unan mar
 thc prospect which a brilliant
 fature seemed to of ün
 to the history of this
 Treat and this glo But
 w Mr Speaker rious country
 changed the picture We tu

 this great ocean of prosperity
 to a ha ven of
 successful repose and an eminent
 prosperity We aro involved in
 the horrors of a revoltition
 and civil convulsion which whatever
 may bc its re sult
 portends mischief permanent enduring and
 irrenarable to onc seet10 l
 or the other or to
 one of the many sections
 of this glorious Confed eracy
 It becomes us then surrounded
 by these diffl culties to
 pause in order t inquire
 for a gingko moment at

 this blicrht has so suddenly
 come over ull the _n
 ospects this coun try that
 we should pause to inquire
 for a mo ment whatcauscs

 a brief year since I

 has not had pre alt
 its fury upon the devoted
 head of this country Warning
 upon warning has bcen given
 States man after statesman for
 lorig years has raised his
 voice and told you that
 there were dangers deep serious
 and irreparable ahead which if
 not warded off would ultimately
 result in pre cisely the
 state of things which we
 are now in They havc
 been unheeded The Republican party
 that party which has lately
 swept into power overriding all
 that was dear and sacred
 in the Constitution the laws
 and history that party has
 seen the breakers ahead for
 long years past nay more
 not only did these breakers
 lift their heads above the
 surrounding waters but we of
 the South had erected Our
 light houses to warn you
 of the dangers You heeded
 not the warn ino you
 headed your ship upon the
 rocks and now when the
 old ship of State has
 gone to picccs upon the
 rocks and is floating in
 broken fragments upon the dread
 ocean of opinion you de
 mand that we shall gather
 them up and recon struct
 her in all her fair
 and majestic proportions Sir it
 cannot be done You have
 wrecked the ship and you
 are entitled to no salvage
 at least we of the
 South are unwilling to pay
 it Now sir upon what
 ground is it that I
 come to this conclusion Mr
 Speaker there have been crimination
 and rccrimination upon all sides
 of this Hall Gentlemen from
 the non slaveholding States have
 charged upon the Sout h
 that we are the cause
 of all the mischief which
 has come upon us We
 of the South have charged
 back upon them that the
 true source of all the
 evil is in the very
 organization which now constitutes the
 dom inant party of this
 country so far as thc
 popular will seems to be
 concerned Where lies the truth
 Sirs our Government in its
 earlier its purer its happier
 and its better days did
 encounter ques tions which wore
 in conflict with the very
 insti tutions under which we
 live and which it was
 necessary to settle in order
 to secure the peace the
 prosperity and the happilless of
 the country We had the
 alien and sedition laws we
 had the question ofwar with
 Great Britain whcn one whole
 section arrayed itself against the
 Union we had the tariff
 acts of 1828 and 1833
 All those ques tions we
 settled not perhal s in
 the manner which ID y
 conscience approved and yet they
 were so settled as to
 secure the peace If not
 the prosperity of the country
 Whence sprung this difficulty Where
 was its From 1788 down
 to 1819 20 l ve
 had no controversy upon this
 subject of slavery There was
 no serious difficulty It is
 very true that in 1797
 a member from Massachusetts proposed
 to restrict slavery in the
 r I erritory of Mississippi
 but another mem ber long
 since gone to his reward
 Mr Otis opposed it and
 t t e proposition was
 rejected We had no serious
 difficulty I repeat until Missouri
 applied for admission into the
 Confederacy as a free soveroicrn
 and equal member of this
 glorious How tl ien did
 this difficulty ealaxy of Slates
 Sir let me premise at
 this point by saying what
 has often been said upon
 this floor as a part
 of the history of the
 country and is therefore not
 to bc controverted that at
 thc formation of this Government
 every Slate but one was
 a slavehold ing State and
 that at the time of
 the Declaration of Independcnce every
 State was a slaveholding Stale
 And yet in 1820 owing
 to the magna iiheralily of
 the South and particn nimity
 and larly of Virginia you
 had gathered strength enough upon
 the floor of this very
 body to in terpo sc
 a restriction not only upon
 southern rights but equally upon
 the rights of sovereion States
 which mieht thereafter bé admitted
 into the Union Mr Jefferson
 declared that the N J
 is souri restriction came upon
 him like a fire bell
 in the dead of night
 language expressive of the profound
 peace calm and re ose
 in which tho country then
 was when the orth sprang
 this question of ill omen
 upon the people of the
 South Chere is the source
 of all the mischief under
 which this country now labors
 Sir my colleague from the
 Norfolk district Mr MILL SON
 whom I do not see
 no sv in his seat
 declared ill the able and
 eloquent speech which hc delivered
 two or three days since
 that every question between the
 North and the South hall
 been settled in favor of
 thc South although ho added
 that while we got the
 princip e they got tl
 e sn_lbstance My friend from
 Missouri shadow We got the
 principle When did we get
 it in the Missouri question
 know that when it was
 proposed to interpose an anti
 slavery qual ification as a
 condition of the admission of
 Mis souri it was compromised
 But how compro mised By
 agreeing to draw an imaginary
 line through the then territory
 of the United States and
 positively prohibiting slavery in all
 that part of the territory
 north of that line while
 that part south might come
 in with or without slavery
 as the people of the
 Territory themselves might pre scribe
 when they applied for admission
 Into the Union How was
 that controversy settled in fa
 vor of the South On
 the contrary it was as
 I said just now the
 source ofall the ills under
 which I this country labors
 It was settled against the
 South because then the right
 of Congress to in terdict
 slavery in the Territories was
 conceded by an act of
 this body You assumed jurisdiction
 over the question at that
 time and have recognized it
 since whenever it has been
 necessary in your opinion to
 exercise it But Mr Speaker
 I appeal to my colleague
 again upon a point on
 which I am inclined to
 think he will agree vith
 me when he understands what
 I mean I am willing
 to take this question upon
 his own basis and to
 argue it upon the idea
 that so far as the
 action of this Government is
 concerned every question has been
 settled in favor of the
 South and I am forced
 to come to a conclusion
 diametrically opposite to the one
 at which my distinguished and
 respected colleague arrived in his
 argument Admit that we have
 all the guarantees that the
 Constitution can give us and
 that we have settled cvery
 controvérsy that has risen so
 far as this Government can
 settle it in favor of
 the South and yet we
 know that the South is
 now the oppressed section and
 that we have not derived
 one solitary jot or tittle
 of ben efit from the
 settlements of which my colleague
 so proudly boasts The question
 has been settled practically and
 morally against us The Govern
 ment has utterly failed in
 thc great end and object
 of its creation and the
 southern people have Been entirely
 deprived of those rights which
 know my colleague wants which
 I want and which the
 II has failed utterly iüiled
 South demands your legislation is
 worthless your compromises are not
 worth tho paper upon which
 they are written 1 repeat
 that the experiment isa fåilure
 and when the people of
 my section of this cöun
 try wish to derive adequate
 protection for their rights from
 the Government and the Constitution
 and the laws made in
 pursuance thereof then s r
 Virginia holds the remedy in
 the hollow of her hand
 and I tell you that
 she will apply it in
 the manner she ma deem
 best for her own good
 Mr MILL Will my colleague
 allow me to interrupt him
 Mr LEAKE Certainly sir Mr
 MILLSON vant to correct an
 error He is answering an
 argument i never made I
 never did say that every
 question had becn set tled
 in favor of the South
 I said that the present
 territorial question involving the right
 to carry slaves into the
 Territories had been settled in
 favor of the South settled
 by the repeal of the
 Missouri restriction to which my
 colleague has referred settled by
 the Constitution and by the
 Supremc Court and if we
 have derived no benefit from
 it it is only because
 we have no slaves to
 carry into the Territories and
 no territory suita ble for
 them Mr LEAKE I think
 that if my colleague will
 read the written report of
 his speech which I read
 very carefully last night and
 I may say that I
 heard every word he uttered
 he will find there excuses
 for the misapprehension for I
 doubt not there is misapprehension
 into which I have fallen
 I know he will not
 suspect me of a disposition
 to misrepresent him Mr MILLSON
 Certainly not Mr LEAKE The
 argument comes back to the
 same point but I must
 pass rapidly from it because
 I have other matters to
 deal with Let me say
 here that it strikes me
 that this whole con troversy
 is even now not weli
 understood by the people of
 either section of the country
 I know wrell that certain
 legislation on the part of
 northern States is constantly referred
 to and certain action upon
 the part of this Government
 and I know also that
 the question has been aoain
 and acrain asked a question
 which v ras ariswered in
 his moni ions of Ibo
 which hug now burst in
 gays we got the It
 was less than the h
 wruy by mv colleague from
 the Norfolk district 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 565 whether the
 election of Lincoln was a
 casus bell i for which
 we ought to sever the
 relations existing between the different
 sections Sir I pause to
 remark that the election of
 Lincoln was no cause ofa
 dissofution of the Union I
 tell you that the mere
 election of a President of
 the United States ander the
 forms of the Constitution never
 can be a justifiable cause
 of a dissolution of this
 Confed eracy I say however
 at the same time that
 whilst the constitutional form is
 there you have to create
 a soul under the ribs
 of death You have furnished
 us with the ribs of
 death it is for you
 to inquire whethér you have
 Oiven us the sout under
 those ribs What I believe
 and what I believe the
 whole South thinks is that
 the elec tion of Lincoln
 is evidence t hat cause
 for the dis solution of
 the Union exists itis not
 cause itself but it is
 evidence that that cause exists
 That cause underlies it it
 reaches far behind it so
 far behind that very few
 perhaps have taken the pains
 to look into it Another
 colleague of mine whom I
 see in his seat Mr
 CLEMENS I and he will
 pardon me for observing that
 he seemed to take cspeeial
 pleas ure in administering to
 the delectation of his northern
 friends upon the other side
 of the House thought proper
 in the course of the
 remarkable speech which hc delivered
 to quote from the fare
 well address of the father
 of Virginia s liberties In
 that address he warned us
 arrainst sectional controversies As though
 he possessed the power of
 omniscience of looking into the
 human heart of penetrating that
 darkest and most mysterious Of
 all labyrinths and subjecting its
 motives to the test of
 infallible analysis that immortal man
 warned you in the language
 quoted by my col league
 against the dangers of sectional
 strife wonder that the member
 from Virginia should apply the
 quotation to the people of
 the southern section of this
 Confederacy I wonder that he
 should have attempted to draw
 us within the ad monition
 of that great good and
 illustrious man Sir had he
 attempted then to describe with
 more than prophetic vision the
 present position aims and objects
 of the Republican party he
 coukd not have better done
 it MT ho have created
 this sec tional eöntroversy Who
 nre its authors Who have
 prosecuted it until there is
 perhaps no hope left fo
 r the South but in
 the ultima ratio ot nations
 The North Did the South
 begin the fight 1 appeal
 to my colleague to know
 whether Virginia ever attempted to
 create sectional strife within the
 limits of this Confederacy He
 shakes his hcad I am
 glad he does it Even
 that slight assent to the
 southern view of the question
 will be gratify ing to
 his constituents Where did it
 begin have alluded to the
 Missouri compromise What next You
 may go back to the
 history of this Confederacy from
 1821 22 down to this
 day and you witl find
 that history but the hist
 ory of a series of
 aggressions upon the part of
 the North on the just
 constitutional rights of the South
 new agitations in both branches
 of Congress and attempts to
 interfere with the relations be
 tween master and slave You
 need not talk to me
 about legislation when you have
 organized your societies and set
 the machinery at work to
 sap the What have the
 N0Jth done You have sanctified
 crime you have canonized murder
 you have of fered a
 premium upon pcr j ury
 and you have made it
 a high crime and misdemeanor
 to obey the Constitution of
 the United States and thc
 laws passed in pursuance thereof
 I except of course from
 this statement the gallant Democracy
 of the North Sir if
 you wanted to find the
 man within the broad limits
 cf this Confederacy who has
 done more to sap the
 foundations upon which the Government
 has until of late years
 reposed in peace and quiet
 who has laid the foundation
 of this whole controversy broadly
 and deeply who has done
 it in a way that
 shows that hc would not
 comply with his own constitutional
 oblicrations but would punish all
 who complied with theirs and
 protect those who violate the
 Constitution and the laws you
 will find him I thank
 God not within the limits
 of the sunny South I
 been said in the Senate
 of the United States It
 would be unparliamentary to do
 so and I mean to
 violate no parliamentary law if
 I can avoid it But
 that man is now in
 the Senate of the United
 States representing the greatest State
 of this Con federacy I
 allude sir to William H
 Seward who as Governor of
 New York as far back
 as 1839 asserted doctrines fatal
 to the rights of all
 tho States of this Confederacy
 At that time three men
 went to the city of
 Nor folk in Virginia and
 stole three negroes They escaped
 with them to New York
 William H Seward was then
 Governor of the State of
 New York The proofs were
 made out the evidence filed
 every requirement of the law
 complied With and the act
 ing Governor of Virginia made
 his requisition in soiemn form
 for the surrender of the
 criminals but thc Governor of
 the State of New I
 York refused to comply with
 the obligations of the Constitution
 And on what ground On
 the naked ground that according
 to the laws of New
 York there could be no
 property in slaves Sir would
 it not be a novelty
 in a system of govern
 ment constituted as ours is
 if every State of tbc
 Confederacy had a right to
 supervise the laws of every
 other State of the Confederacy
 Would it not bc a
 novelty if not only the
 State through her regularly constituted
 legislative authorities but that the
 Governor of each State should
 have a right to supervise
 those laws Yet Mr Seward
 did it The crime was
 nota felony in New York
 and therefore he was not
 bound to surrender a fugitive
 accused of committing that crime
 Now let us examine that
 for a moment Not long
 ago thc State of New
 York came very near abolishing
 the law inflicting thc punishment
 of death for murder and
 it is contended by some
 that she did absolutely make
 it impossible to pun ish
 murder in the first degree
 Suppose she had said by
 her legislation that murder should
 not be a crime within
 the limits of the State
 of New York and suppose
 a rnan committed a murder
 in the State of Virginia
 and escaped to New York
 would the Governor of New
 York bc justified in saying
 in response to a requisition
 made upon him No sir
 we do not regard murder
 as a crimc in New
 York and therefore we are
 not bound to surrender this
 person Now is that law
 I am merely giving a
 rapid sketch of these things
 W hut bas twe Governor
 of Ohio done What I
 las the of Iowa done
 Governor Dennison refused to surrender
 a man accused of aiding
 and abetting others to commit
 murder Mr SHERMAN Will the
 gentleman allow mc to makc
 a statement about this rnattcr
 Mr LEAKE Certainly sir Mr
 SHERMAN 1 simply desire to
 that whenevcr an v citizen
 of Ohio goes within the
 limits of the State of
 Virginia and there commits a
 crime acrainst her laws und
 flce s to Ohio Governor
 of Ohio has ever refused
 to surrender Ithe case referred
 to was a case such
 person where a citizen of
 Ohio was accused of havil
 committed a crinne 110t williin
 limits of Vir l he
 papers shtnved on their ginia
 but of Ohio fhcc that
 the presence aliecrcd in Virginia
 wuss u presence and not
 an a c tl lal
 rncre constructive i know the
 Governor of Virginia very presence
 well arid I verily believe
 thut he hirnsclf would not
 surrender a citizen of Virginia
 to the Execu tivc of
 Ohio when that citizen of
 Virginia had not left thc
 soil of his nativc State
 Mr COX I think this
 rnattcl ought to be correctly
 understood I understood my colleugue
 Mr SHER MAN to say
 the other day that in
 the case referred to the
 case of Mit riam and
 Brown there was no evidence
 befbro Governor Dennison that the
 offense charged against these men
 was committed in the State
 of Virginia He has re
 vides that the fugitives are
 to be demanded on the
 certified copy of an indicuueni
 becausd the indictment sets forth
 the förmälly In t htß
 case it is expressly stated
 in the iiidictment that said
 Francis Mirriam being a free
 person in the 16th and
 17th days of the m91ith
 of OQQber in the year
 1859 in the county of
 Jefférsoh ar d commonwealth of
 Virginia and within the ju
 ri diction of this court
 did commit the offense with
 which he was charged What
 language could be used to
 express the thought moÉe fülly
 and explicitly And yet it
 is urged here that the
 Governor of Ohio went outside
 of the papers in the
 requisition to find out the
 fact that Mirriam a nd
 BröWn were not in Virginia
 but vere really in Ohio
 will pretend that the Governor
 of Ohio had va right
 to go behind the papers
 and get up testi Inony
 to show the fact that
 these criminals were in Virginia
 only constructively Nor is there
 any evidcncc here to show
 that that is the truth
 All the evidencc shows that
 on the very day the
 Governor of Ohio refused to
 surrender the slaye stealing vagabond
 Lago to the Governor of
 the Commonwealtl of Kentucky this
 subteifuge found for the purpose
 of violating the Constitu tion
 in this very itnportant particular
 with ref erel ice to
 the Virginia cases Yes sir
 authorit ics arc sometimes quoted
 My colleague cetin rcd the
 other day to a case
 in Ken tuck y That
 authority has been called for
 again but never Introduced as
 precedent and again for this
 action of Ohio lilcre is
 a case where the Governor
 of Ohio for the very
 purpose of screen ing these
 mell from punishment for their
 insur rection in Virginia actually
 madc proclamation in the State
 of the fact of the
 reclamation and re fusal to
 deliver so hat they might
 escape and be free from
 arrest Everybody knew that the
 requi I he fact was
 publisheWin the sition was made
 He did not act as
 the Governor of newspapers Pennsylvania
 did when Hazlett fled there
 and when It appeared that
 there was a mistake about
 his name that Governor held
 lhe scoundrel till the mistake
 was corrected and then delivered
 him up But our Governor
 the Governor of Ohio God
 bless you this man whom
 my colleague undertakes to defend
 for his Constitution loun attributes
 gave notice to all tile
 world that these men wet
 o sent for and t
 hoy were therefore never surrendm
 cd up to receive their
 proper puntsh rnent Proud as
 I am of the State
 of Ohio I have pride
 as I have said again
 and again in her wrong
 doing And I applaud thc
 course of my CORWIN J
 the chairman of the colleague
 iMr conunittee of thirty three
 fbr reportincr a provis ion
 whereby this wrong can bc
 remedied which never could have
 been remedied but for the
 fact that the nat ional
 Congress has observed this very
 wrong to which I have
 called the attention ofthe Mr
 SHERMAN 1 desire to say
 a word in reply to
 my colleague am perfectly willing
 that the LEAKE gen tlcman
 shall take five or ten
 min utes provided 1 he
 allowed it in my time
 Mr SHERMAN I will not
 take two min utes of
 the gentleman s time Mr
 very well then 1 am
 perfectly willing this explanation should
 be made Mr SHERMAN I
 do not wish to say
 any thil lg further about
 the Governor of Ohio Gov
 ernor Dennison is able to
 talcc care of himself We
 arc now discussing a matter
 between States peated it now
 I do not believe Mr
 Speaker L he fact is
 that b between the Sta
 te of and thc State
 of Vir that this statement
 is correct thc indicttnent certified
 by the great seal of
 Vir ginia and repeat my
 assertion that where it appears
 that a citizen of Ohio
 has gone into the In
 that ginia was before the
 Governor of Ohio Indictment therc
 wasa statement that Brown and
 State of Virginia and committed
 a crime in that Mirriakü
 were in the county of
 Jefferson and State State if
 he flees back to Ohio
 the Governor of of Virginia
 while cngagcd in the John
 Ohio will surrender him I
 did not anticipate the technical
 plea now made transaction Where
 else should such an allega
 tion bc fbund l he
 indictment is the for by
 my colleague that the indictment
 atlcges that these defendants wcre
 in Virginia As a matter
 his message Gov ernor In
 such an anecyation Letcher stated
 that the Attorney General of
 Ohio of course the indictment
 would so allege Indict there
 is to show that Mir
 ments always allege a great
 rnany things having objects that
 riam ever was in the
 State of Virginia save the
 i little to do with
 the offense charged If I
 were to allegation in the
 indictment that the offense of
 I read an indictment now
 to these crowded galler which
 he is accused was there
 committed The ics many would
 not know what it meant
 An first objection was that
 there was not one word
 indictment is a formal accusation
 couched in in the indichnent
 to show that Mirriam had
 fled II phraseology This indictment
 of course alleged from justice
 and now the objection is
 that the that these defendants
 were within the juriSdiction allegation
 that he ever was in
 Virginia is of Virginia but
 from the papers accompanying l
 the indictment it appears that
 thesc men were not nowhere
 save in the indictrnent Where
 clse II should it be
 found The act of Congress
 pro within the State of
 Virginia and had not been
 566 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 25 The fact that young
 Brown and Mirriam were not
 in Virginia when it is
 alleged they committed the crime
 is admitted They were and
 had been in Ohio Their
 alleged presence is merely a
 con structive presence The evidence
 was that they had never
 left the soil of Ohio
 Sir this claim of constructive
 presence when attempted to be
 carried out as in this
 case is one of the
 most in human and barbarous
 practices that ever was ori
 ginated There is not a
 civilized code in the world
 that would recognize the right
 of a State to pun
 ish a man for a
 crime not committed within its
 jurisdiction the person himself never
 having been within its jurisdiction
 No State would allow a
 man to be punished outside
 of its jurisdiction if the
 crime was committed within it
 Yet this is the very
 case about xxvhich so much
 trouble has been made Mr
 CLEMENS 1 desire to ask
 the gentle man from Ohio
 this question whether thcrc was
 not in the case referred
 to accompanying tho in dictmcnt
 the affdavit of Andrew Hunter
 and others of the county
 of Tefferson in the Statc
 of Virginia swearing that these
 two men for whom the
 requisition was given were at
 Harper s Ferry at the
 time John Brown invaded the
 State of Vir ginia Mr
 SHERMAN 1 do not think
 so Mr COX That was
 the fact Mr CLEMENS Yes
 sir there accompanied that indictment
 the affidavits of the prosecuting
 attorney of Virginia for the
 county of Jefferson and of
 others that these men vere
 at Harper s Ferry at
 the time of the John
 Brown raid Mr SHERMAN Then
 1 can only say that
 the affidavit was certainly untrue
 because It was admitted on
 all hands that these men
 had not been within the
 jurisdictiön of Virginia Mr FOÜKE
 If the gentleman will me
 I will stale riffht here
 that I have before me
 the statute governyng the case
 under which this requi sition
 was draWn by which it
 appears that all that is
 necessary is to present a
 certified copy of the indictment
 or an affidavit taken before
 some court of competent jurisdiction
 in the State from which
 the fugitive has escaped to
 require the sur render of
 the Tugi tivc from justice
 by the Governor of the
 State to which he has
 escaped Mr SHERMAN Onc remark
 Ide sire to say that
 Virginia shall have no cause
 to dissolve the Union in
 regard to thc surrender of
 I will only repeat what
 I fugitives from justice stud
 the other day that when
 a citizen of Ohio goes
 into t he State of
 Virginia that citizen must obey
 the laws and even the
 police regulations of Virginia but
 I for one am not
 williåg to sec citizens of
 Ohio carried out of their
 own State charged with constructive
 presence and construc tive crimes
 wit hin the jurisdiction of
 another If a citizen of
 one Stat c goes into
 another State he must obey
 the laws and if he
 violates them he ought to
 bc punished Mr COX I
 am very glad this discussion
 has arisen because I believe
 it has shown that there
 will be considerable unanilüity on
 both sides of the House
 in voting for one of
 the propositions I was about
 of the committee of thirty
 three to remark that the
 act of Congress only provided
 for a copy of the
 indictment to accompany the requisition
 or as an alternative for
 an affidavit In the Iowa
 casc there was to accompany
 it an affidavit m this
 case there was a copy
 of the indictment and I
 am assured and I assure
 gen tlemen of the fact
 that these rnen were actually
 not constructively in the State
 of Virginia How any other
 evidence got before the Executive
 ofthc State of Ohio do
 not know This discussion tends
 to bring these things to
 light and to provide a
 remedy for such difficulties in
 future I believe there was
 cause of complaint on the
 part of Vir ginia arrainst
 Ohio For one I am
 for a retnedy and I
 am glad that my colleague
 is also for a remedy
 Mr LEAKE Mr Speaker 1
 have only two replies to
 rnake to the gentleman from
 Ohio Mr i SHERMAN One
 is simply to read the
 first section I of the
 statute upon this subiect which
 I will now proceed to
 do and show yau that
 I have the law and
 the testimony upon my side
 s Be it enacted c
 That whenever the executive author
 ity of aii v State
 in the Jnion or of
 either of the Territories northwest
 or sont h of the
 river Ohio shall demand any
 per son as a fugitive
 fi om justice of the
 executive authority of E any
 State ot rerritory to hie
 tl such person shall have
 fou d or an affidavit
 madc before a magistrate of
 any State or Territory aforesaid
 charging the person so demanded
 with having counnitted treason felony
 or othcr crilne cer tified
 as authentic by the Governor
 or chief Inagistrate of i
 the State or Ilerritory from
 whence the person so charged
 fled it shall be the
 duty of the executive authority
 of l he State or
 Territory to which such person
 shall have fled to cause
 him or her to be
 arrested and secured and notice
 of the arrest to be
 given to the exccutive authority
 making such demand or to
 the agent of such authority
 appointed to receive the fugitive
 and to cause the fugitive
 to be de livered to
 such agent when he shall
 appear but if no such
 agent shall appear within fix
 months from the time of
 the arrest the prisoner may
 bc discharged And all costs
 or expenses incurred in the
 apprehending securing and trans mitting
 such fugitive to the State
 or Territory making such demand
 shall be paid by such
 State or Territory Now sir
 I say that it appears
 that a certified copy of
 the indictment was presented But
 I have anot her reply
 to make to the gentleman
 from Ohio to which I
 invite his cspecial attention I
 understand him to take the
 position and I do not
 undertake to arcrue this point
 for I was mcrcly putting
 together certain fåcts as the
 basis of the conclusion I
 arn trying to get to
 I invite his at tention
 to this consideratiori He thinks
 that these men must undoubtedly
 have bccn in Virginia where
 the crime was perpetrated before
 the Gov ernor of Virginia
 would be authorized to make
 a requisition on the Governor
 of Ohio to deliver the
 men up I demand of
 that gentleman if he means
 to state that a man
 in the State of Ohio
 may plot the murder of
 a family in Virginia by
 poison may procure that poison
 himself send by his agent
 to Virginia and adfninistcr it
 to the family whereby the
 death of all takes place
 Does he dare say that
 under the comity of the
 Statos and the laws of
 the United States that man
 in Ohio is not to
 be delivered up to Virginia
 to answer for his offense
 Mr SHERMAN I take pleasure
 in saying that in such
 a case as that Ohio
 would punish the miscreant who
 should dare conspire against the
 life of any yuan in
 Virginia Mr LEAK E I
 would to God that Ohio
 would punisl k her miscreants
 but when we have upon
 our own record the evidence
 that two crim inals concerned
 in the Harper s Ferry
 raid prilna facic evidence at
 least and suffcient for all
 the not desire now to
 do injustice to the Governor
 of the State of Iowa
 or tlie Governor of any
 other State notwithstanding he may
 not care to know the
 name of the Governor of
 Iowa He proposes as I
 understand him to refer to
 Iowa in connec ti012 with
 a casc similar to that
 which he has stated against
 the Stato of Ohio If
 he will permit me I
 wish to state at the
 threshold of his remarks before
 he may be betrayed into
 a mistaken theory of the
 case he proposes to bring
 forward what I understand to
 be the real facts involved
 Mr LEAKE Why my dear
 sir 1 have not stated
 the faets of the case
 myself yet and I would
 like to know how the
 gentleman can correct w hat
 If I misun has not
 yet been said Laughter deretand
 or misrepresent the facts promise
 the gentleman cheerfully to yield
 to him to make whatever
 correction may be necessary The
 House know that have never
 denied the privilege to any
 I memberduring U eprogress of
 any remarks I may have
 submitted of making an explanation
 and I never will I
 utterly abhor the hour rule
 because it destroys the legitimate
 ends and objects of debate
 on this floor I was
 about to say this that
 on a requisition from the
 State of Virginia the Governor
 of the State of Iowa
 refused in a similar manner
 to the Governor of the
 State of Ohio His refusal
 was based upon the merest
 meanest most and contemptible technicality
 a tech nicality such as
 even a petifogger in a
 county court would not rest
 a case upon He alleged
 some informality in the authentication
 of the affidavit and then
 gavc the criminal notice to
 escape for his life to
 tarry not in all the
 plain but flee to the
 mount the Governor of Virginia
 could provide a remedy Mr
 VANDEVER lunderstand that the gen
 tleman charges against the Governor
 of Iowa that he refused
 to surrender a criminal upon
 the mere pretext that the
 affidavit made before the notary
 public was not duly authenticated
 I admit that that was
 one of the reasons asSigned
 Whether it is frivolous or
 not it is for this
 House and the 1 believe
 it is admitted by every
 world to judge purposes of
 the Constitution and laws who
 have lawyer that the manner
 in which a notary public
 been by the action of
 that State shielded from the
 gentleman will pardon me if
 punishment after that we have
 some hesitation in trustino the
 State of Ohio Mr VALLANDIGHAM
 1 with the gentleman from
 the Mansfield district of my
 State Mr SHERMAN that Ohio
 would punish and the miscreant
 who would bc severely punish
 guilty of the offense to
 which he has alluded but
 it is true also that
 the Republican party of Ohio
 in the Senate did last
 winter vote down the bill
 drawn up by the most
 eminent lawyer of the State
 to punish parties to just
 such conspiracies Mr MAY NARD
 If my friend will permit
 1110 I wili give nn
 example illustrating the posi tion
 whie h he has taken
 I yield to the gentleman
 with Mr LEAKE the understanding
 that the time he takes
 up shall be allowed rne
 Cries of Agreed J Mr
 MAYNARD A band of miscreants
 con spired to go over
 into Virginia a fcwr years
 since to rob a poor
 widow of a fev r
 hundred dollars of Inoncy the
 price of a small piccc
 of land all the property
 she had A portion of
 thcln went over perpetrated the
 crime crot the Inonoy and
 brought It with them into
 Tennessee lthey divided it among
 themselves The larger and more
 guilty portion had never been
 in the State of Virginia
 at all and yet I
 need not say that upon
 the de mand of Virginia
 they were all promptly surren
 dered up for punishment to
 that State Mr LEA K
 E Of course we all
 know that Tennessee has done
 and will do her duty
 Let us pass fora moment
 to the State of Iowa
 I must pause one instant
 to remind the House why
 it is that I indulffe
 in this course of remarks
 want to show you Mr
 Spcaker and the House what
 underlies the controversy now going
 on I he Governor of
 the State of Iowa I
 forget his name and I
 would not know it for
 one dollar the Governor of
 the State of Iowa Mr
 VANDEVER 1 will ask the
 gentleman to yield to me
 for a moment I will
 yield to the gentleman Mr
 LEAKE of course if I
 havo misrepresented him but I
 i authenticates his acts is
 by his seal and that
 in the absence of his
 seal there is no authentication
 If this is frivolous t
 hen let the gen whatever
 tlpman so regard it Another
 reason assigned by the Governor
 of the State of Iowa
 in reference to this matter
 was this that the requisition
 was not accompanied by the
 copy of any indictment or
 by an aflidavit made beföre
 a magistrate That may be
 involved in the first objection
 but another and still more
 fatal objection existed in the
 fact that the affidavit which
 accompanied the requisi tion of
 thc Governor of Virginia did
 not even indirectly charge that
 any had been com mitted
 by the alleged crilninal within
 the jurisdic tion of the
 State of Virginia In that
 it was sim ilar to
 the case of Ohio The
 requisition was issued upon the
 affdavit of one Andrew Hunter
 of the State of Virginia
 representing upon in formation derived
 from persons in that State
 who had been tried convicted
 and executed for the connnission
 of great crimes that this
 man in Iowa had aided
 and abetted them Aided and
 abettcd In tho State of
 Virginia That them where is
 not charged even inferentially There
 is no charge that the
 man had committed any offense
 in the State of Virginia
 The gentleman charges another thmg
 and I do not know
 upon what authority he makes
 the dec He charges that
 the Governor of Iowa gave
 the alleged criminal notice so
 that he might escape Now
 Governor Kirkwood has himself expressly
 decltred that he gave no
 such notice whatever but it
 has been ascertained beyond the
 possibility of a doubt that
 the messenger sent with the
 requisition from the Governor of
 Vir ginia into Iowa himself
 voluntarily gave inform ation publicly
 in regard to the nature
 of his errand He did
 that sir before he stated
 his mission to the Governor
 of Iowa Mr LEAK E
 I do not want to
 take the floor from the
 gentleman I have yielded it
 to him and now ask
 him to permit me to
 make a statement that it
 may go in connection with
 the statement he has just
 made Does not thegentleman know
 that wbcn the Governor of
 Virginia made the requisi tion
 upon the Governor of Iowa
 the Governor Of am not
 n ware that I have
 referred to him at all
 I have no doubt the
 gen Iowa published his letter
 in reply to Governor Mr
 VANDEVER Letcher before sending that
 reply to the latter tleman
 Vircrinia has not desired arid
 does fled and shall rnnrcovor
 produce the copy of an
 indie0nQnt 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 567 that way the news
 of what was going on
 reached I notary public is
 not a magistrate and therefore
 the requisition is defective But
 the gentleman the criminal s
 ears and enabled him to
 escape If the gentleman does
 not know the fact I
 tell 111m II has forgotten
 that a law was passed
 in 1850 by that it
 is so and I assert
 it upon the Authority of
 the Governor John Letcher himself
 Mr VANDEVER If the gentleman
 from Vir ginia means to
 bavc the idea go out
 that Governor Kirkwood by the
 publication of his correspond ence
 with Governor Letcher first gave
 the in formation to the
 alleged criminal and the world
 of what was going on
 then I take issue with
 him deny that Govermor Kirkwood
 gave such in formation I
 have the declaration of Governor
 Kirkwood in the message he
 sent to the Legisla ture
 of Iowa that he did
 not directly or indi rectiy
 give notice as charged Governor
 Kirk wood is incapable of
 such an act The messencrer
 from Virginia himself published the
 object of his errand before
 he arrived at the capital
 of Iowa The alleged criminal
 was notified of it from
 that publication and made his
 escape Now sir we in
 the State of Iowa hold
 in ref erence to these
 criminal matters certainly where the
 liberty of a white man
 andVa citizen of the State
 is concerned that there should
 bean adher once to the
 ordinary forms of the aw
 Whether it is right or
 not to dispense with those
 forms in reference to other
 persons we never adopt such
 ra rule of procccding in
 Iowa with respect to our
 own citizens whether at the
 sugges tzon of Vir ginia
 or any ot her State
 And Ict me say another
 word The want of form
 or neglect to meet the
 well known require Congress which
 declares that the afidavit may
 also be made before a
 notary public This is in
 the very terms of the
 law itself Whether the Governor
 of Iowa wras ignorant or
 captious it is not for
 me to say One thing
 is sure that he had
 not read the law of
 1850 which permitted notaries public
 also to take testimony for
 requisitions There is still another
 quibble resorted to by the
 Republican Governor of Iowa to
 avoid the Con I am
 glad that this discussion has
 stitution taken place for these
 facts show that there is
 a necessity for some measure
 to settle the practice in
 these cases Again thc gentleman
 from Iowa says there was
 no evidence that this man
 Coppie who fled into Iowas
 where his mother resided was
 ever in the State of
 Virginia He says there was
 no such evidence furnished to
 the Governor Now the evideYlce
 of Mr Hunter which the
 gentleman W ill fir d
 efcrred to in Governor Letcher
 s mes sage shvs thc
 fact that the defendant on
 sun dry days was in
 Virginia aiding and abetting John
 Brown c Mr VANDEVER There
 is no such fact stated
 Mr COX I have made
 the exact quotation Mr VANDEVER
 The gentleman s mem ory
 is false Mr COX I
 do not rely upon recollection
 I quote from the papers
 which are before me I
 Mr COX I use the
 exact language quoted ments of
 law raised the presumption in
 the minds of many that
 it was the desire of
 Virginia that the alleged criminal
 should escape I have heard
 the from Hunter s affidavit
 As the gentleman from opinion
 expressed by men of all
 parties in my II Massachusetts
 N lr ADAMS said ycsterday
 Iam a precise man and
 it is well Mr Speaker
 in State that it was
 not the intention or the
 wish of these matters to
 have precise information those who
 made the requisition that it
 should be II All that
 I haye got to say
 further is let Repub complied
 with We do not recoffnize
 however lican Governors of the
 northern States only emu the
 right of the State of
 Virginia or any other State
 to adopt such a loose
 course of proceeding late Governor
 Packer of Pennsylvania When in
 regard to matters of this
 kind The papers a criminal
 likc this man Coppic fled
 to Pennsyl x vere so
 defective that they woutd scarcely
 be tol vania what did
 he do Dischargc him upon
 a orated in a justice
 s courtinany district throughout technicality
 get up a quibble upon
 a scroll seal he held
 the man the length and
 breadth of the land Iowa
 to day or something sin
 lilar No sir is true
 to her constitutional obligations Demand
 of her the surrender of
 any fugitivc for a crime
 committed in Virginia or elsewhere
 and she will comply with
 it But this man was
 not charged with having corninitted
 any crime in Virginia and
 the papers were not authenticated
 If the mes senger from
 Virginia had kept his counsels
 the fugitive could not have
 escaped and when the defects
 were supplied in the requisition
 he would shave been delivered
 up Mr LEAK E The
 gentleman s explanation reminds me
 of the account found in
 Falstaff s pocket one pennyworth
 of bread to five shillings
 of sack Mr COX Will
 the gentleman give mc a
 mo ment Mr LEAK E
 I will upon the same
 terms of extension of my
 time Objection was made The
 SPEAKER pro tctnpore The gentleman
 from Virginia will proceed as
 objection is made Mr COX
 I did not see any
 one nse in his seat
 and object Such is the
 rule and therefore I will
 proceed A II I wish
 to say in answer to
 the gentleman from Iowa Mr
 VANDE VER when he undertakes
 to show good faith upon
 the part of the Governor
 of Iowa is that he
 does not come up fully
 to the facts I happen
 to be informed of the
 facts in this very case
 That very Governor of Iowa
 himself sets out the facts
 in his corre spondence The
 reason which the gentleman from
 Iowa gives for the of
 Coppic is a in custody
 because he was a great
 public crimi nal who had
 outraged social order and the
 sov ercignty of a State
 remanded him to prison and
 sent noticc to the Governor
 of Virginia and in the
 end had him remanded to
 Virginia If the Repub lican
 Governors had acted in that
 spirit we would not now
 havc been in this perilous
 condition caused in part by
 the infraction of this peculiar
 provision of the Constitution Mr
 VANDEVER 1 would ask the
 gentle man from Ohio if
 in the statement ho has
 Mr LEAK E I cannot
 yield any further unless my
 time is extended Mr VANDEVER
 occupy but a few minutes
 The gentleman from Ohio deprecates
 technicalities and still he himsclC
 has fallen into a gross
 technicality in reförence to the
 powers of a notary public
 A notary public is not
 a judi Cial oflicer and
 I prcsurnc the Governor of
 Iowa is just as conversant
 with the facts of this
 case as the gentleman from
 Ohio As to the aiteration
 in the law of 1850
 Vie knew it and we
 all know it Although that
 law was changed in 185
 yet if it conferred any
 judicial powers upon notaries pub
 lic it conferred them to
 bc exercise l in strict
 ac cordance with the law
 The latitudc allowed by law
 or custom to notaries in
 the discharge of the functions
 pertaining to their peculiar and
 appro priate duties does not
 exlend to their acts when
 exercising the powers conferred by
 the act of 1850 If
 a which are judicial rather
 than ministerial scroll is lawful
 in Virginia it does not
 necessa technical reason It is
 that there was no authen
 rily follow it is lawful
 in Iowa But here is
 a question of fact between
 the gen ticated seal upon
 the requisition and affidavit be
 tleman and myself as to
 what was in that affida
 I will say to the
 gentle fore the notary public
 man that the decisions of
 ourcourts have gone so vit
 and I allege again as
 I did in the outset
 that far as to hokd
 thatno such seal is required
 to such I the affdavit
 of Hunter contains no specific
 allega papers All that is
 necessary as our courts have
 tion that this man Coppic
 was within the juns decided
 again and again is a
 scroll which shall diction of
 Virginia It alleges that certain
 persons have the same effect
 as a seal But here
 there was i who had
 been condemned and had been
 executed the seal of Virginia
 authenticating thenotarial off were within
 the State of Virginia performinc
 cer cerand certificate These factsshow
 thatthisrequi tain unlawful acts and
 then states disconnectedly that they
 had been aided and abetted
 by Coppic sition for a
 murderer was rejected on the
 smallest I have the message
 of Governor Letcher in my
 sort of a technicality to
 commence with Again says the
 gentleman the affdavit was hands
 and it corroborates that view
 of the case made before
 a notary public while the
 law of Though thc gentleman
 from Ohio may volunteer 1793
 requires that a copy of
 the indicfinent af and becomc
 t he accuser of his
 mvn State i he will
 let Iowa alone she can
 take care of herself fldavit
 shall be made before a
 nagistrate that a Mr LEAKE
 I must interrupt the gentleman
 and resume my remarks I
 may be pardoned here if
 while upon this issue in
 regard to the repudiatiöå of
 thefugitive slave law I allude
 to the conduct of Virginiaqpon
 a question of a similar
 character In a qüeétion between
 New York and Virginia 18397
 azid 1840 when the Governor
 of New York was as
 think plotting against the Constitution
 and the whole tone of
 our fraternal system of Govern
 ment by refusing to surrendenlp
 men who had stolen negroes
 a man who had committed
 an of fense in New
 York escaped into Virginia T
 M Gilmer my own trusted
 and honored friend wis then
 the Governor of that State
 Mr Seward then Governor of
 New York made a requisition
 upon him for the man
 and Governor Gilmer im mediately
 notified him that he would
 hold the man in custody
 fora six months to see
 whether New York would comply
 with her constitutional obli gations
 He wanted to show that
 he thought this compact between
 the States ought to be
 carried out When the fact
 came to the knowledge of
 the Legislature of Virginia they
 with great unanim ity passed
 a resolution in which they
 declared that the Slate of
 Virginia would comply with the
 constitutional obligation to surrender fugitives
 although New YoFk had refused
 to do so That is
 but a specimen of the
 mode in which Virginia complies
 with her obligations under the
 Consti tution and the laws
 of the land Again I
 refer to thc action of
 a foreign Gov the mode
 in which they of as
 high solemnity and sanction as
 the Consti tution of the
 United States The courts of
 Can ado instcad of imitating
 the example of the Gov
 ernors of New York Ohio
 and Iowa have upon solemn
 deliberatiön remanded a slave who
 had committed murder and fled
 to Canada But I pass
 to another point want to
 show northern men where it
 is that this cot troversy
 finds its true origin and
 source Hence my allua Sion
 to this diffculty You have
 broken up the comity of
 States You have rcfused comphancc
 with constitutional obligations in the
 casqs to which I have
 alluded and many others And
 have alluded to them for
 the purpose of turnino again
 to the fact of the
 passage of your personal I
 said at the outset of
 my desultory liberty bills speech
 made more desultory than I
 thought It would be by
 repeated in terruptions thatthey had
 sanctified crime at the North
 You have done it through
 the instrumentality of your State
 author ities by declaring that
 what we in the South
 re gard as crime is
 entitled to immunity if not
 to protection at the North
 What more have you done
 Why you have offered a
 premium on perjury by declaring
 in your personal liberty laws
 that you will make it
 a high crime and mis
 demeanor to obey the Constitution
 and the laws of the
 land Eleven if not twelve
 of your StatcS have imposed
 pains and penalties upon the
 man who undertakes to execute
 the law of Congress for
 the recovery of fugitive slaves
 passed in pur suance of
 the precise terms of the
 Coristitution That is the amount
 of your personal liberty bills
 and they amount to nothing
 more and nothing less The
 whole six New England States
 have passed such laws Ohio
 hasakindred measure but not so
 strong New York has a
 pretty strong one and Pennsylvania
 too has an enactment upon
 her statute book looking to
 the same results While these
 eleven or twelve States thus
 come forward and solemnly nullify
 that law and the ConstitU
 tion which they are sworn
 to support and refuse compliance
 with its obligations gentlemen get
 up here and prate about
 South Carolina and Georgia and
 Florida and Alabama and Mississippi
 and Louisiana very soon and
 old Virginia before the 4th
 of March not consenting longer
 to be BUbiect to a
 Government to all the burdens
 of which they are bound
 to submit without deriving any
 of its benefits As i
 told yöu in the outset
 it is not the elec
 tion of Lincoln which is
 the cause of the dissolu
 tion of this Union There
 is evidence and con clusive
 evidence to my mind that
 the cause exists behind Lincoln
 s election It isthesectional party
 of which my colleague spoke
 Where is it and what
 is it It is easy
 for you now to repudiate
 the Garrisons and Giddingsesand Phillipses
 and the old Abolition organization
 but _history provos that those
 old Abolitionists werc the sappers

 tremendous organization which has at

 its pathway with the broken

 party has got into power
 You have the control of

 based upon tlie one idea
 of hostility to the South

 now that upon the 4th

 What is the rem Ody
 Sir the gentleman from Tennessee
 Mr NELSON if I understood
 him correctly almost ridiculed the
 idea of secession Did it
 occur to that amiable most
 excellent and talented gentleman that
 in denying the right of
 secession Mr NELSON Will the
 gentlernan ffivc way to mc
 for a moment Mr LEAK
 E I will sir if
 I can have my time
 extended Mr VAN WYCK to
 that Mr NELSON 1 gave
 way 1 think to the
 gentleman from Virginia and it
 was not taken out of
 m time Mr L AKE
 If it is anything personal
 hc I yield to the
 shall have the rest of
 my time entleman from Tennessee
 Mr NELSON I am obligcd
 to the gentleman from Virginia
 for his kindness in yielding
 the floor to me and
 I Shull endeavor not to
 abuse his courtesy What I
 have to say in regard
 to seces Sion is this
 it was condemned by Madison
 it it has bccn repudi
 was condemned by Jackson uted
 by the fathers of thc
 Republic The doc trine of
 pcaceal le secession is inconsistent
 with the Constitution for the
 Constitution is in the nature
 of a partnership bctwccn equal
 States and no one State
 has a right to destroy
 its obligati0i without the consent
 the others Mr Howell Cobb
 if I am not mistaken
 also sustains the doctrine which
 I have advocated hero to
 day Mr LEAKE Tho gentleman
 refers to the venerated name
 of Madison whose bonos repose
 quietly within twenty five rnilcs
 of rny own res idence
 but whose bones I doubt
 not would turn over in
 thc very grave at the
 pse now madc of his
 authority His language has been
 m totcd and again on
 the other side of the
 I louse Sir Will do
 no injustice to the memory
 of that pure patriot A
 belter ruan a nobler statesman
 this country has never produced
 Mr POTTLE obtained the floor
 Mr LEAKE My is up
 The SPEAKER tempore The time
 of gentleman from Virginia has
 expired Mr McCLERNAND The gentleman
 from Virginia yielded to interrupti0i
 s with the under standing
 that the time occupied by
 those interrup tions would be
 deducted from his hour I
 would inquire if that deduction
 has been made rrhe SPEAKER
 tempore The frona Virginia has
 been allowed twenty five min
 utes extra time His hour
 expired twenty five minutes a
 Y0 Mr LEAKE Will the
 House allow me ten minutes
 more I have voted to
 extend the time of every
 gentleman who has desired it
 Mr VANDEVER I trust no
 gentleman on this side of
 the House will object Mr
 BURNETT As gentleman only asks
 ten minutes I hope there
 will be no objection to
 allowing him that time The
 SPEAKER tempore Docs the Chair
 hear any objection to the
 gentleman from Virginia proceeding Mr
 POTTLE I desire to say
 that I obtained the floor
 upon the condition that I
 should not yield it for
 an adjournment bu t should
 gp on to night The
 gentleman from Virginia will see
 therefore that I must either
 give way entirely and abandon
 the purpose of speaking or
 go on now Mr LEAK
 E I will agree that
 the gentleman shall havo the
 floor in the morning will
 vote to adjourn for his
 accommodation Mi POTTLE That would
 be inconsistent with the understanding
 upon which I obtained the
 floor The SPEAKER tempore Theg
 tieman from New York will
 proceed time like Mr POTTLE
 Mr Speaker in this when
 the foundations of the Government
 are shaken and the spirit
 of revolution already em braces
 so large a portion of
 our country I shall try
 and avoid any and every
 cxpression calculated to add to
 the madness of the hour
 But in speak ing of
 the condition of the country
 and of the remedies brought
 before us to restore peace
 and harmony I believe it
 to be the duty ofa
 member of Congress to speak
 frankly and in no double
 or doubtful sense The march
 of events which has brought
 the country to its present
 position has been so rapid
 thattherc is no Ume for
 dalliance with smooth words Sternly
 and with a full sense
 of the weight of his
 responsibility each man no v
 takes his position prepared to
 abide its conse qucnces whatever
 they may be Five States
 have already by their State
 author ities severed then connection
 with the Govern ment and
 declared themselves out of the
 Union While active preparations are
 znaking by other States to
 follow their cxamplc and the
 claim is daily put fbrward
 here that unless the members
 from the frec States shall
 offer terms which shall be
 acceptable to the southern or
 slave States the example of
 secession x vill before the
 4th of March be followed
 by all of these States
 Nor have thcse States stopped
 with the declaration of their
 seces i hcse declarations have
 Sion from the Union been
 followed and ih some cases
 preceded by armed defiance of
 the General Government And overt
 acts of war in the
 closing of their ports to
 vessels bearin our flag in
 seizing thc property of the
 Government in firing upon a
 vessel bear irv troops and
 stores to a Government fort
 and in the arrest and
 imprisonment of a citizen for
 trea son because Imc remained
 faithful to thb Govern ment
 of the United States leave
 no doubt of the fact
 that in open rebellion they
 offer the plain and straigh
 tforward alternative of war or
 com pliance with their Sir
 I need hardly add that
 citizens in this at titudc
 menacing the Government with arms
 in thcir hands seenl hardly
 t o have lcft us
 in a posi tion considering
 our obligations by our oaths
 to snpport the Constitution of
 the United States to choose
 as to our course of
 action They would sccm fairly
 to have forced upon us
 the issuc of successful rebellion
 on their part or on
 ours such a manifestation of
 the power of thc Government
 I as shall recall them
 to their allegiance and coni
 pel them to seek for
 redress of grievances in the
 ordinary way under the Constitution
 But waiving all questions as
 to the propriety of listenin
 to terms from those whose
 bayonets are leveled at our
 breasts and whose cannon are
 threatening thc very Capitol in
 which we hold our deliberatiohs
 I am willing to listen
 attentively to all the complaints
 they have to make and
 vote for every redress to
 which they shall be enti
 Before attempting to satisfy our
 southern breth ren we must
 first try and ascertain what
 these grievances are of which
 tl ley complain I have
 listened patiently from day to
 day have read the debates
 of this House and of
 the Senate and have also
 carefully rcad the reasons assigned
 by the seceding Statos for
 these grievances and it appears
 to me that they all
 unide substantially on one ground
 and that was stated by
 the hon orable member from
 Missouri Mr ANDERSON in his
 speech the other day in
 the following words which I
 quote My section of the
 UniOn has never asked nor
 demanded more than its constitutional
 rights You surely do not
 en we will surrender them
 at yout bidding and thereby
 make ourselves inferiors in this
 Government The majority of the
 people of the free States
 have presumptuously to say the
 least of it by the
 election of Mr Lincoln with
 the indorse ment of his
 views and principles decided as
 we believe alterably determined that
 they will if not in
 the Union then out of
 it This then is the
 cause for breaking up a
 great and successful Government ingulfing
 the for tunes and lives
 of millions and wiping out
 in blood the history of
 the most favored nation upon
 It rs all put into
 one little sentence the globe
 The majority of the people
 of the free States have
 presumptuously to say the least
 of it laid down their
 platform of principles and elected
 a President If this means
 that a majority of the
 people of the free States
 have been guilty of an
 infringe ment upon theurights of
 thc South because in a
 peaceful and strictly constitutional manner
 they elected a President from
 their own section then the
 argumcntcomes su bstantially to this
 the South will remain in
 the Union so long it
 is allowed to rule it
 no longer And the North
 will be con sidered as
 conceding to it its constitutional
 rights so long only as
 it consents to be thus
 governed Even in this view
 I think the gentleman upon
 reflection will agree that one
 way or another the South
 has had this right with
 but few and brief interruptions
 from the beginning of the
 Govern ment until the present
 time If the gentleman means
 as I think he does
 that there is something in
 the principles of the Republican
 party calculated to work a
 denial to the South of
 its rights it would have
 been fair as it certainly
 would have been moi e
 satisfactory if he had referred
 us to the dangerous plank
 in our platform As he
 bases all his arguments upon
 matters growing out of the
 slavery question I shall take
 it for granted that it
 must be found if any
 where in that part of
 the creed of the Republican
 party which relates to that
 institution As the four propositions
 contained in our platform upon
 that sukject are brief and
 explicit I beo leave to
 read them That the maintenance
 inviolaæ of the rights of
 the States and especially the
 right of each State to
 order and control its own
 domestic institutions according to its
 own judgment exckusively is essential
 to that balance of power
 on which the perfection and
 endurance of our political fhb
 ric depends and we denounce
 the lawless invasion by armed
 force of the soil of
 any State or l crritory
 no matter under what pretext
 as among the gravest of
 crimes That the n ew
 dogma that the Constitution of
 its own force carries slavery
 into any or all of
 the Territories of the United
 States is a dangerous political
 heresy at variance with the
 explicit provisions of that instrument
 itselt with cotemporaneous exposition and
 with legislative and judi Cial
 precedent is revolutionary in its
 tendency and sub versive of
 the peace and harmony of
 the country That the normal
 condition of all the territory
 of the United States is
 that of freedom that as
 our republican fathers when they
 had abolished slavery in all
 our national territory ordained that
 no person should bc deprived
 of lite liberty or property
 without due process of law
 it becomes our duty by
 legislation vhcnever such legisla tion
 is necessary to maintain this
 proviSion of the Consti tution
 against all atten pts to
 violate it and we deny
 the authority of Congress ot
 a Territorial Legislature or of
 any individuals to ive legal
 existence to slavery in any
 Terri tory of the United
 States That We brand the
 recent reopening of the African
 slave trade under the cover
 of our national flag aided
 by perversions of judicial power
 as a crilne against humanity
 and a burning sharne to
 our country and age and
 we cail upon Congress to
 take prompt and efficient measures
 for the total and final
 suppression of that execrable traffic
 That is all The first
 in favor of maintaining the
 rights of the States inviolate
 and of preventimr invasion of
 or Territory Second that the
 dogma that the Constitution of
 its own force carries slavery
 into any Territory is at
 variance with the Constitution with
 cotemporaneous ex position and with
 legislative and judicial prece dent
 Third that slavery not existing
 in a Ter ritory by
 force of the Constitution it
 is not in the power
 of Congress or of a
 Territorial Legislature to give legal
 existence to it there Fourth
 op position to the reopening
 of the African slave t
 rade The very head and
 front of our offending Hath
 this extent no more For
 the assertion of which of
 these is it that this
 Government is to be broken
 into hostile sections and all
 the horrors of civil perhaps
 servile war superadded 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 569 it cannot
 be because we maintain the
 rights of the States or
 because we o ose the
 reopening of the African slave
 trade r telieve the honoråble
 member as much in favor
 of the one and opposed
 to the other as any
 Republican can be Nor do
 I think he will dispute
 what our platform asserts in
 regard to cotemporaneous construction of
 the Con stitution or of
 legislative and judicial precedent But
 the gentleman says Phe Supreme
 Court of the United States
 the ablest and most impartial
 tribunal known to the country
 unin fluenced by party clamor
 and party föeling have decided
 that we have the right
 under the Constitution to go
 to all the Territories of
 the United States with our
 slave prop erty and have
 it protected And the charge
 IS that we deny to
 them the In this he
 has right thus affirmed by
 the court hardly stated fäirly
 the position of the Repub
 lican party We deny to
 no section an estab Ushed
 right What we do deny
 is that any such right
 as that put forth by
 the gentleman has been established
 W c say first that
 the court has not so
 decided that in the case
 referred to it only decided
 that Dred Scott was by
 the record ad milted to
 be of African descent and
 by the laws of the
 State Of Missouri not a
 citizen of that State and
 therefore not entitled to sue
 and the causc was dismissed
 for want of jurisdiction But
 we say further that if
 what the court after having
 thus dismissed the cause took
 upon itself to say upon
 the constitutional question is to
 be taken as a part
 of its decision still it
 is at variance with contemporaneous
 c onstruction and lecrisla tive
 and judicial precedent and does
 not there fore establish a
 right which is beyond question
 But sir suppose t his
 decision to have been all
 that the gentleman claims what
 then Are not the same
 judges still on the bench
 Have we a ma jority
 in either branch of Congress
 to excitc fears that we
 will attempt to override it
 by legislation No But with
 every advantage upon the part
 of the South in sustaining
 this dictum of the court
 and making it the established
 construction of the Constitution gentlemen
 speaking for States say they
 can no longer stay in
 t hc Union unless we
 will stop doubting the correctness
 of the court in this
 case Surely sir nothing short
 of mental madness could lead
 to the conclusion that it
 was good ground for breaking
 up a Government that there
 exists among its citizens differences
 of opinion upon constitutional questions
 questions too upon which the
 decisions of the court have
 been by no means uniform
 From a careful perusal ofthe
 speech ofmy friend and of
 other speeches from his section
 I have been forced to
 the conclusion that it is
 not the principles of the
 Republican party which are ob
 jected to by our friends
 of the South so much
 as the belief which they
 hold that the great mass
 of the northern people believe
 that slavery is wrong Sir
 for one I cannot deny
 that such is the opin
 think a very ion of
 the nonhern people majority of
 them do honestly earnestly so
 think Alid he must have
 read American history to little
 purpose who does not find
 that once that opinion was
 shared by nearly all of
 the leading men of I
 do not intend to quote
 the great the South names
 of southern statesmen either dead
 or liv ing who have
 expressed this opinion for their
 opinions and great names seem
 now to have no influence
 and small respect in that
 section of the Union The
 gentleman says that we of
 the North are opposed to
 the institution of slavery that
 we speak of it as
 a relic of barbarism again
 say that I believe thegentleman
 fairly states the north ern
 feeling But i deny that
 because such is our opinion
 and such our feeling in
 rcgat d to negro slavery
 we want to deny to
 any State absolute control of
 its domestic institutions or its
 full rights under the Constitution
 When this Constitution v zas
 formed there was nothing expressed
 or implied that the citizens
 of the several States should
 surrender their opinions upon any
 subject to the General Government
 What they diil agree was
 to observe fuithfully all the
 reserved rights of the States
 and I say to gentlemen
 of the South we witl
 obsorvc your rights but you
 cannot compel us to suppress
 our opinions nor do I
 believe you will by your
 pres ent attitude induce us
 to modify them in regard
 to slavery You have a
 right clearly to insist that
 slavery in the States is
 a matter belonging exclusively to
 you and to be left
 to manage it within State
 limits as you think best
 you have the right also
 to expect nay to demand
 a faith ful observance on
 our part of that provision
 in the Constitution in relation
 to the rendition of fugi
 tives from service I do
 not say that you have
 the right to avail yourselvcs
 of party power and make
 a law pur posety obnoxious
 and of doubtful constitutionality even
 in the opinion of South
 Carolina statesmen and demand of
 us to execute it with
 alacrity and with expressions of
 pleasure Yet the presentlaw subject
 as it is to both
 of these objections and although
 r orthern men feel the
 shame which you put upon
 them in thc execution of
 it sting likea feel that
 you call upon them to
 do what wound gentlemen from
 the South would hardly do
 for themselves wedo still execute
 with fidelity Few State laws
 were ever executed with more
 and none in my State
 which was repugnant to public
 sentiment was ever executed with
 so much as this has
 been And more than this
 sir the weight of public
 sentiment has always been that
 oppressive as the law is
 and believed to be quite
 as effcient for kidnapping as
 for returning fugitives it was
 better to execute it and
 trust to Congress and the
 mao nanimity of the South
 to modify its more offensive
 features And such I believe
 to have been the feeling
 generally in the other frcc
 States No considerable body of
 men at the North have
 ever denied the right of
 the South to have such
 a fugitive slave law as
 the Constitution contem plates or
 that it should be faithfully
 executed admit that occasionally there
 have been cases like the
 Jerry rescue case in my
 own State where the officers
 of the law havc been
 interfered with But there is
 good reason to believe that
 for every slave rescued two
 free negroes have bccn kid
 napped under the law If
 the law was what it
 should be neither of these
 cases would occur again in
 New York and if tbe
 committee of thirty three have
 succeeded in making such recommend
 ations as shall accomplish this
 purpose they have to that
 extent done good service and
 ought to be sustained I
 know sir that two wrongs
 do not make a right
 and that a disregard of
 the rights of one section
 is never atoned for by
 a corresponding dis rcgard by
 the other section But Sir
 while we are talking of
 compromises while we are pre
 paring to have all things
 put rightand everybody satisfied would
 it not be well to
 inquire some thing in regard
 to the observance of that
 portion of section two article
 four of the Constitution which
 provides that the citizens of
 each State shall be entitled
 to the privileges and innnunities
 of citizcns in the several
 States Sir is it ask
 ing too much of gentlemen
 who speak so warmly of
 our faults to sotnetimes think
 of our rights Gent ltnnen
 of the South talk of
 our aversion to negro slavery
 of our personal liberty bills
 bills to prevent kidnapping and
 of the escape of an
 occasional fugitive slave as things
 which arc sub versive of
 their rights But since I
 havc been in Congress do
 not remember to have ever
 heard them allude to southern
 statutes in derogation to northern
 rights nor of the hanging
 drowning and scourging of northern
 men in the southern States
 sill l ly because they
 were norlhcrn men holding principles
 in common with the rnajority
 of northern men nor of
 citizens of southern States driven
 from their States because they
 exercised the right which the
 Constitution gave them of voting
 for whom they pleased If
 a cataloguewcrc fairly made I
 think it would be found
 that there were wrongs to
 be redressed on both sides
 And sir I regret that
 the distinguished chairman of the
 committee of thirty three did
 not in his able re
 port make some allusion to
 facts like those re ferred
 to facts of world wide
 notoriety That report is ample
 in suggestions to guard southern
 rights and to restrain the
 northern press and northern speech
 but I have looked in
 vain through it for one
 single suff Testion in defense
 of northern righ ts As
 the North seldom complains perhaps
 the committee did not feel
 called upon to look in
 that direction although I thilllc
 I am not mistaken in
 saying that a resolution calling
 their attention to this subject
 was referred to them Upon
 this point I have but
 a word more to say
 and that is that no
 compromise that does not look
 to the pro tection of
 the rights of the citizens
 of all the Slates under
 the Constitution can receive my
 Vote and one that does
 by whomsoever brought forward I
 will vote for It is
 all that is needed to
 day to give peace to
 the country But sir the
 gentlemen from Missouri makes another
 complaint I quote again from
 his speech Many 01 our
 slaves are now impressed with
 tlje idea that after the
 inauguration ot Mr Lingoln they
 are to be free This
 impression nukes tl cm restless
 and discon tented renders our
 homes our wives and our
 cliildren unsafe Surely no ratkona
 man expects us to liVe
 With such a state of
 things in our midst We
 cannot we not I can
 understand this I can imagine
 something of the horrors of
 life when servile tour han
 s over one s State
 one s family one s
 self The sword of Damocles
 was nothing to a condition
 like this But sir who
 impressed the minds of the
 slaves with the idea that
 after the inauguration of Lin
 coln they were to be
 free Surely t his was
 not occasioned by the licentiousness
 of the press spoken of
 in thc report of the
 committee for slaves do not
 read and if they did
 the whole South ig as
 hermetically sealed against the northern
 press as the Barbary States
 ever were Neither was it
 the licentiousness of spccch on
 the part of north ern
 men for you have long
 steadily refused them a hearing
 within your borders No gentlemen
 of the South this was
 not our work but your
 In your eacrerness to secure
 all the non own slaveholding
 votes In your States and
 prevent the I spread of
 Republican principles there you tra
 duced us instead of telling
 or allowing us to tell
 frankly to your people what
 were our principles and thereby
 showing that we were as
 loyal to the Constitution and
 as true to the rights
 of the sev eral States
 as any party that ever
 existed in the Republic you
 denounced us as Black Republi
 cans as Abolitionists as advocating
 social equal ity with the
 negroes and the mixing of
 the races as armed with
 fire and sword against the
 rights of the South sand
 only waiting success in the
 elec tion of out President
 to march down to the
 south ern States and make
 the white man subordinate to
 the black Your servant behind
 your chair as he waited
 at your table your field
 hand as hc plied the
 hoe and the loun yer
 aftcr work hours with open
 ears took in your words
 and but half com prehending
 them yet fully alive to
 the fact that they were
 of freedom freedom to him
 and to his race spread
 them through your negro quarters
 and over your plantations and
 if the curse which you
 meant for us comes home
 upon yourselves It will not
 be the first instance of
 the kind but only another
 instance of the vindication if
 that that those who want
 justice must higher law do
 it to others Sir I
 believe before God that the
 best guaran tee which the
 South could have to day
 for future safety would bc
 to frankly tell its citizens
 and its slaves that the
 aims and objects of the
 Republican party had been misunderstood
 and misrepresented that it has
 nothing to do with slavery
 in the States that it
 intends to uphol uhe rights
 of every man and cvery
 State under the Constitution so
 far ras it has power
 so to do Publish this
 truth as truth it is
 and in much less time
 than your compro mise committee
 has been deliberating how to
 perform impossibilities you would find
 peace and prosperity returning to
 you again and instead of
 a broken Union and warlike
 preparations to imbrue our hands
 in each others blood we
 could again show the world
 that we were not only
 a neat but a united
 nation Men brethren of the
 gouth this wrong has bcen
 one which you have brought
 upon yourselves you have taken
 the path of wrong instead
 of that of right And
 no committee no congressional or
 constitutional compromise will ever make
 the former lead into I
 say it with ali deference
 you must the latter either
 retrace your steps or follow
 out the wrong to its
 bitter but inevitable consequences The
 gentleman from Missouri asks us
 to amend I quote from
 his speech the Constitution now
 appeal to the Representatives of
 the non slave holding States
 to propose amendments to the
 Constitution that will secure to
 the South her just and
 equal rights that give to
 the country quiet and repose
 Amend the Constitution to give
 to the slave holding States
 their just and equal rights
 Why sir is not this
 the Constitution made by your
 fathers as well as ours
 Was it not made by
 men who were nearly all
 slaveholders and at a time
 570 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 25 when all the States
 but one were slave States
 And now after more than
 three quarters of a cen
 tury of domestic peace and
 unrivaled prosperity increasing our population
 from four to million extending
 our commerce to every sea
 and making our namexespected by
 every people we are told
 that unless we will change
 the Con stitution which has
 wrought such results ay and
 change it too so as
 to make it more pro
 slavery than slaveholders who were
 making it for slave States
 made it all this prosperity
 shall melt away and the
 great American Republic like the
 baseless fabric ofa dream dissolve
 into thin air or exi
 t only for the purpose
 of illustrating the world s
 history with the red horrors
 of civil and servile war
 Did you ask us not
 to take from you your
 rights under this Constitution then
 I could stand here and
 assure you of one at
 least who would heed I
 would defend your rights as
 my your request own and
 as I would my own
 But never sir never whilc
 I have a voice or
 a vote to protest against
 it will I consent to
 a change ofthc Con If
 you wring this stitution for
 such a purpose compromise from
 the fears or the love
 of Union of the North
 it will not bring you
 peace It will only be
 the beginning of violence The
 Govern mcnt once demoralized by
 yielding to menace what in
 sober judgment It had just
 refused at the ballot box
 every dissatisfied State or section
 would in turn threaten the
 Union and right after righ
 t would be yielded until
 weakness and anarchy would at
 length co npel us to
 change thc namc of Republic
 for the substance of a
 government strong enough to protect
 itself against the clamor of
 jarring sections But sir were
 wo to submit to the
 people an amendment of the
 Constitu tion which vou Id
 satis fy the gentleman from
 Missouri would it satisfy all
 other demands and bril g
 peace No The Senator from
 Texas Mr WIGFALL makes exactions
 far beyond the power o
 uny utnend ment cven if
 you would allow him to
 draw it h i nugelf
 And the honorable member frcnn
 tho State Mr REAGAN in
 his speech the other day
 said all know that we
 cannot and dare not live
 in this Union with ottr
 rights denied by the Republican
 party Its ascendency is our
 destruction and sir its destruction
 this day is the only
 salvation the Union well sir
 it would be asking much
 of great party which had
 canvassed the country for six
 years and finally received a
 verdict of indorse ment for
 principles as well understood as
 any ever subjected to the
 ordeal of the ballot box
 to give up Its success
 tind Iny its victorious banner
 at thc rect of the
 vanquished submitting itself to utter
 destruction its name never heard
 except when uttcrcd with scorn
 and contempt But although I
 have deemed it a privilege
 to contribute In y labors
 to tho success of this
 party I would fbr one
 constnnt to all this if
 I lhought it would restore
 peace and prosperity to this
 distracted land It 15 because
 believe the only chance of
 tho Urjion rests to day
 u tbc principles of this
 party it bccause I be
 ievo its only salvation Icpcnds
 upon the lnain tenance of
 those principles and that thc
 rights of all sections can
 only bc secured by administering
 the Gov upon them that
 I cannot consent to aid
 in the destruction of Republican
 party But even the destruction
 of this party would not
 sat isfy our southern bretl
 lren unless accompanied by guarantees
 that no other party should
 interfere with southern domination The
 Senator from Alabama Mr CLAY
 in a recent letter says
 of the free States Thev
 are the most bitter relentless
 and vindictive enernies we have
 on earth course we cannot
 five under the same Government
 with these people unless we
 could control it Allow thc
 South to govern this country
 and you would reach the
 real difficulty And I respect
 fülly submit to the compromisc
 committee that un less their
 propositions will accomplish th is
 they have failed fear to
 offer such a compromise or
 concession for it is all
 on one side as will
 be found satisfactory 1 border
 slaves States than any and
 all others looked upon it
 as inviting bids for terms
 upon which they would stay
 in the Union and I
 think subsequent events have shown
 that they so un derstood
 it and no compromise man
 should feel disappointed at finding
 what they demand beyond his
 power to give The only
 question now seems to be
 whether you can induce them
 to lower their demands Sir
 shall leave this whole matter
 to be settled by those
 who opened proposals and I
 wash my hands of all
 part or lot in the
 matter I am ready to
 give any and all guarantees
 that are within our power
 that the constitutional righté of
 all sections shall bc obscrvcd
 not merely in the letter
 but in the spirit also
 I seek no evasion of
 them myself nor do thepeople
 for whom I speak W
 c havc been compromising for
 forty years und what has
 it availed Shall we contil
 ue to try remedies that
 have only aggravated the disease
 It is said if we
 vote against compromises we vote
 for war I say no
 We vote for peace we
 want peace we offer you
 your rights under the Constitution
 as it is rights which
 secure you greater blessings than
 you will ever find under
 any other constitution or in
 any other union And we
 beg of you in God
 s name to accept of
 peace now while we can
 offer it We beg of
 you by all the memories
 of the past by all
 the hopes of the future
 by your reverence for the
 memories of the dead and
 your love of your children
 to reconsider your hasty and
 rash resolves and to unite
 with us Pain your hands
 around the Con stitution of
 our country and join in
 renewed oaths to maintain it
 forever can even now by
 our common devotion wipe out
 or forget the stain which
 our broils have brought upon
 our flag It is idle
 to shut our eyes to
 the fact that we are
 fast drifting beyond the point
 of reconciliation It would be
 worse thun idle it would
 bc cowardly not to prepare
 to meet this question squarely
 Let no dcccive himsclf with

 us that if war coines
 they will show us how
 bravc men can die I
 do not doubt it and
 I tell the gentleman in
 reply that he knows little
 of the North if he
 thinks the example wili be
 thrown away upon us Sirs
 you do injustice to our
 common ancestry if you doubt
 that we too can meet
 the shock of battle upon
 equal terms with you in
 this respect Who doubts the
 cour age of either section
 Surely we do not need
 to plunge the country in
 war to settle this question
 Are we not the sons
 of those who in t
 hc old days upon a
 hundred battle fields proved their
 common valor upon a common
 foe Do not the bones
 of our brothers lie bleach
 ir g together upon the
 fron tier and upon the
 plains of Mexico Nay are
 not many of those among
 us who escaped death on
 those fields and who not
 only belong to both sections
 but whose vnior is the
 pride ofboth sections But if
 war must come we Inust
 meet it And when thc
 roused millions shall once have
 been marshaled and the havoc
 begun thcrc will be slight
 care for t he nice
 dis tinctions in regard to
 State rights or whether a
 sovereign State can bc coerced
 9 the honor of that
 flag which never yet was
 lowered will be maint ained
 and the Government of the
 United States will I trust
 bc sustained though millions should
 perish in thc conflict My
 position sir first and last
 is the Constitu tion as
 it is and a just
 and impartial enforcement of the
 laws When I say that
 in the event of h
 var all nice distinctions in
 regard to State rights would
 be lost sight or I
 speak o it as a
 consequence and not as a
 thing which would advise either
 in peace or war I
 do not think as Government
 is constituted it is either
 the province or tho right
 of the General Government to
 coerce or in any manner
 interfere with States as such
 The al legiancc due to
 the General Government is not
 that of States but of
 the people of the United
 Sir for one I shall
 vote all propositions States and
 it cither has the power
 to enforce changing the status
 of slavery under the Consti
 I obedience of the people
 wrho constitute the Gov I
 voted against the raising of
 the conunit I tution ernmcnt
 of the United States to
 all the laws of the
 tec and bclicvc to day
 that movement has corE United
 States or it ceases to
 bc u Government tributed rnore
 to the present excitement in
 the II And the arotunent
 that a State can absolve
 its cit izens citizens also
 of the United States from
 their obligations to the General
 Government is but another way
 of denying the existence of
 such Government It looks to
 me like an absurdity to
 say that the General Government
 is bound in all events
 to pro tect the ri
 hts of its citizens but
 can in no event exact
 obedience from them to those
 laws when a State chooses
 to intervene And I therefore
 re peat that I have
 no doubt after all the
 ingenious discussions in regard to
 State rights shall have been
 exhausted the practical result will
 be that the General Government
 will exact obedience to its
 laws from all its citizens
 in whatever State they may
 be and that coercion of
 States oi interference with States
 will only happen when a
 State shall attempt to place
 itself between the offender against
 law and his Government In
 the present attitude of the
 seceding States such a conflict
 may be expected in every
 case where the General Government
 attempts to pun ish an
 offender aoainst its laws within
 their bound aries And we
 are thus at once brought
 to the alternativeofadmittingthat these States
 have been successful in their
 revolution and that their cit
 izens are no longer citizens
 of the General Gov ernment
 or we arc compelled to
 attempt to enforce obedience to
 our laws That we shall
 accept the first and acquiesce
 in a peaceful separation of
 such States few or many
 as choose to withdraw from
 the Union I do not
 expect Whether such a course
 would be for the best
 considering the diversity of our
 institutions and the exasperated state
 of the public mind in
 the dif ferent sections if
 proper arrangements for bou nd
 aries and intercourse between the
 sections thus divided could be
 agreed upon or if we
 could know where to find
 a limit to secession it
 is hardly worth white now
 to inquire It is sufiicient
 to know that the tcmper
 of our people is such
 that these questions can never
 be settled peaceably Their interests
 are so interwoven with every
 State and every section that
 I am satisfied they will
 never consent to a dissolu
 tion of the Union of
 these States until years of
 conflict shall have severed these
 intorcsts and fixed boundaries between
 us as hostile nations And
 sir I wish I could
 add that I had good
 grounds to hope that these
 Swes would not com pcl
 us to the othcr alternative
 of attempting to enforce obedience
 to our laws But vhen
 that attempt is rnadc as
 madc it must be I
 expect it will be made
 to the uttermostcxtcnt of the
 power and resources of the
 Government and that the Government
 at whatever cost will enforce
 obe dience to its laws
 or break down in the
 attempt Sir we cannot escape
 this alternative We may shrink
 from the horrors of civil
 war as who does not
 We may carry our imaginations
 for v ard until every
 State is seen drenched in
 blood every business interest laid
 ill ruins cities smoul dcrincy
 in ashes widows and orphans
 filling the land with their
 wailings and whole districts once
 populous the homes of happy
 millions turned into deserts by
 the dernon of war and
 yet we are compelled to
 come back to the some
 point The citizens of this
 Govcrnment must yield obedience to
 the laws or the Government
 must compel that obedience even
 though all these shall become
 realities even though we know
 they must become realities Men
 of the South 9 why
 will you force this alter
 native upon the Government You
 have received every assurance which
 northern Representatives in Congress can
 give you that every nonhern
 statute if any such there
 be which obstructs your constitutional
 rights shall be swept away
 r he powers of the
 Government are so balanced that
 you can receive no injury
 at the hand of the
 incoming Administration and you have
 had every assurance that Illen
 can have or oive that
 none is intended Should all
 these fail will it not
 be time to make the
 attempt to break up such
 a Govern ment as this
 wlien the administration of Mr
 Lincoln shall have evinced an
 intention of over stepping the
 bounds of the Constitution Should
 such an attempt ever be
 made you would find thousands
 yes millions of northern men
 who shoulder to shoulder with
 you would resist the attempt
 and vindicate not only your
 rights but their own But
 if deaf to reason and
 to all the assurallces 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE of your
 rights which we tender you
 you will rush upon war
 will compel the Government to
 enforce obedience to its laws
 neither you nor history can
 place the responsibility for the
 consequences of such madness upon
 the free States It will
 be all your own And
 after all what is it
 that you propose to gain
 even by a successful revolution
 You leave us because we
 do not like your institution
 of sla very Do you
 think it will increase our
 love for it to make
 it the cause of destroying
 the Govern ment bankrupting our
 business and slaughtering our pcoplc
 These are not the incentives
 to love but to fierce
 uncompromising unrelenting hatred incentives which
 will lead to the determination
 to wipe out utterly and
 forever an institution which brings
 such evils upon us That
 such is the expectation of
 those who seek the overthrow
 of slavery in the States
 will be seen by an
 extract which I read frotn
 a late address of Mr
 Wendell Phillips at Boston Disunionisan
 is abolitionism That is all
 I care for it I
 care not forms of government
 but for its essence The
 music of disunion to mc
 is that at its touch
 the slave breaks tort h
 in jubilee Disunion leaves God
 s natu laws to work
 out their solution insurrection is
 the tyrant s Lct us
 stand out of God s
 way and His divine laws
 check will have free course
 The ways of the Govcrnment
 are just as nucll permeated
 with slavery as are those
 of _ hina and Japan
 with idolatry You complain that
 we do not return your
 fugi I have already said
 that I believed tive slaves
 the complaint substantially groundless but
 if true If war does
 not break the shackles what
 then of every slave in
 the Government do you expect
 when we are your enemies
 and released from all obligations
 which the Constitution imposes upon
 us that we shall voluntarily
 turn necrro catchers for you
 You cannot you do not
 exiject this What then are
 you to gain You have
 answered this question many times
 here by replying that you
 intended to gain your independence
 dependence from whom From those
 who are ready at any
 and all times to shed
 thcir blood in your defcnse
 from those oniy upon the
 face of God s earth
 who do or will guaranty
 protection to your institution of
 slavery Mr Speaker I should
 in common with millions in
 this country and elsewhere hail
 the day when this subject
 of contention should no longer
 cxist among us when we
 could with truth adopt the
 boast of England and say
 that slaves could no longer
 breathe our atmosphere and freedom
 uni versal freedom in the
 broadest sense of our Dec
 laration of Independence be the
 right and condi tion of
 every human being But sir
 i love my country and
 have sworn to support its
 Constitu tion and will do
 it and I have no
 sympathy in common with those
 who would seek a realization
 of universal freedom over the
 ruins of that Con stitution
 I am willing to takc
 the institutions of rny coun
 try as I find them
 Under them we have been
 prosperous and happy and although
 the storm which threatens us
 seems charged with destruc but
 trust that the Prov tion
 I wilk not despair idence
 which has thus far watched
 over and pro tccted us
 will still protect us and
 that we shall continue one
 Government one pcoplc challcn r
 ing admiration and respect everywhere
 by the working of our
 system of self government I
 havc heard It said here
 and elsewhere by southern men
 that tl le North was
 divided that there were thousands
 there who would take sides
 with the South against the
 Government Do not North deceive
 yourselves upon this point is
 to day a unit not
 against you but for the
 en forcement of the laws
 If they have the power
 as I think they have
 the flag which you have
 insulted will be vindi cated

 wrested frorn withdraw that motion

 if wc have got time
 to investigate it The rcport
 of the Conunittee on Invalid

 appears therefrom that Bar bara
 Walker was the widow now
 deceased of Gideon iValker who
 died in the service of
 the United States during the
 wur of 1812 that the
 mother of tho petitioners was
 entitled too half pay i

 THOLMAS I ask the unanimous
 consent of the House that
 leave be granted for tho
 with drawal from the files
 of the House of the
 papers in the case of
 Peter Van Buskirk in order
 that they may be referred
 to the Pension Offce There
 was no objection and it
 was ordered accordingly IIOCKADAY AND
 LIGGIT The SPEAKER laid before
 the House a mes sagc
 from the President of the
 United States re turning with
 his objections to the I
 louse in which it originated
 a bill entitled An act
 for the relief of Hockaday
 Liggit Mr SHERMAN As that
 message relates to a private
 and not a public matter
 I hope that time Will
 not be consumed with its
 reading but that it will
 be to the proper committee
 I think that is the
 usual course 1 know that
 it is courte ous to
 have read veto messæres on
 public Inatters Mr BURNETT The
 usual course is 1 think
 to have read all messages
 from the President of the
 United States The House after
 the reading of a veto
 messao e proceeds at once
 to the ques tion of
 reconsideration I have had time
 only to look to the
 provision of the Constitution on
 the subject Mr SHERMAN The
 to reconsider the case and
 it may reconsider it by
 referrin it to one of
 the standincr committees It is
 a private claim and I
 think it ought to be
 re 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 Mr BURNETT 1 win say
 that this claim has been
 twice considered by the committee
 of this House and the
 cömmittee of the Senate and
 surely wc arc in as
 good condition to judge of
 its merits now as we
 will be at any future
 time Mr SHERMAN What committee
 did the bili come from
 Mr BURNETT The Committee Post
 Offce and Post Roads Mr
 SHERMAN Then submit motion that
 the message be nox v
 referred to the same committee
 Mr BURNETT 1 hope that
 motion will be voted down
 and that the House will
 now dispose of this case
 Mr SHERMAN There is no
 reason why the message should
 be read I know that
 it is respect ful to
 the President to have his
 messages on pub lic matters
 read to the House but
 there is no wyant of
 courtesy toward him it messages
 on private claims are referred
 without reading The SPEAKER The
 messages of Presi dent ought
 to be read as they
 are spread upon the Journal
 The Clerk read the message
 as follow s To the
 House of Representatiues of the
 United States ret urn with
 my objections to the House
 in which it originated the
 bill entitled An act for
 the relicf of Elockaday Liggit
 presented to me on the
 15th instant This bill appropriates
 59 576 G to Hockaday
 Li rgit in full payment
 for damages sustained by them
 in reduction of pay for
 carrying the mails on route
 No 8911 and that said
 amount be paid to William
 Liggit for and on account
 of Hocka bill containing the
 same language with the single
 exception that the sum appropriated
 therein was 40 000 instead
 of 59 both Houses of
 Congress at their last session
 but it was pre scnted
 to me at so late
 a period of the session
 that could not examine its
 merits before the time fixed
 for the adjournment and it
 thercfore under the Constitution failed
 to bccome a law The
 increase of the sum appropriated
 in the present bill over
 that in the bill of
 the last session being induced
 me to examine the question
 with some attention and I
 find that the bill involves
 an im portant principle which
 if established by Con gress
 may take targe sums out
 of the Treasury It appears
 that on the 1st day
 of April 1858 John M
 Hockaday entered into a contract
 with the Postmaater General for
 transporting the mail on route
 No 8911 from St Joseph
 Missouri by Fort Kearny Nebraska
 Territory and Fort Leavenworth to
 Salt Lake City for the
 sum of 190 000 per
 annum for a weekly service
 The service was to commence
 on the 1st day of
 May 1858 and to terminate
 on the 30th November 1860
 By this contract the Postmaster
 General reserved to himself the
 ri Fht to reduce the
 service to semi monthly whcnevcr
 the necessities of the public
 and the condition of affairs
 in the Territory of Utah
 may not require it more
 frequently A nd that the
 Postmaster General may discon agatn
 tinue or curtail t he
 service in whole or in
 part in order to place
 on the route a greater
 degrec of service or whenever
 the public interests require such
 discontinuance for any other cause
 hc allow incr one month
 s extra pay on the
 amount of ser vice dispensed
 vrrith On the 11th April
 1859 the Postmaster General curtailed
 the service which he had
 a clear right to do
 under the contract to semi
 monthly with an annual deduction
 of 65 000 leaving the
 compen sation 125 000 for
 twenty four trips per year
 instead of 190 000 for
 fifty two trips This cur
 tailment wras not to take
 effect till the 1st of
 July At the time the
 contract was made it vas
 ex of War upon the
 subject in the course of
 which the Secretary agreed that
 a weekly mail to St
 Joseph and Salt Lake City
 was no longer needed for
 the purposes of the Government
 This evi dently because the
 trouble in Utah had ended
 Mr Hockaday faithfully complied with
 his con tract and the
 ftdl compensation was paid at
 the rate of 190 000
 per annum up to the
 1st July 1859 arid one
 month S extra pay on
 the amount of service dispensed
 with according to the con
 tract PreviOus to that date
 as has been already stated
 on the 14th April 1859
 the Postmaster General curtailed the
 service to twice per month
 and on the 11th May
 1859 Messrs Hockaday Co assigned
 the contract to Jones Russell
 Co for a bonus of
 50 000 Their property connected
 with the route was to
 be appraised which was effected
 and they received on this
 account about ninety four thousand
 dollars making the whole amount
 about one hundred and forty
 four thou sand dollars There
 is no doubt that the
 contractors have sustained considerable loss
 in the whole transac tion
 The amount I shall not
 pretend to decide whether 40
 000 or 59 476 or
 any other sum It will
 be for Congress to consider
 whether the precedent establisheü by
 this bill will not in
 effect annul all restrictions contained
 in the mail con tracts
 enabling the Postmaster General to
 reduce or curtail lhe postal
 service according to the pub
 I have no other lic
 exigencies as they may arise
 I am informed that solicitude
 upon the subject there are
 many cases in the Post
 Office Depart ment depending upon
 the same principle JAMES BUCHANAN
 WASHINGTON CITY January 25 1861
 Mr BURNETT 1 hope the
 gentleman rom Ohio will withdraw
 his motion to refer the
 mes sagc to the Committee
 on the Post Offce and
 Post Roads in order that
 we may act on the
 question at once Mr SHERMAN
 I am willing to take
 a vote on the reconsideration
 and I therefore withdraw the
 motion to refer Mr MAYNARD
 1 trust that the members
 of the House will have
 that message in print before
 they are called upon to
 act onit Cries of No
 think we ought to have
 such an opportunity in order
 that we may vote understandingly
 on it It will be
 recollected in what difficulty we
 were put by hasty legislation
 at the last session in
 a similar case I do
 not Mr BURNETT 1 have
 the floor propose to detain
 the House with anything like
 a speech on the mcrits
 of this veto message A
 statement of the reasons why
 it ought not to change
 our former action can briefly
 be given Mr Speaker under
 all the circumstances sur rounding
 this case this veto message
 must be regarded as an
 extraordinary one r I lie
 President cohccdes the loss of
 these parties but adds that
 notwithstanding they have been seriously
 dam aged by thc action
 of the Postmaster General it
 is improper for the House
 of Representatives to do them
 justice Hc declares that we
 ought not to pay them
 the losses they have actually
 sus tained because then a
 precedent would be estab lished
 for doing justice to other
 contractors who had been damaged
 by the action of the
 Federal Government This House will
 remember that in 1858 59
 by the failure of the
 Congress of the United States
 to make appropriations for the
 service of the Post Office
 Department that then thc Postmaster
 Gen eral having no money
 as a reason fop it
 issued his orders curtailing the
 service upon various mail contracts
 in this country in some
 instances fifty per cent and
 in others forty and thirty
 per cent This House will
 remember that on the 14th
 day of April 1859 the
 question involved in the Presi
 dent s messao c was
 fully discussed by gentlemen pected
 that the army in Utah
 might be engaged in I
 in this House The gentleman
 from North Caro lina Mr
 I do not say it
 with active operations and hence
 the necessity of fre quent
 conununications betwecn the War Depart
 any disrespect to the President
 of the United ment and
 that Tcrritory The reservation of
 the States presented the reasons
 much more forcibly I and
 much more clearly in reference
 to the prin the bill
 passed the House upotf the
 untanimöus report Of the Post
 Offee Committee all the ixie
 m bei s of that
 committee concurrino in the report
 which was made It went
 to the other end of
 the Capitol find was referred
 to the Post Offce Com
 mittee of the Senate The
 whole question Was there reviewed
 in one Of the most
 elaborate reports I have ever
 read discussing at length all
 the ques tions involved in
 the mcssage of the President
 of the United States to
 tlie HOusc Iri the Sbnatc
 t he queStion was again
 elabo ratcly discussed and the
 objections which the President has
 urged were presented But it
 washcld that Where a contraCtor
 under the Government has complied
 faithfully with his contract and
 in consequence of the action
 of one of the Departments
 of the Government he has
 suffered loss under his contract
 the Govern ment ouoht under
 these circumstances to reim burse
 the contractor to the extent
 of his löSseB This principle
 was settled in both ends
 of the Capitol after a
 very full and thorough discussion
 both upon the floor of
 the House and Senate Well
 sir what occurred during the
 present session I his bill
 was taken up and reported
 acain unanimously by the same
 committee which first reported it
 The same amount was again
 reported and upon their unanimous
 report the bill passed the
 House without a singfe objection
 Mr IIOLMAN I wish to
 ask the gentleman from Kentucky
 why the Post Offce Committee
 in the present session increased
 the amount some twenty thousand
 dollars Mr BURNETT If the
 gentleman will hear me through
 he will find that the
 amount has not been increased
 during the present session The
 bill reported by the committee
 this session was identically the
 same bill reported by them
 and passed by the House
 in the last session The
 amount was reduced in the
 Senate believe upon the motion
 of Senator Yulee of Florida
 from 59 000 to 40
 000 But when it camc
 back to the House the
 Post Oßice Committee reported the
 same amount contained in thc
 original bill Now sir I
 wish the House also to
 consider another fact in connection
 with this thing The Postmaster
 General in his correspondence with
 thesc parties when he curtailcd
 the service him self admitted
 the justice of this claim
 and sug gested the precise
 remedy which the parties have
 sought at the hands qf
 Congress He said The I
 epartment cannot but regrct any
 losses that you may sustain
 by the annulment of your
 contract but as the course
 adopted by the Postnntstcu General
 was forced upon by Congress
 that body will no doubt
 indenk nify au who have
 sustained datnage through its action
 Now sir when this bill
 was under discussion in tl
 ie House my friend from
 North Carolina made this point
 that in every contract made
 with every contractor for carrying
 the mail the Post master
 General reserves the right of
 reducing the service or of
 changing the c ontract as
 the wants of the I
 epartment may require Grant it
 That provision was in the
 contract with these parties as
 it is in all such
 contracts But that is a
 mere formal condition I undertake
 10 say that it is
 a condition which was never
 attempted to be en forced
 until after tl e action
 of the last Congress failing
 to pass the Post Office
 appropriation bill I will state
 also and every gentlcnnan who
 will examine the statute will
 agree with the Postmaster General
 has under the law no
 power to alter or change
 any contract madc for carrying
 the mail except under certain
 conditions which hold were not
 complied with in this instance
 that the Postmaster General had
 no power under the law
 to insert any such condition
 into the con tract and
 that any such provision if
 inserted is in violation ofthc
 law and therefore null and
 void Now Mr Speaker the
 Presidentof the United States in
 his rnessao e icnorcs the
 law he pays no attention
 to the statute he makes
 no mention of the fact
 that there is now the
 statute book a lax v
 which regulates and controls this
 matter Before conclude I will
 read the law so that
 there may be no mistake
 about it These parties entered
 into a contract to carry
 the mail over a certain
 route once a week for
 the sun i of 190
 000 They went on to
 carry out itself proves that
 the parties had in view
 the con ciplc involved in
 this bill than they are
 presented their contract faithfully until
 the Postmaster Gen tingency of
 such curtailment whenever the ne
 in the messacre of the
 President The whole oral Congrcss
 having failed to pass the
 ccssities of the public and
 the condition of affairs i
 question passed in review before
 the House and appropriations reduced
 the service to a in
 Territory of Utah may not
 requirc it more the House
 refused to order the yeas
 and nays monthly mail The
 proof is abundant in the
 case upon its passage only
 twenty one members vot from
 St Joseph to Salt Lake
 City from Fort frequen ixp
 at the time for the
 yeas and nays Before the
 Postmaster General ordered this cur
 i I Well sir after
 able discussion as i have
 stated Leavenworth to Pike s
 Peak that the servicc was
 tailnun t he had an
 interview with the Secretary 574
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 26
 faithfully performed up to the
 time it was changed from
 a weekly to a semi
 monthly service The proof in
 the case is abundant that
 the reduction of the service
 instead of reducing the expenses
 of the contractors increased them
 How The entire mail if
 carried once a week could
 be car pied by one
 team but if carried only
 once in two weeks two
 teams were required They rcmon
 stratcd against the reduction of
 the service they remonstrated against
 this violation of their con
 tract in derogation of their
 rights entailing upon them heavy
 losses Their remonstrances were disregarded
 they were told that in
 consequence of the failure upon
 the part of Congress to
 pass the usual appropriations and
 the crippled condi tion of
 the Department the service must
 be cur tailed and they
 must look to Congress for
 relief They continued to carry
 the mail and to perform
 their duty faithfully and in
 accordance with the recommendation of
 the Postmaster General came to
 Congress and asked them to
 reimburse them for the damages
 actually Sustained Well sir as
 I have said after mature
 deliber ation this House passed
 the bill in one session
 and again passed it in
 another The President of the
 United States now returns the
 bill with his objections not
 that the bill violates the
 Constitu tion not that it
 is hasty and inconsiderate legisla
 tion or that it involves
 some great political ques tion
 upon which I believe veto
 messages have genefally been founded
 but the President of the
 United States undertakes to step
 in between these private parties
 and this House and tclis
 us that if we undertake
 to do justice to these
 parties it will open the
 door by which other parties
 who have also sustained wrong
 may come in and ask
 Congress also for relief and
 money may be thus taken
 from thc Treasury to a
 large amount For myself I
 do not propose to act
 in this House upon such
 considerations Mr LOVEJOY I wish
 to ask the gentleman from
 Kentucky whether we have not
 during the present session rcpealed
 an act passed in the
 last session and whether the
 Inere fact that the House
 passcd a bill is a
 reason for oar not recorisid
 l incr that action wron
 Y Mr BURNET É Not
 ail 1 have not stated
 i only say that this
 bill havino that as a
 reason twice passed this House
 upon mature deliberation all the
 objections urged by the President
 in his message having been
 fully stated and considered it
 does seem to me a
 most extraordinary proceed ing that
 it should be vetoed under
 such circum stances I do
 not Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 know whether I understood the
 gentleman from I understood him
 to take the Kentucky or
 not ground that this Provision
 in the contract of the
 Postmaster General with those parties
 giving him the right to
 chancre contract was in violation
 of law Mr BURNETT Yes
 sir and nullity Mr WASHBURNE
 of Illinois I am very
 glad to hear it for
 that is precisely the ground
 which I assumed in the
 last session ill respect to
 all the changes of contract
 which took place uftcr the
 close of the last Congress
 Mr BURNETT 1 have never
 taken with thc gcn tie
 man upon that point 1
 state that such is the
 filet Mr WASHBURNE 0f111inois 1
 de sired to know if
 I understood the gentleman cor
 rectly Mr BURNETT 1 stated
 in my argument of this
 casc last session that that
 clause was in vio lation
 of express law Mr WASHBURNE
 of Illinois contended so and
 the gentleman from Missouri i
 Mr CRAIG madc a speech
 upon that subject I believed
 then that he had the
 right of the matter and
 I believe so now Mr
 BURNETT Now 1 will refer
 gentlemen to the twenty third
 section of the act of
 July 2 1836 in reference
 to the Post Office Department
 It is as follows And
 whenever it shall become necessary
 to change the ternis of
 any existing contract in any
 other rnanner than that designated
 in this act or to
 enter into a contract iör
 the transportation of the mail
 at any other time than
 at the I annual letting
 the Postmaster General shall give
 notice in one newspaper published
 at Washington city and in
 one newspaper published as near
 as may be to the
 route in w hich the
 services arc to be perfönned
 for at least four week
 tjcft re chanaincv or rnüking
 such contract invitina thereiör which
 proposaEs shall be received and
 opened and euch proccedings thereon
 had in all things as
 at the annual lettings Provided
 however That the Post master
 General may make temporary contracts
 until a re ular letting
 can take place Mr LOVEJOY
 Does not that provision refer
 to cases where it is
 proposed to take a contract
 from one party and give
 it to another it refers
 to all Mr BURNETT No
 sir I have examined all
 the statutes thor changes oughly
 I have examined the whole
 matter in regard to changes
 and there is no such
 provisioni It IS not contended
 that in this case the
 law was complied with There
 was no advertisement whatever in
 accordance with the law but
 the Postmaster General acting upon
 the clause in the contract
 giving him the power to
 alter change and amend it
 and against the remonstrance of
 the Contractors changed this contract
 without any advertisement and without
 conforming at all to the
 law And now the President
 sends in his message in
 which he concedes the fact
 that these parties have sustained
 heavy losses I hcse men
 by a life of honest
 toil and industry have accumu
 lated a competence for themselves
 and their fami lies and
 by the action of the
 Postmaster General this is all
 swept away by our annulment
 of the contract They come
 to this Congress for relief
 and we agree to give
 to them what they claim
 and establish as their damages
 for such action of the
 Department The bill was reported
 twice unani It passed mously
 by a committee of this
 House the House and was
 sent to the Senate and
 it passed twice there The
 Presidcnt sends back a messagc
 vetoing the bill and tells
 us that this precedent would
 open the door by which
 the Treasury will have to
 pay a very large sum
 to contractors I care not
 how much we have to
 pay If tho Govern if
 the claims arc right and
 just meniof the United States
 in equity and justice owe
 these parties we ought to
 pay and relieve these men
 who are not in fault
 themselves The Government first violated
 the contract and in doing
 so they also violated the
 law of the United States
 and now svc arc asked
 to turn these par ties
 out of this House after
 they have been broken up
 a fact which is conceded
 without paying what they are
 entitled to and after we
 have twice passed bills for
 their relief Mr ALLEY I
 desire to say a word
 upon this question in behalf
 of the committee w hich
 first reported the bill The
 facts have been so clearly
 stated by tho gentleman frorn
 Kentucky that there is but
 little left for me to
 say In my judgment there
 never was a case pre
 sented to the Congress of
 the United States that excited
 more discussion or investiøation than
 this It has undergone a
 most thorough investi casc gation
 by a committec of this
 House on two oc It
 was also thoroughly examined and
 casions investigated by a committee
 on the part of the
 Senate and I do think
 that it is as the
 gentleman from Kentucky has justly
 observed a most ex traordinary
 proceeding upon the part of
 the Pres ident Butl will
 not join in any denunciation
 of the President for exercisinff
 clear constitutional right because if
 he considers that a privule
 claim is passed by Congress
 under extraordinary cir cumstances which
 would establish a bad prece
 dent it is not only
 his constitutional right but it
 is I hold his imperative
 duty to interpose an executive
 veto This matter has been
 so t horoughly discussed in
 this case and all the
 facts are so fully under
 stood that I will not
 detain the House now by
 recapitulating the statements which have
 been heretofore made I will
 only briefly examine the objections
 which are made by the
 President to the The President
 has made l n tt
 three points against this bill
 Tho first and the one
 on w lich he seems
 to me to lay more
 stress than any other is
 that this bill passed Congress
 at the last session för
 the sum of 40 000
 while it is passed now
 in precisely the same terms
 with the exeeption that for
 40 000 is substituted 59
 500 Now Mr Speaker it
 seems to mc that that
 is not a reason which
 should operate upon this Hoüse
 ut all against the bill
 This House passed the bill
 for 59 500 after the
 most thorough examination by the
 Post Oflice Committee and after
 a most thor ough and
 exhaustive discussion upon tho part
 of this House at the
 last session of Congress was
 then sent to the Senate
 and at the close of
 the session as I understand
 as a matter of com
 promise it was reduced to
 the sum of 40 000
 in that body It then
 came back to the House
 and it being so near
 the close of the session
 and there being no time
 to consider it in full
 it received the sanction of
 this House as amended by
 the Sen ate and the
 bill passcd in that forrn
 It failed to receive the
 sanction of the President At
 this session the petition was
 again referred to the Post
 Offce Committee of this House
 That committöe after another examination
 and invest igation as it
 had done previously by an
 unani mous Vote reported this
 bill to the House in
 the same form precisely as
 it was passed in this
 House at the last session
 of Congress and it passed
 the It was sent to
 the House by a very
 large vote Senate and there
 after another examination by that
 body the action of the
 House was concurred In Now
 Mr Speaker I put it
 to the House to say
 if under such circumstanccs that
 is any It reason at
 all why this bill should
 be vetoed seems to me
 not The next and second
 point of the veto message
 is that the contract allows
 the Postmaster Gen eral to
 reduce the service and that
 he has so re duced
 it in accordance with the
 provision of the contract Mr
 Speaker that matter was fully
 ex amined at the last
 session of Congress by this
 House and was fully discussed
 and while the legality of
 that question was in great
 doubt the House decided by
 a very laree vote and
 it seems to me judging
 from the discussion the almost
 unanimous feeling of the House
 was that this case ought
 to be settled upon principles
 of equity and not according
 to its legal bearings although
 it does seern to me
 that upon legal grounds alone
 it presents a case not
 by any means devoid of
 strength As has been remarked
 by the gentle man from
 Kentucky that question was thoroughly
 discussed and he has read
 from the law what he
 conceives to be a proper
 interpretation And in this connection
 allow me to call the
 at tention of the House
 to letter written by the
 Attorney General upon this very
 subject when the Postmaster General
 called his attention to the
 Butterfield con tract That is
 the only contract I believe
 in wh ich that provision
 was never inserted although it
 seetns to me it is
 a contract of all others
 in which it should have
 been inserted In every other
 cont ract it has been
 inserted and it is inserted
 merely for the protection of
 the Govern I do not
 believe that any contractor ever
 ment signed a contract containing
 that provision with the expectation
 or thought that he would
 ever be taken advantage of
 in consequence of it and
 I think that advantage has
 never been taken of that
 provision since it was first
 inserted by a former Postmaster
 General many years since say
 that provision was never taken
 advantage of until the appropriation
 bill failed which made it
 neces sary In the judgment
 of the Postmaster General to
 reduce nearly all this kind
 of service And this was
 one of the cases in
 which the service was reduced
 and the Postmaster General gave
 that as a reason to
 the contractors why the service
 was reduced Now after this
 matter wras investigated and thoroughly
 discussed it was decided by
 the last Congress that that
 provision in the contract ought
 not to affect a clear
 case of equity I wish
 to call the attention of
 the House as I was
 say ing to a letter
 of the Attorney General coverino
 this ground in the Butterfield
 case in reply to the
 Postmaster General He holds this
 language I am not at
 liberty nor do I think
 you are to inquire whether
 it was well or ill
 for the Government to inake
 this contract The unfortunate condition
 in which the De partment
 has nexpectedly found itself might
 make us wish to get
 rid of as Inany burdens
 as possible but the pecu
 niary interests of the country
 are not the most important
 It has a far deeper
 stake in doing justice and
 maintain int the laws That
 is the reply of the
 Attorney General and it seems
 to me the reply was
 eminently worthy of that distinguishedjurist
 i therefore Mr Speaker think
 that that objection is not
 a valid one so far
 as this bill is concerned
 The other point which the
 President makes is that this
 case wrill open the door
 to other cases of a
 similar character and establish a
 bad pre cedent Mr Speaker
 that was the very ground
 of ob jection which was
 urged in t his House
 at the last session of
 Congress by the opponents of
 the bill It was thoroughly
 and I think successfully an
 swered at that time If
 the claim presents a clear
 case of equity no matter
 how many cases there THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 575 may be
 of the same character it
 ought to be favor ably
 acted on I think that
 is clear and after the
 strong verdict which the House
 gave upon that point at
 the hist session of Congress
 I certainly will not urge
 any more considerations in regard
 to it at the present
 time I will only say
 in regard to the veto
 of the President that he
 has exercised h is constitutional
 right and that it was
 his duty if he regarded
 this as an extraordinary ease
 to vcto the bill I
 wish he could have time
 and opportunity to examine more
 cases of private claims that
 como before him for I
 arn free to say that
 I believe a majority of
 alk the private ciaitns presented
 for the considera tion of
 Congress are but so many
 schemes to plunder the Treasury
 and I am afraid that
 many are sanctioned bv Congress
 that do not receive that
 close exarnination and attention which
 they If then the President
 s objec ought to receive
 tions were such as commended
 themselves to my judgment I
 would certainly vote to sustain
 his veto but I believe
 thatevery consideration of jus tice
 every principle of equity and
 every feeling of humanity in
 this case demands that the
 veto message should not be
 sustained and I hope and
 now move trust the House
 will not sustain it the
 previ_ous question Mr BRANCH I
 hope the gentleman from Massachusetts
 will withdraw the demand for
 the previous question for a
 few minutes to enabl eme
 to make a few remarks
 in regard to this bill
 Mr ALLEY 1 will withdraw
 it if the gen tleman
 wilk agree to renew it
 Mr BRANCH I do not
 want to renew it but
 I will give the floor
 to the gentleman to do
 it when I am through
 Mr ALLEY Then 1 withdraw
 it Mr BRANCH Mr Speaker
 the most disa greeable duty
 that a public offcer under
 this Gov ernment has to
 discharge is to stand up
 in resist ance to private
 claims and when I find
 a public officer disposed faithfully
 and fairly and consci entiously
 to guard the Bublic Treasury
 I feel it my duty
 to give him whatever support
 is in my I think
 that in the present case
 the Pres power ident has
 discharged his duty and only
 dischargcd I thought when it
 his duty in vetoing this
 bill passed the House that
 it ought not to pass
 and I thought then that
 the President ought to veto
 it if it did pass
 both branches of Congress The
 facts of this case Mr
 Speaker are very simple and
 may be stated in very
 brief terms These parties entered
 into a contract with the
 Postmaster General to carry the
 mails to Salt Lake City
 once a week foragiven sum
 It was stipulated in that
 con tract in express terms
 that the Postmas ter General
 should have the privilege wheneverhe
 thought the public interest demanded
 it to reduct the service
 and pro rata to reduce
 the compensation or to increase
 the service and increase the
 compen sation pro rata That
 the contract was signed by
 these parties with a distinct
 knowledge that It reserved to
 the Postmaster General this privilegc
 of altering its terms at
 his pleasure or of altering
 the nature of the service
 at his pleasure and that
 they reserved to themselves on
 the other hand the right
 if they did not choose
 to continue the ser vice
 on the new terms to
 throw up the contract and
 cease to discharge any du
 ties under its terms is
 not denied by anybody All
 admit that that reservation was
 made in express terms in
 the con tract and that
 in consideration of its being
 put in it was stipulated
 that if the parties should
 choose to throw up the
 cetract when the Posi master
 General thought proper to make
 a change in it they
 s150uld be paid one month
 s extra com tra That
 was the bonus given to
 these parties for the privilege
 reserved to the Department of
 changing the contfact whenever the
 public ser vice required it
 to be changed Gentlemen I
 say do not deny that
 these are the terms of
 the contract but they say
 that the contract was ille
 gal that the contract was
 in violation of law Well
 now I have two things
 to say about that In
 the first place if the
 contract was in violation of
 law these parties equally with
 the Postmaster Gen era participatcd
 in that violation of law
 Tl ey signed the contract
 They agreed to abide by
 the terms of the contract
 and if it was void
 on the If one side
 it was equally void on
 the other the contractors were
 authorized to disregard its terms
 the Post Office Department was
 equally authorized to disregard its
 terms Mr BURNETT Will the
 gentleman permit me to ask
 him a question Mr BRANCH
 1 would prefer to go
 through with my statement and
 then I will answer any
 question Mr BURNETT Just one
 question Mr BRANCH very well
 go on Mr BURNETT 1
 understand the gentleman from North
 Carolina to say that if
 the provision in the contract
 authorizing the Postmater General to
 change its terms was m
 violation of the law then
 both parties were equally in
 fault the Post master General
 and the contractors Now I
 de sire Lo put this
 question to him if the
 Govern ment violated that contract
 first by a failurc to
 comply with the stipulations of
 the contract ought not the
 parties contracting with the Governmht
 to bo relieved from any
 damages they may have sustained
 by reason of the fault
 of the Govern ment Mr
 BRANCH well sir do not
 think it essential to inquire
 whic h party violated the
 con I do not admit
 that the Department tract first
 violated it either first or
 last or at all But
 if we were to go
 into an inquiry as to
 which vio lated it first
 and I were to admit
 that the Post master General
 had violated it at all
 I N vould hold that
 the contractors had violated it
 first in point of time
 when they refused to comply
 with the order that the
 Postmaster General gave them in
 the express terms of the
 contract But I pass from
 that point I contend Mr
 Speaker that the terms of
 this contract were in express
 accordance with the terms of
 the law and that the
 statute or that portion of
 it which has been read
 by my honor able friend
 from Kentucky Mr BURNETT does
 not prove to the contrary
 Here is the language of
 that statute And whenever it
 shall become necessary to change
 the terms of any existing
 contract in any other manner
 than that designated in this
 act That does not apply
 to the present case The
 Postmaster General ill this case
 has not changed the terms
 of the contract he has
 only givcn an order which
 he was expressly authorized by
 the very terms and letter
 of the contract to give
 He has not attempted to
 change the contract He has
 only attempted to carry it
 out himself and to require
 the contractors to carry out
 every letter and syllable of
 the contract that they themselves
 signed I admit sir that
 if hc had undertaken to
 change that contract he was
 compelled by the statute which
 has been read by the
 gentleman from Kentucky to advcrtisc
 and give it out anew
 to the lowest bidder but
 he has not attempted any
 such thing The contract reserved
 to him the right to
 change thc service from wcekly
 to semi monthly and all
 that he has donc was
 to exercise his right under
 that contract and required the
 par ties to reduce the
 service Now Mr Speaker suppose
 such were not the case
 We have heard here to
 day from the mes sage
 of the President that inasmuch
 as this con tract had
 been entered into to a
 large extent in order to
 supply our troops in that
 country with mail matter and
 inasmuch as the troops had
 been withdrawn it had therefore
 become unnecessary to perform the
 service so often The statement
 of that fact in the
 message proves to us that
 it is indispensably necessary to
 the public intcrcsts that thcrc
 should be reserved in every
 mail con tract the privilegc
 which was reserved in this
 one of changing not the
 contract but the service un
 der the contract Why you
 enter into your mail contracts
 for four years Long before
 the expi ration of the
 four years great changes may
 takc place in the physical
 features of the country and
 I the means of transportation
 You may make a contract
 to have the mail carried
 by a stage Before the
 expiration coach over a given
 route of the contract a
 railroad may have been built
 on a much nearer route
 and one that can furnish
 the public with mails far
 better and more conve niently
 and satisfactorily Is it to
 be established that in such
 a casc as that the
 Postmaster Gen eral has not
 the right to put an
 end to the mail not
 that the only Way you
 can geta5d of such contracts
 is by paying large sums
 of money buying them off
 But Mr Speaker neitherCö1F gress
 nor the executive department tofore
 held any such idea or
 ticteåon sach a prin ciplc
 Every mail contract that has
 been entered into by the
 Government With one solitary excer
 tion and that exception is
 one of which the gen
 tleman himself Mr ALLEVI has
 informed us reserves to the
 Postmaster General as this con
 tract reserved to him the
 privilege of changing the nature
 of the service at his
 pleasure on his paying a
 pro rctc increase or deduction
 as the case might be
 of compensation I call the
 atten tion of the House
 to the fact that without
 such reservation the public interest
 might suffer seri ously in
 a large number of cases
 The public Treasury might suffer
 and far worse than that
 the conveniencc of our citizens
 might suffer also The gentleman
 from Massachusetts Mr AL LEY
 says that this reservation which
 he admits is embraced in
 this contract as in all
 other mail contracts of the
 Government was never taken ad
 vantage of until after the
 failure of the Post Omce
 appropriation bill last Congress In
 that the gen tlcman is
 totally mistaken From time imme
 morial the Post Office D
 artment has been in the
 habit aAits pleasure an frequently
 of chang ing the nature
 of the service under these
 contracts It is not that
 this is the first time
 that the Depart Inent has
 ever attempted to exercise that
 power but it is the
 first time I ever heard
 of any contractor claiming the
 right to disregard the order
 and to ask indemnity from
 Congress The gentleman will find
 upon inquiry among his experienced
 friends or at the Department
 that nota year not a
 month not a week perhaps
 not a day pa es
 without the Postmaster General sending
 orders changing the nature of
 the service under thesé con
 tracts and I do not
 think he will find one
 single instance in which compliance
 with such order has been
 ever refused and where the
 contractor has ever comc to
 Congress to claim compensation Mr
 ALLEY Will the gentleman from
 North Carolina allow me to
 explain Mr BRANCH Certainly Mr
 ALLEY I do not mean
 to be understood as saying
 this right had never been
 exercised said that ithad ilever
 before beeh taken advantage of
 The provision is that the
 Postmaster Gen eral shall have
 the privilege of changing the
 sel vice when the public
 exigencies require a change utid
 of course it is undestood
 that when causes arise such
 as the gentleman has been
 narrating this power would be
 exercised know that it has
 often been exercised in that
 way but never before have
 contractors been injured by taking
 advantage of it That is
 to say the provision has
 not been resorted to to
 strike down the inter ests
 of contractörs acyainst what was
 fair and right just and
 equitable As I understand it
 tl lC provision is put
 in there to cover just
 such contin rencies as the
 gentleman has a luded to
 Of course understand perfect y
 wel that such causes frequently
 arise and that the Postmaster
 General has exercised his power
 in that way But undertake
 to say that never in
 the history of the Government
 has advantage been taken of
 that provision from the failure
 of an appropriation bill Fl
 hat was made an excuse
 by the Postmaster General for
 strikingdown hundreds ofcontractors and destroying
 the validity of their contracts
 madc in good faith with
 the understanding that if they
 carried out all the stipulations
 of their contract the Government
 would do the same on
 its part Now undertake to
 say that in this case
 as well as in many
 other cases the Govern ment
 did not perform its duty
 and its obligations to the
 contractors but made use of
 an excuse which was no
 proper excuse at all Mr
 BRANCH 1 desire that this
 bill shall be I have
 a disposed of during the
 morning hour few more remarks
 to make and then I
 will close Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri Will the gentleman yield
 to me for a moment
 Mr BRANCH Certainly 1 will
 Mr CRAIG ofMissouri only ask
 the gen coach contract and
 have the mail sent by
 raih oad tleman to yield
 that he may make a
 point on a Again you
 may have been sending your
 mail question which I desire
 to ask him would not
 by railroad on a very
 round about route A nearer
 do so but that the
 argument of the gentleman from
 and more direct railroad may
 be completed within North Carolina
 is scarcely as fait as
 is usually the four years
 Can you not get rid
 of the former characteristic of
 his speeches He puts the
 ease contract and put the
 mail on the nearest route
 ofa contract beine entered into
 for four years to The
 gentlemen who sustain this bill
 say you can have the
 mail carried overa certain route
 by stage 576 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE January 26 coach and
 of a railroad being built
 there at the end of
 two years and says that
 the friends of this bill
 contend there is no power
 to make a new contract
 with the railroad company and
 dispense tell the gentleman that
 with the slow coach neither
 the gentleman from Kentucky Mr
 BUR NETT nor the gentleman
 from Massach usetts Mr ALLEY
 has held any such doctrine
 They admit the right of
 the Postmaster General within a
 day or a month or
 a year after he has
 made a con tract to
 change its terms but they
 deny the right of the
 PoStmaster General to take the
 bid into his own mouth
 and when he reduces the
 ser vice on a route
 to say how much less
 the pay shall be The
 law pomts out how he
 shall do it and all
 that the friends of this
 bill claim is that the
 Postmaster General shall follow the
 law In this instance he
 reduced the service and reduced
 the pay a certain per
 centage W c say that
 it was his duty under
 the law to have ad
 vertised fbut weeks in the
 newspapers and to have given
 to these parties the poor
 privilege of competing with other
 bidders and seeing how much
 the service was worth Mr
 BRANCH In reply to the
 gentleman from Missouri desiro to
 say that I have not
 heard before that there was
 any complaint made that the
 reduction made by Postma vr
 General was not pro rata
 and in strict accordance with
 the Is there any such
 complaint contract Mr CRA IG
 of Missouri It was not
 pro rata He reduced some
 contracts thirty per cent and
 some forty five per cent
 Mr BRANCH My question is
 whether the reduction made in
 the case of Hockaday Liggit
 was not pro ratc with
 the reduction of service Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri No sir
 Mr BRANCH That is a
 matter ofarithmetic and calculation Anybody
 may make the calcu lation
 and show whether it is
 not prccisely pro to a
 dime If not we will
 pay the difference But Mr
 Spcakcr to pass on as
 I wish to get through
 what I have to say
 within the mornincy hour and
 not to defeat the bill
 by talking against timo and
 throwing it over I will
 close with this remark that
 the contract entered into with
 those parties was in the
 same form in which such
 con tracts have been entered
 into from timc immemo rial
 Every contract for carrying the
 mail on a railroad in
 a steam boat in a
 stage coach buggy or on
 horseback contains precisely the saine
 provision couched in the same
 language giving the Post Offce
 Department the right to re
 duce the service as he
 may please Anu I never
 knew in any single instance
 any contractor whose service was
 so reduced disregard the or
 der and then como here
 and claim compensation at the
 hands of Congress until this
 claim was pre scnted to
 Congress I say then that
 the Post master General has
 the right and that there
 is no law to prohibit
 it to insert in every
 mail contract such a provision
 as was inserted in this
 contract and that the contractor
 has no right to expect
 cornpensation if it is acted
 on by the Postmaster General
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania 1
 was not in the House
 when the mcssage of tho
 President was read and am
 not certain whethcr I understand
 the facts connected with this
 case or not I desire
 to ask the gentleman whether
 this contract con tained the
 usual clause that if the
 Postmaster Gen eral reduced the
 service or changed the contract
 they were entitled as damages
 to onc month s BRANCH
 Yes sir they are entitled
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania Have
 they received it Mr BRANCH
 I do not know If
 theyhavc not the money is
 at their credit and they
 can take it when they
 please Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 Thenthey have liquidated their own
 darnaces Mr BRANCH Cptainly they
 have Now Mr Speaker in
 obedience to my promisc to
 the gentleman from Massachusetts I
 yield the floor to him
 to unove the previous question
 if he de sn cs
 to do so Mr BURNETT
 With the consent of the
 centieman fi orn Massachusetts I
 desire to say a sing
 le word in addition The
 gentleman from Noi th Carolina
 says there was no violation
 of to decide whether there
 has been any violation of
 contract or not The Post
 Office Department makes a contract
 with me to carry the
 mail six times a week
 from Louisville Kentucky for in
 stance to Lexington The law
 says the Post master General
 shall not make any change
 in the the law passed
 by Con terms of the
 contract gress and now on
 your statute book without first
 advertisilig for at least four
 weeks in some newspaper in
 the city of Washington and
 in some newspaper nearest the
 route of the mail contract
 Now when the Postmaster General
 without no tice and without
 any advertisement orders that service
 of six times a week
 to be reduced to three
 times a week and when
 I remonstrate with him and
 tell him that relying upon
 carrying out the contract as
 entered into I have incurred
 great expense in stock and
 other preparations for carry ing
 it into effect and he
 replies that he has been
 compelled to do it by
 the action of Congress in
 refusing to make the necessary
 appropriations and that Congress will
 no doubt reimburse me I
 ask whether I have not
 good reason to expect reimbursement
 for the damages I have
 incurred Yet that is precisely
 a parallel case with the
 one before us Postmaster General
 as I read this morn
 mg told these contract0F s
 in effect I am com
 pelled to reduce the service
 on this route in con
 sequence of the action of
 Congress and I have no
 doubt Congress will reimburse you
 for the losses you may
 sustain Now I put it
 to every fair minded man
 in this House whether in
 a case of this description
 when it has been ascertained
 be yond a doubt that
 the damages sustained were at
 least as great as the
 amount provided in this bill
 when the bill with all
 the questions involved has been
 fully and fairly discussed in
 both branches of Congress and
 has passcd both branches of
 Congress twice with great unanimity
 no hasty or inconsiderate action
 I say under these cir
 cumstanccs is it not just
 and proper that this bill
 for the relief of these
 parties shall become a law
 Mr BRANCH I would like
 to ask my friend from
 Kentucky one question I wish
 to ask him if he
 can satisfy the House that
 the Postmaster General in this
 instance attempted to change the
 contract In my judgment he
 did not I Ic merely
 attempted to exercise a power
 which the contract gave him
 and if that provision of
 the contract was in violation
 of the law the parties
 themselves who signed it violated
 the law equally with the
 Postmaster General Mr BURNETT Then
 1 to the gentle man
 from North Carolina as a
 lawyer that if this action
 of the Postmaster General was
 in pur suance of a
 provision in the contract still
 any action upon his part
 to change the contract was
 null and vc id Why
 Because it was in violation
 of existing law That is
 the reason why I state
 it I say and I
 repeat that the Postmaster Gen
 eral had no power to
 change the character of the
 service except in accordance with
 the provisions of law requiring
 that the proposed change should
 be advertised at least four
 weeks The gentleman from North
 Carolina says I can not
 produce a single instance where
 the Postmas ter General has
 changed the character of mail
 servicc and the parties have
 sought relief at the hands
 of Congress up to this
 time Why sir we llave
 time and again passed joint
 resolutions referring such cases to
 the Postmaster General to bc
 settled upon principles of equity
 and justice lars injust such
 cases A case occurs to
 me just at this moment
 in which a contract was
 entered into for a daily
 mail by river from Louisville
 Kentucky to Cairo The boats
 were built for the full
 service and afterwards the service
 x vas reduced Congress passed
 a joint resolution re imbursing
 them for the losses they
 sustained in consequence of the
 change of contract Now Mr
 Speaker I submit whether it
 is not right that this
 great Government possessing aÅ it
 does arbitrary power over all
 contracts made by it when
 it violates them shall pay
 to the con tractors the
 losses sustained by them in
 conse quence of such violation
 even though it should result
 in taking millions from the
 l reasury Now Mr Speaker
 I think the gentleman from
 Massachusetts stated correctly that this
 clause which is inserted into
 all nutil contracts has never
 contract in this case Now
 sir I want to put
 been enforced in any instance
 up to the failure of
 a question to him as
 a lawyer and then ask
 him I Congress to pass
 the annual Post Offce appro
 priation In that instance the
 Postmaster Gen era reduced the
 mail service all over the
 country and especially in the
 north svestern States from thirty
 to fifty per cent Had
 Congress performed its duty there
 would have been no necessity
 for reducing the service The
 cause of the reduction was
 not therefore that the wants
 of the service did notdemand
 the full service but because
 of the failure of Congress
 to discharge its duty And
 inasmuch as the contracts were
 violated by the act of
 the Government itself I ask
 whether these contractors may not
 fairly claim of us that
 we shall reimburse them for
 the damages they have sustained
 Mr BRANCH I wish to
 correct the gentle I understand
 him to man as to
 a matter of fact say
 that the Postrnaster General never
 attempt ed to act under
 this provision in tho mail
 contracts until the failure of
 the last Congress to pass
 the usual appropriation bill 1
 think the gentleman is mistaken
 in that Mr BURNETT 1
 did not intend to say
 that such a power had
 never been exercised by the
 Postmaster General What 1 said
 was that res olutions for
 the relief of those who
 have sustained damages under such
 change of contract have fre
 quently been passed by Congress
 I now move thc previous
 question Mr HOWARD of Michigan
 Has not the morning hour
 expired The SPEAKER It has
 but Chair thinks this is
 a question of a nature
 which ought to be decided
 The previous question was seconded
 and the main question ordered
 to be put The SPEAKER
 The question before the House
 is this Shall the bill
 be passed notwith standing the
 objections of the President provided
 that that question shall be

 CRISIS The SPEAKE1i The hour
 has arrived for resuming the
 consideration of the special order
 which is the report of
 the select committee of thirty
 three on the disturbed condition
 of the country On that
 question the gentleman from Missouri
 Mr CLARK is entitled to
 the floor Mr CLARK of
 Missouri From quarters of our
 country appeals come up to
 us to preserve if possible
 the Union as made by
 our fathers There is not
 a member who is not
 daily implored by his constituents
 to exert every effort within
 his power to preserve the
 rich legacy left us by
 our fathers in order that
 it may be handed down
 Intact toourdescendants Wesee distinguished citizens
 men who have served their
 country in war and in
 peace in the cou ncilsofthe
 nation and upon battle fields
 which crowned our flag with
 victory we see these men
 in every section appealing that
 the Con stitution may be
 fully carried out yiotdingtoevery section
 the rights svhich they are
 entitled to under it and
 that the national banner may
 pass through the storm and
 the darkness which surround us
 with ail the power and
 all the glory that have
 heretofore rendered it respected In
 every section of the Olobe
 With a view to that
 grand result I will to
 all I can and in
 its behalf I speak this
 day State after State whether
 rightfully or wrong fully has
 withdrawn from t he Union
 They have seceded and we
 cannot shut our eyes if
 we would to the fact
 that we are now in
 the midst of a great
 revolution Coming from a State
 which has always been loyal
 to the Union and justly
 estimated the blessings it has
 conferred I beg the attention
 of the House while I
 discuss the causes which have
 led to the present diffculty
 and the remedies which in
 my judgment are demanded for
 the peace the integrity and
 the honor of the Government
 In the reunarks I shall
 submit I do not wish
 to be understood as intending
 to be per sonally offensive
 to any gentleman of the
 Repub lican party when I
 take occasion to refer to
 that party i will in
 stating the course of policy
 on tho part of the
 North which has brought the
 country to its present distracted
 and excited con dition adhere
 closely to the history of
 the times Witlpundeviatin veracity I
 will lay before the House
 the acts 01 the part
 of the different sections of
 the Union which have culminated
 in the ex isting secession
 movement Mr Speaker all parties
 will admit that up to
 the year 1820 there was
 no serious disturbance between the
 States of this Confederacy in
 refer 37 TUESDAY JANUARY 29
 1861 ence to slave property
 and the rights of the
 south ern people to emio
 rate to the Territories with
 their domestic institutions In that
 year Mis souri sought admission
 into the Union as a
 State Her people mct in
 convention and framed a con
 It was brought stitution and
 State government here and presented
 to Congress Missouri askcd that
 she might be admitted into
 the Union as other States
 had been before She asked
 admission upon ancqual footing with
 thcother States Then for the
 first time in the history
 of the country an attempt
 was made to deny to
 the people the right of
 self government the right to
 form their own ffovernment in
 their own way The constitution
 of Missouri recognized the institution
 of slavery and was admitted
 to be republican in form
 It complied with all the
 requirements of the Consti tution
 of the United States The
 objection to the admission of
 Misouri was placed solely upon
 the ground that her tion
 recognized slavery The consequent excite
 ment on that occasion is
 recorded in vivid colors in
 the history of the country
 The Union was threatened With
 dissolution An agitation like it
 had not previously been seen
 Missouri x vas denied admission
 into the Union for one
 session of Congress That great
 patriot and statesman l lenry
 Clay xvas then in Congress
 and ib was because of
 his eloquence his patriotism and
 his personal influence that the
 Missouri compromise was effected He
 it was who led the
 movement which restored quiet to
 the count ry and peace
 harmony and prosperity to the
 Union Missouri was admitted under
 that famous bill which estab
 lisbed the Missouri compromise line
 of 360 30 We were
 forced to accept that compromise
 the South did accept it
 not because they believed it
 constitutional or as granting them
 all of their rights but
 because of their love for
 the Union and theil dread
 of the evils which would
 have resulted fl om u
 dissolution They sacrificed at that
 time upon the alt ar
 of their country s peace
 the rights which thc Supreme
 Court of thc United States
 has since in the Dred
 Scott case fully ac knowlcdgcd
 I ask the Republicans of
 this House whether up to
 that tinie there had been
 any disturbance on the slavery
 question I lild we not
 lived in fraternal concord We
 had fought together north and
 south contending with each other
 only to show which should
 most enhancc the glory of
 the Re public All was
 loyalty and devöiion to the
 Union up to the nullification
 movement of South Caro lina
 in 1832 In the course
 of events when the question
 grew up in reference to
 the acquisition of r rexas
 thefe was opposition to that
 acquisition Where did it come
 from What was the reason
 alleged for that opposition The
 gentleman from Massa chusetts Mr
 ADAMS yesterday read some reso
 lutions which were introduced into
 the Legisla ture of Massachusetts
 and those resolutions are a
 truc exponent of the sentiment
 of that State in reference
 to tho annexation of Texas
 Upon that acqi lisition the
 House will bear in illind
 the Mis souri compromise line
 was extended Texas was admitted
 upon the express condition that
 that line should be extended
 in good faith to the
 extent of our then possessions
 That was in 1845 if
 I am not mistaken in
 the date Sir the annexation
 ot Texas produced the Mexican
 war Daring that war 1Mr
 Polk was President and I
 ask the House to remember
 that the people of the
 South without respect to party
 furnished men and means for
 Ihat war where we met
 northern as well as south
 In that war we ern
 men upon the battle field
 lost many of our distinguished
 men A Clay McKee a
 Butler a Ycll from the
 NEW SERIES NO 37 viso
 was introduced and an attempt
 måd6 to puf restrictions on
 that territory oven before i
 w as_ae quired to the
 prejudice of the South While
 our armies wero fighting our
 best and noblest men dying
 our blood being shed our
 money paid to acquire territory
 there was a party in
 this House engaged in placino
 a restriction upon that terri
 tory and endeavoring to make
 a discrimination to the prejudice
 of the Soutli At that
 particular time after the treaty
 lyvas made and New Mexico
 and California and our possessions
 upon the Paci fic coast
 were acquired and the country
 which had been enraged at
 the efforts to discrim_inate to
 our prejudice was again turning
 to peace the country was
 again threatened with dissolution and
 the same great man wlio
 calmed the gtoi m in
 1820 Henry Clay found his
 way again int6 the Senate
 of the United States and
 in conjunc tion with patriots
 and members of all partieS
 made the compromise of 1850
 A Clay Citgs a Webster
 a Douglas and many other
 distin guished members of various
 pa rucs then acted together
 not as we are acting
 nosv but they calmed the
 storm which was lowering over
 us ri liere was no
 question with them about Platforms
 or whether they belonged to
 one party or the other
 The only question was what
 measures were ne cessary to
 sustain and preserve our common
 coun try from disruption and
 ruin They rose above the
 propositions of mere partisans to
 that ofstatesi men and patriots
 to save a sinking and
 bleeding country At that particular
 time when the question of
 the Wilmot proviso and the
 disposition of thé Territories were
 under discussion Mr DOUGLAS then
 a member Of the United
 States Senate in troduccd a
 proposition to eitend the Missouri
 compromise to the Pacific ocean
 on the line of 360
 30 as it had been
 extended to our borders before
 Where were our northern friends
 then Did they vote for
 it I have the proposition
 Inade by Mr DOUGLAS upon
 that occasion It is as
 follows Inotion by Mr I
 OUGLAS to amend thet bill

 declared to be in full

 in the same sense and
 with the saine understanding with
 Which it was origin ally
 adopted It was determined in

 DOUGLAS made the proposition In
 the Sen ate and every
 northern Senator except a few
 Democrats voted against the extension
 of the compromise line while
 every southei n Senator and
 every Democrat in that body
 except one voted for it
 The bill extending this line
 passed i the Senate and
 was sent to the House
 and when the question came
 to a vote after an
 exciting ing States as well
 as a Hardin and many
 others debate it was rejected
 by a sectional vote the
 from the border States meton
 the battle field and South
 all voting to extend it
 and the North all mingled
 their blood too ether and
 died sustaining voting against the
 extension I he compromise of
 1850 being made we again
 the flag of their common
 country in the acquisi had
 repose until the time of
 the Kansas and Ne tion
 of common territory When that
 war was about to close
 and before braska act When
 Kansas and NebfaSka wore about
 to be orcranized into Territories
 a mOtion the treaty of
 peace was signed there was
 intro duced into Congress the
 Wilmot proviso In view was
 made and carried to repeal
 the Missouri com of the
 acquisition of territory the MT
 ilmot pro promise line which
 the North had refused to
 January 26 578 extend and
 which they had up to
 that hour denounced by their
 orators here and elsewhere The
 South by the repeal of
 the Missouri com promise was
 only put upon the original
 ground she occupied before the
 establishment of the Mis souri
 line and v rhich the
 Supreme Court has de cided
 to have been unconstitutional Then
 it v ras that the
 Republican party commenced weeping and
 wrailing over what they were
 pleased to call the ruins
 of that compromise which they
 had refused to extend and
 which they had denounced until
 it was repealed But as
 soon as it was re
 pealed they declared that it
 was a compromise canonized in
 the hearts of the people
 and that its repeal was
 a breach of good faith
 And Mr DOUG LA s
 who has lookGd through the
 future of all these troubles
 and madc a record for
 himself which would do honor
 to any living statesman was
 par ticularly assailed for his
 advocacy of that measure Then
 came also pouring into this
 House thc pe titions of
 the clergymen of the North
 denounc ing the repeal of
 the Missouri compromise Then the
 Republican party was formed which
 has so rapidly increased that
 now they have elected theiu
 candidate for the Presidency Now
 Mr Speaker I ask this
 House is it any Wonder
 that the South is excited
 We are equals in this
 Union and we claim the
 same constitu tional rights and
 claim to be entitled to
 the same constitutional guarantees that
 any other portion of the
 Confederacy possesses From the time
 that the Republican party was
 formed as I have told
 you we have had no
 peace The country has been
 excited continually from that time
 until now These evils have
 increased until they have reached
 a culminating point and it
 now depends upon the action
 of this party v rhother
 this Gov ernmcnt is to
 contil lue and this Union
 be pre served or whether
 it is to be destroyed
 State after State has seceded
 and withdrawn their Rep rescntatives
 have vacated their seats in
 this Hall Sir those empty
 seats speak with an eloquence
 which should command the attention
 of patriots of all parties
 What has produced this state
 of things Who have produced
 it Havc the South ever
 imposed upon the North Have
 they ever initiated any proceedings
 to take from the North
 their political rights in the
 Territories or their rights of
 person and property anywhere I
 deny that anything can be
 produced to show that any
 portion of the southern States
 have made encroachments in any
 respect upon the northern section
 of the Union Against all
 these encroachments of the North
 the South have complained apon
 the South Sometimes they have
 threatened but for the greater
 part they have held up
 the Constitution and have shown
 the structure and framework of
 the Government and under them
 have asked the North to
 give them the equality to
 which they are entitled under
 the Constitution They have asked
 the North not to trespass
 upon the consti tutional rights
 of their section But notwith
 standing the North have persisted
 in their course CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 and happiness When we had
 the c xecutive and judicial
 arm and the legislative power
 of the Government although these
 encroachments were advancing upon us
 we had the power and
 that power we could exercise
 to secure our safety having
 the fortress of the Constitution
 The dif ferent departments of
 the Federal Government upon our
 side gave us safety and
 repose When we lost the
 executive power of the Government
 and it was transfcrrcd to
 the Republican party the South
 begal i to look around
 for means to strengthen their
 fortress or to change their
 posi tion In this connection
 I wish to say that
 whether a State has a
 constitutional right to secede or
 whether the action of a
 State in seceding is rev
 olutionary I shall not consume
 the time of the i
 I consider that no State
 and House to discuss no
 citizens of a State will
 ever secede from the Federal
 Government until their grievances arc
 too heavy to be borne
 and when that is the
 case all admit that they
 have the right of revolution
 and can change their form
 of government when ever thcy
 please Whether tl en it
 be secession or revolution it
 is useless now to inquire
 or dis cuss We have
 to deal with the facts
 before us and if we
 can to arrest the progress
 of that rev olution save
 the country and keep the
 stars and stripes of this
 blessed Union floating Nothing nox
 v remains for the patriot
 but to address him self
 to the work of healing
 the breach between the two
 sections of this Confederacy Five
 States have gone out of
 the Union whether rightfully or
 wrongfully they have denied the
 Federal au thority and have
 set up their own jurisdiction
 We have to deal with
 this fact We were asked
 the other day by the
 gentle man from Ohio Mr
 SHERMAN what the Re publican
 party had done Said he
 what have we we done
 except to elect our President
 claim that they have done
 a great deal and when
 I answer the gentleman s
 question I want it dis
 tinctly understood that I do
 not impugn the mo tives
 of any one nor do
 design to make a per
 sonal application of my remarks
 to any particular other obstacle
 that may be in the
 way of adjusting our present
 diffculties the honest Union loving
 masses of Pennsylvania will when
 the opportu nity first presents
 itself consign the leaders of
 that party to their political
 graves from which they will
 not rise until the day
 of resurrection It shall not
 be said that any act
 of Pennsylvania is a thorn
 jn the side of the
 South irritating that portion of
 the Confcdcracy to secession Mr
 FLORENCE 1 think not havo
 as much hope of the
 Legislature as he has of
 the people of Pennsylvania He
 ought to have said that
 Mr VAN WYCK 1 give
 notice that 1 shall object
 to these interruptions being taken
 out of the time of
 the gentleman from Missouri Mr
 KILGORE ask the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania Mr MCKENTY if the
 per sonal liberty laws of
 his State were not passed
 by a Democratic Legislature I
 was glad to hear Mr
 CLARK of Missouri the remark
 of the gentleman from Pennsylvania
 who int errnpted me The
 gentleman from Indi ana asks
 him if a Democratic Legislature
 did not pass the lam
 vs of which we complain
 care not sir whether it
 was a Democratic Legislature or
 I am not now dealing
 with parlies otherwise I am
 dealing with the causes which
 produce the disruption of our
 Government and T vhich it
 is in the power of
 the Republican party to remove
 Mr McPHERSON With the permission
 of the genfleman from Missouri
 I will state for his
 information that no matter what
 was the com plexion of
 the Legislatures that passed those
 en actments both the Governors
 who signed them belonged to
 the Democratic party Mr FLORENCE
 The gentleman ought in ju
 ice to add that the
 Governor who signed the bi114
 to repeal one of them
 was also a Democratic Govb
 rnor MR JUNKIN 1 understodd
 the gentleman from Missouri to
 state that in Pennsylvania we
 have a law which forbids
 the use of our jails
 for the purpose of securing
 fugitive slaves I did not
 say that Mr CLARK ofMissouri
 member of the Republican party
 The question Mr JUNK IN
 I have no doubt that
 that im asked was wkiat
 has been done giving the
 South pression has prevailed however
 for I have seen It
 stated as a fact in
 the newspapers Such a law
 cause of complaint I answer
 that the Abolition was madc
 in 1847 but it was
 repealed in 1852 ists and
 Free Soilers of the free
 States have for more than
 thirty years assailed the institution
 of and is not now
 upon our statute book never
 said that Mr CLARK of
 Missouri slavery in the southern
 States They deny to us
 a common property in the
 Territories those Ter Pennsylvania had
 such a law and I
 never thought so for I
 am in the habit of
 reading the statutes of of
 wrong and oppression Sir it
 has been asked by some
 if the election of Mr
 Lincoln was any cause for
 a dissolution of the Union
 1 say emphatically that I
 do not con sider that
 it is a sufficient cause
 of itself The election of
 a President is in no
 case a sufficient I believe
 in the power the intelligence
 cause I rec and the
 integrity of the American people
 ognize the Constitution of my
 country as a bond of
 union and when I take
 the oatll to support in
 my judg that Constitution I
 take an oath ment to
 bow to the majority and
 will of the peo pie
 constitutionally expressed But while I
 make this admission I want
 to tell my northern friends
 of the Republican party that
 it is not the election
 ritories acquired equally by our
 blood and treas ure as
 by yours making it a
 condition that we shall migrate
 to them only with such
 property as is recognized in
 the free States A gentleman
 on the other side of
 the House said the other
 day that they imposed no
 restrictions upon the South that
 when the citizens of the
 free States moved into the
 Territories they carried no slaves
 with them and that they
 were w illing to permit
 the slave States to carry
 there all they carried The
 doctrine of the Constitution is
 that each State has a
 right to regulate its domestic
 affairs in its own way
 to establish its own institutions
 and to recorynize as property
 whatever its citizens see proper
 in the formation of their
 fundamental law the doctrine of
 the Constitution is that the
 citi zens of each State
 shall have the same rights
 and privileges as the citizcns
 of the several States The
 Territories were acquired by the
 several Pennsylvania and of most
 the other States and I
 never supposed that Pennsylvania had
 such a law The Republican
 party of the North have
 de clared in their national
 convention as a solution of
 the slavery question and they
 have clected a President pledged
 to that doctrine that all
 men are free and equal
 and this doctrine of negro
 equality is carried into practical
 effect in the States of
 New York Massachusetts and Ohio
 where negroes are allowed to
 vote for President and members
 of Congress Associations have been
 organized in many of the
 free States without rebuke from
 the Republican party in any
 organized form to steal our
 slaves and to prevent their
 recapture show that such associations
 are countenanced in hicrh places
 I have only to instance
 the refusal of the Governor
 of Ohio upon a late
 occasion to give States and
 it is therefore a violation
 of good I up persons
 charged with negro stealing on
 the requisitions of thc Governors
 of Kentucky and faith and
 of our constitutional rights to
 restrict our citizens from carrying
 into the common Ter Tennessee
 on the ground that negro
 stealing not a crnne in
 the State of Ohio Citizens
 from ritories whatever is regarded
 as property in the your
 States have invaded southern soil
 for the States v rhence
 they emigrate The North havé
 enacted laws in many of
 their purpose of liberating slaves
 and have murdered States nullifying
 the provision of the Constitution
 unoffending citizens and the people
 in many local ities in
 your States have in public
 meetings and of the United
 States for the rendition of
 fugitive slaves refusing the use
 of their jails for the
 cus otherwise bestowed praise and
 eulogium upon of NIr Lincoln
 alone which has created this
 alarm tody of the prisoners
 and making it a penal
 of the assassins and the
 Executives of several States in
 1 ile South The facts
 which have named the history
 which I have given the
 encroachments fense for any one
 to aid in the execution
 of the have refused to
 deliver up parties implicated in
 which I have alluded to
 connected vgith the opin ions
 which Mr Lincoln is known
 to entertain the platform of
 principles upon which he was
 elected the construction which he
 gives to the Constitution and
 to the decision of the
 Supreme looking to the use
 of the executive arrn of
 this Government and of the
 power of the party which
 hag in years gone by
 trespassed as we think upon
 our constitutional rights these all
 these are what give us
 alarm and admonish the South
 to look out in time
 to secure additional constitutional guarantees
 for their safety peace fugitive
 slave lavv Justice requires that
 1 should II the treason
 Many distinguished members of the
 say here that there seems
 to bc a disposition in
 I E Republican party have
 declared their iRtention to remodel
 the Supremo Court and to
 put it on the many
 of the free States to
 repeal those obnoxious laws Théy
 have not yet however been
 rc E side of freedom
 They have declared that their
 I hope party power shall
 be used for the expansion
 of pealed in more than
 one or two States freedom
 and the contraction of slavery
 afd that they will all
 be repealed without delay Mr
 McKENTY I would say to
 the gentle with Lincoln s
 clection American slavery is at
 an end They have in
 many of the free States
 ar man from Missouri that
 there is bill before tho
 Legislature of Pennsylvania at this
 time to repeal rayed the
 schools churches and presses with
 the obnoxious sections of the
 act to which he re
 great unanimity against the South
 and the idea is inculcated
 by them that it is
 the duty of the If
 the Republican party who are
 nov in fers power there
 do not repeal them or
 remove any people to exterminate
 slavery at anysacrificc and 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 579 at
 all hazards They have flooded
 the South with legislative department
 enacts the laws the judicial
 seditious anti slavery pamphiets and
 papers cal department expounds them
 and the execußve de culated
 to create servile insurrection and
 to cn the families BY
 law it is for the
 fanaticism of thc North we
 have been forced to separate
 from you in some of
 our churches and other religious
 institutions These are things of
 which the South complains whether
 truthfully or otherwise history will
 re cord In addition to
 all this Mr Lincoln has
 been elected to the Presidency
 with his sentiment that he
 was opposed to the exclusion
 of the negro from the
 polls with the sentiment that
 thc Unioil part slave and
 part free was like a
 house divided against itself which
 could not stand with the
 sentiment proclaimed by him that
 those who deny the court
 to declare the proper construction
 and the decisions of thc
 courts in cases properly before
 them become until reversed part
 of the law of the
 land and every citizen must
 yield obedience to them Then
 in regard to a State
 being the sole judge of
 its political rights my opinion
 is that it is the
 duty of all States and
 of all communities to assert
 their rights to demand them
 to peti tion for them
 and it is the like
 duty of all the other
 sections of the Union to
 accord those rights wiilingly and
 promptly But when all constitu
 tional remedies are exhausted and
 fail to secure freedom to
 others cannot long in the
 providence these constitutional rights then
 thc citizens of a ofGod
 retain it themselves AI these
 things taken sovereign State are
 justified in asserting by force
 in connection with the past
 history of the party if
 necessary the rights which belong
 to them have alarmed the
 South These are the things
 f under thc Constitution That
 is my answer that have
 culminated in producing the disruption
 Mr STANTON Then I understand
 that the which now exists
 in the withdrawal of the
 south gentleman s claim is
 that whenever there is a
 ern States diihrence of constitutional
 construction in diffcr Mr FARNSWORTH
 1 desire correct the ent
 sections of the Confederacy it
 is the consti gentleman from
 Missouri I do not think
 he can tutional right of
 cach State to maintain its
 own find any passage in
 any speech of Mr Lincoln
 construction even by a dissolution
 o f lhc Con where
 he ever declared himself in
 favor of negro federacy and
 civil war suffrage Mr CLARK
 of Missouri No 1 believe
 no Mr CLARK of Missouri
 Oh yes I can find
 such thing and the gentleman
 could certainly that he has
 said what amounts to the
 same thing have not so
 understood me I say again
 that I Mr FARNSWORTH 1
 think thcgentleman it is the
 ldty of good citizens to
 submit to the is mistaken
 courts of the country It
 Vhcn the courts make a
 I vlr CLARK of Missouri
 I will incorporate decision it
 is the duty not only
 of States but of it
 in my rctnarks I have
 not time to read it
 now citizens to obey that
 decision but I know that
 I am right Mr Lincoln
 in a I Mr STANTON
 If that be so honor
 in part to represent stilt
 continue to mairi tain their
 loyalty to States self is
 what will relieve the apprehensions
 Of the people of the
 South What will restöre peace
 t o t be country
 What will give sti éngih
 tö the t T ni6if
 What wilk calm these troubles
 What will give peace and
 repose and confidence and safety
 gand again reunite our once
 prosperous coühtry In this connection
 Mr Speak6i without ad verting
 to any particular arguments permit
 me tb say it herc
 to anhounce it from myplace
 thatl believe the measures called
 the Crittendeh prop osition would
 give peace to the country
 That proposition sir establishes nothing
 more than the Missouri compromise
 as originally understood It docs
 nothing more than to give
 protectiön to persons and property
 in the territory lying south
 of the line of 960
 30 If gentlemén aro sincere
 in desiring the Union to
 be preserved if they are
 sincere in saying they are
 willing the South should have
 equal constitutional rights in the
 Union if they are sincere
 in saying they w ould
 do nothi ng in derogation
 of the rights of the
 South here is an opportunity
 by adopting that proposition to
 carry into effect their promises
 and to immedi ately produce
 a state of feeling that
 would cul minate in tho
 safety and reUni0i1 of the
 whole country in my humble
 judgment I ask gentle men
 of the Republican party why
 can you not consent to
 gubmit that proposition to the
 peor le Arc you afraid
 of the people I believe
 thåt if this proposition were
 to be submitted to the
 sov ereign people of this
 country it would be carried
 I by acclamation But if
 the people of the country
 are with the Rcpub icans
 of this House and op
 posed to that proposition you
 then run no risk by
 submitting it Mr HOARD Suppose
 it is submitted to the
 people and they votc it
 down would the gentle man
 then be satisfied II Mr
 KILGORE r understand thc gentleman
 from Missouri to say that
 thc Crittenden proposi tion is
 nothing more nor less than
 the Missouri compromise I wish
 to ask thegentleman whet hel
 that proposition does not constitutionalize
 slavery south of that linc
 and whether thc Missouri com
 promiso did speech at Chicago
 in September 1856 spoke as
 follows My friends I have
 detained you as long as
 I desired to do and
 I have only to say
 let us discard all this
 quibbling about tllis rnan and
 the other racc and that
 race and the at hcr
 race being and therefore they
 Inust be piaced in an
 infQ rior position discarding out
 standard that we have loft
 us Let us discard all
 these things and unite as
 one people throughout this land
 until we shall once morc
 stand up declaring that all
 onen arc created equal My
 friends I could not without
 launching oil upon some new
 topic which would detain you
 too long con tinuo to
 night I thank you br
 this n 03t externsive au
 dience that you have furnished
 me to night I leave
 you hoping that Lhe lamp
 of liberty will burn in
 your until there shall no
 longer be a doubt that
 au men are crcat ed
 free and equal Mr Lincoln
 in a speech at Chicacro
 on the 10th of July
 1858 used the following language
 If 1 were in Congress
 and n vote should eon
 e upon a question whether
 slavery should be prohibited in
 a new Territory in spite
 of the Dred Scott decision
 I would vote that it
 should Mr Lincoln in a
 letter addressed to the Repub
 licans of Boston in answer
 to an invitation to par
 ticipate in the celebration of
 Jefferson s birthday I April
 13 1860 used the f0110i
 ving languacre This is a
 world of compensation and he
 would I hose who I
 be no slave in ust
 consent to have 110 slave
 deny freed011 to othcrs deserve
 it not for themselves and
 under a just God long
 retain it LNow Mr Speaker
 notwithstanding all these things Missouri
 has ever been loyal to
 he Union Missouri and the
 border slave States have been
 ever true to the flag
 of our common country In
 addition to all these things
 raids are continually mado within
 our borders our slave property
 is taken our citizens are
 murdered and to day in
 the State of Missouri we
 are compelled to keep three
 companies of militia stationed on
 our bor ders to protect
 the lives and property of
 our fel low citizens Still
 these States have been ever
 I Mr CLARK of Missouri
 I cannot consent to be
 interrupted any further but I
 will make a personal application
 of the point The Supreme
 Court in tho Dred Scott
 decision delivered its opinion as
 to the constitutional rights of
 my sec tion of thc
 Union and yet thc gentleman
 s party refuses to submit
 to that decision They de
 nouncc the Supremc Court for
 making it and to reconstruct
 that court and to put
 it on the side of
 freedom I say then that
 it is timc for thc
 citizens of the section whose
 rights have II bccn sustained
 in that decision to prepare
 them selves for the Worst
 arrainst a section which re
 pudiates the Supremo Court and
 denounces its Mr CLARK of
 Missouri I will anssver t
 he decision gentlmnan from Indiana
 Mr STANTON the gentleman allowi
 Mr HOARD As my question
 asked me a n 0tnent
 of his time first I
 hopc you will answer it
 first Mr CLARK of Missouri
 I cannot Mr CLARK of
 Missouri I will l he
 gen Mr STANTON All I
 ask is to state my
 tleman from New York asks
 whether if the Crit position
 on this point tenden proposition
 be submitted to the people
 and Mr CLARK of Missouri
 One complaint I they refuse
 to adopt it will then
 be content to a ainst
 the Republican party and against
 Mr remain in the Union
 lanswer the gentleman that Lincoln
 s elevation to tlie Presidency
 is founded I am willing
 to subunit that proposition ns
 the basis on that very
 obioction of compromise and I
 state to the gentlernan from
 MI SINAN TON That is
 what I want to cor
 Now York that so far
 as I am concerned and
 so far as my State
 is concerned or at least
 so far as rect Mr
 CLARK ofMissouri Mr Lincoln stated
 that portion of the Statc
 which I represent is con
 in a speech that notwithstanding
 the decision of I corned
 for I have the right
 to speak forsmy con the
 Supreme Court in the Dred
 Scott case he stitucnts we
 are in favor of remaining
 in the would if he
 were in Congress still vote
 to pro Union so long
 as mvc can remain with
 honor and hibit slavery in
 the Territories while the court
 I safety W c love
 the Union We love the
 stars had said that it
 was unconstitutional to pass that
 and stripes W c look
 upon its monuments upon its
 past glories upon its present
 greatness and restriction Mr Lincoln
 avowed that notwith standing the
 decision of the courts if
 he had the when this
 Congress met we looked forward
 to a bright future No
 light cause will ever make
 power he would still vote
 to prohibit slavery in Chat
 gen Missouri leave the Union
 But I tell you in
 that thc Territories of the
 United States tleman is now
 the President elect of the
 United connection that we must
 be equal we must have
 States elected by the Republican
 party having our constitutional rights
 we must be upon terms
 power to remodel the Supreme
 Court as occasion I of
 equality in all the departments
 of the Govern ment for
 we will remani with no
 people and in true They
 have not seceded They have
 not may present itself That
 is one cause of alarm
 defied the Federal authorities but
 they have corne it Mr
 STANTON If the genllcman will
 allow no Union or in
 any Confederation as inferiors me
 to interpose a word on
 that point to go out
 Mr HOARI Then I understand
 the gentle here vvith petitions
 and applications man from I
 lissouri to say his constituents
 are They ask the dominant
 party berc and they with
 his speech it may have
 tendency to quiet the apprehensions
 of his constituents upon that
 II willing to assert their
 constitutional rights in a have
 alwavs asked the North to
 give them their constitutional rights
 We ask 1 0tbing else
 and If Mr Lincoln Mr
 CLARK of Missouri il tend
 to submit to nothing loss
 Mr STANTON YViil the gentleman
 from would say a word
 upon that point himself he
 He could quiet thc apprehensions
 of the people on Missouri
 permit me to ask him
 a question the subject in
 a moment provided what he
 said says his State will
 submit to nothing less than
 her was in favor of
 obeying the decision of the
 court I desire to know
 whether constitutional rights Hc could
 quiet the fears of the
 country or pre they will
 constitute themselves the sole judges
 of what is to be
 the construction of the Constitution
 parc them for what inevitably
 would come Nir STANTON Now
 will Mr CLARK of Missouri
 The gentleman from Ohio asks
 mc if we will constitute
 ourselves allow me I will
 take but a moment of
 his time the solo judges
 as to our constitutional rights
 My Mr CLARK of N
 _lissouri No sir I cannot
 answer to thegentleman is this
 the Govern mentis yield further
 Mr Speaker I vas going
 On to re composed of
 three departments the executive ju
 mark that notwithstanding all these
 complaints dicial and legislative I
 understand the first duty of
 which in our judgment have
 abundantcause a good citizen is
 to obey the laws of
 the land The to make
 the people of the State
 which i have thc constitutional
 way Mr CLARK of Missouri
 That is what I I
 stated before what my doctrine
 was in say answer to
 the gentleman f rom Ohio
 We wili ex haust ail
 constitutional means first Otit doctrine
 is that it is the
 duty of every citizen to
 make his application in a
 constitutional manner and to make
 his resistance in a constitutionål
 manner as long as that
 Constitution furnishes a remedy for
 the cvils that are done
 him but when they are
 exhausted when our application iS
 not heard when our constitutional
 guarantees are violatcd when the
 departments of the Government will
 not hear our request or
 grant us What is our
 due under the Constitution then
 we have our remedy thcn
 580 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January
 26 II as a matter
 of course we must fall
 back upon first may be
 preserved and it is with
 you gentlemen ple as a
 reason why they were not
 for disrupting principles and preserve
 our rights the best way
 of the Republican party to
 do it Delay put it
 off longer quibble over thése
 technicalities and we can I
 was proceeding to ask the
 Republican party why they w_ill
 not consent to submit the
 Critten dcn proposition to the
 people Mr KILGORE 1 hope
 the gentleman from Missouri will
 not forget to anss ver
 my question Mr Missouri The
 gentleman from Indiana wants his
 proposition answered and will answer
 it Sir we wantnothing more
 than what is just and
 proper The Crittenden prop osition
 we contend IS nothing more
 or less than carrying out
 the principle embodied in the
 Mis souri compromise The gentleman
 says that the Crittenden proposition
 gives constitutional pro tection to
 slave property south of the
 line of 360 3 Y
 Well sir I ask any
 Republican I ask any member
 of any party in this
 House if you pro pose
 to grant that line if
 you are willing to ac
 knowledge slavery to exist south
 of that line does not
 the Constitution of the country
 demand that property shall be
 protected there If you are
 willing to grant that line
 is there anything incon sistent
 on the part of any
 Republican in voting for the
 Crittenden proposition and thus giving
 peace to the country You
 acknowledge that élavery exists there
 and all that we ask
 is that we may have
 protection for the property which
 you have said ma exist
 there Mr ILGORE one word
 further Mr CLARK of Missouri
 I cannot yield again Mr
 KILGORE 1 merely wish to
 put the I merely want
 to say that the gentleman
 right proposed restoration of the
 Missouri line embraces much more
 than that The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The gen tloman from
 Missouri declines to yield and
 the gentlc man from Indiana
 is out of order I
 tell gentlemen Mr CLARK of
 Missouri upon the Republican side
 of the House that now
 is the time if they
 desire to prevent the hopeless
 dissolution of Confederacy Missouri Ken
 tucky Tennessee Arkansas Virginia Maryland
 Dela vare we are the
 border slave States we claim
 to be the conservative portion
 of this Union and we
 not only claim to be
 the conservative por tion of
 this Uuion but ve are
 the sufferers as border Slates
 We have borne our sufferings
 with patience but the people
 of these States are now
 moving My own State has
 provided for a con vention
 to take into consideration what
 remedy they Shall provide have
 confidence in the peo le
 of the State of Missouri
 I have known them I
 have lived among them all
 my life and I know
 them to be a brave
 and loyal people under standing
 what are their rights and
 possessing the I have full
 confidence nervo to maintain them
 that the convention soon to
 assemble there will protect the
 honor the safety and the
 interests of it does not
 become ma to point out
 my State the course of
 policy lhcy ought to pursue
 But sir i tell the
 Republican party that unless some
 thing be done soon to
 allay the existing excite rnent
 and to restore harmony to
 tho country unless sir they
 evince some spirit of conciliation
 and comprornise and pass some
 measure of ad justment like
 the Crittenden proposition the U
 nion will be severed Unless
 something is done the border
 States when they assemble by
 their com missioners in convention
 will coöperate with their southern
 brethren unless they can have
 secured to them the rights
 guarantied by the Constitu tion
 the right of protection to
 our peculiar prop erty in
 slaves without which we cannot
 live with you T hc
 border States are not in
 favor of precipi tate action
 They have already shown that
 they are not We have
 made no threats but sir
 we are not the less
 determined to act at the
 proper time as becomes a
 free and a brave people
 Mis souri will not shrink
 from the responsibility im posed
 upon her If our constitutional
 righ ts shall be resisted
 and denied to us and
 the Union be dissolved let
 gentlemen of the North be
 not mis taken or deceived
 the border States will confed
 erate with the States xxvith
 which they are homo geneou
 s in population and institutions
 But we beg to be
 relieved from such a dire
 alternative We implore the party
 in power to adiusl the
 pres ent difficulties by granting
 the South her consti tutional
 rights Now is the accepted
 time now peace may be
 secured with honor now the
 Union it may be too
 late The SPEAKER The gentleman
 s hour has expired Mr
 GILMER obtained the floor Mr
 CLARK of Missouri I ask
 that my time I have
 not yet finished all I
 have be extended to say
 The SPEAKER Is there objection
 There was no objection and
 it was ordered accordingly Mr
 CL ARK of Missouri 1
 thank the House for its
 kindness Mr Spealccr I want
 to remark that it is
 in my opinion the duty
 of the border States Vir
 ginia Kentucky Tennessee Missouri and
 Ark ansas to consult togcthcr
 We have the same population
 and the same interests and
 our des tiny is inseparable
 Missouri is pledged by res
 olutions known as the Jackson
 resolutions their author being our
 present Governpr passed in 1849
 thut she would be found
 coöperating with the slavcholding States
 if the constitutional rights of
 the South were denied by
 Congress I under stand that
 our first duty the first
 duty of the bor der
 States is coöperation Their ultimate
 destiny will be dctermined by
 the action of their respect
 It is in tbe ive
 conventions about to assemble power
 of this Congress to save
 the Union While I love
 the Union while I avow
 my de votion to it
 while my constituents are devoted
 to it while they all
 dcprecate disunion and would do
 everything not dishonorablc to avoid
 pesti lence famine anarchy fratricidal
 war indeed all the horrors
 of civil war yet sir
 we are resolved to have
 our rights We are resolved
 to have all the rights
 guarantied to us by our
 forefathers W c arc resolved
 not to be placed upon
 terms of inequality and inferiority
 If ve cannot secure our
 rights in the present confe
 leration we will bc coil
 pellcd to confrderate where they
 can be secured Mr GILMER
 The storm that now rages
 in South threatened before I
 left my home It has
 It is near at increased
 and still is increasunff It
 hus been my hope band
 and is all around us
 that sorne action of the
 two Houses of Congress would
 ere this have allayed this
 threatening regret that it has
 not been done tempest think
 I trust that it is
 not yet too late for
 some t hing to be
 done by this Congress by
 which this Government may be
 preserved and peace aud hanuony
 restored to the greatest nation
 and the I must confess
 I greatest people upon the
 earth feel discouraged by tho
 fact that our northern friends
 have up to this hour
 made no demonstra tion Whether
 t hey intend to do
 so or not I am
 not assured but appearances indicate
 a cold icy stoical indifference
 to this racino storm in
 the southern States A final
 effort a desperate strug o
 le is now being n
 fldc in all the southern
 States to consummate that which
 South Carolina now avows Ehe
 has had at heart for
 the last thirty or förty
 years When I x vas
 a boy in that gallant
 State the doctrine of nullification
 was preached It was said
 to bc a peaceful rerncdy
 It was said to be
 tho only constitutional remedy by
 which differ enccs between a
 State and the General Govern
 ment in relation to pox
 vcr could bc safely settled
 But when that heresy was
 crushed out during the adm
 inistration of General Jackson the
 next resort In order 10
 give that scnne ivas to
 secession plausibility it was said
 to be most peaceful in
 its character Nullification ncvcr could
 have had many friends secession
 never could have had many
 friends were it not that
 their advocates gave the most
 solemn assurances that they were
 con stitutional Union men and
 excelled all others in attach
 ment to ti ie Constitution
 and the Union and that
 tlie direction which they led
 was the better for the
 preservation of both These pills
 were made acceptable with tlle
 most seductive assur ances of
 good designs and peaceful purposes
 I pass sir over many
 points of history in rela
 tion to this matter which
 go to show that this
 conspiring for disunion has been
 at work for many years
 to c orne down to
 a day within the last
 twelve months When the Democratic
 party per mitted itself to
 be disrupted by the nullifiers
 and the seceders at Charleston
 and Baltimore and our nullifying
 and seceding friends rallied under
 a nomination of Union men
 they held up that nom
 ination of Union candidates to
 the southern peo this Goycrnment
 in case Lincoln was elected
 They insisted vociferously that they
 had made Union nominations that
 they had putat the head
 of their ticket men who
 were Union men as show
 ing they had no design
 of disrupting the Govern ment
 in case they were defeated
 and Lincoln was elected When
 they were accused of look
 ing to disunion in case
 of defeat they uniformly in
 the South almost without exception
 in the border southern States
 denied it most manfully What
 is the rcsult The men
 who regulated and controlled that
 disruption of the Democratic party
 the men who enlisted under
 the Breckinridge ticket the men
 who have maintained nullification as
 being peaceful in its character
 who have advo cated secession
 as a peaceful remedy where
 are they Doing all they
 can everywhere to destroy this
 Union Mr BURNETT Will the
 gentleman permit me to interrupt
 him Mr GILMER 1 decline
 to yield What is said
 now What is the course
 pursued by them now To
 give the country time for
 reflection To give the country
 time to consider Are the
 i people allowed to consider
 what they shall do V
 hen Georgia was calling her
 convention when Alabama was calling
 her convention when Mis sissippi
 was caliing her convention what
 did we see We found
 telegram after telegram going from
 this place not for peace
 not for reason not for
 reflection but still further to
 inflame the south ern mind
 still further to fire the
 southern heart still further to
 run into madness into inconsid
 ate action the whole southern
 people North Carolina and Virginia
 are now calling conven tions
 and what is the course
 pursued by men pro fessing
 to want to preserve this
 Union I wilk only call
 attention to what was published
 in yes terday s Globe
 Here it is A dispatch
 from Richmond says Ten Virginia
 Con gressmen have sent out
 an address to the people
 of Virginia giving a review
 of thc congressional proceedings in
 refér ence to the great
 question of the day and
 the probable ac tron or
 Congress saving that it is
 vain to hope for any
 neasurcs of conciliation or adjustment
 fronl Congress They also hich
 the people ot the South
 could accept say that th
 ey arc satisfied that the
 Republican party designs by civil
 war alone to coerce the
 southern States undef the pretext
 of enforcing the laws unless
 it shall become speed ily
 apparent that the seceding States
 are so mnnerous de termined
 and utiited as to Inakc
 such an attempt hopeless The
 address concludes by expressing the
 so ernn conviction that prompt
 and decided action by the
 people ot Virginia in convention
 vvill afford the surest Inean
 s under the pvov idence
 ot God in averting the
 impending civil war and preserving
 a hope of reconstructing a
 Union already dis2 solved Here
 are two ideas particu arly
 dangerous in their character prominent
 in this address first is
 that Virginia s only safety
 is in Icavino this Union
 And the second is equally
 fallacious equally dangerous tind it
 is that thul is the
 only I notice also way
 to reconstruct this Government the
 followino in the North Carolina
 Standard a Democratic paper but
 witha Union standard re ferrinq
 to a letter sent from
 here by a Senator from
 North Carolina in the other
 House Among other things Mr
 CLINGMAN charges that the hesitation
 or division in the South
 and t h e delay
 in the St ate are
 encouraginf the Black Republicans that
 the Black Republicans only want
 an opportunity to eonjppi the
 South to submit to their
 d01nination to the ectcnt ez
 en of abolishing slavery should
 civif war afford them a
 toler able pretext Why Mr
 Speaker this idea of a
 reconstruc tion of the Union
 is only a part and
 parcel of the fruitful expedients
 by which the popular mind
 is to be lulled until
 the pooplo deceived by it
 r are drifted into the
 terrible consequences of the disrup
 I t ion of this
 Government What sir get the
 fifteen slave States of this
 Union separated from the cieh
 teen free States as thc
 proper mode to be pursued
 to procure a reconstruction of
 this Government There is a
 purpose and a design in
 ail this You meet the
 plain and honest hear ed
 Democrat or an old Whig
 either of North Carolina or
 Vir ginia or Kentucky 0k
 Missouri and tell him that
 the ultimate design and purpose
 of the movement is to
 sever finally and forever these
 slave States from the free
 and break up this Union
 and he would shudder at
 the idea as the men
 who voted for Breckinridge would
 have shuddered had they had
 they been told that on
 the known the truth failure
 of that ticket its friends
 intended to dis solve the
 Union The true intention or
 purpose is not made known
 to them Should the honest
 farmers mechanics and merchants of
 the South 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 581 be told the
 truth that the object is
 the final dis ruption of
 tbc Government they would shudder
 at the idea When you
 throw outa decoy duck and
 tell them this deception this
 syren song that this is
 only a movement of the
 southern States to procure a
 reconstruction of thi s Government
 I sübmit with great defcrence
 that you deceive them Reconstruction
 You might as well tell
 me after you had taken
 a delicate watch and put
 it under the ponderous blows
 of a forge hammer that
 you only did it that
 you might reconstruct with perfection
 its complex machinery I have
 no hope that they will
 ever come to the work
 of reconstruction But if they
 should fear they will fail
 and I should not I
 confess be much surprised if
 it were to turn out
 that their first step I
 honor had beert to break
 the main sprin r Virginia
 and North Carolina and all
 the south ern States that
 have not seceded and desire
 that they shall understand what
 is really covered up in
 this cry of a readjustment
 of the Govern ment 1
 would say to my nortbern
 friends to the the Republican
 party that you have it
 in your power and that
 too I conceive with out
 any material sacrifice of any
 principle valu able to you
 or any one else to
 crush this thing out in
 one hour You have the
 power and you ought to
 quiet the minds of all
 reasonable men in tho slave
 States You have it and
 I say it with great
 respect you have itin your
 power to crush out the
 enemies of this great and
 glorious Govern ment Why sirs
 do you think these ultra
 men insist on what they
 call protecti01 because it is
 of any value to them
 Whenever you say to them
 take it as you want
 it then you hand over
 to them what will be
 to them their political winding
 sheet II is not because
 it isa thing which is
 really valu able to the
 South that they desire protection
 nor is it because it
 would be any injury to
 thc North if you grant
 it They demand it because
 thcy think you will refuse
 it and by your refusal
 they hope the South will
 be inflamed to the extent
 of break in T up
 this Government the tery thing
 the leaders Let me ask
 you northern gentlemen I beg
 par don when I address
 you as northern men but
 you are the men to
 whom I want to appeal
 let me ask you one
 question Suppose the Congress of
 thc United States were to
 pass a law that no
 Gov ernor ofa Territory that
 no member of a Terri
 corial Legislatore that no man
 of any protninence in the
 Government should give a vole
 make a speech or utter
 a word against tbc right
 of a slaveholder to settle
 and remain with his slaves
 in any Territory belonging to
 this Government north or south
 do you think it would
 make a sol itary slave
 State more than otherwise would
 nat urally be provided the
 North had an equal chancc
 to emigrate and settle in
 those Territories Would it make
 one more slave There is
 not a man in this
 House who can now put
 bis hand upon his breast
 and say that he believes
 that it would malco one
 slave State more or less
 or one frec State more
 or less or one slave
 more or less And if
 you want effectually to break
 up this disunion movement you
 have to do is to
 risc in your and voted
 with a few conservative men
 of the South to settle
 the question by allowing the
 peo ple of Kansas to
 take the matter into their
 own hands and say whether
 there should be slavery there
 or not You did that
 and ask you what was
 the result The result in
 Kansas shows that I there
 is no harm to you
 in that course On that
 prmciple you triumphed On that
 principle main ly for adopting
 it in that case has
 your strength grown up in
 your section and I believe
 there are not now in
 any section of this Union
 many who have courage enough
 to denounce the course then
 taken to settle that difficulty
 You triumphed then But as
 I think on a correct
 fail principle all you ought
 to desire is the maintenance
 of that principle whether it
 runs out for you ot
 asyainst you You have it
 in your power to maintain
 it You have elected the
 President and Vice Presi dent
 You have secured the appointing
 power Then I ask you
 to consider it again I
 ask you If you will
 say to to go home
 and think about it these
 fire eaters of the South
 Give us free em igration
 and ree settlement and then
 a fair vote on thc
 formation ofa Stateconstitution you will
 see a set of men
 die off quicker than you
 over saw a set of
 men die off before You
 will send them homc to
 hide their heads mourning and
 disap pointed I ask you
 to do it I implorc
 you for the sake of
 the peace the quiet and
 the happi ness of thc
 greatest people on t be
 face of the earth Do
 it and to many millions
 of anxious and ach ing
 hearts it will give ease
 Do it and you will
 save the greatest people on
 the face of the earth
 from utter bankruptcy and ruin
 and you will put an
 end to the race of
 a set of men who
 are acting as I verily
 believe like madmen You will
 lose nothing fbr your section
 or your party You will
 gain immeasurably to both and
 to the whole coun try
 But you say there was
 no such issue as this
 in the canvass that you
 did not come here under
 any instructions upon such an
 issue as this Nor did
 you when Lccmnpton came here
 Your elec tion took place
 before that swindle was perpe
 trated and presented to you
 You acted then without instructions
 You acted under the advice
 of southern conservative men and
 you got clear of that
 great wrong You acted under
 the solemn sanction of your
 oaths and met that crisis
 Do so now and your
 constituents will approve and rejoice
 in your course I tell
 you if you will only
 be advised by me who
 live in the heart of
 the Sout h a man
 in whom i bf lieve
 you have some confidence as
 a fair minded man just
 now be ad vised by
 me and your country will
 say that you acted like
 noble patriots in a crisis
 which was forced upon you
 You wilk have the praises
 of all your countrymen and
 thousands and millions of unborn
 souls will rise up to
 say Blessed be the men
 who stood in this crisis
 and saved this great country
 Why sirs you tell me
 Con gress can mnkc slavery
 go or not go wherever
 it pleases Just as well
 might you tell me that
 any law that Congress might
 pass would stop the waters
 of the Mississippi from flowing
 into the Gulf of Mexico
 as to tell me that
 Congress could lefyislate sla very
 out of or into any
 Terri might in this and
 say Gentlemen of I tory
 It canr10t be done the
 South just fix it so
 that t herc shall be
 equal More than that gentlemen
 when is this con cnessional
 legislation to be invoked When
 will of immigration and settlement
 in the Ter it be
 asked for Only when the
 people ofa Ter ritories givcn
 to au the States and
 when the peo ritory indicate
 their hostility to slavery and
 in ple have the power
 to form a State constitution
 which as things now stand
 will be a very short
 vade the right So long
 as thc people get along
 time they shall be permitted
 to come in with a
 without sla very or peacefully
 with it such le It
 is only when the free
 or a slave constitution as
 they desire Do gislation is
 not asked for peoplc arc
 determined not to have it
 that Con this and you
 could do nothing that would
 disap How long will point
 the disunionists nqore or which
 would so gross could be
 asked to interfere such legislation
 be effective The peoplc as
 in the speedily prove their
 downfall There would be casc
 of Kansas will soon decide
 Congcessional joy and gladness among
 all the industrious masses but
 weeping mourning and wailing and
 a speedy action would not
 make a slave more or
 a slave I ask the
 members of t his House
 to con end to the
 ambitious schemes of disunion poli
 sider Let by gones and
 past differences pass ticianso Why
 gentlemen of t he North
 let me remind you of
 the Kansas Lecompton troubles Let
 us coine up to the
 great work of the peace
 frauds and swindles The manner
 in which they happiness and
 prosperity of our great and
 be loved country vere settled
 was not of your device
 As you know at least
 Think of it til l
 If yoü Will not give
 us the Crittenden us the
 border States proposition åf then
 give us the proposition of
 the committee of thir ty
 three modified if you please
 to conforms in substance and
 in effect to the two
 propositions but let us all
 go man who loves his
 country and this Union for
 somer thing that will certainly
 give peace to our diétraOtcd
 and distressed countrymen of all
 sections Sir am free to
 say that I have given
 Ahe most careful examination to
 these various propositions and I
 am cheered to find them
 all verging so nearly to
 the same ends They do
 not differ so widely us
 to justify Union men falling
 out by the way and
 failing to agree The effects
 expected by the adoption of
 any one of them ought
 not to be lost I
 by the adoption of either
 of the others In many
 particulars and for reasons which
 I have not timo now
 to assign 1 think of
 the report f the committee
 of thirty three Under all
 thecircum stances I incline to
 the opinion that their prop
 osition to adjust the territorial
 question should be well considered
 because it shows a feeling
 on the I part of
 northern gentlemen thatl häd notexpected
 The objection to the proposition
 so far as it relates
 to the Territories cannot consist
 in the proposi tion itself
 but it must be somewhere
 else than in It must
 be because it what I
 can see on its face
 does not come from what
 gentlemen consider a I read
 it as it is written
 I desirable source give it
 think a fair and impartial
 construction And if I do
 it means much and goes
 a long way to adjust
 and settle all territorial quat
 rels as to the I
 erritories we now have or
 may hereafter have I prefer
 Mr CRITTENDEN S proposition so
 far as it relates to
 siavery in the Distric t
 of Columbia and in the
 forts arsenals and dock yards
 But northern gentlemen say that
 if you submit all these
 little questions of constitutional amendment
 to the people and some
 of them are voted down
 you will be worse off
 than you were before and
 that these are all small
 and unimportarv questions compared with
 the question ofsiavery in lhe
 States The question as to
 the interference with slavery in
 these places has only had
 importance in the South as
 settling a principle which they
 feared Would lead to an
 interference with slavery in the
 States Whether slavery shall be
 employed in these places or
 not is aquestion small compared
 with the ques tion of
 slavery in the States but
 it becomes an important one
 in the South because if
 that power were exercised by
 CongrcSs our people take it
 for granted that the next
 step would be to attack
 slavery in the States But
 if as gentlemen pro pose
 they will give us a
 congressional pledge upon these subjects
 and then give us as
 they propose a perpetual guarantee
 against the inter ference of
 Congress with slavery in the
 States the great area or
 field where it exists for
 all time to come by
 a constitutional amendment never to
 be altered or disturbed except
 by the consent of all
 the States of this Union
 if you will do this
 then conceive the apprehensions of
 my people will in a
 great degree be removed as
 to thcse diminutive localities When
 the people of the free
 States have given them a
 guarantee for tho perpetual enjoyment
 of their institutions in these
 glorious fifteen States having nine
 hundred and fifty thousand square
 miles of territory the best
 rivers in the world tl
 ie most valuable produc tionsof
 the earth and the most
 desirable climate E and also
 give them a reasonable chance
 in the Territories wherever climate
 soil and produc tions will
 invite their settlement then would
 add ress my people and
 say that they should stay
 in the Union With this
 constitutional perpetual guarantee as to
 slavery in the States and
 a con gressional pledge as
 to the District arsenals and
 dock yards I should consider
 all inducements to interfere with
 slavery in these very small
 locali ties removed Gentlemen say
 that this is altogether unneces
 sary that you never intend
 to interfere with sla I
 say to gentlemen here from
 the North con very in
 the States and that you
 have no power a few
 conservatives of the South had
 to struggle for a longtime
 to prevail upon some of
 you to vote with I
 sider well Mr CRITTENDEN s
 proposition not now to abolish
 it in the States I
 have repeat us upon theCrittenden
 amendment because it said because
 it is so much better
 than some others as e

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 26
 estly believe that thc Republican
 party a great and powerful
 party at the North do
 intend to interfere with slavery
 where it exists in the
 States and if the North
 will come up in this
 solemn man ner and put
 this perpetual guarantee in the
 Con stitution against the power
 of Congress then the men
 who distrac_t the South with
 this jdeu will be contradicted
 by you in At he
 most positive and in dubitable
 manner for all tinw to
 come And here let me
 make a remark to northern
 gentlemen in all kindness and
 without meaning any offense to
 any one You say you
 have elected your Presi dent
 constitutionally I admit it You
 express wonder and surprise that
 the South should be alarmed
 at this Now let me
 reason with you The presentation
 of the converse of a
 proposi tion sometimes puts the
 question itself in a dif
 ferent light Suppose the position
 of tbc two sections of
 the Union was reversed suppose
 the slave States were eighteen
 and the free States fif
 teen suppose the slave States
 had majority in this House
 a mAjority in the Senate
 and a ma jority in
 the electoral college suppose the
 slave States were to hold
 a convention ang appoint the
 place of meeting as far
 South as they could say
 at Mobile that there should
 be no delegates in that
 convention from the free States
 that they should nominate two
 candidates one from Flor ida
 and the other from rrexas
 and should vind up thei
 proceedings by the adoption of
 a resolu tion intimating that
 it is in the power
 of Con gress as well
 as the duty of Congress
 to pro vide that no
 more free States shall bc
 admitted into the Union and
 should elect their candidates nominated
 by the slave States alone
 suppose all these things wcre
 to happen and then speeches
 assurances and tclcgrtuns should be
 freely cir culaLed through your
 country that the South in
 tend to make all tho
 States slaveholding States I submit
 to you my northern friends
 would you not be very
 much warrncd up against that
 south ern movernent and begin
 to feel that you were
 the same principle there established
 if carried out about these
 slaves just as Mr North
 and Mr would carry slavery
 into the free States Who
 can South originally did for
 themselves and their fam wonder
 that that idea when presented
 to north ilies The question
 then comes to this can
 we ern audiences should excite
 them against the agree Is
 it possible that the sons
 of American South and set
 them railing against us And
 so fathers cannot agree in
 this trifling matter If not
 when a Democrat gets up
 before a southern audi I
 ence and tells them that
 the great sectional Re I
 publican party has got the
 power and has determ ined
 to set all the slaves
 free who can Wonder that
 they become excited Who can
 wonder that the man who
 owns slaves looks up his
 old rifle and that he
 and his sons are for
 fighting when thus assured Partisansand
 demagogues have wrought all this
 mischief The Supreme Court as
 I un derstand it has
 not decided that tha normal
 con dition of the Territory
 is cither slave or free
 No sir I used to
 think that the Missouri compromise
 was constitutional Looking to the
 men who passed it and
 the long acquiescence of the
 coun I try and of
 all parties under it I
 so concluded thought that partners
 in land coald divide their
 land as legally and as
 constitutionally as they can sell
 it or iointly occupy it
 I can illustrate in a
 few words how I under
 stand this decision and the
 extent to which it has
 gone Pardon me if I
 do so by example Sup
 pose two old farmers Mr
 North and Mr Soutb have
 bought and cach owns a
 large tract of land under
 a Government which permits slavery
 Mr North says he does
 not want to have slaves
 on his plantation he will
 do without them and makes
 a family law that ali
 slaves brought over into his
 lands shall be free if
 they come by the consent
 of the owner The common
 Government says this I homestead
 law you may make But
 Mr South I owns slaves
 and says that he will
 and does make his fmnily
 law making ib legal to
 cornmand the obedicncc and service
 of his slaves This right
 the Government aforesaid common to
 them both recognizes Thcso old
 gentlemen after awhile conclude to
 buy for the joint benefit
 of themselves and their families
 a large body of new
 woodland but small folks in
 this Government Would you adjoinino
 or near to their said
 farm and fami then wc
 have lost the spirit of
 our fathers What did they
 do W lien they framed
 the Constitu tion nearly all
 the States owned slaves some
 did not They recognized and
 generously provided for the rights
 of all in these then
 States as to sla very
 and every other matter They
 provided in their common organic
 law that if a slave
 ran away from his master
 into a free State hc
 should be returned More than
 that they agreed by way
 of compromise and to form
 a Union with slave States
 to let the African slave
 trade be kept open for
 twenty one years That is
 what they did When North
 Carolina granted to you Tennessee
 it was put expressly In
 the bond that slavery should
 not be abolished by Congress
 in that Ter ritory That
 is what our fathers did
 What pray you would they
 do if they were here
 in our places to day
 Why they would settlesthis ques
 tion immediately l hey would
 not go to dinner before
 they had settled it They
 never would have broken up
 this Union rather than do
 m vhat I re quest
 of you to do ncvcr
 When the country comes to
 understand this and looks back
 upon what our fathers did
 this Congress will be dis
 graced for not having settled
 this question satis factori y
 and that too speedily Strip
 it of all the misrepresentations
 and exaogerations which have been
 so improperly crowded around it
 to create sectional jealousy and
 hatred and it bc comes
 one so smjpte and plain
 that were the plain honest
 masses herc that we assume
 to rep resent they would
 settle it before the going
 down of another sun Now
 Mr Speaker I want to
 refer to the prop osition
 of the comrnittee of thirty
 three I am not disposed
 to look bchind their action
 to see what this member
 or that member of the
 committee may have said The
 country will make up its
 judgment on the report itself
 What do they rec ommend
 To let the Dred Scott
 decision alone They say in
 silence to the South you
 have got that Dred Scott
 decision in your favor it
 gives to not feel like
 looking out fbr yourselves at
 least to the extent of
 asking for some guarantee I
 throw out this idea by
 way of some excuse or
 extcnuation of these ravings and
 threatenings to the peace and
 quiet of this country It
 is my honest opinion and
 in that I agree with
 the gentleman from Virginia Mr
 MILLSON that our present territorial
 question is substan tinny settled
 and that it is rather
 an excuse for agitation I
 incline to the opinion that
 in the future as heretofore
 soil climate and produc tions
 would settle this question of
 slavery in the Territories if
 peace and quiet were restored
 After all that has been
 said and done Congress has
 never madc a free State
 out of any Territory that
 nature intended for a slave
 State and has never made
 a slave State out of
 territory where froc labor could
 be profitably ernployed You cannot
 by your Wilmot proviso prevent
 the cs tablishunel t of
 slavery in any terri tory
 vhero the people can use
 compulsory labor better and with
 more profit than any other
 and where they can cultivate
 rice tobacco cotton indigo and
 sugar better than anything else
 When such a terri tory
 has got a population large
 enough for the establishment of
 a government ar d you
 tender them u territorial government
 with the Wilmot proviso in
 it they will th row
 it back in your faces
 and when they have sufficient
 population for a State they
 will organize a crovcrnmcnt of
 their own republican i form
 and apply for admission and
 according to your own principlc
 you will be bound to
 admit them I am only
 showing you what a very
 little t hing it is
 that we have got this
 country so much bv the
 cars about and if we
 get in a proper humor
 how casy it would be
 for sen Sible geritlemen to
 together and settle it Why
 gentlemen pray what is this
 territorial question It is one
 that hus only ass tune
 d its im Fjortance within
 a short time because ultra
 par tisans have magnified and
 misrepresentcd it for the purpose
 of inflaming the public mind
 North and South In this
 they have succeeded to a
 most lies and take a
 common deed to the land
 join in the payment of
 the purchase money and the
 deed is nutde to them
 and their heirs All this
 being in the course of
 a few weeks Mr completed
 North goes with his sons
 and apprentices oxen you your
 slaves and your right to
 hold them in and carts
 out into this newly purchased
 land to all the rrerritories
 North and South but we
 have rot the power to
 secure free settlements and fair
 and Mr South sends his
 sons and cut timber slaves
 with horses and wacons to
 do the same decisions in
 the Territories and ve will
 take care of the northern
 territory ourselves We leave When
 these parties meet on these
 newly pur chased lands and
 a quarrel begills Mr North
 II you the southern territory
 under circumstances addresses the sons
 of Mr South and says
 that which will enable you
 to establish slavery there although
 the land is common to
 both families i if you
 ever could do it under
 any circumstances Mr South had
 no right to send his
 slaves into this new purchase
 and in consequence of this
 and his Mr North s
 homestead law the slaves arc
 free N o sir reply
 the sons these slaves by
 law common to us both
 bclongcd to our father on
 the old place We have
 a joint right and a
 joint possession to this land
 with you We have not
 left our possession We are
 as much at home with
 these slaves and these horses
 as you are with your
 oxen and apprentices Mr North
 re plies if you want
 your neo roes to work
 on this land you must
 set them free or will
 set them free T hc
 sons of Mr South say
 if you do wc will
 do as much harm to
 you So here arises the
 question The Supreme Court decides
 that neither ofthcsc parties l
 ave oono ft cnn home
 they are tenants I In
 common and the same rights
 of property that cach had
 at and in their first
 homes they retain when they
 meet on the new purchase
 the con dition of which
 after the said joint purchase
 must I be mixed and
 must assimilate itself to the
 con dition rights and interests
 of its joint owners But
 suppose an honest ilnpartial néighbor
 should cmne up while the
 quarrel progressed between the parties
 and they would agree to
 leave the matter in dispute
 to him ho would not
 likely decide that the necrroes
 were free he would more
 likely advise them to divide
 their new lands as nearly
 equal between them as they
 could and each stay We
 leave the Dred Scott decision
 untouched uncontradicted and without criticism
 by making no reference to
 it in the compromise Take
 your southern territory under the
 compromise of 1850 and under
 the Dred Scott decision and
 with the protection and the
 right to sue for your
 slaves which it declares and
 do just what you please
 with it and we will
 take the territory north of
 the Missouri line just in
 the same way we ask
 no prohibition anywhere in any
 territory You can not make
 that north of 360 30
 slave territory and thereforc we
 care nothing for the Dred
 Sc ott de cision But
 do you take the southern
 territory with the Dred Scott
 decision take it now whilst
 the status of slavery is
 upon it fixed by territo
 rial law and make a
 slave State out of it
 if you can We ask
 no prohibition of slavery north
 of the line We trust
 to climate soil and produc
 tions If any of your
 negroes come over into our
 territory the few that come
 or are b ought may
 remain until the people of
 the rrerritory in form ing
 a Slate constitution shall otherwise
 determine If I am not
 mistaken and I think I
 cannot be in my construction
 there is no other on
 its face I think this
 proposition may bc safely accepted
 by the South It not
 only applies to the territory
 that wc now have but
 it applies also to what
 w e ever mav have
 I would have southern gentlemen
 think of it But it
 is said that there are
 men in the North with
 his own persons and things
 on his own side who
 make war upon the Dred
 Scott decision fearful and alarming
 extent This is the true
 But if told the court
 common to both parties had
 I ask is this the
 first decision of the Supreme
 Court complaint with which we
 are afflicted This is decided
 that this cannot be done
 constitutionally that was over denounced
 by apolitical party Our the
 disease which has brought us
 to the verge of the
 neighbor would then likely advise
 the parties Democratic friends talk
 now much about stand to
 make friends get on frieidly
 and peaceably ing by the
 decisions of the Suprerne Court
 the grave i Vhy sir
 I find in the newspapers
 of the day II with
 their persons and things the
 men Ibers think I noticed
 that at Charleston a little
 resolu that our northern friends
 say we have got the
 Dred of the faunily marry
 and setile new farms or
 plan tion was offered commuting
 the Democratic party Scott decision
 that that decision makes slavery
 tations on these newly purchased
 lands and then to bc
 bound by the decisions of
 the Supreme Court the nornnzal
 condition of the Territories and
 that let these new families
 determine each for itself on
 all constitutional questions but it
 did not get 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 583 many votes
 It comes with ill grace
 1 respect fully submit from
 the Democratic party to be
 preaching about standing up to
 the Dred Scott de cision
 when you cannot to day
 get them to pledge themselves
 that the Supreme Court evcn
 the pres ent court is
 to be the arbiter on
 all questions arising under the
 Constitution They never have done
 so They denounced the decision
 of the Supreme Court in
 the case of the United
 States Bank and although they
 had General Jackson in the
 Presidencv other Presidents of the
 same faith and had the
 control of almost every State
 govern ment they never tried
 to amend the Constitution in
 that respect or to take
 away the effect of that
 decision never The Republican party
 vcry im properly follow a
 bad example which was set
 for them but I imagine
 with no better success Experience
 under the decision will not
 require I I tell you
 it never will be done
 its reversal tell you gentlemen
 that in my opinion the
 more that is understood by
 gentlemen of the North and
 South the less inclined will
 they be to disturb it
 It was well said by
 the gentleman from Virginia Mr
 MILLS decison mark you con
 nected with this Kansas trouble
 that It gave to the
 North the kernel and to
 the South the hull and
 that is about the whole
 of it Now Mr Speaker
 I have presented these con
 sidcrations hoping thereby to get
 us in proper frame of
 mind and disposition to work
 for the peace of this
 country becausc I desire to
 do my duty and my
 whole duty while anx in
 the Union and if I
 am forced to go out
 of it I may I
 tell gen be also enabled
 Lo do my duty then
 Ilemen that if iii spite
 of all the efforts of
 wise and good men the
 State from which I come
 dc cides to dissolvc her
 connection with this Gov ernment
 my destinies are and will
 be s vith her i
 know that when that event
 occurs peace cannot long continue
 A war a terrible war
 will ensue whenever the people
 of the North and South
 have once appealed to the
 God of hattles for which
 I look with most fearful
 apprehension a civil war will
 follow that will end only
 in the dc struction of
 all the great interests of
 all sections of the country
 Whenevcrt at event comes I
 know my duty and whether
 I have thc nerve to
 be there rnysclf or not
 I know that such will
 be my duty and that
 it will also be my
 duty to devote to the
 ser vice my means myself
 and my children When ever
 that struggle comes you will
 find North and South that
 the men who have sought
 most to preservc the Union
 who have been the last
 to Five it up wili
 be the first men to
 be found in the rank
 and file on both sides
 of the bloody contest their
 means most liberally and freely
 be devoted to helping and
 maintaining the great terrific and
 bloody struggle and they will
 enter it on either side
 for victory or death and
 if they fail in their
 efforts for the first they
 will be found with their
 back to the field and
 their feet to thc foe
 I want gentlemen North and
 South to mark my words
 when these things corne when
 this bloody strife ensues as
 it certainly will unless this
 spint of disunion can be
 checked when mark you this
 country shall be laid waste
 when all our channels and
 communications of trade shall be
 broken up when the shipping
 in our ports shall be
 destroyed when our institutions oflcarning
 and religion shall wither away
 or be torn down when
 your cities shall be given
 up for plunder and for
 slaughter when your sons and
 my sons your neighbors and
 my neighbors shall be carried
 from this bloody field of
 strife and our mothers our
 sisters our wives and our
 daughters shall assemble around us
 and with weeping eyes and
 aching hearts say G Could
 not you have done something
 could not you have said
 something that would have averted
 this dreadful calamity I want
 to feel in my conscience
 and in my soul that
 I have done my duty
 Suppressed applause I want you
 fellow men of the North
 to be able to say
 that upon a mere abstraction
 that upon a question of
 no practical importance you have
 not held out and refused
 to yield for the sake
 of giving peace to the
 country I ask you a
 ain if you cannot give
 up this mere abstraction For
 Wilh all due respect i
 can never envy the feelingsof
 the man North orSouth5 who
 when that day of butchery
 and destruction shall come wilk
 feel in his heart that
 he stood out on a
 mere point of etiquette that
 if he had yielded a
 matter ofno practical im portance
 to him or his con
 stit uents all trouble could
 have been avoided I ask
 gentlemen North and South if
 they will not avowed and
 determined policy was to make
 free unite in settling these
 abstract questions and give dom

 prevent lanted and almost in
 full fruition long before the
 extension of slavery that the

 of the free States and
 the languishing natcd in thö

 of that great clusivcly that
 freedom favors growth and pros

 Mistaken Does the unprofitable to

 howling wilderness almost there was
 a strong reaction in the
 public mind untrod by the

 that slavery should never exist

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE January 26
 publican party upon the question
 of slavery is thc Eßärhe
 as that occupied by all
 the great statesmen Of the
 past both North and South
 and with the indisputable facts
 staring us in the face
 that the material interests of
 this great country can only
 be fully developed by a
 system of free labor we
 are dalled upon to stifle
 our convictions of right to
 Close our earSto the calls
 of humanity to ceaS e
 writing and speakingagainst to give
 it free license for its
 extension throughout God s heritage
 i have heard men of
 the South say that we
 must do all this and
 more we must change the
 hear ts of our people
 and make them believe with
 the South that slavery is
 right and not as we
 think now a curse and
 a crime buta blessing to
 the master and a mercy
 to the slave This of
 coürse we can never do
 The freemen of the North
 believe slavery to be Wrong
 a sin against God and
 a crime against man and
 they cannot and they will
 not be re sponsible for
 its further extension So far
 as I am concerned by
 no word or deed of
 mine shall sla very obtain
 any new constitutional guarantees The
 people of the North believe
 they have no power and
 they have no desire to
 meddle with the institution of
 slavery in the States They
 do not feel that they
 are at all responsible for
 it there and therefore it
 is no burden upon their
 con science But not so
 with thc Territories There they
 regard themselves as responsible for
 it and no power on
 earth could compel my constituents
 to consent to its protection
 there The people of the
 South groatly mistake the sentiment
 of ihe North They think
 this oppo sition to slavery
 is grounded upon prejudice and
 ill will to the South
 that their hatred of the
 South and its institutions is
 incffacabie and implacable that this
 slavery question is a merc
 question of property Would to
 God that thc southern mind
 could be disabused of this
 false imprcssion I bclicvo there
 is no sacrifice that could
 be named involving mere pecu
 niary considerations that the North
 would not cheerfully make to
 restore peace and harmony to
 our distractcd country But to
 be called upon to sacrifice
 their long clH 1 ished
 convictions of right and duty
 is more than they can
 consent to be the conscguenccs
 what they may Ro accuse
 us of hating the South
 because we cannot in conscience
 be responsible for any further
 guarantecs for slavery is no
 morc reason able than it
 would bc for Quakers to
 nceuse Bap tists of hating
 them because they could not
 In conscience become Baptists or
 for Baptists to ac cuse
 Quakers of hating them bectiuse
 they would not abandon their
 conscientious convictions and believe as
 they do No indeed if
 it was a ques tion
 of mere property it could
 bc speedily settled be the
 amount never so large My
 constituents are willing to live
 up to and fulfill all
 their consti obligations and will
 be quitc content to live
 on in thc future as
 in tbc past leaving slavery
 where it belongs unmolested in
 thc States If the Union
 can be upon this basis
 God he praised if not
 then they arc ready to
 take thc consequences I think
 have shown that the action
 ofthc North furnishes no reasonable
 ground of complaint How has
 it been with the action
 of the South Let us
 sec how far she has
 bccn just to the North
 For half a century or
 morc the South has vir
 tually had possession of the
 national Government and during that
 whole period a very large
 ma jority of the revenues
 for the support of the
 Gov ernment have been paid
 by the people of the
 North and luring a greater
 portion of that time more
 than three quarters of the
 whole revenue has been taken
 from the pockets of the
 people of thc North Any
 man who has bestowed much
 thought upon this matter and
 who will take the trouble
 to in vesticrate it thoroughly
 will bc convinced of the
 truth ofthcse declarations Now so
 far as offices and appropriations
 are concerned the South has
 always had the lion s
 share Her sons have mo
 nopolized to a very great
 extent all the best offices
 Its honors and emoluments of
 the Government have been lavished
 upon the men of the
 South with an unsparing hand
 Of all this thc North
 I not give them additional
 guarantees for protection because the
 condition aid institutions of the
 South are not conducive to
 the growth and development of
 such minds Therefore it is
 that filmostcvery southern mind in
 whose bosom glows the fires
 of ambition turne his attention
 to the glittering prizes and
 high honors of the Government
 Not so with the North
 While she has furnished to
 the Government many eminent statesmen
 of great ability vast attainments
 and liberal culture I think
 it but fair to say
 that as a generat propo
 sitions her highest type of
 mind is not to be
 found in administering the Government
 Therefore it is that in
 all political contests notwithstanding the
 acknowledged superior power of the
 North and her greater numbers
 the South has almost always
 been victorious Had the South
 used her power prudently and
 acted wisely she would have
 controlled the des tinies of
 this Government for generations yet
 to come Had she even
 administered the Govern ment as
 she always had done with
 but little re gard to
 the development of the material
 interests of the North and
 with an eye single to
 the inter ests of the
 South only but refrain l
 from attempt ing to coerce
 the North into a surrender
 of their deep rooted conscientious
 convictions of right and duty
 Abraham Lincoln would not have
 been to day President elect
 of these United States But
 flushed with victories so constant
 and thorough and maddened by
 every expression of opposition to
 their peculiar institution they commenced
 a work of proscription and
 aggression upon the rights of
 the people of the North
 which has finally forced them
 to rise in their might
 and drive them from power
 They commenced their ag gressions
 upon the North in some
 of thc south ern States
 by the enactment of unconstitutional
 laws imprisoning colored seamen and
 refusing to allow those laws
 to be tested before the
 proper tribunals They trampled upon
 the sacred right they rifled
 and burnt our mails if
 of petition they suspected they
 contained anything in con lcmnation
 of slavery They proscribed every
 northern man from office who
 would not smother and deny
 his honest convictions upon slavery
 and barter his inunhood for
 place They an noxed foreign
 territory avowedly to extend and
 and made stfcngthcn their peculiar
 institution war in defönse and
 support of that policy They
 refused admission into the Uni01
 1 of States with free
 constitutions unless they could have
 as an equivalent new guarantees
 for slavery They passed a
 fugitive slave bill some of
 the provisions of which were
 so merciless and unnecessary as
 they were inhurnan that they
 would have dis raced the
 worst despotism of Europe Thcy
 which rcpcale d that Missouri
 compromise mct they had themselves
 forced upon the North against
 their wishes and their votes
 and after having attained all
 their share of the benefit
 they struck it down against
 the indignant and almost unanimous
 protest of the whole North
 for the purpose of forcing
 slavery upon an unwilling peo
 people They undertook to prevent
 by violent rncans tho settlement
 of Kansas by free State
 men r I hey invaded
 that Territory and plundered and
 rnurdcred its citizens by armed
 force with arms belonging to
 and taken from the National
 Government They imposed upon its
 people ar bitrary wicked and
 bogus legislation by a fraud
 ulent Legislature They were left
 to the tender mercies of
 border ruffians unprotected by the
 11hese peaceable inhabit Federal Government
 ants were subjected to fire
 pillage and murder by these
 invaders at the instigation of
 southern counsels Not satisfied with
 all this they tried to
 force upon them against their
 consent a con stitution permittirp
 ai d protecting slavery and
 for spurning the bribe they
 have been kept oat of
 tho Union and made to
 suffer all manner of indignities
 Every new triumph of the
 South and every concession by
 the North has only whetted
 their appetite for still more
 and encour aged them in
 making greater claims and more
 un reasonable demands until to
 day they are threat eniog
 the overthrow of the Government
 if we do have ncvcr
 seriously complained and it results
 from two causes the jealousy
 of the South of northern
 influence generally and the fact
 that almost the only avenue
 to distinction in the South
 is in connection with the
 Grovernment There are few men
 of distinction in the South
 in science in literature or
 in mercantile pursuits to their
 slave proporty in territory which
 we do If this has
 been the action of the
 not nov r own South
 and such aro her monstrous
 and unreason able demands upon
 tbc North is it not
 well to inquire the value
 of this connection with the
 South and the consequences to
 us and to her of
 severing the tie which now
 binds us together In a
 speech which I made in
 this House on the 30th
 day of April last I
 used the following lan guage
 But we of thc North
 are not only threatened wit
 h a dissdution of the
 Union in the event of
 a contingency which think is
 sure to happen nameiy the
 election of a is to
 be established itnmediately with the
 North and the South will
 pnrehase no more of her
 products This is in deed
 alanning but let us inquire
 how this is to be
 effected Everything that the Söuth
 has to sell her poverty
 cornpels her to scll for
 cash only while everylhing we
 dispose of to I he
 South the South we give
 her a liberal credit upon
 to day cannot in my
 opinion pay its debts and
 it has not property enough
 in my judgment not what
 we Of the North call
 property to pay seventy five
 cents on the dollar Why
 if yon except the last
 few years in which t
 he South has been remarkably
 prosperous owing to the high
 price of her products a
 state of things which it
 is impossible should last and
 tbe North has lost more
 money at the South a
 great deal than she has
 ever madc by the trade
 of the South and there
 is scarcely a northern merchant
 who has not been obliged
 to depend upon his profits
 from custom received froun the
 middie and western States to
 Deet his I remember well
 losses suffered in trade at
 the South that in the
 great commercial revulsion that swept
 over this country like a
 tornado in 1837 every northern
 merchant that I knew in
 all the northern cities that
 dealt exclusively with the South
 failed and was ruined The
 saine thing again oceurrcd in
 1842 the year in which
 the United States bankrupt law
 was passed which wiped out
 untold millions of southern indebtedness
 znore in tact than the
 profits of the wholc t
 rade of the South would
 then amount to for half
 a score of years The
 only houses that survivcd those
 two storrns were those which
 had kept clear of trading
 with the South Mr Speaker
 what I then said I
 fully believed and thought I
 knew It has now become
 history which no one thinks
 of denying much with the
 South and my own experience
 is I have bestowed corroborative
 of these views much thought
 and investigation upon the subject
 and am willing to stake
 my reputation as a mer
 chant upon the record of
 the declaration that commercially and
 financially if you take into
 view only the business interests
 of the two sections the
 North would be better off
 if this Union should be
 dissolved to morrow Evcn if
 this Union is to be
 perpetuated in my opinion the
 South never will and never
 can pay one half of
 its indebtedness to the North
 without corvracting new debts to
 help meet its old obligations
 The whole property of all
 the cotton States if you
 except slaves will not equal
 by many millions in my
 judgment that of the State
 of Massachusetts The great staple
 of the South about which
 she boasts so much and
 with which she is to
 move the world does not
 amount to one half as
 much as the annual products
 of Massachusetts And I will
 venture the prediction that within
 eight years American cotton will
 not be of one half
 the relative import ance to
 manufactures that it is to
 day from causes which I
 have not time now to
 enumerate and the introduction of
 flax will diminish the use
 of it very materially I
 have spoken of the property
 of the South if you
 except slaves But why except
 slaves Be cause they are
 not property only in a
 conventional sense They arc not
 good for anything to pay
 debts with beyond the community
 where slavery is legalized and
 they add nothing to the
 aggre gate wealth ofa country
 or a community llhey are
 no more property so far
 as thc wealth of the
 community is concerned than our
 population at the North is
 property All labor adds to
 the pro ductive wealth ofa
 country and the only differ
 ence between slave labor and
 free labor in this connection
 is that our laborer ns
 his own labor and the
 slave s labor is owned
 by another and being forced
 labor is tess productive than
 the other consequently less valuable
 as a source of illustration
 perhaps that can be given
 than in peon slavery Peons
 are held to sarvice and
 can not control their own
 labor becausc it is owned
 by another and yet they
 are not property but they
 are quite as much property
 so far as the If
 therefore you State is concerned
 as slaves deduct the estimated
 value of the slaves from
 the aggregate property of the
 South the balance pre sents
 but a mea er show
 not much more than enough
 certainly to pay its indebtedness
 to others But I think
 I hear the question asked
 how will the trade of
 the North be improved by
 a separa tion from the
 South Because the want of
 thrift at the South is
 such and the system of
 long and loose credits prevails
 to such an extent thcrc
 that a large portion of
 the southern trade is not
 worth 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 5S5 having the losses upon
 it being greater to the
 merchant than the profits The
 credits are almost all upon
 one side consequently the osses
 are also There is no
 reciprocity in the credit system
 be tween the North and
 the South There is scarcely
 any thing of northern manufacture
 that the South will not
 want as much after disunion
 as it does now There
 is hardly any product or
 manufac ture of the North
 that the South now purchases
 of her that she cannot
 furnish against the markets of
 the world therefore free trade
 so far as the South
 is concerned could Ilia ke
 but littlcdifference to the commercial
 or manufacturing interests of i
 so much greater in numbcrs
 with almost infinite resources that
 such an unequal contest could
 only i excite feelings of
 pity for them with every
 reflect ino mind We can
 afford to be magnanimous and
 forbearing and let us do
 nothing which will put us
 in the wrono in any
 particular in the eyes of
 i the civilized world If
 we do not yield we
 are told by the advocates
 of compromise we are like
 the Government and tories of
 Great Britain in the days
 of theRevo lution They were
 told by the Burkes and
 thc Pitts that the colonists
 were righ in resisting and
 the King would lose the
 colonies if the Govern i
 ment did not recede So
 we were told now that
 the North If we should
 have a peaceable division which
 this Government shall be overthrown
 if we do I conceive
 next to impossible but if
 it were pos not cease
 to hate slavery and love
 freedom It sible the trade
 of the South would be
 more valu i seems to
 me this parallel should be
 reversed The able to the
 North than it is now
 Credit would colonists vere struggling
 against usurpation and be much
 more restricted than now and
 our losses on the part
 of those in power They
 would be comparatively light Our
 Government would also be relieved
 from an enormous expend iture
 which we have been are
 now and prob ably will
 be obliged to incur for
 the benefit of the South
 if we continue together most
 of which is drawn from
 the pockets of the northern
 peo ple The persons and
 property of our citizens would
 be much better protected then
 than now A united North
 under one Government would then
 as now be masters of
 this continent and all other
 Powers here would have to
 bow in hum ble submission
 tö our will We should
 be three times as great
 in numbers very much larger
 in inhabited territory and in
 wealth and material resources incalculably
 superior to the United States
 when she waged a successful
 war acainst Great Britain no
 longer ago than 1812 a
 nation of freemen with resources
 so vast with an I
 intelligence so great with a
 mission so important would not
 yield and they overthrew their
 power Just so with us
 We have resisted the usurpa
 tions and aggressions of tbc
 slave power and they would
 not listen to our appeals
 and we have risen in
 our strength and overthrown them
 I heard tlie distinguished Senator
 from Missis sippi say the
 other day that it would
 soon bc too latc if
 it was not already to
 tender the olive branch of
 peace that obstinacy and refusal
 to make concessions in season
 cost one king of Eng
 land his head and drove
 another his successor into exile
 And he compared us to
 King James who refused to
 listen to all complaints until
 hc saw his kingly scepter
 passing from him when he
 would gladly have made all
 the concessions demanded of liim
 but it was too late
 and he was I lore
 again is the mistake of
 driven into exile misapplication The
 parallel should be reversed James

 I close I wish to
 say a word in reply
 to the aspersions so frequently
 Cast upon the fair fame
 of Massachusetts and her distinguished
 Chief magistrate I will say
 now what I haved said
 before in this place that
 Massachusetts needs no eulogy from
 any of her sons Her
 works praise her and envy
 or malice may occaSion her
 disparagement but she stafids forth
 to day in the estimation
 of all enlightened men through
 out the world as the
 model State of this Union
 Her achievements in science in
 literature in arts in industrial
 pursuits and in works of
 benevolence and her intellectual and
 mbral standard gcthcr unsurpassed by
 any section of cquäl terri
 torial extent upon this continent
 Eqütdly pre eminent is her
 historic greatness and so Well
 settled is this by the
 general judgment orall man kind
 that no one whose opinion
 is worth quoting dares to
 deny her historic supremacy Her
 de votion to the interests
 of freedom is but the
 record of her history SIIC
 ever has been and evpr
 will be true to hcp
 plighted faith She will observe
 every constitutional obligation As she
 made greater sacrifices of the
 treasures of her coffers and
 the blood of her sons
 than any other State to
 secure constitutional liberty so she
 will al ways stand by
 the flag of the Union
 as the symbol of its
 power and the type of
 its continuity Her excellent Governor
 has been most basely slandered
 not only by the Opposition
 press but writhin the walls
 of this Cäéitol by those
 who should have known better
 as defender of the invasion
 of Virginia by John Brown
 The recoi d Of his
 testimony g ven under the
 solcmnitics of an oath not
 long after the occurrence in
 this very Capitol before the
 Harper s Ferry invcsligating committee
 stamps the declaration as false
 He has often declared in
 public and private that John
 Brown s invasion of Virginia
 was without justi fication or
 wa rrant Mr MAYNARD gentleman
 from Mas suchusetts will allow
 me desire to say a
 single word in explanation of
 his remark that the Gov
 crnor of Massachusetts has been
 grossly slandered in respect to
 his favoring the John Brown
 raid I suppose it is
 proper that the fact should
 be known that the statement
 of thc supposed sen timent
 of the Governor of Massachusetts
 origin ated in a reported
 speech delivered in Tremont Temple
 if I mistake not about
 the 19th of Novem bcr
 1859 on taking the chair
 to preside over a meeting
 called for the purpose of
 sympathizing with the family of
 John Brown perhaps or with
 some persons connected with that
 unfortunate affair Mr ALLEY say
 tothe gentleman from Tennessee that
 I desire not to be
 undérstood as imputing to any
 one in this House or
 in the Sen subjection With
 us cither one of several
 of our as bloodless and
 as beneficent in its results
 as ate an intentional misrepresentation
 of the posi tion of
 Governor Andrew I stated that

 indeed may the péople well
 old States could raise equip
 and maintain acon been basely
 slandered by tho Opposition press
 at rejoice siderable army upon
 its own resources and all
 the North and that the
 report which has been combined
 could defy the world in
 arms This is I This
 Government in my judgment will
 ncvcr made of his remarks
 on the occasion to which
 the no exacgerated picture as
 every thoughtful man be overthrown
 W c may have secession
 tem porary perhaps permanent and
 it may bc wise gentleman
 refers Was a garbled report
 that he has knows Is
 it for us then to
 humiliate ourselves since contradicted it
 and that his testimony given
 sacrifice our principles and be
 bound hand and policy to
 lot some of the refractory
 Stat os go but they
 will never repent before the
 investigating committee of the Senate
 peaceably if they foot by
 this arrogant slave power to
 save these southcrn States from
 rushing upon their own it
 hut once and that will
 bc always If they can
 proves the declaration to have
 been false 1 will il
 state to the gentleman further
 that I have heard afford
 to go we can certainly
 afford to lose them dest
 ruction Never Never But they
 are our brethren and we
 would not But deeply as
 I should deplore it should
 feel Governor Andrew both in
 private and in public say
 that thc invasion of John
 Brown wus withoub forget if
 we could that they are
 descendants of that much worse
 political evils could befall us
 justificati01 1 or excuse that
 he never had the the
 same heroicancestry and thus far
 have shared and for one
 I should try to bc
 content i do not believe
 with someof t hose who
 are slightest sympathy with his

 a common destiny And let
 us remem that they know
 not what they do They
 I implorirv us to submit
 to any demand to save
 that he never said In
 his life that he would
