Mr
'IIRUMBULL
Is it too late to object to the consideration of this resolution
The PRESIDING OFFICER
There was no objection made at the time the resolution was of- fefed
It is under discussion now, and the ques- tion is on agreeing to the resolution
Mr
TRUMBULL
It is a matter thatl do not wish to take up the time of the Senate in discuss- ing; and I think the best way to get rid of it would be to object tov consideration, and let it Postpone ft."] I move to postpone go over
It until to-morrow
The motion was not agreed
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 will make a single remark or two
I hardly think that I should have proposed this resolution at all if I had supposcd it would be deemed a matter of consequence or importance enough to lead to any discussion or any objection
I did not suppose it would
It is assigning to respectable foreigners, who are here in offcial capacigy, a seat in the gallery
Is there any thing in this that does not become the hospi- tallty and courtesy with which the American peo- ple, in their private capacity, in their private houses, receive respectable strangers and foreign- It is because I think it becomeS the hospi- ers 
tality, and is a graceful exercise of the courtesy, of the people of the United States, that I have been induced to offer this resolution and shall vote for it; that is all
I view it in that light
I novcr thought of starting any question of rivalry be- tween these foreigners and our American citizens as to privileges or distinctions to be granted here
It is not the occasion for any such question
is a matter of civility and courtesy to stran«ers and to foreigners who are herc on business with that is all
I am surc it is nob our Government; for us beyond that measurc of courtesy which they would receive from every American gentle- man in whose house they might be
Sir, there is a reason a little beyond this, I think, why they should have seats assigned tl•tem
We desire to open to them all the means of' in- formation svhatever of the country and of the Government to which they have been sent
This is one of the means
Important debates are ex- pected to-day
How could any one get into these galleries
You have privileged ministers to come on this floor; but that does not include thc whole class of offcial foreiffners by any means; and all but the ministers themselves would be excluded
I will not argue the question at all
The Sen- ate may dispose of it as they please
choose t.o convert a mere question of courtesy and I of hospitality into a great question of privileges and distinctions, I have nothing more to say about it; but I think there is not an American citizen who would not feel that the Senate of the United States might well show this mark of the courtesy and hospitality of America and of this Government
I I hope the ques- have no more to say about it
Lion will be put

STATE OF UNION
Mr
POWELL
Mr
President, the special committee of the Senate, to whom was referred that portion of President's messacye relatino• to thc present agitated condition of the country, have I send to the Secretary's directed me to report

proceedings of the com- ask that the report be read

The Secretary read, as follows: The committee of thirteen, appointed by order of the Senate
of the 20th instant, have agreed upon the töllowintv resolution, and report tlje same to thc Senate : Resoleed, 'I'hat Lhc committee have not been able to agree upon any general plan of adjustment, and report that fact to the Senate, together witli the journal of the committee

The Senate will not meet to-mon ; and I desire that the motion may lic over unti Ved- nesday
Mr
G MT f N
I will suggest to the Senator from lilinois that he had better select some other day
There is a special order—the Pacific rail* road bill—for that day; and I hopß the Senator will not interfere with it
Say Thursday
Mr
DOUGLAS
If I had any assurance that the Pacific railroad bill could be disposed of in one day or two days, I should bc willing to waive my remarks for that time; but, from what I have learned, I am perfectly satisfied the Senator can- not get the Pacific railroad bill through on Wed- nesday
Mr
G WIN
It is the special order for that day
Mr
DOUGLAS
But iB the present condition of the country, certainly there are other questions that will override it
Otherwise, i would not be in the way; for the Senator well knows that I have always supported every Pacific railroAd bill
am certain we cannot get action on it on that day

TERRITORY OF ARIZüMA
The Senate, as in Committee of tho- Whole, resumed the consideration of the bill" (S; 365) to provide a temporary government for ntht Territory of Arizuma, and to create -the offee df surveyor general therein; the pending question, being on Mr
TRUMBULL'S• amendment to; the amendmentof Mr

Mr
BROWN's amend- ment was to add as an additionalt seclion:: be further enacted,' That the actof the LégiSIåtäVe Assembly

Mr
TRUMBULL moved to amend the amendment by striking out all after the word

The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr
CRUMBULL
That amendment 1 lieve pretty fully explains itself
I do not desire to occupy the attention of the Senate in making any remarks upon it, further than to state that i hope it will receive the sanction of this body
Here is a reffion of country about to be organized into a territorial government, which, at the time wc acquired it, was under a law excluding Afri- can slavery from it
Now, the question is, when it becomes incorporated with this Government, without any action of the people there, or any desire to have that law changed, whether we should not continuc the existing state of thines
That is what we propose by this amendmeni— that the status of country in respect to Afri- can slavery as it was when we acquired it, shall, continue
This is not the Wilmot- proviso, to exclude slavery; it has been done alrcady; nor is it like thc section proposed by the Senator from Mississippi, a provision cstablishing slavery there; but it is to leave the country in the condi- tion in which found it when it x,vas acquired Tho amendment explains itself; and as the yeas and nays have been ordered upon it, I have no desire to take up the time further than to record my vote in its favor
Mr
GREEN
Senator from Illinois is I will not now say, becauseit greatly at fault
is not necessary, what the law of Mexico was, and what the effect of that
law would be afteran- nexation; but I do say, that the by the Senator from Mississippi is sim-ply to con= tinue the existing law over Arizona, Under the law of 1850, New Mexico was organized: When the Gadsden treaty was made, it was annexed to New Mexico and placed under the law of that rrorritory
•New Mexico passed the identical law that my friend from Mississippi has proposed to make tho law of Arizurna
It is the present law of Arizona; and when hc proposcs, therefore, to Inakc it the permanent law of Arizuma, he pro- poses to do no wrong to anybody
He does not propose to change the that existed in the Gadsden purchase, for that is already changed by existing law of New Mexico
There is no n)istake about it; and the Scnator fron'i Illinois is greatly at fault when he says we propose to change a law that existed, and with the people were satisfied
The law which the Senator from Mississippi proposes to make the permanent law is the existing law—the law that nobody can change, without competent authority
I thought, perhaps, it was unnecessary to propose it, because I knew the peoplo Lhcre would have just such institutions as they wanted; and therefore thought it was unfortunate that my friend -from Mississippi offered it; but when he the: principle bci•ng right, the law beipg right* I can— not vote ao•ainst it

We are not talking about what the law of Mexico was
That is all changed and abrogated
When 'sve took the Gads- den purchase, which is now proposed to be made the Territory of Arizumu, we annexed it to New Mexico, and put it under the jurisdiction of New Mexico
New Mexico passed the identical law that my friend from Mississippi says shall not be chancn•d•, and the only question is in regard to this phrase, in which [ think my friend from Mississippi is wrong—it shall not be changed
I think we had better leave it as it is, subject to thc control of the peopte of the Territory, under the Constitution of the United States, according to the principles of the original bill
But to say that we are seeking to legislate contrary to the original status of the people there, is a rnistakc
All of that
has alrcady been changed, and we are now compelled to say whether we will leave the people there free—I-free as the Constitution per- mits them to be—or whether we will, by an ar- bitrary act, make it a permanent thing or not

The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, re- sumed the consideration of t.he joint resolution (S

JOHNSON, of 'i'en- nessce, proposing amendments to the Constitu- tion of the United States
Mr
BENJAMIN
Mr
when 1 Cook the floor at our last adjouvnrnent I stated that I expected to address the Senate to-day in reference to the critical issue now before the country
had supposed that by this time there would have been some official communication to the Senate in reference to the fact now known to sali of the condition of affairs in South Carolina
e, for the purposes of the remarks Mr
President, no man can deny that the words I will ass that I ha to make, that those facts have been uttered four years and a half ago form a faithful communicated, and address myself to picture of the state of things that we see around offcia nd, Mr
President, probably never has a them
deliberative assembly been called upon to determ- ine a question calculated to awaken a morc sol- emn sense of resoonsibilitv than those that now address thernselves to our consideration
NV e are brought at last, sir, directly forced, to meet promptly an issue produced by an irresistible course of events whose inevitable results some of us, at least, have foreseen for years
Nor, sir, have we failed in our duty of warning the Repub- licans that they were fast driving us to a point where the very instincts of self-preservation would impose upon us the certain necessity of separa- tion
W c repeated those warninrs with a depth of conviction, with an earnestness of assertion that insnired the hapo that wre should succeed in impartinff at least so file faint assurance of our sincerity to those by whose aid alone could the crisis be averted
But, sir, our assertions werc derided; our were scoffed at; all our honest and patriotic eflhrts to save the Constitu- tion and the Union sneered at and maligned , as dictated, not by love of country, but by base alü- bition for place and power
Mr
President, it has been justly said that this is no tiuue for crimination; it is no such spirit, but xxvith the simple desire to free my- self personally, as a public servant, from all re- sponsibility for the present condition of affairs, that I desire to recall to the Senate some remarks made by rne in debate morc than four years ago, us now
Would to God, sir, that I could believe , L that the apprehensions of civil war, then plainly expressed, were but the vain irnaøinations of a timorous spirit
Alas, sir, the feelings and sen- timents expressed since the commencement of this session, on the opposite side of this floor, almost force the belief that a civil war is their desire; I and that the day is full near when American citi- zens are to meet each other in ,hostile array; and when the hands of brothers 111 be reddened with the blood of brothers
Mr
President, the State of South Carolina, with unanimity scarcely with parallel in history, has dissolved the union which connects her with the other States of the confederacy, and declared her- self iridependent
We, the representatives of those remaining States, stand here to-day, bound either to recognize that independence, or to over- throw it; eith-er to permit peaceful secession from the confederacy, or to put her down by force in which I predicted the precise state of public I feeling now, and pointed out the two principal I causes that were ccrtair) to produce that state
r I'he first was the incessant attack of tbc Repub- licmos, not simply on tho interests, but 011 the feelings and sensibilities of a high-spirit.ed people by the rnost insulting language, and the most of- fensive epit bets; the other was (heir fat.al success in persuading their that these constant acro rcssions could he continued and kept with that the South was weak and too no danger; conscious of weakrwss to dare resistance

That is the issue.
That is the sole issue
No artifice can conceal il
No attempts by Incn to disguise it from their own consciences, and from an excited or alarmed public, can suffice to conceal •it
Those attempts are equally futile and disinoenuous
As for the attempted distinc- tion between coercing a State, and forcing all the people of the State, by arms, to yield obedience to an authority repudiated by the sovereign will of the State, expressed in its most authentic form, it is as unsound in principle as it is impossible of' practical application
Upon that point, howeverj I shall have something to say a little further on
If we elevate ourselves, Mr
Prcsidcnt, to the height from which we are bound to look in order to embrace all the vast consequence that rnust result from our decision, we are not permitted to ignore the fact that our determination does not involve- the State of South Carolina alone
Next week, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, will havc declared themselves independent; the week after, Geoi•gia; and a little later, Louisiana; soon, very soon, to be followed by Cl'e„xas and Arkan- I confine myself purposely to these eight sas
States, because I wish to speak only of those whose action we know with positive certainty, and wh ich man can for a pretend to f designedly exclude others, about whose action I feel equally confident, although others may raiso a cavil
INow, sir, shall we recognize the fact that South Carolina has become an independent State, or shall we wacye war against her
And first as to I do not aeree with those who think it idle to discuss that right
In a great crisis like this, when the right asserted by a sovereign State IS quostioned, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind at least requires that those who main- tain that right, and mean to act upon it, should state the reasons upon which they maintain it
If, in the discussion of this question, I shall refer to familiar principles, it is not that I deem it at all necessary to call the nttention of members here but because they naturally full within to thern ; the scope of rny rnent, which rnight other- wise prove unintelligible
From the tirne t bat this people declared its in- dependence of Great Britain, the right of tbe peo- ple to selflgovernment in its fullest and broadest extent has been a cardinal principle of American liberty
None deny it
And in that right, to use the language of tbe Declaration itself, is in- clude.d the right whenever a form of government bccomcs destructive of their interests or their safi•ty, " to alter or to abolisl-i it, and to institute a new o•overnment, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its po wers in such form as to them shall seern most likely to effect (heir I admit that thero is a safety and happiness
principle that modifies this power, to v,.7hicl) I shall presently advert; but leaving thal principle for a Inoment out of view, I say that there is no other modification which , consistently with our libert-v, we can adrnit, and that the right of the people of ill convention duly assembled, 10 i one generation, alter tho institutions bequeathed by their fathers is inherent, inalienable, not susceptible of restric- tion; that by the stune power under which one Legislature can repeal the act of a former Legisla- convulsive and closer era brace, because the biack avenger, with uplifted dagger, would be at the door, and hc tells us so can one convention Of the people duly as- sembled, repeal the acts of a former convention that ig a bond of Union which we date not violate."  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
213 of the people duly assembled ; and that it is in strict and logical deduction from this fundamental prin- ciple of American liberty, that South Carolina has adopted the form in •which she has declared her independence
She has in convention duly as- sembled in 1860, repealed an ordinance passed by her people in convention duly assembled in 1788
If no interests of third parties werc concerned, no question of compact intervened, all must ad- mit the inherent power—the same inherent povvet• which authorizes a Legislature to repeal a law , su b- ject to the same modifying principle, that where the rights of others than the people who passed the law are concerned, those rights must bc re- spected and cannot be infringed by those who dc- scend from the first Legislaturo or who succeed them.- If a be passed by a Legislature im- pairincr acontract, that law is void, not because the Legislature under ordinary circumstances x,vould not have the power to repeal a law of its prede- cessor but because by repealing a law of its pre- decessor involving a contract, it exercises rights in which third persons are interested, and over which thcv are entitled to have an equal control
So in the case of a convention of the people as- sumilv to act in repeal of an ordinancc which showed their adherence to the Constitution of the United States, the power is inherently in them, su12iect only to this modification: that they are bound to exercise it with due regard to the obli- gations imposed upon them by the compact with others
Authorities, on pomts like this, are perfectly idte; but I fear that i may not have expressed the ideas which I entertain so well as I tbem ex- pressed by Mr
Webster In his celebrated argu- ment in the Rhode Island casc
Hc gays: First and chief, no man makes a question that the people are the source of all political power
Government is instituted for their good, aud its Inelilbers are their agents and servants
He wi10 would argue auainstthis, illust arauc without an adversary
And svho thinks there is any peen- liar Inerit in asserting a doctrine like this, in the n)idst of twenty million people, when nineteen *Iliili0i) nine hun- dred aud uillcty-nille thousand nine hundred nnd nincty- nine of thorn hold it., as well as himself
'I'here is no other doctrine of government here ; •and no Knan ilnputes to an- other, and no man should claitu for himself, any particular merit for asserting ••.vhat everybody knows to be true, and nobody of Daniel Webster, vol

Bat he says in this particular case an attempt is madc to establish the validity of the action of the people, organized in convention, without their having been called into convention by the exer- cise of any constituted authority of the State; and against the exercise of such a right of the people as that he protests
He says: Is it not obvious enough that men cannot get togethcr and count themselves, and say they are so Inany hat-tdreds and so many thousands, and judge ot' their own qualifica- tions
and call themselves the people, and sct up a govern- ment
Why, another set of meu forty miles off, on the same day, with the same propriety, with as good qualifica- tions, and in as large numbers, may rnect and set up another govennnent; one rnay meet at Newport and another at Chepachet, and both may call themselves the people.' rhid., p
226
Tbcrefore, he says, it is not a mere ass6mblage of the people, gathered together sua spontc, that forms that meeting of the people authorized to act in behalf of the people; but he says that— Another A Inerican principle grosving out of this, and just as impot•tant and well settled as is the truth that the peoptc are the source of power, is, that, when iFI the course of events it becornes necessary to ascertain the will of the people on a new exiaency, ot a new state of things or of opinion, the lenislative power provides for that ascertain- rnent by an ordinary aet of in the -case of South Caro• We have then, sir, lina, so far as the duly organized convention is concerned, the only body that could speak the will of this generation in repeal of the ordinance passed by their fathers in 1788; and I say again, if no third interests intervened by a compact binding upon their faith, their power to do so is inherent and complete
But, sir, there is a compact, and , no man pretends that the generation of to-day is not bound by the compacts of the fathers; but, to use the language of Mr
Webster, a bargain broken on one side is a bargain -broken on all; and the compact is binding upon the generation of to-day only if thc other parties to the compact have kept their faith
This IS no new theory, nor is practice upon it I say that it was precisely without precedent
upon this principle that this Constitution was formed
I say that the old Articles of Confed- eracy provided in exprcss terms that they should be perpetual; that they should never be amended or altered without the consent of all the States
I say that the delegates of States unwilling that that Confederation should be altered or amended, appealed to that provision in the convention which If you do formed tho Constitution, and said: not satisfy ns by t.he new provisions, we will prevent your forming your new government, be- cause your faith is plighted, because you have agreed that there shall bc no change in it uniess 'l'his was the argument with the consent of alf." of Luther Martin, it was the arffumcnt of - Pater- son, of New Jersey, and of large numbers of other distinguished members of the convention
Mr
Madison answercd it
Mr
Madison said, in reply to that: It has been alleged that tho Confederation having been formed by unanimous consent, could be dissolved by unan- itnous consent only
Does this doctrine result from the nature of co:npacts
Does it arise froun any particuiar stipulation in the
Articles of' Confederation

I need scarcely ask, I'vlr
President, if anybody has found in the Constitution of the United States I a article providing, by express stipulation, that force shall be used to compel an offending mem- ber of the Union to dischal•ge its (laty
Acting on that principle, nine States of the Confederation seceded from the Confi2dcration, and formed a new Government
They formed it upon the ex- press o•round that some of the States had vio!atcd proper; if not, they were to remain ay foreW nations
- Here'is the histöry Of the formation-df this Constitution, so as it of the States to secede from a Confederation, and to form new confederacies: to suit themselves
Now, Mr
President, there is difficulty in •thie matter, which was not ovérlooked by the of the Constitution
One State may thc compact has been, broken, and others may deny it: who is to judge
When pecuniary terests are involved, so that a caseM>ai) be b}öughp up before courts of justice, the Cons_titatiön has provided a ro(medy• within itself
It has dcélared that no act of a State, either in convention Legislature, or in any other manner, shan viOlate the Constitution of" the United States, and it:has provided for a supreme judiciary to determine cases arising in law or equity which- may involve thc construction of the Constitution or the eon
struction of such laws
But, sir, supposc infringements on the Consti- tution in political matters, which from their-very nature cannot be brought before the/ court 
,Thai was a difficulty not unforeseen; 
it was debated upon propositions that were made tormeet-it
-At• tempts were made to give power to Government in all its departments, one åftér•æthé othcr, to meet that precise case, and the convene tion sternly refused to admit any
It was, pro- posed to enable the Federal Government, through the action of Congress, to use force
That was refused
It was proposed to give to the President of the United States the nomination of State Gov- ernors, and to give them a veto on State laws, so
as to preserve the supremacy of the Federal Gov- ernment
'Ithat was refused
It was proposed to make the Seno te the judge of diffculties that miéht arise between States and the General Government
That was refused
It was finally proposed to give Congress a negative on State legislation inteRfer- ing with the powers of the Federal Government
That was refused
At last, at the very last mo- ment, it was proposed to give that power to Con- gress by a vote of two thirds of each brabch; and that, too, was denied Now, sir, I wish to show, with some little detail —as briefly as I possibly can and do justice to the subject—what vvas said by the leading members of the convention on these propositions to subject the States, in their political action, to' any
power of the General Government, whether of Con- gross, of the judiciary, or of the Executive, and by any majorities whatever
The first proposi- tion was made by Mr
Randolph, on the 29th of M_ay, 1787; and it was, that power should be given to Congress— To negative all laws passed by the several States cot* travening, in the opinion of the National Legislature, the articles of' Union, or any treaty subsisting under the au- thority of the Union ; and to call the force of the Union against any member of the Union failing to fulfill its duty undcr the articles thereof." To negative all laws violative of the articles of Ünion , and to employ force to constrain a
Ståte to perform its duty
Mr
Pinckney's proposition on the satne day vvas: And t.o rendcr these prohibitions- effectual, the -Legig- lature of the, U(lite.d States shall have thC power to rcvise the laws of the several States that may be supposed to in- fringe tlie powers exclusively délegated by tl)is Constttu• tion to Congress, and to negativc and annul such as do." The proposition giving a power to negative the I laws of the States, passed at first hurriedly, with- I their compact
Immediately after, two otherStates out consideration; but upon further examination, seceded and joined them
They left two alone, Rhode Island and North Carolina; and herc is 111 y answer to the
Senator from Wisconsin, [Mr
should be ascertained by some regular rule of procceding DOOLITTLE,] who asked me the other day, if prescribed by previous law
But
svhen asecrtail)éd, that thirty-three States could expel one, inasmuch as will is as sovereign as the will ofa despotic prince, of the one had the right to leave thirty-three: I point Czar of Muscovy;or the Emperor of Austria himself, though hiln to the history of our country, to the acts of not quite so easily made known
A ukase or an edict sig- nifies at once the will ofadcspotic prince; but that will of the people, which is here as sovereign as the will of such a prince, is not so quickly ascertained or known ; and hcncc arises thc necessity for suffrage
which is the mode whereby each 'nan s power is made to tell upon thc Constitution of the Government, and in tbc enactinent of laws." He concludes— We see, therefore, from thc commencement of the Gov- ernrnent under which we live, down to this late act

After this Government had been organized; after evcry department had been in full operation for some time; after you had framed your naviffation laws, and provided what should be considered as ships and vessels of the United States, North Carolina and Rhode Island were still foreign na- tions, and so treated by you, so treated by you in your laws; and in September, 1789, Congress I passed an act authorizing the citizens of the States of North Carolina and Island to enjoy all thc benefits attached to owners of ships and ves- sels of the United States up to the 1st of the fol- lowing January—navc them that much morc time If they thoüght , to come into the new Union, 4 full justicc was done to it
Upon the subject of force, Mr
Madison said, moving to postpone the proposition to authorize force: Mr
Madison observed, that the more he reflected on the use ot {Orcc, the more he doubted the practicability, the jnstiec, and the efficacy of it, when applied to people col- lectively, and not individually
A union of the States con- taining such an Ingredient, seemed to provide for its own 'I'be use of force against a State would look destruction
more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punish- ment, and would probably be considered by the party at- tacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might be bound
He hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this resource unnecessary, and :noved that the clause be postponed.—Madison Papers— Debates in the Federal Convention, Vol

Madison considcrcd the negative on the laws or the States as essential to the efficacy and sectn•it.v of the General Government
'The necessity of a General Govern- ment proceeds
fronn the propensity 'if the States to pursue their particular intcrcst*, in opposition to the general inter- est
This propensity svill continue to disturb the system unless effectually controlled
Nothing short of a negative their laws will control it
'l'hey will pass laws which will accomplish their injurious objects before they can be repea}cd by the General Legisiaturc, or set aside by the na- tional tribunals." ' ' A power of negativing the improper taws of States is at oncc the most mild and certain rneans of preserving the harmony of the system
Its utility is sufficiently disp!aycd in the Brit- isli system," This was acrain negatived in July by the same vote
Finally, tho 23d of August, för the last time, an attempt was made to give that necrative with a check upon it; and it was in these words: Mr
Charles Pinckney moved to add, as an additional power to be vested in the Legislature of the IJnited Stat.es : 'l'o negative all lav.'s passed by the several States, in- terferin", in the opinion of the Legislature, with the gen- oral intérests and harnlony of the Union, provided that two thirds of the mctnbers ot• cach House assent to the same." Mr
Madison wanted it committed
Mr
Rut- ledge said: if nothing clse, this alone wöuld daunn, and ought to damn, the Constitution
Will any State ever agree to be bound hand and root ill t.his Inanncr
It is worse than making Inerc corporations of' tlunn, whose by-laws would not be subject to this shackle." And thereupon Mr
Pinckney withdrew his proposition, and all control was abandoned

- The lan- guage of the ninth and tenth amendments to the Constitution is susceptible of no other construc- tion: 'lthe enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construcd to deny or disparage others retained by the people." " 'I'he powers not delegated to the United States." Gentlemen are fond of using the words '6 sur- rendered," abandoned, given up
'That is the constant language on the other side
The lano guage of the amendmentintendcd to fix the mean- ing of the Constitution says that these powers were not abandoned by the State, not surrendered, not given up, but " deleo•ated," and therefore su12jcct to resumption: "'l'he powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Now, Mr

If none is provided, not, then what tribunal 
then natural law,' and the law" of nations tell you that she and she alone, from the very necessity of the case, must be the judge of the infraction and of the modc and measure of redress
This is no novel doctrine; but it is as old as the law of nations, coeval in our system with the foundation of the Constitution; clearly announced over and over agam in our political history
A very valued friend from New York did me the favor to send me an extract, which he has_writ- ten out, from an addrcss delivered by John mcy Adams before thc Ncx.v York Historical ociety in 1839, at the jubilee of the Constitution
His language is this: Nations acknowledge no judge between them upon Inust, in earth, and their Governmcnts, from necessity, their intercoursc with each other, decide vvhcn the {hilure of one party to a contract to pcrförrn it.s obligations absolves the other froin the, reciprocal fulfillment of his 0',vn
But this last of earthly powers is not necessary to the frced01k) or independence of States, connected touct.her by the im- '110 mediate action of the peoplc, of they consist
the people alone is there reserved, as well the dissolving as the constituent power, and that power can be exercised by thein only under the tie of conscience, binding thetn to the retributive justice of heaven
With these gualifications, we tna.v admit the saine right as vested in the people ot• every Slate in the with reference to the General Government
which was ex- ercised by the people of the United Colonies with retorcncc to the supreme head of the British Empire, of which they formed a part; and, under these limitations, have the peo pie of each State in the r_ini01'i a right to secede from tbc "Thus stands the RIGHT
But the indissoluble link of union between the people of thc several States or this con- federated nation is
after all, not in the right, but in the heart
If the day sliould ever come (may néavcn avert it !) when the affections of the peop}c of' these Statcg shall be alienated from each other ;' when the fraternal spirit shall give way to cold indifference, or collisions of interest shall fester into hatred, the bands of political will not long hold t.o«rctber parties 110 lougor attracted by tho magnetistn of conciliated interests and kindly sympat.hies ; and far better will it be for the pcoplc of the disunited States to part in friendship from cucli other, than to he held to- the time 'Or reverting to gether by constraint
Then will be the precedent, which occurred at the for:nation and adop- tion of thc Constitution, to form again a inore perfect Union, by dissolving that which could no longer bind, and to leave the separated parts to bc reunited by the law of political gravitation, to the center." I am compelled to refer also, for the purpose of completing my argument, to the very fatniliar Vir- 'I'hcy cannot, ginia and Kentucky resolutions
however, be too often repeated or held too rever- ently in memory
The first, drawn by Mr
Jef- ferson, is: Resolved, 'I'llat the several States composing the United Stat.es of America are not united on the principle of un- bv compact, under the style and title ot• a ('onstitution foil tlie United States, and of amendinents tbcret.o, they con- stituted a General Government för special purposes, dele- gated to that Government certain definite powers, rcscrvinc each State to itself the residuary mass of right to self-government; and that whensoeverthe General Govern- rnent asslilnes undelegated powers its acts are unauthori- tative, void, and of no force; that to this compact each State acceded as a State, and is an integral party ; that this Governrnent, created by this conlpact, not made tbc exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers dele- gated to itselt; since that would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its power; but no connnon judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the mode a-nd measure of redress." These resolutions of Virginia were submitted to all the States
They were commented upon; they were answered generally wit.h contempt and disdain, because the people of the northern States never seem to have comprehended that the Statcs had any rights at all
They have alsvays gone astray in t hc hcrcsv that this was one consol- idated G-overnment, governino• subiecls to the Fedem_il Government, and not' controlling States, and individuals in the States

in any of its positions
No man can answer it
The proof is such that conviction is forced home upon the mind as by the enunciation of an axiom
It has been A single passage I desire to quote
often quoted, but I must read it again: It appears to your eornmittee to be a plain principle, founded in c.ozmnon sense, ifiustrated by connnon practice, and essential to the nature of compacts, that, where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority of the parties, the parties thelnselves Illust be the rightful judges- in the last res -rt, whether the bargain rnadc has been pur- 'Dhe Constitution of the United States sued or vlolated
wras fbrme.d by the sanction of the States, givcn by each in its sovereign capacity
It adds to the stability dig- well as to the authority, of the Constitution, that it rests on this legitimate and solid ibundation
'l'he States, then, being the parties to the constitutional con:pact, and in tbcir sovereign capacity, it löllows, of necessity, that there can be no tribunal, above their authority, to decide, ill the last resort, whether the coinpact made by theti be and consequently, that, as the parties to it, they violated , lnust
themselvcs decide, in the last resort, such questions as Illay be of sufficient knagnitudc to require their interpo
sition." He goes on to state, not limitations upon' the power, but considerations in regard to the mode of exercising it
He says: Tl'he resolution has, accordingly, guardcd against any misapprehension of its object, by expressly requiring, for subli an interposition, the case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous breach of the Constitution, by t.hc exercise of powers not granted by it.' It be a case not ('f li2ht and transient nature, but of a nature danuerous to the great purposes iOr thc Constitution was established." Mr
Madison, in the debates in the Virginia convention, seemed to take it for granted tbatany State had a right to secede at any time, without any condition or limitation
His later, well-con- sidcred report, qualifies that doctrine, as I have iust shown; but at the time the debates occurred in the Virginia convention about adopting the Constitution, it was taken for granted on all sides that Virginiå could withdraw whenever she pleased; nobody seems to have disputed that
After defending the grant of power in relation to t.hc militia, Madison said: An observation feli from a gentleman on the same side attended to
If we be dissatisfied iVith thc National Governinent., it we should choose to rcnounce it, this is an additional satoguard to our defense.' '—Elliot's Debates, vo'

Apparently taking it for grantcd that any State could renounce it when it pleased, and that the militia would already be oroanized as a safeguard I do not statc this as any partic- for its dcfcnsc
ularly pertinent authority, but to show the inn- pressions that generally prevailed at tho time Of the adoption of' the Constitution; but when the .q•nestion was subsequently discussed ill 1798 at')d ; 1799, upon the alicn and sedition laws, not only did I'vlr
Madison make this report, but I have a reference hore to a letter of Mr
Jefferson, which I have not on the table, and which will annex to in y speech when printed, showing that hc dc- I ibcf•ately cxtunined this whole question, und came to the same conclusion
But, Mr
President, the President of the United States tclks us that he does not a(hnit this right to be constitutional; that it is revolutionary
lhave„ endeavored thus f'ar to show that it results from the nature of' the compact itself; that it must nc- ccssariiy be one of those reserved powers which not abandoned Ijy it, and.thcrcfore grows out of the Constitution, and is not in violation of it
If I am asked how I will distinguish t.his from revolutionary abuse, the answer is prompt and easy
These States, parties to the compact, have a right to withdraw from it, by virtue of' its own President and Vice President, the Congress Ofthé United States then; in the exercise of its powers, and the President to back them, éould spend the entire revenue of the Confederation-in that section which had control, without violating the words or the letter of the Constitution; they could establish forts, light-houses, arsenals, mage azines, and all public buildings of everycharacter in the northern States alone, and utterly refuse any to the South
The President, with the aid Of his sectional appoint all omcevs• of the Navy and of the Army,- ail the civil omcers of tbc Government, all thc judges, attorneys,-and mafshals, all collectors and revenue oficers, all postmasters—the whole host of-public offcers he might, under the forms and powers vested by the Constitution, appoint exclusively from the north- ern States, and quarter thcm in the southern St.ates, to eat out the substance of our people, and as- sume an insulting superiority over them
All that might be done in the exercise of admitted constitutional
power; and it is just that train of evils, of outrages, of wrongs, of oppressions long continued, that the Dcclaration of Independence says a people preserves the inherént right of throwing off by destroying their government by I say, thereforc, that I distinguish revolution
the rights of thc States under the Constitution into two classes: one resulting from the nature of their bargain; if the bargain is broken by the sis- ter States, to consider themselves freed from it on thc ground of breach of compact; if the bargain be not broken, but thé powers beververtcd to their wrong and their oppression, then, wheneyer that wroncr and oppression shall become suff- I ciently aggravated, the revolutionary right—the last inherent right of man to preserve freedom, property, and safety—arises, and must be exer- •cised, for none other will meet the case
But, Mr
PreSident, suppose South Carolina to be altogether wrong in her opinion that this com- pact has been violated to her prejudice; and that she has, therefore, a right to withdraw', take that for granted: what then
You still have the same issue to meet face to face
You must per- mit her to withdraw peace, or you must de- clare war
'That is, you must coerce the State itself, or you must permit her to depart in peace
Therc is nothing whatever that can render for an instant tenable the attempted distinction between coercing a State itself, and coercing all- the indi- viduals in the manner now proposed
Let me read a fcw lines upon that subject
First, Vattel, in speaking of States, and Gf their rights, and tho rights of their citizens, uses this language; Every nation that governs itself, under what form so• ever, without dependence on any foreign Power, is a sov- Its rights are naturally the same as those of ercign State
any other State
Such are the n:oral persons who live to, gether in a natural society, subject to the law of nations
To give a nation a right to makc an immediate figure in this grand society, it is sufficient that it be rcallv sovereign and independent; that is, that it govern itself 'by its own authority and laws." Then, he speaks of those qualifications that may exist in relation to this sovereignty; and hé Several sovcrcign and independcnt Statcs may unite thennselves togcthcr by a perpetual confederacy, without ceasing to he, cach individually, a perfect State
'I'hcy will togcthet constitute a ii'deral republic: their joint delib- erations will not hnpa.ir t.hc sovereignty of each member, the excrcisc of it, in virtue of voluntary engagements
A 
person does not cease to be frcc
and independent when he is obliged to fulfill engagennent.s which he has voluntarily cOntracted."— La.u_' of Nations, book l, chap
I
Here, then, we sec that, under the law of na- tions, the State of South Carolina is a sovcreinn , Slate, independently of all considerations drawn from the language of the Constitution itself, and as such is entitled to be treated, and as such has a right to protect and shield her citizens from all provisions, whc•n those
provisions are violated by I the consequences of obedience to her acts
The the other parties to Il'le cotnpact, when either powers not granted are usurped, or rights arc re- put to my friend from Virginia [Mr
M AsoN] the fused that are especial! y grauted to the States

the State of powers might be so perverted and abused South Carolina, but a mere rebellion of the body as to give cause of ccnnplaint, and finally, to give of its citizens

ductin relation to this negotiation ;and he delivered a very elaborate speech in defense of the treaty of Washington, This brings me to the point which I sugffested to the honorable Scnator from Wisconsin, when hc told us the othcrtlay that each citizen owed allegiance to two sovereignties, and that he was bound at his peril to distinguish between their orders; that he could commit trea- son, under the Constitution, against the United States, and that the Constitution also recognizes that he could commit treason against the State; and yet the honorable Senator went so far as to say, that if his State ordered him to do a thing, and the United States forbade him from doing it, both under t hc penalty of death, it svas his mis- fortune to be placed ill) such a position that he might be hanged or executed by cither, and under the faw of nations have no redress, no escape
I answer him in the language of MI'
Webster on that very subject: In the next place, and on the other hand, General Har- rison was ()t• the opinion that
t110 arrest alid detention of Mc_Leod svere contrary to the lav.' of nations
McLeod was a soldier, acting under the authority of his Govern- and obeying orders which he was bound to obey
It was absurd to say that a soldier, who liltist
obey orders or bc shot, rnay still bc hanged if he does obey thenl
_ Works of Danict Webster, vol
5, page 123
I do not use the term " absurd;" Webster wlfo uses it
But perhaps gentlemen _ I •will say: Mr
Webster says that he was acting under the authority of his Government, and obey- ing orders which he was bound to obey; but we I dehy that a citizen of South Carolina is bound to obey the orders of his Government
To that I reply, in tho language of Vattel, that no citizen of any State has the right to question that; that it is a principle of the law of nations % that the citi- zen owes obedience to the command of his so VCP- and he cannot enter tho question whether the sovereityn 's order is lawful or unlaw- fu}, at his peril
If his sovcreiffll encyacrcs in war—if his State declares her indep-endencc.— hc is Ijound by the action of his State, an(l has no authority to control it
Why, Mr
I) rt•nsident., how idle and absurd wotAld be any other proposition ! How idle and absurd to suppose th,at you can, in principle and in [)ract.ice, separate each particular individ 1.1al of' a State and ITIake him for the collective act of his Governrnent—each agent in turn
The honorable Senator froin Ohio, [Mr
PWGII,] who delivered to us the other day so rnacy- nificent and patriotic an appeal, read you the lan- gua«e of the different Presidents of the
United States upon that sul)ject, and cited to you the lan- guage of Mr
Adams, in which he said that he had boon forced to avoid rnaking QSC of the power of the Federal Government, in the State of Geor- gua, against certain surveyors acting in defiance of thé Federal authority, because he understood that they w•ere ordered so to act by their State gov- and believed themselves bound to obey ernment., the order
Sir, if there was at) ything in this idea in theory, you In ight reduce it to practice; but what can be 111 orc absurd, tnot•e vao•ue, rnoro fanciful, than the sucro•cstions put out by gentlerncn here
You are (roil)'M now, ol.).serve, to declare no war and to coerce no State; vou are sinnply going to execute the laws of the IJnited States againso individuals t.he State of South Carolina
That is your proposition
Is it scrious
One gentlenuu'l says A h, where is the Inar- he will hang for treason
shal to scize, and •.vhere is the court to try, where is the district attorney to prosecute, arid where is jury to convict
A rc you going to establish Wii] execute the laws to collect revenue by block- ading your ports, and stopping them up
At first blush this seems a very amusinø noode of collecting revenue in South Carolina, by allowincr no vessels to come in on which rcvcnue can be collected
It is the strangest of all possible fan- cies that that is the way of collecting revenuc there, of enforcing the laws in the State against individuals
But first you are to have no war
And what is blockade
Does any man suppose that blockade can exist by a nation at peace with another; that it is a peace power; that it can be exercised on any other ground than that you are at war M,' ith the.party whose ports you blockade, and that you make proclamatiön to all the G-ov- et•nments of the earth that their vessels shall not be authorized to entor into these ports, because you arc reducing your enmny by the use of reg- ular constituted, recognized, warlike means
Oh, but perhaps it is not a blockade that you will have; you will have an embargo, that is what you mean
We are guarded here again
'l'he Con- stitution heads you off at every step in this Quix- otic attempt to 00 into a State to exercise your laws affainst her wholc citizens without declaring war or coercing the State
You cannot embargo the 420t•ts of one State without embargoing all your- rts; you cannot shut up one without shut- ting u all; the Constitution of the United States expressly forbids it
If your blockade or your embargo were a peaceful measure, you are pro- hibited by the very words of the Constitution it- self from forcing a vessel bound to or from one State to enter or clear or pay duties in another, or from making any regulations of commerce whatever, givinrr any preference to tho ports of one State over the ports of another; and you have no more right to blockade or close the ports of South Carolina by embargo, even by act of Con- gress, than you have to declare that a soverei(-rn State shall have no right to have rnorc than one Senator on this floor
Your blockade is impracti- cable, unconstitutional, out of the power of the President
MI hat is this idea of executing the laws by armed force acainst individuals
Gentlemen seem to suppose—and they argue upon the supposi- tion—t.hat it is possible, under the Constitution of the United States, for the President to determ- ine when laws are not obcyed and to force obedi- ence by the sword, without the interposition of courts of justice
Does any man have such an idle conceit as that
Docs he suppose that, by any possible construction, the power of the Fed- eral Congress to call out the militia, and to use the Army and the Navy to suppress insurrection and to execute the laws, rneans that the President is to do it of his own volition and without the inter- vention of the civil power
The honorable Sena- tor from Tennessee, [Mr
JOHNSON,] the other day, called upon us to look at the example of' Washing- ton, who put down rebellion in Pennsylvania
He said well that he was lawycr, when he cited that General Washington called forth the militia I of Pennsylvania and of other States to aid in ex- ocuting the laws, upon a requisition by a judge of the Suprejne Court of the United States certi- to hilu that the marshal was unable to carry out the judgments of the court
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
I understood that very well
Mr
BENJAMIN
Then what on earth do you mean by saying that you will go into a State and execute the laws of the United States against individuals, without a judge or jury there, with- all these by arms
Perhaps you mc you will i! out a marshal or attorney, with nobody to declare the violation of law, or to order its execution bc- him elsewhere for trial
Not so; our fathers have not left our liberties so unguarded fore you attempt to enforce it
T hc Senator may Instructions to Illis were accordingly sent to the Attorney General
But Mr
was subsequently attacked in the Senate for his con- I and so unprotected as Chat
The Constitu ti01) originally provided that
no nuln could be brought to trial for an on•ense out of the State where ho conunitled it
The fitthers were not satisfied with it, and thcy added an amend nocnt that hc should not be brought to trial out of the district even in which he had committed it
You cannot take hilli out of the district
You havc got no judge, no marshal, no attorney, no jurors, there; and sup- pase you had: who to ü(ljndRQ, who is to con- His fellow-citizens, unanimous in opinion
M.'ith him, dot,crmine that he has done his duty, and has committed no guilt
That is the I.vay you are to exec.ute the laws against treason ! next
Oh, no, says the Senator from Ohio, [Mr
WADE,] that is what we Will do; we not
have intended to assurne such a position
Ho has been unfortunate in the irnpressions that he has produced upon the country
But, sir, other Ine.ans are suggested
can- not to war; we are not goino• to war; we are , not ooino• to coerce a State
" Z)'Vhy," says the Senator froin Illinois, " who talks of coercino• a E I State; you are atten')Dtiug to breed confusion in the public mind; you are atteznpting to impose l! upon people by perverting the question; we onlv mean to execute the laws ao•ainst individuals
Ao•ain, I say, where will be the civil process t which must precede the action of thc military force
Surely, surely it is not at this day that we are to argue that neither the President, nor the President and Congress combined, are armed  1860

You can do nothino of the kind with your military force
But it is and the President is weak enough to yield to the suggestioh, that you will (Collect your revenue by force—by the action of the power of the Federal Government on individ- uals
Has anybody followed this out practically
Is it possible
I remember that Mr
Webster once, as a mere figure of rhetoric, in his debate on the Foot resolutions, used some such threat as this aoainst this same State of South Carolina; but it wus looked upon as a n-nere beautiful figurc of speech
No man ever paid any attention to it as really a threat of the use of constitutional power
You will put your collector on board of a vessel in the harbor
It shall be a man-of-war; it is in the port; and thero you will make ever v- body pay dutiesbcfore thegoods are landed
is the next proposition, that nobody sces any practical difficulty about
But, sir, it is totally Impracticable—totally impossible
Take a casé
A citizen of New York owns a vessel which loads with a cargo of assorted merchandise, part frec, part owing duty, and consigns it to Charles- ton
He enters the harbor
Under the law he is obliged to make entry of his vessel, to produce his manifest, to go through certain other formal- ities
He goes on board your ship-of-war, sees the collector,and complies with the Orders
What next
There are no duties paid yet, and the man who has a right to the free goods has no duties to pay
You cannot prevent him from to the m,vharf and discharging then-I
There is no law to be executed there against an individual
But I will take it for granted that the whole caroo is a duty-paying cargo, and all belongs to one man, who does not mean to pay your duties
You are no better off
The man declines to enter his cargo
What is the law
The master of the vessel wants to go away
He is entitled by law to report to the collector that he is ready to de- liver his cargo, that nobody is there to enter it, and that he demands that his cargo be discharged, and put in public store; and under that he may go upon his new voyage; and you cannot change that, unless you change the law for all the ports of the United States, Or he may go further: t importer may go to the collector, and say, want to enter my cargo in warehouse;" and he gives a bond signed by himself and a solvent fel- low-citizen, that they will pay the duty when he takes the goods out of the warehouse
Then you must let him put those goods into the custorn- house warehouse; and you cannot changc that law either, without changing it for the whole United States; because you cannot, under the Constitu- tion, by any regulation of commerce, give any preference to the ports of one State over those of another
Mind you, you are at peace; you are not co- ercing a State; you are merely executing the laws against individuals! You cannot do it without breaking up your whole warehouse system; you cannot do it' without breaking up your whole cornmercial syslém ill every port of the Confed- eracy
Your goods are ashore; they arc in Gov- ernmont warehouses; but you have not crot the duties
A rush upon the warehouse, and the goods are taken out
You have got a bond, but you have no court to sue it in; and if you had, you would have no iury to forfeit it, because the jury would be told by the court, or at all events by the lawyers who defended the defendant, that the Government had no right to collect that bond; that it was a usurpation which required him to give the bond
This whole scheme, this whole fancy, that you can treat th act of a sovereign State, issued in an authoritative form, and in her collective ca- pacity as a State, as being utterly out of exist- ence; that you can treat the State as still belong- ing collectively {o the Confederacy, and that you can proceed, without a solitary Federal offcer in the State, to enforce your laws against private individuals, is as vain, as idle, and delusive, as any dreatn that ever entered into the head of man
it i4 only asserted The thing be done
for the purpose of covering up the true question, than which there is no other: you must acknov,'l- edge the independence of the seceding St.ate, or reduce her to subjection by war
Now, Mr
President, i desire not to enter in anv detail int() the dreary catalogue of •wron$s ana outrages by which South Carolina defénds her position; that she has withdrawn from this Union because slie has a constitutional rifflit to do so, by reason of prior violations ot the com- pact by ber sister States
Before, however, mak- Ing any statement—that statement to which we have been challenged, and which I shall make in but very few words—of thc wrongs under which the South is now suffering, and for which shc seeks redress, as the difficulty seems to arise chiefly from a difference in our construction of the Con- struction, I desire to read one more, and a last, citation froin Vattel, giving a rule in relation to the construction of treaties between sovereigns, and compacts between States
Among other thil')gs, he says: 'The rules that
establish a lawful interpretation of trea- ties are stifliciently ilnportant to be made the, suba:cct of' a distinct chapter
For the present, let us silnply observe that an evidcnt)y false interpretation is the grossest ima- ginal)le violation of lhc faith of treaties
He that resorts to such an e.xpcdient, either ijnprudently sports with that sacred Caitb, or sufliciently evinces his inward conviction of the degree of moral turpitnde annexed to the violation of it ; he wishes to act
a dishonest part, and yet preserve the character of an honest man ; hc is a puritanical impostor who agn•avatcs his crilnc by the addition of a detestable hypocrisy
Grotius quotes several instances of evidcutly false intcrpretations put upon treaties
The Plateaus having promised the 'I'hebans to restore their prisoners, restored them after they bad put them to death
Pericles, having promised to sparc the lives of such of the cnen1Y as laid down their anns, ordered all those to be killed that had iron clasps to their cloaks
A Roman gcncral havin«r agreed with Antiochus to restore him half his fleet, caused cach of the ships to bc sawed in two
All these interpretations arc as fraudulent as that ()t• Rhadalnistus, who, according to Taci- tus's account, having sworn to Mithridatcs that he would not employ either poison or steel against him, caused him to be sniQthered under a heap of Law of Nations, book 2, chap
15, p
234
There is the text; now' the commentary
You, Senators of the Republican party, assert, and your people whom you represent assert, that under a iust and fair interpretation of the Federal Consti- tulion, it is right that you deny that our slaves, which directly and indirectly involve a value of more than four thousand million dollars, are prop- erty at all, or entitled to protection in Territories owned by the common Government
You assume the interpretation that it is right to encourage, by all possible Incans, directly and ilidiroctly, the robbery of this property, and to legislate so as to render its recovery as difficult and dangerous as possibie; that it is right and proper and justifi- able, under the Constituti0)), to prevent our mere transit across a sister State, LO embark with our property on a lawful voyao-e, without being openly despoiled of it
You assert, and practice upon the assertion, that it is right to hold us up to the —kind in speech, writing, and print, ban of man with c very possiblc app]iancc of publicity—as thieves, robbers, murderers, villains, and crimi- nals of the blackest dye, because '..ve continue to own property which we owned at the time that we all signed the compact; that it is right that we should be exposed to spend oar treasure in the purchase, or shed our blood in the conquest, of foreign territory, with no right to enter it- for set- tlement without leaving behind our most valuable property, under penalty of its confiscation
You practically interpret this instrument to me that it is cminently in accordance with the assurance that our tranquillity and welfare were to he pre- served a_nd promoted ; that our sister Statcs should combine to prevent our growth and development; that they should surround us with a cordon of hostile communities, for the express and avowed purpose of accumulating in dense masses, and within restricted limits, a population which you believe to be dangerous, and thereby force the sacrifice of property nearly suflicient in value to pay the public debt of every nation in Europe
T h!' is the construction of the instrument that was to preserve our security, promote our I,velfare, and which we only signed on your assurance that that was its object
You tell us that this is a fair construction—not all, some say one thing, some but you act, or your people do, upon another; this principle
You do not propose to enter into our Slates, you say, and what do we complain of
You do not pretend to enter into our States to kill or destroy our institutions by force, Oh, no You imitaie the faith of Rhadamisfus: you propose simply to close us in an embrace that will suffocate us
You do riot propose to; fell•ihte tree; you promised not
Y chi merely proposé-ntb girdle it, ,that itdies
And them When we; telfyou that we did not this bargain this Way, that your acting -upon it in this* Sbirit- 'i•éleases us from the obligations that ublddr no circumstances can we, consent to' live• together uhder that interpretation, and say: we from you; Ict us go in peace;" we are ansivei€tl by your leading spokesmen: you can- not do that; we have no objection 'to it pérson- ally, but we are bound by our oaths; if you ail
tempt it, your people will be hanged for treason
We have examined this Constitutio'h thoroughly; we have searched it out.with a fai-npitit, and, We can find warrant in, it for releasing ourselves from the obligation of giving you any of its benéflts, but our-oaths force us to tax you; we can dispense with everything else; but our consciences, we-pr0- test upon our souls, will be sorély worried if' we do not take your money
[Lauglitep.], That is the proposition of the honorable Senator from Ohio, in plain language
He can avoid everything else under the Constitution; in the way Of seces- sion; but how is he to get rid of the duty of taking our money he cannot see
[Laughter•] Now, Senators, this picture is not placed before you with any idea that it will act upon any one of you, or change your views, or alter your con- duct
All hope Qf that is gone
Our conunittee has reported this morning that no possible sdheme of adjustment can be devised by them all com- bined
The day for the adjustment has passed, If you would give it now, you are too late
And now, Senators, •within a fcw weeks we part to meet as Senators in one common council chamber of the nation no more forever
We dé-x sire, we beseech you, let this parting be in peace
I conjnre ypu to indulge in no vain delusion that du ty orconscicnce , interest or honor, im poses upon you the necessity of invading our States or shed- ding the blood of our people
Yon have no pos- Sible justification for it
trust it is in no craveri spirit, and with no sacrifice of the honor or dig- mty of my own State, that I make this last appeal, If, how- but from far higher and holiet motives
ever, it shall prove vain, if you arc resolved to pervert the Government, framed by the fathers for the protection of our rights intcan instrument for subjugating and enslavincr us, then, appealing to the Supreme Judge of thc u nivm•se for the recti- tude of our intentions, we must meet the issue that you force upon us as best becomes freemen defending all that is dear to man
What may be the fate of this horrible contest, no man can tell, none pretend to foresee; but this much i will say: the fortunes of war may be ad- verse to our arms; you may carry desolation into our pcaccfut land, and with torch and fire you may set our cities in flames; you may even emu- lat.e the atrocities of those who, in the war of the Revolution, hounded on the blood-thirsty savage to attack upon the defenseless frontier; you may, under the protection of your advancing armies, give shelter to the furious
fanatics who desire, and profess to desire, nothing more than to add all the horrors of a servile insurrection to the ca- lamities of civil war; you may do all this—and morc, too, if more there be—but you never can subjugate us; you never can convert the free sons of the soil into vassals, paying tribute to your power; and you never, never can degrade them to the level of an inferior and servile race

Mr
Speaker, inquire whether that com tnunication is in reply to any resolution of this House
The SPEAKER
It is a connuunicatidn fl'01n the Secretary of War addressed to Enc as the Speaker of this House; and as such the Chair has presented it to the Ilouse
Mr
CURTIS
to the House, and read at the request of the Speaker
then I will not
object; otherwise I do object; for it does secm to nic that a communication from the head of one of the Exccutive Departments ought to come to us through the President of the United States
Mr
WINSLOW
Let the paper, and t.hon we judgrc what action to take on it
Mr
CURVT{S
I object, unless the paper is read at the
request of the Speaker of this I-louse
The SPEAKER
As it is a paper addressed cessary to start large trains of transportation across the plains to Utah, when there was no available means to put those trains ill rnotion
Acceptances were "i ven to the contractors then to enable thetn to start; and they did so
'I'he practice, thus begun, was continued for a good while froin necessi1Y, and was afterwards followed to afford ac- commodation to the contractors in their very large and ex- tensive work
Their purport is to give preference to the holder, when filed in the Department, out of any moneys due the contractors
'I'hese acceptances have, until the past autumn, been regularly paid to large amounts ; nor has any complaint whatever, until then, been heard that means wrere not provided to meet and redecm them
There has never been the least concealment or mystery about this business
it was perfectly known to all who had any inter- est in knowing anything about it
"I'hcy have been given only when thcrc was a subsistinrr contract
out
of' which the
means to meet them would cer- tainly arise, and fi)r the e.xecution of whie.ll there was an existing appropriation
They arc prohibäted by no law
The issue or these acceptances within this luonth rested upon the ibilowing considerations : those given for thc last season's work, and which were held as collateral security
in ditün•ent places, contractors were all.xiotts to post- l)one until the next season
'I'hoy represented that this could be done ',vith acceptances which on their fhce repre- sented that they w•ould be paid when the money thcy called tor was earned by the contractors for the next season's work
'I'hc stroll {rest assurances were "iven that this paper was only to go
alid certainly to go, by agreement already :nade, int.o the hands alonc 01' those banks atl(l who then hcld unpai(l accepta and for which they were to be substituted and held as collateral security to ihcir own 'I'he pay accruina under their contract next season will be more than enough to cover thc amount of the accept- ances predicated Oli it
insure this stipulation, I consented to issue the
paper on! y in large amounts, and in a forni which would be ac- ceptablc, it' at all, to those who know pcriZ•ctly the solvency of the contractors, and '.vho had already Inoney engage- Inents writh them to a large amount, and who had, as I was infonned, and as I belicved, already conscnted to and de- sired the arrantvement
It' these protn ises and {hithful etjøaut'luents had been performed, no difficulty could ever have resulted t'ro:u the transaction
It
could not
and would not have l)) isled or deceived any one : no expectation based it could by any possibility have becn disappointed
But
the protniscs Inade Ine werc not kept; they were broken
'I'l)is paper was, it seeins, placed in the hands of a clerk of' the Departinent the Interior, who had abstracted a large amount of the securities belonging to the Indian trust fund
Finding this to the case, i
liavc not hesitated to give an order to canec.l and annul those acceptances
per- version rendered void and of no effect
r an) tyratj(icd to assert thc confident belief Illat no one connected in any way, directly or rernotely, in any *hapo or tin•tn, ith the duties of the VVar Departnnet)t., had any the least, connection Ivitll or knowledge of this ernbezzle- rnent in it.s inception or its prog-rress
'l'he issue of this paper resolves its•clt' into a question of adrninistrative, consideration alone, [ think; alid so regard- ing it., I "'ill be pardoned ad vereiii" very briefly to this asbect 01' the subieet
'i'hes•e contractors have, by a long serics of' years of faith- , honest, and Inost cflieieRt
service, won the confidence and good feeling of an persoE'k* havinø au y connection wit.h tiiC transportation ()f' the in t.he country lying beyond our Ivest.eril settlelnent,:;
'l'hey had never failed in any of their encr;vretnellt.s-, and had executed Iliany of then) under circutnstances or peen) iar 'I'heywerc men 01' vcry larce wealth and Inost extensive rneans, and pos- sesscd fully rhe conlidenee of all who knew then)
It has latterly prettv evidellt that but profits, if any, '.vere likely to be realized frmn their operations, and this was put into great danger ft•cnn recent reverses in money 'I'he revulsions which have recently swept over the country have arisen f'rcnn no causes which l)ltsiness Inen could be tåirly called upon to take the risk J
; they have licen froin political causes, and not any vioiated law of eonnne rcial or Inonetary action
Under t.his evident thct, I was 110t unwilling to afford these cinp}oyés of thc Goveunnent any assistance li kcly to save thenl fronl serious injurv •rrowino out of political disturbances, if that could bc (lone H'ithout
running any risk of' loss to the Govern- I think such a course can derogatc nothing t'rotn a Illcnt
discretion, although the sequel has so [1 is tra live shonrn illat such a coo fidence has been lilisp'acod
But l.here is anot.hcr and I) igher public consideration con- ncctcd with the subject
of contracts turtrallsportation, and one ivllich cannot be overlooked with any just apprecia- Lion of good ad:n inistration
Good and thoroughly re sponsi ble contractors for transportation across our irnjnense plains are e.\'trcuncly important persons to our little Army, and (lißieult to obtain
is no other service like it known in the world, Nowhere else on the globe would the idea be
entertained of subsisting an army by transport- intr its supplies over land a distance of a thousand or twelve hundred jni\es through an uninhabif.ed wilderness ; and yet a very Iat(re part of our Aunyr is furnished and subsisted hy this means
thc present contractors, who llave so long and so faith- futly perturlncd their work, should fail or becmne so ern- of and would require months of industry and activity to prepare
It Inust be very clear to any one that a wise forecast de- manded of the, Government to sustain these contraetors by all Pair and legitimate rneans
I have now nearly brought adlninistration of the War Department to a close, and f
will be excused tar adverting to it briefly
"I'here is not one branch of the :nilitary service which is not in perfect order, as ihr as any means are ai2 forded of knowiner—and they are very complete
Sorne have been particularly encouraged ; I think improved
The I discipline is excellent, and the accountability to superior authority in every department could scarcely be excelled
A strict economy is enforced, and a perfect responsibility in all money e.xpenditures is, and has been, successfully carried into effect
VVithin the four years sincc I have presided over this Department, not a dollar, I believe, has been lost to the Government bv embezzlement or thcft, and within that time havo been disbursed
No system of ad- ministration, no line ot• policy, I think, could reach better results
No systetn of accoußtabikity could be more per- f@ct
'I'hese facts I confidently assert; and the Department is everywhere Cull o!' the proofs of the;n
invite any investigation which the I-louse may think proper to institute into- any or all of my official acts

it, and to request that it be r I'he Clerk will proceed to read it
The letter was thicn read, as follows: IVAR DEPARTNENT, Dcconber 27, 1860
SIR : So Inuch has been said very recently about the pol- icy of this in granting acceptances to the con- tractors lb r ra portation , that I (lemn it duc a! i To (_:onet-ess, , and to Inysclf, to niake a short, unneut of the tacts connected svith the At onc tinie—in tbc year 185d—it bccanw- absolutcjy ne- stun of 'noney—probablv a Inillion dollars
But the pecu- Diary loss would bc stna!l in ccnnparison with the risk and damage whicb such a failure would subjcct our troops to, who are stationed in the deserts of New Mexico and Ari- zona
Should Inly aecident befall these rncn

Mr
BOCOCK
I rnove that the communica- tion just rcad be referred to the select committee raised on this subject, of which the honorable gentleman from Illinois [Mr
MORRIS] is chair- man, and ordered to be printed
Mr
CURTIS
I should like to say a word, if there be no objection
Mr
JONES
1 object to debate
Mr
BOCOCK
I demand thc previous ques- tion, if i am not too late
I say to the gentleman from Iowa, that I mean no discourtesy to him; but I do think that it is premature to open any debate on this subject before the select committ.ee submits its report
I would råther that the gen- tleman would delay any remarks he may desire to raake on this subject until we receive that re- port
Mr
CURTIS
I wish to say something in re- lation to tbc facts which' have come to the knowl- edge of the Committee on Military Affairs, con- nected with the making of the contract reförred to, and the subsequent action of the Secretary of -war in relation to it
Mr
BOCOCK
1 sug«est, as this matter is before a select committee, that any information necessary for the country ought to come before it in the formal nnd regular way
If the gentleman has any facts, I think it would be bettei• that he be summoned before the select committee, in order that his testimon may be taken in regular form
Mr
LOVEJO\
lhope, then, the gentleman from Virginia will modify his motion, so as to have the paper referred and not printed
Mr
BOCOCK
I presume that the committee would prefer to have it printed
It will cost but Mr
MORRIS, of Illinois
The committee desire to havo it printed
Mr
CURTIS
1 dislike, in the face of the objection, to urge my explanation; l)üt while the Secretary of War has thus volunteered a defense, it seems to mc proper that all the facts should 'TO with that communication to thc public
Mr
BOCOCK
I would suggest to the gen- tle.man from Ohio that the communication wili to the select committcc
T hc public does not make up its opinion fronl the statements of one side only
The communication will go to committee, and furnish a subject of Invest.io•nt.ion by the committee
That committee can take the testimony of the gentleman from Iowa, and of anybody else
And let me say further to tbc gentleman from Iowa, that under the rules of the House, he has not the parliamentary right to dis- close matters which occurred in a committee-room except in the form ofa report
Mr
CURTIS
Ido not make a unteer witness to go before that committee or any other committee
I stand hero, as the gentleman from Virginia himself does, trying to place before the House every thing which ought to be pre- Mr
EOCOCK
appeal to the gentleman from Iowa, and i do not want to present, any point which docs not address itself to his fairness arid r l'he 'Secretary of 'Wur says, in his communication, that he has l.)een ilnp]icatcd
by public rumor, in the matter of thc latc defalcation,  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
219 and he wishes to make his explanation
Hc vol- untarily tuakcshimself party defendant and courts investigation
Now, bccause one of thc partics in the matter chooses to conie forward and make his statement., I appeal to the gentleman from Iowa to know whether a third person should comc for- ward and make his statement here ec parte before the House
The gentleman from Iowa himself is not presumed by anybody to be implicated in this transaction
What he says must be in the nature of evidence, or argument
It is time to argue the question when the evidence is com- ple.tcü
All we want now is testimony
Does the fact that a party defendant files his plea' here justify the gentleman from Iowa in corning for- X.vard as a witness and givinø ec parte testimony
Mr
CURTIS
I have not pretended to come here as a witness, but I wish to draw the atten- tion of the House to facts already in testimony before the House and thc country—the facts in relation to the making of these contracts with these contractors, and the interference by the Secretary of -w at' with the proper department for t.he purpose ot• Éiving the contracts to thesc men whom he favored
I wish to recall the memory of this House to the fact, that at that time there was a general indignation through the country because people bidding for contracts before the Quartermaster General were deprived of the privilege of concluding their bids, and making contracts: because the Secretary found an obso- Icte law, which allox,ved hirn to make a contract with those men
And in this connection I wish to say, that the priccs given to these contraCtors were double those which other persons were will- It seems to me ino- to take the contracts for
strange that, before accusations are tnade, or charges presented, or an investigation ordered by this House, this man should come without au- thority of law, as a head of a Department, and offer a communication to this House, excusintr himself from conduct which ought to be deprc- catcd by everybody in this country
I deny that I have offcred myself as a witness here; I repu- diate any such idea; but I am willing that the facts shall go before the committee, where there will be an investigation
Mr
GROW
I rise to a question of privilege
By the Constitution of the United States, the Pres- ident is the only person permitted to communi- cate to this House at will
The Secretary of the Treasury, I believe, has been authorized by law to send to the House his cslimates
I know of no law which authorizes any other head of a bureau, or Department of the
Government, to communicate directlv to this House
I simply want to make this statement at this time, that our privileges may not hereafter bc in- vaded, but do not intend to press the point in this case
Mr
BOCOCK
1 to a point of order
The gentleman from Pennsylvama has not the floor to make a speech, but only to state his point of Mr
GROW
That is what I am doing
Mr
BOCOCK
It seems to me it is a very long point
• Mr
GROW
I do not know that thc rules confine a member to any particular time in stat- ing a point of order
The gentleman himself spoke some time, under a calk for the previous question, and nobody objected
I merely wished to say that, by the Constitu- tion, the _ President is the only person permitted to communicate to this House at pleasure
The heads of Departments communicate to the House on call
Hereafter, I shall object to any head of Department communicating Lb the House unless some law provides forsuch communication
They can communicate only through the President
Mr
BOCOCK
In the first place, it is entirely too late to raise the question, if there was any- thing in it; but there is nothing in it'
It has been ment until now, that any public offcer implicated I in any charge noay ask the House, through the Speaker, to order an investigation
And he may make his defense
That is all we have now
A II offcer in an ilnportan public station asks, th rough the Speaker, that he ;nay l)ttvc an it-I vestin•ation by, and a bearing before, a committee; and he makes his explanation
The SPEAKER
The Chair wishes to state that, while it is the duty of the President to com- municate to this House, it docs not appear to the Chair any way improper for a head ofa Depart* ment to do so
It has been done frequently the ceser;t Congress; and therefore the Chair saw no objection to rcceiving this communication
iMr•
CLEMENS
The gentleman from Penn- sylvania [Mr
Gnow] declared he could find no law authorizing the Secretary of War to make a commui'lication to this House
I beg leave to refer him to the sixth section of the act of the 21st of April, 1808, by which it is expressly provided that thc Secretary of War shall have the right to makc a cor-mnunieation to this House in regard to all contracts madc by him under existing law
I This comm.unication relatcs to contracts made by thc Secretary of War; and as such, it certainly should be received
Mr
TT'his cominunic.alion is his dc- fense, and does not relatc to his contracts
formation in referencc to that point has been serit in before
The communication was then referred to the select committee of five, and ordered to bc printed
The SPEAKER also laid before the House comrnunication from the Secretary of War, trans- mitting a letter from Inspector General Churchill, embodying an estimate for the publication of his Manual for Parade and Review, for distribution to the militia; and recommending an appropria- tion for that purpose
During tbc reading of the communication, Mr
GROW said: Now I rise to a point of or- i ask if this communication is in rer,ly to der
any resolution of the House askinff information 
The SPEAKER
The Clerk read it, and then thc point will be ascertained
Tbc reading of thc communication was then finished
Mr
GROW
I now ask again if the conn nul- nication is in answer to any resolution of the I-louse 
The SPEAKER
It docs not appear to the Chair that it is indispensable that a communica- tion from the Secretary of War should be in an- swer to any resolution of the House
'l'.he prac- tice has been otherwise, and the Chair thinks it is right' Mr
CURTIS
1 that the communica- tion be referred to the Cornmittee on Milita ry Affairs; and, at the same time, I protest that a communication of that kind should go from the Secretary of War to the President, and by him communicated to this House, and I.)Y nobody else
Mr
STANTON
1 understand the munication contains estimates; and if that be so, unless it is thc intention of tbc House to send the Army bili to the Conunittcc on Military Affairs, it ought to be sent to the Committee, of Ways and Means
The SPEAKER
The Speaker supposed that the Committee of Ways and Means would have been the proper committee; but as the gentleman moved to havc if
referred to thc Committec on Military Affairs, the question must be put on that motion
The communication vvas then referred to the Committcc on Military Affairs
WINDER S BUILDING
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a communication from the Secretary of War, [rans- mitting a communication from the superintend* ent of Winder's Building, embodying an estimate for constructincr certain conveniences absolutely necessary about said building; which was re- ferred to the Committee of Ways and Means, and ordered to be printed
INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL
The SPEAKER stated that the business first in order was the consideration of the Indian ap- propriation bilk, on which the main question was ordered on Thursday last
Mr

ORDER BUSINESS
Mr
LANE
1 move to take up the bill (S
No
322) reported by the Corn tnittee on Military Affairs, to certain military roads in the 'I'erritory of Nevv' Mexico
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 apprehend that it will take sol-ne time tn dispose of the bill
There is a question pending, upon which we adjourned last Monday, on which* the Senator from-Oregon f Mr
BAKER] has the floor; and I think it hardly worth while to take up a bill of this character at this hour
MP
LANE
I think we can get through with it in the morning hour
This is a bill that was well considercd by the Committee on Nfilitary  18619 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBD
'223 Affairs
They believed the roads provided for I want to interfere with this discussion at all; but were necessary to be completed; and I should be there is a question in which my constituents, at glad to have action on the bill
1 am sure it can li least, have a deeper interest than in any other be disposed of Nithin the morning hour
boforc Congress—a bill which is the special order for one o•clock to-day
TRUMBULL
1 inquire whether the un- I nad expected to give finished business of the morning hour does not come up this morning
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
FITZPAT- RICK.) The Chair is not apprised that all the memorials and reports have been presented by Senators; butafter that, the first business in order will be the resolution to which the Senator from Illinois refers
Mr
TRUMBULL
Then 1 ask that that be taken up
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The first ques- tion, however, is on the motion of the Senator from Oregon
I suppose he moves to postpone the further consideration of that resolution, and all previous orders, until the hour of one o'clock, and to proceed to the consideration of the bill named by him
Mr
LANE
That is my motion
The PRESIDING OFFICER
That motion is in order; and it is competent for the Senatc to so determine
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 certainly hope that will not be done; and I apprehend that, if the Senate understand the character of the motion, it will not be done
Here is ar motion to take up a bill which will lead certainly to some discussion, which has not been considered of late, hovvever much atten- tion may have been given to it at the last session, and to supersede all other orders for the purpose of taking it up, and especially to supersede that order upon which the Senator from Oregon [Mr
BAKER] has the floor
I think it would be unjust to him; and f trust the Senate will not adopt the motion of the other Senator frcnn Oregon
MI'
LANE
I havc not the slightest desire to interfere with the Senator from Oregon
My de- sire is to get action this mornini-r on this bill
It is regarded as necessary for the public interest, for the transportation of troops and supplies
As I said before, the bill was well and tlioroughly I considered by the Commitlee on Military Affairs at the last session, and reported with a recom- mendation that it pass
Now, I think, if the Scn- ator from Illinois will allow, the bill to come up, it will consume no time; but we can have a vote, and pass it right through the Senate
I look upon it as necessary for the public good; and therefore I ask for action upon it
But I assure the Son- ator that, if any discussion arises, if it shall ap- pear that it will bc in the way at all of any other business, or of the privilege of any Senator, I will agree that it Shail be laid over
Mr
TRUMBULL
Allow me to say to the Senator from Oregon that his colleague has the floor now, and he is interposing this bill way of his right
The resolution upon which he has the floor is the matter In order at this time
Now, the Senator proposes to come in and re- move that out of the way, and take up another He proposes, as I understand him, to post- way to-day to the Senator from Illinois; for, as we have all seen, he has been trying for some weeks to 'Yet the floor, and I thought it was due to him that I should not press the question so far as he was concerned
I do not want to interfere with this discussion that is going on in the Sen- ate; but I feel it my duty to call up atone o'clock thc special order, which is the Pacific railroad bill
I shall greatly regret if, by doing so, I interfere with any gentleman who wishes to address the Senate; but I am anxious to get action on this .-lt is welf understood by the Senate, question 
by every member, us well by those who are for the measurc as those who are against it; and inm asmucli as I believe no railroad bill can pass, ex- cept the one that came to us from the House, it seems to me that a very short time will enable us to dispose of that question
Mr
DOUGLAS
Allow me to ask the sena- tor from California, whether the bill; as passed by the House, has becn printed by thc Senate
Mr
GYVIN
Yes, sir; it has been printed for ten days
I must insist on the special order
Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, 1 did not quite hear what thc honorable Senator from California said upon the subject of the Pacific railroad bill, which I understand to be the special order for to- day at one o'clock; but, coming from tho Pacific coast, I feel it my dutv to say, promptly and dc- cidedly, that I cannot 'feel for an instant that any word of mine for the Union and the perpetuity of free (movernment on this continent can compare in importance or value with the Pacific railroad bill, which, in my judgment, is an act tending to make perpetual the Üni01') of these States
There- fore I will, following the lead of the honorable Senator frorn akifornia, yield any pretension that I Ilia y havo t the floor now, at one o'clock, at any time, or, if&eed be, forever, that that bill may pass
Mr
LANE
Then, MY
President, there can be no objection to taking up this little bill
I only war)t it up in the morning hour
do not want to interfere with any spccial order
Mr
DOUGLAS
wish to have any conflicting claim acyain with rny friend frotn Orc- TOY) , for the floor to-inorrow
if he waives to-day, [ wish to knox.v which of us xvili be entitled to the floor to-inorrow
I havo felt compelled to o•ive way to hitn to-day, under the circumstances, but I do not vvrant to adjourn it over, and have another conflict with •him to-morrow
N! r
BAKER
Quite unused to the courtesies of the Senate, and quite willingr to submit to its habit, I feel In y.sclf entirely antible Lo discuss these questions of precedence or regularity, and I navself totally indifferent at what, tilne I speak, 01' when speak, or .really whether I Mr
LANE
The Senator -from cer- tainly cOnsumes the 'time of •the Senate hi.inself, not I
I understood that thé busine'ss upon wliich the Senator from Oregon
would speak •would be in order at one o'clock, ah'd I asked the'Senäto-to take up this bill and consider-it before one o'Clock
Mr
BINGHAM
Mr
President-— Mr
LANE
beg the Senator's pardon; do not want to be interrupted
1 only want to say now, for all time, that I do not desire to interfere with the time of the Senator from Oregon
Upon the contrary, I want him•to ha+e the floor'and to speak •wvhenever his time comes, and would rather hear him than have the railroad bill considered to-day—very much rather
If it is not agreeable to Senators to take up this bill this morning, let it lie over
I am willing that it shall lie over; and, when I move again in thc morning hour to take it up, I hope no Senator will get up and say that I desire to consume the time of the Senate
Sir, I have not consumed the time of the Senate
I merely asked the body to take' up the bill and consider it
It ought to be considered, and ought to bc passed, in my judgment; but•ifthe Senate do not want it to come up, let it lie, and let no Senator charge me with trying to interfere with the Senator from Oregon, or prevent him having a full opportunity to speak
I ',viil vote that the railroad bill shall be postponed until to-morrow, so that he shall have this day, and I will not in, terfcre
lb was not my wish, it was not my pur- pose, to interfere
Or I x.vould like to sec the rail- road bill, if you please, laid over until Monday, and Ict it be made the special order for that day, and then givc to-day to the Senator from Oregon, I and to-inorrow to thc Senator from Illinois
1 desire to hear both these Senators; the country desires to hear them
I hope no Senator will charge me with a disposition to prevent anybody Crorn speaking; because it is not so
The PRESIDINGOFFICER
Does the Sen- ator withdraw his motion
Mr
LANE
Why, sir, if the Senator from Oregon will go on now, and the business on which he has the floor can bc taken up now, let it be so
Mr
TRUMBULL
The Senator Oregon has been laborinty under a misapprehension all the time, I see
His colleague is entitled to the floor; that matter is up now, at this time; and if he had understood that, I am sure •he would not h.avc interposed his bill
I see his misapprehen- slon 
Mr
LANE
If 1 had known that, 1 should not have Inovcd to take up this bill at all
I sup- posed that business carne up at one o'clock
I therefore withdraw the motion
I The PRESIDING OFFICER
The first busi- ness in order is the joint resolution (S
No

J0HNsoN,] proposing amendments to the Consti- tution of the United States, upon which the Sen- ator from Oregon [Mr
BAKER] is entitled to the floor
RAILROAD TO PACIFIC
speak at all
i will give way to the Senator from Illinois, or to the Senator from California, or to Mr
G WIN
The Senator from Oregon will the Pacific railroad bill
i submit myseif entirely pernlit me to interpose a motion
He evidently pone the very question upotl which his colleague to the courtesy and justice of the Senate
[" Go has the floor and is entitled to speak, for the pur- pose of introducing a bill here which manifestly on now
cannot be passed between this and one o'clock
A/lr
TRUMBULL
1 think the Senator from Oregon [MI'
LANE] should be satisfied that he is If the Senator insists upo)'l it, I noust call for the reading of this bill, that thc Senate may see what merely wastino• time by persistino• in this attempt to get up a bill, and exclude his collcacyuc from thc Mr
DOUGLAS
If my colleague will give floor
•This is the first instance since I have been way for a moment, I think I can adjust this mat- in the
Senate, whore a member of tho Senate upon supposed that I had the floor fot to-day, either side has had the •floor and was ready to ter
according to an arrangement made on Monday
proceed, that any member has persisted in bl'lng- up a bill to take the floor from him
Tfie the Senator from Louisiana When, however, closed his speech, the Senator from Oregon I Mr
Senator from Oregon must sec that hc cannot pass BAKER] took the floor, and .he has come into tl'ie this bill in the morning hour, and he is but wast- Senate to speak to-day
is very evident that ing the time of the Senate
Although his col- thc two speeches cannot be delivered on one day; league seems entirely willino• to waive his rights, and as bc goes on in the mornirig hour, I have the rest of tl'1C Senate and the country havc some said to him that I would waive 771 y right to the floor to-day at one o'clock, provided I could have it to-morrow, in order to avoid stopping hi;n in thc midd\e of his -•peech, or beginning a speech myself {his afternoon and running it into to-mor- row, as I should not be able to get through after he bas concluded to-day
If this arrangement be made, I presume the Senator from Oregon [Mr
LANE] can pass his bill, and the other Senator Oregon [Mr
BAKER] can occupy the floor for and this will beharmonious all around
I do not Mr
GWIN
object to that
cannot get through his speech by one o'clock, and I am very reluctant to interfere with him in giving his views on the important question which I he wilt discuss to-day
I do not want, however, to evade my duty aé a Senator from California, which is to psess,at all proper times, the railroad question
Therefore, I will move to make it the special order for to-morrow at one o'clock, with the hope that lhc friends of the measure will bring it up then, and not interfere with the Senator's speech to-day
I Mr
DOUGLAS
crowded out to-day, and shall want to-rnorrow
Say Monday
Mr
LATHAM
1 would suggest to my cao•ue, 10 avoid all difficulty, to make his motion for Satu i'day
To-morrow the Senator from Illi- interest in what hc has to say
want tho nois will be entitled to the floor, and he will con- sumc the whole day
The next day is a day on benefit, of it
We understand that
he is to speak II which thc Senate will not sit
But on Saturday for the Constitution and the Union, which are above all price, and which arc to be.maintaincd we can meet; and I think that every Senator, by at all hazards
Sir, have an interest in hoar- common consent, will agree to give us a hearing on the railroad bill then, and pass it, or dispose ing him
T hc country wants to hear froin him from the Pacific slope, and to kn6w the feeling of of it in some way finally
i that people
This persistent effort to bring upa I Mr
G WIN
I am willing that it shall be made bill to construct a road, in order to crowd him out the special order for onc o'clock on Saturday
of his right to the floor, is a very unusual thing The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will regard that as the sense of the Senate, unless I trust that the Senate will not allow it to objected to
be done

AMENDMENTS TO Tl•lß CONSTITUTION
The Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, resumed the consideration of the joint resolution (S
No
48) introduced by Mr
JOHNSON, of Ten- nessee, proposing ameffdments to theConstitution of the United States
Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, the adventurous traveler who wanders on the slopes of the Pacific, and on the very verge of civilization, stands awe- struck and
astonished in that great chasxn formed by the torrent •of the Columbia, as, rusbing be- tween Mount Hood and Mount St
Helen's, it breaks through the ridges of the Cascade mount- ains to find the sea
Nor is his wonder lessened when he hears his slightest tone repeated and re- echoed vv'ith a larger utterance in reverberations that lose themselves at last amid the surround- ing and distant hills
So l, standing on this spot, and speaking for the first time in this Charnber, reflect with astonishment that my feeblest word is reechoed, even while I speak, to thc confines of the Republic
I trust, sir, that in so speaking, in the midst of such an auditory, and in the presence of great events, I Inn y remember all the respons- ibility thcsc impose upon me to perform my duty to the Constitution of the United States, which I havc sworn to support, and to be in no wise för- getful of my obligation to the whole country, of which I am a devoted and affectionate son
It is my purpose, to reply, as I may, to the speech of the honorable and distinguisl'hed Senator from the State of Louisiana
I do so because it is, in my judgment at least, the nblest speech which I have heard, perhaps the ablest I shall hear, upon that side of the question, and in that view of the st.lbjec,t; because it is respeetful in tone and elevat.ed ill manner; and because, while it will be my fortuilc to differ from upon , most ot- the points to which he has many, nay addressed himself, it
is not, I trust, inappropriate for to say thut louch of what hc has said, and has tended to the manner In which he has said it, increase the personal respect—nay, I Inn y say the learned to feel for h ill)
admiration—which I havo And yet, sir, while i say this, I tun reminded of the saying of a great Inan—Dr
Johnson, I be- his critical •eve—who, when he was asked for just then published, and 01)inion upon a book •which was making a great sensation in London, said: " Sir, the fellow who has written that, has done very well what nobody ought ever to do at all." r Ithc entire ol)ject of the speech is, as I under- stand it, to o fVer a philosophical and constitu- tional disquisition to prove that the of these United States is, in point (')f fact, no Gov- t.hat it has no principle of vitality; ernment at all ; dwindled that it is to be overturned by u touch; into insignificance by a doubt; dissolved by a capable of exercise against domestic treason and against foreign foes
Such, sir, is the main pur- pose of my speech; and what I may say addi- tional to this, will be drawn from me in reply to the speech to which I propose now to address myself
Sir, the argument of the honorable Senator from Louisiana is addressed first—I will not say main- ly—to establish thc proposition that the State of South Carolina, having, as he says, seceded, has sccedcd from t.his Union rightfully; and, sir, just here he says one thing, at least, which meets my hearty approval and acquiescence
He says he does not deem it—such is the substance of the remark—unwise or improper to argue the right In this I agree of the case even now and here
with him most heartily
Right and duty are al- ways majestic ideas
They march an invisible cruard in the van of all true progress; thcy animate the loftiest spirit in the public assemblies; they nerve thc arm of the warrior; they kindle the soul of the statesman, and the imatrination of the poet; they sweeten every reward; they console every defeat
Sir, they are of themselves an indisso- luble chain, which binds feeble, erring humanity I meet the dis- I to the eternal throne of God
1 defer to that authority
cussion in that spirit
I observe, sir, first, that the argurnent of the gen- tlcman, from beginning to end, is based upon tbc assmnption that- the Constitution of tho United i States is a compact between sovereign States
think I in no sense misapprehend it; I am sure i understand hill') , such cannot be my desire
throughout the whole tone of his speech, to main- tain that proposition—I repeat it—that the Con- stitution of' thc United States is acotnpact between sovcreio•n States
Al'(yuing from thence, he arrives at the conclusion that, beino• so, u cotnpact, when broken by either of the other States, or by the General Governnoer)t, the creature oc the Consti- lution , South Carolina or Louisiana may treat the as broken, the contract as _ scinded ; nMty withdraw peacefully frorn the Ulf n, and resturne orio•inal condition
I remark next, that this prol osition is in no wise new; and perhaps for that, as it is a con- stit.utional it is all the better; and a (rain, the a rcrurnei'lt by which tbc honorahlc Sen- ator seeks to nraiut.•ain it is in wise new in any of its parts
I have examined with some carc the, arguments hitherto made by great men, the echoes of whose eloquence yet linger under this dome and I find that the proposition, the argument, the nut,hority, the illustration, are, but a repetition of the famous discussion led ofl•'by Mr
Calhoun , and growing out of the attemptofSouth Carolina to do not, by malad Ininistration rne.rcly, but in of organic interwoven with its very existence purpose—stranrre and in anybody, s:t.ill ore so ili him— a terrible significance now and here
the Union is this h on o ra ble Sen a t.or, ment of' the day dissolved; it is ken and disin tegrated; civil war is a consequence at once necessary and inevitable
Standing in the Seriate Chaniber, h speaks like a prophe-t of woe
The l.)urdell of prediction the echo of x.vlu_lt the distinguished has Said gentlennan now presiding in that chair I YERSON in the chair 1—" r I'Q too late ! ' ' The gleamino• and lurid lights of war flash around his brow, even while he speaks
A_nd, sir, if it were not
for the exquisite amenity of his tone and his n-ntnner, we could casily per- suadfh ourselves that we saw the flashing of the armor of the soldier beneath the robe of the Sen- purpose is far diffe.rellt•, sir, I think it is I desire to contributc poor {.11'(yu- far higher
men t to maintain t lie dignity, the honor of the II under which I live, I propose, whose august shadow I hope to die
in opposition to all that has been said, to show tho Government of thc United States is in very deed a real, substantial Power, ordained by , not doppndent upon States; sovereicrn in its s'l')hero•
a Union, and nen a ccnnpact bet\veen soverei«yn Stacc,s; that to its truc theory, in capacity of self-protection; E before what she says she has done now
If the proposit.ion is not new, and if the argu- rnent* are nq')t stru.nge, it will 1101 be wonderful if replies [.-»artals-e of the like character
I clerw, as Mr
Webster ; 1 deny, as Mr
Madison that I deny, as General Jackson denied, this U nion is a betwc•en sovereign States I meet just herc and so d en vin tho rities which the honorable Senator has chosen 'I"hey are substantially, as follows: first
, E)0t the Constitution itself', (and that is re- , not
the arguments inade by the cx pounders of the Constitution directly this floor; but luainly upon this question, arid 01) fu triti ve exp ressions, sornetin'lcs hasty, not always considered, upon propositions not gerinane to the coil troversy now encra(Yincy us to-day; and when rnade, if' I'ikisapprche.nded, corrected again and again in after years
To illustrate: the gentleman States
It crushes nullification" and must hasten an abandomnentof secession." But this dodrres the blow, by conföunding the claim to secede at will with the right of seceding froin intolerable oppression
'I'lle tbrmer answers itself, being a violation without cause of' a faith solenmly pledged
The latter is another narne only for revolution, about which there is no theoretic controversy
Its double aspect, nevertheless, with the countenance received from ccrtaill quarters, is giving it a popular eurreney herc which may influence the approaching elections both för Congress and for the State Legislature
It has gained some advant- age, also, by mixinrr itself with the question whether the Constitution of the United States was tanned by the peo- ple or by the States, now under a theoretic discussion by animated partisans
-it is fortunate disputed theories can bc decided by undisputed fhcts ; and here the undisputed fact is, that the Constitution was made by the people, but as embodied into the several States who were parties it, and, therefore, Ilh'ldc by the Statcs in their highest authoritative capacity
They Inigbt, by tho same authority and by the satne pro- cess, have converted the Confederacy into a mere league or treaty, or continued it with enlarged or abridged powers, or have enibodied the peopie of their respective States into one people, nation, or sovereignty ; or, as they did, by a mixed fonn, Inake them one people, nation, or sovereignty for certain purposes, and not so for others
rf'he Constitution of the United States, being established by a cotnpetent authority, by that of the sovereign people of the several States wljo were parties to it, it retnailjs only to inquire what the Constitution is ; and hcre it speaks for It organizes a •rovernmentinto the usual legislative, itself'
executive, and judiciary departlnents; it invests it with specified powcrs, leaving others to the parties to t.he Con- stitution
It nrakes the Governlnent like other (}overnments to operate directly on the people; places at its colnmand the necdfttl physical rneans ot• executing its powers ; and finally proclailns its suprernaey, and that of the laws Inade in pursuance of it, over the constitutions and laws of the Slates, thc powers of the Govern:nent being exercised, as in other elective and responsible Governinente, under the control of its constituents, the people and the Legislatures of the States, and subject to the revolutionary rights of the in extrellle cases
Such is the Constitution of the Unit.ed States dejure and de 
facto, and the narne, whatever it be, that Inay be given to it can Inakc it nothing *nore or less than what it is
Pardon this hasty effusion, which, whether precisely ac- cording or not with your ideas, presents, I am aware, none Illat will bc to you
With great esteellh and cordial salutations, JAMES MADISON

Mr
President, 1 submit to the candor of the Senator frorn Louisiana that that is dist.inct, positive, unequivocal authority to show that so as the opinions of Mr
Madison were concerned, he did not believe that tbc Constitu- tion of t.he United States was a cornpuct between sovereign States; but that be did believe it was a form of Govern tnent ordaii'ied by the people of the United States
I expected, Again: Mr
Webster is quoted
when I heard Mr
-wycbstcr named, to find that the honorable Senator would allude to thc great discussion which his genius has rendered immor- tal
He does not do that; but Fefers specifically to a passage Mr
Webster's in an arøume.nt in the Supreme Court, I believe, upon a question arisincr as to boundary between Massachusetts and Rhode Islay)d
Mr
BENJAMIN
If tho Senator will perniit tne, be is Inistaken
The question that arose there was in relation to the power of the people of Rhode Island to constitute a new crovernmcnt, not a questi0i) of boundary
I allude to his arcrument in the cele.brated Dorr controversy
Mr
BAKER
I feel oblig•ed to the Senator for his correction; and I beg leave 10 say that the mistake perhaps is not a very unnatural one in me, livino so many thousand n)iles away; for, really, Rhode Island, though very patriotic, is so very small that I do not quite keep up with her It is no sort of difference history as I ought
whether Mr
Webster madc the speech on a boun- 
dary question or on arebellion question; the speech that its Constitution is a perpetuity, beneficent, unfailing, grand; and that its powers are equally II late very powerful speech in the Senate of the United from Louisiana has quoted nt considerable length was made
My criticism upon the quotation is frojn tho debates in the convention which formed this: it has no relation whatever to the controversy now here, or it- it has, it is so remote and indis- the Federal Constitution; he has quoted the opin- ions of Mr
Madison, and to those who littvc not tinct that it becomes him and ine alike to refer to looked i1110 the quesUon, it n•fight appear as if what Mr
-Webster did say directly upon the controversy itself
Now i take the liberty of read- those opinions were
really in support of his prop- osition that this is a conipac.t between soverenrn to show that that is in no sense States
Now, sir, so, I will read, as a rcply to the entire quotations of the opinions of IM r
iMadison, M,'hat Mr
Mad- I i ison n-lselt' said upon that subject upon the full- I proceed to read est considei•auon in the world
what I suppose to bo at once arg•cunent and au- —L read the letterofNf_r
thority upon [hat question to Mr
dated March 15, 1833
Mr
TRUMBULL read, as follows
MONTPELIER, March 15, 1833
MY DEAR SIR : I return zny thanks for the copy of your ing Mr
Webstér's views as expressed and con- densed by hirnself
I read from Mr
Webster's works, volume three, page 464: against all these theories and opinions, And sir, I inaåltain— l
tuc Constitution of the United States is not a ' league, confederacy, or compact
between the people of the several States in tileir sovereign capacities ; but a Govern- ft)ühded on the adoption 01' tbc people, and ment proper, creatiu•-F direct relations benveen itself aud individuals
'I'hat no State authority bas power to dissolve these relations ; that nothing cau dissolve then) but rcvolutian • and that consequently can be no such thing as seces- Sion without revolution
3
That there is a supreme law, consisting of the Con-  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN THIRTY-SIXTM CONGRESS, 2D SESSION
stitutiou of the United States, and acts of Congress passcd ill pursuance ot• it, and treaties; and that in cases not ca- pable of assuming the character of the suit in law or equity, Congress Inust judge of, aud finally interpret, this supreme law so often as it has occasion to pass m.•ts of legislation ; aud in cases capable of assumin«, and actually assuminø the character of a snit, the Supreme Court of the United States is the final interpreter." Now, I submit again to the candor of the hon- orable and distinguished gentleman, that there is the positive, unmistakable evidence of Mr
Web- step, so far as his own opinion goes; that this is not, according to his proposition, a compact be- sovereign States; but it is a Government made and ordained by the people of the whole United States; a Government capable of acting directly upon individuals, and made by individ- uals
And, sir, it is remarkable that these prop- ositions of Mr
Webster grew out of his desire to contradict the affirmative propositions of Mr
Calhoun, upon which the debate erew up
f read them : The first two resolutions of the honorable
meniber, [says Mr
Webster,] amrm these propositions, namely"— And they are propositions sought to be en- forced by the distinguished Senator from Louis- iana— l
That the political system under which we live, and under which Congress is now asscmbled
is a compact, to which the people of the several States, as separate and sov
ereign communities, are the parties
2
That, these sovereign parties •åæve a right to judge, each för itself, of any alleged violation of the Constitution by Congress, and in case such violation, to choose, each {Or itse;t', its own mode and Ineasure of redress.' There, sir, is the right of secession upon the onc hand, or at least of nullification; and I )nay say here, once for all, the difference betwccn nul- lificationand secession is just this: secession bears the same relation to l')uÜlification that biography bears to history, somebody havincr wittily said that history was biography with it's brains knocked I understand that rmllification- is just seces- out
Sion with its brains knocked out; and every argu- ment applying to the one applies to the other
So much for the second authority upon which the distinguished Senator frotn Louisiana relies
I now come to the third; and I trust he wili allow me to correct for what I know was an oversight, or at least an entire Illisapprehension
The honorable gentieman from Louisiana, durincy the course of his speech, rernarked, as I renunn- ber it, that a valued friend had placed in his hands a paper from which he reads purporting to be the opinion of John Quincy Adatns, upon this ques- tion of the right of a State to secede
I did not understand him as reading from a manuscript of his own copy, but from a paper placed in his hands, and perhaps about the moment., by some- body else
Mr
BENJAMIN
so far as that is concerned, the paper that I read from m.vas sent to me as I read it, from a valued friend from New York
As to the speech of Mr
Adams, of course cannot tell anything about it; I have never scen it
Mr
BAKER
The reason why f say this it It is a remarkable fact is proper to state that of all the passages ever written by John Quincy Adams, of all the passages ever written by anybody from the beginning of the world, that passage, taken altogether, part of which was honorable Senator from Louisiana, read by the is the passtve, of all others, which maintains the doctrine of the oneness of this Go€ernment, its unity, its creation by the people, its ordination by them as one Government, and arj entire anni- hl'ation the whole doctrine of secession
difficulty was this: that the gentleman who fur- nished it, and who caused the unwitting reading of it, have no doubt, in its mutilated condition, by the Senator from Louisialla, omitted the most remarkable part of the whole passage; and it is more remarkable in this—it is for that reason I hasten to acquit my distinguished friend of any that it is in knowledge of the misapprehension— the very same and there had to be in that paragraph this very same process of separa- tion and disunion which is getting to bc fashion- able now-a-days, to make it bear upon the Sena- 15 FRIDAY, JANUARY 4, 1861
tor's view of the question at all
I will read it
It begins in this wise: In the calm hours of self-possession, the rightof a State to nullity an aet of Congress is too absurd for argument, and too odious for discussion
The right ofa State to secede from the Union is equally disowned by the principles of the Declaration of Independence." Now, sir, there follows after that the passage read by the distinguished gentleman
It is a pas- sage, as I understand it, incorporated in his speech, which presents the opinion of Mr
Adams that there may be extreme cases in which a State ora community has aright to revolutionize
So rnuch for the third authority quoted by the distinguished Senator
Now, speaking of authorities, Ict me add once more, that this speech of Mr
Adams, entitled the Jubilee of the Constitution, delivered by him, with all his cxhaustive power as to any subject to which hc turncd his attention, is, in pointoffact, an irresistible argument in favor of our proposi- tion that the Constitution of the United States is an ordained Government by the people for the government of the people, and that it is in no sense, and can never be, taken or considered as a compact bctwccn sovereign States
Nay, sit, throughout the '.vhole course of that speech he gocs much further
He argues with great power, and with great historical research,- to show that, not Ol')ly is thc Constitution of the United States a Government formed by the people and not a compact betwccn States, but that the old Confed- et•ation, prior to the Constitution, was intcnded to bc that form of Government also; that rcally the people of the thirteen revolting or revolution- ary colonies intended, even at the time of the Dec- laration of Independence, preceding both the Con- and the Confederation, to form then a united Government of one common people
will read, not wearying the Senate, as I trust, by authorities much mote expressive of constitu- tional law than anything I can say vv'i]l be, thc conclusion to which Mr
Adams comes as the sum total of the whole argument: That the Constitution of thc United States was a rc- turn to thc principles of the Declaration of Indepcndence, and the exclusive constitt_tent power of the people
it was the •work of the ouc peopie of the United States; and that thosc United States
though doubled in numbers, stiil constitute, as a nation
but one people
'I'hat this Constitution, making due allowance ftn• the in)perl'ec.tions and errors incident to all human affairs, has, under all the vicissitudes and changes of war and peace, becn ad•ninistered upon those same principles during a career of fifty years
'Ithat
its fruits have been, still making allowance fot htnmtan a Illorc pertuct uni01i, established justice
(tornestic tranquiiiity, provision tur the comrnon detense, proutotion of the general welfare, and the enjdy
inent of the blessings of liberty by the constituent people and their posterity to the prescut
day
And now the future is all betörc us, and Providence our guide." And I submit again, in the most respectful that the authority of Mr
spirit, Mr
President, John Quincy Adams is direct, positive, unequiv- ocal, in maintcnance of the propositions we are
endeavoring to estal.)lish, and utterly and totally contradictory to all the distinguished Senator from Louisiana has said upon thal subject
A1)d yet onco rnore, sir, I quote from General It is au authority which I trust the dis- Jackson
tinguished gentleman will revere
As I have said, South Carolina att.empted f.o do once before what it is said she has accomplishcd now
There was then a President of the United States determined to do his whole duty
Whetl'ier there bc now, I leave others to dctcrminc: Tirc States severally have 110t retained their entire sov- ereigl)ty
It has been shown that in becoming parts of a nation, not *nembers ofa league, they surrendered 'Dany of 'l'he right to Inake their essential parts of sovereignty
treaties, declare war, levy taxes, exercise exelusive judicial and let'islative powers, were ali fianctions of soverei«n power
'rhe States, then, iör all these iniportant purposes, were no longer sovereign
'Vhe allegiance of their citizens was transferred in the first instance to the Government ot' the United States; they becarne American citize.ns, and owed obedieuee to the-Constitution of the United States." He savs, again: The unity •out' politicaf character (as has been shown tor another purpose) corn:nenced with its very cxistence

Ünder the Royal Government we had no separate eharactcr.; our opposition to its oppression began ds united colOnies
We wore the United States under the the name was perpetuated, and the Union rendered ruore pertct by the Federal Constitution." * would not do to say that our Constitution was only a league, but it is labored to prove it a in one sense, it is,) and then to argue that, as a ' league iR compact, every compact between nations must, ofcourse, be a league, and that from such an engagement every sovereign- Power has a right to recede
But it has been shOwn tbat in this scnse the States are not sovereign, and that even if' they were, and the national Constitution lidd been it»nned by compmct, there would be no right in any one State to exon- erate itself from the obligation." Another mistake- which (speaking q.vith great deference) I think is obvious throughout the whole speech of the Senator from Louisiana, is the as- sumption, not only that the Constitution is a com- pact, but that the States parties to itare sovereigns
Sir, they are not sovereign; and this FederalGov- ernment is not sovereign
Paraphrasing the Ma- hometan
expression, thcrc is but one God," I may say, and I do say, not without reverence, there is but one Sovereign, and that sovereiøn -is the people
The State government is its creation S the Federal Government is its creation; each su- preme in its sphere; each sovereign its pur- pose; but each limited in its authority, and cach dependent upon delegated power
Why, sir, can that State—either Oregon or South Carolina—be soverewn which relinquishes the insignia of sov- crcignty, the cxcrcisc of its highest powers, the expression of its noblest dignities
Not so
We can neither coin money, nor levy impost duties, nor make war, nor peace, nor raise standing armies, nor build fleets, nor issue bills of credit
In sliort, sir, we cannot do—because the people, as sover- eigns, have placed that power in other hands— many, nay, most, o
thosc things .which exhibit and proclaim the sovereignty of a State to the whole world
Mr
Webster has well .observed that there can be in this country no sovereignty in the European sense of sovereignty
It is, I believe, a feudal idea
-It has no place here
I 'They are not repeat, we are not sovereign here
sovereign in South Carolina; they are not, and cannot be in the natuvc of the case; and therefore all assumptions and all presumptions arising out of the proposition Ofso reign ty—su premacy upon the part of a State—is a fallacy from beginning to end
Again, sir: Mr
Calhoun, in the course of this celebrated argument, in wrell chosen words, in- sisted that the States in their sovereign capacity, acceded to a compact
Mr
Webster replied with his usual force
The word 'i accede" svas chosen as the converse of " secede*' the argument being intended to be that if .the State accedes to a com- pact she may secede from that compact
But; said Mr
Webster—and no man has answered- the nrcrument, and no man ever will—it is not an ac- cession to a compact at all; it is not the formation of a leågue at all; it is the action of the people of the United States carrying into effect their pur- pose from the Declaration of Independence itself, manifested in the ordination and establishment of a Government, and expressed in their own em- phatic-words in the preamble of the Constitution of the United States itself
In arguing upon the meaning and import of the Constitution, I had hoped that a lawyer so dis- tinguished as
the gentleman from Louisiana, would have referred to the terms of that docu- merit to have endeavored at least to find its real meaning from its force and mode of expression
In the absence of such a quotation, I beg leave to remind him that the Constitution itself declares by whom it svas made, and for what it was made
Mr
Adams, reading it, declares that the Cons_ti- tution of the United States was the work of one people—the people of the United States—and that those United States stifl constitute one people; and to establish that, among other things, he re- —the great, the patent, the glorious fers to the fact fact—that the Constitution declares itself to have been made by the people, and not by sovereign States, but by the people of the United States; not a compact, not a league, but it declares that the people of the United States do ordain and  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 2, establish a GQvernment
Now, I ask the distin- guished Senator, what becomes of this iteration and reiteration, that the Constitution is a compact between sovereign States 
Pursuing what I think is a defective mode of reasoningfrom beginning to end, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana quotes Vattel, and for" what
To prove what, as I understand, nobody denies: that a sovereign State, being sovereign, may make a compact, and afterwards withdraw from it
Our ansx,ver to that is, that South Caro- lina is not a sovereign State; that South Carolina has not made a compact, and that, therefore, it is not true that she can withdraw from it; and I submit that all these disquisitions upon the nature of European sovereignty, or any of those forms of government to which the distinguished author which
he has quoted had his observation attracted , is no argument whatever in a controversy as to the forcc and meaning of our Constitution bear- ing upon States, sovereign in some sense, not sov- ereign in others, but benrincr most upon individ- uals in their individual relations
But the object of the speech was twofold
It was •to prove first, that this Union wras a compact between States, and that, thcreföre, there was a rightful remedy for injury, intolerable or other- wise, by secession
Now, sir, I confiess in one thincr I do not understand this speech, although it be clearly written and forcibly expressed
Does the Senator mean to argue that there is such a thing as a constitutional right of secession 
Is it a right under the Constitution, or is it a right above it and be ond it
Mr
BENJAKIIN
I do not know whether the Senator desires an answer DOW
Mr
BAKER
Yes, sir; now
Mr
BENJAMIN
Well, sir, 1 will take ample from gentlerneu on the other side, and I will answer his question by asking another
Mr
BAKER
Do, sir
Mr
BENJAMIN
him if the State of South Carolina were refused more than one Senator on this floor, whether she would have a right to withdraw froin the Union, and if' so, whether it would arise out of thc Constitution or not
Mr
BAKER
Now, Mr
President, 1 will do what the distinguished Senator from Louisiana has not done: i will answer the question, [laucyh- tee.] Hc asks mc whether if the State of South Carolina, sending two Senators here loyally, with affectionate reverence for the Consti tution , werc de- nied the a(lmission of one, or, it' you like, of both, I understund it would be cause for withdru•wal
that to be the question
Sir, I reply: that
would depend upon several things yet to bc stated and determined: First, I think South Carolina ought to inquirc what is the couse of thut refusal
believe this body is the judge of the qualification of its own Incmbcrs
If' the Senator was disqual- ified, or if in any Cair judginent or reasonable judgn-kent we believed he ought not to occupy a sent.- this floor, surely ii would not bc cause of withdrawal or secession , or• t•cvolution, or war, if we wérc to scud him back
But, sir, I will meet the question in the full spirit in which, I suppose, it intended to put it
It is this: the right of representation is a sacred If that right is fraudulently and pertina- ciously denied, has the State to which it is denicd right to secede in consequence thereof
I an- swer, the right of representation is right, in my judgmei)t, inalienab\e
It belongs to all comrnnn- ities, and to all men
II is of the very nature and essence of free government; and if, by force, by despotism of the Inany over the few, it is denied, solemnly, despotically, of purpose, the intolera- ble oppression resulting from that may be repelled by all the means which God and nature have put in out; hands
Is the honorable Senator an- swercd 
Mr
BENJAMIN
Not yet
Mr
BAKER
What, sir
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 was saying to the Sena- I asked him whether he denied the tar, not yet
fact that, in the supposed case, which he has very fairly met, the right to withdrawr resulted from the breach of the agreement in the Constitution, and would be a right growing out of the violation of the Constitution, independent of the question of oppression at all 
Mr
BAKER
well, sir, 1 beg to say, in answer to that: that is not the question the honorable Senator put to me, but I will answer that
T hc right of South Carolina to withdraw, because the fundamentaL right of representation is denied her, is the right of revolution, of rebel- lion
It does not depend upon constitutional guar- It is beyond them, above them, antees„ at all
and not of them
Now, is the Senator answered 
Mr
BENJAMIN
lam fully answered
1 am only surprised at the answer
Mr
BAKER
NOW", will the distinguished Senator answer me 
Mr
BENJAMIN
With pleasure
Will the Senator state hisquestion once more
Mr
BAKER
Is such a thing as a con- stitutional right of South Carolina to secede
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 thought, Mr
President, that 171 y proposition on that subject could not be 1 hold that there is, from the very m islaken
nature of the Constitution itself, from the theory upon which it is formed, a right in any State to withdraw from the compact, if its provisions are violated to her detriment
Mr
BAKER
well now, sir, 1
understand what I did not quitc understand before—no doubt it was owing to my obtuseness—that the gentle- man contends that there is in the State of South Carolina a right to secede, to use his own words, in the very nature of the Constitution itself
Mr
BENJAMIN
Resulting from the very nature of the compact, which I consider the Con- slitution to be
Mr
BAKER
But that, Mr
President, is not what the
Senator did s•xy
I press him on this point again
Does the right to secede spring out of and belong to the Constitution
And if so, I am a strict constructionist
where
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 am, too; and, if the sen- ator will admit with 1110, whut I suppose he will scarcely deny, that the States have reserved to themselves under the Constitution, by express language, every right not expressly denied to them by the Constitution, I say that he will find in the ninth and tenth amendments to the Con- the reco«rnition of the very right which Mr
BAKER
well, sir, the answer to that is just this: that we have been endeavoril'lg to show 
—and I think irresistibly—that, so far from its being true that the States do reserve to themselves in the Constitution all riffht,s not delegated by it, they do not reserve anything, for they are not parties to it; and there is no such thing ns a res- ervation by the States at all
The instrument is made by the people; and the reservations, if any, are made by the people, not the States
Mr
BENJAMIN
if I am not intruding upon the Senator's line of argument or time—and if I am I will not say another word— Mr
BAKER
Not at all
Mr
BENJAMIN
the Senator whether, after the Constitution had been framed, amend- merits were not proposed by nearly all the States arid adopted, for the very purpose of meeting that construction for which he is now contending; for the very purpose of maintaining the proposition I-lis idea•is, that arrainst which he, now armucs 
the Constitution of the United States fin-med a G-overnment over the whole people as a mass
'l*he amendruents state distinctly that that was not the meaning of the Constitution; but that, on the contrary, it was a delegation of power by the States, and that the States and the people of the States reserved to themselves all powers not ex- pressly delegated
Mr
BAKbR.
" The powers not delegated to the Ul')ited States by the Constitution, nor pro- hibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people;" that is the amendment
Now, in unswer, I stry that in full light of that ainendrnent, every authority which I have read, every ar•gun'lent at which I havo glanced , from Jackson, from Madison, from Web- i ster, from Adams, all unite in the proposition that still this is a Government made by the people of the IJnitcd States, in their character of people of the States, being one Government by them or- dained
Mr
BENJAMIN
Will the Senator be good enough to tell me what he deems to be the mean- ing of this article of the Constitution
(A disturbance in the galleries attracted the attention of the Chair, caused by loud laughing i I and talking.] i: The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
in the chair.) Order in the galleries
The Sergeant- at-Arms will remove the persons from the galle- ries in front of the Chair, on the right of the clock, forthwith
The order of the Senate must be pre- served
Mr
BENJAMIN
Will the Senator good enough to allow' me to call his attention to the seventh and last article of the Constitution
The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient fot the establishment of this Consti- tution between the States so ratifying the same" —not read the preamble, but the bargain
Mr
BAKER
Where shall 1 find it, sir
Mr
BENJAMIN
In the very last article of the Constitution
Mr
BAKER
lazn not sure that I understand the forcc of the distinction which thc honorable gentleman makcs between the preamble and the Constitution itself
Following the example of Mr
Webster, I love to read the whole instru• ment together; but I will answer the Senator
The ratification of the conventions of nine States shall be sufficient for the establishment o
this Constitution between the States so ratifying t11C saine." Mr
BENJAMIN
Between the Statcs." Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, are the conventions of nine States but the people of nine It is not States
Thcrc is the answer at once
ratification b the State Legislature
Mr
BENIAMIN
What is the meaning of Is not that the phrase G' between the States 
the language of compact
BAKER
Well, it is obvious enöugh
Ratification is to bc donc by the people
It so pro- made by the people in the first place
It is to be ratified by them in the second poses
place; and being so made by them, and being so ratified by them, is binding upon the States, which are the governments of the people that ratified it
That is all
But, sir, the Senator does not es- cape in that way
I ask him yet once again, is the right to secedc a right growing out of the Cmnstftution itself
If so, where
What is that provision
_I repeat, am a strict constructiön• am not now going to hunt 1st
He says he is
for a vatyrant and doubtful bower; but when States propose to secede, to dissolve thc Union, to dep clare war, to drench confcdcrated States in fra- ternal blood, I ask if they claim it as a constitu- tional right to take the step that Will inevitably I ask for the word, the page, the lead to that

place, and I meet no reply
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 again refer the Senator to the words and the place
If the right of seces- Sion exists at all, under any circumstances, revo- lutionary or not, it is a State right
Now, the question whether it exists under the Constitution or not, can only be deterxnined in one way: first, by examining what powers are prohibited to the States; and next, whether the powers not pro- hibited are reserved
This power is nowhere prohibited ; and the tenth amendment declares that the powers not prohibited by the Constitution to the States are reserved to the States
IVIr
BAKER
Mr
President, 1 do not ceive the iffiportancc, nay, the profit, of pursuiDT that line of Inquiry any further
I have asked for the answer of the honorable Senator to that question; and if with that answer he is content, and if by that answer he intends to abide, so be it
think that we have well disposed of' the right of secession under the Constitution itself
I advance to another proposition
I admit that there is a revolutionary right
Whence does it spring
How is it limited
To these questions for a moment I address myself
Whence does it spring
Why, sir, as a right in communities, it is of the same nature as the- right of self-preservation in the individual
A corn mu- nit y protects itself by revolution aoainst intoler- able oppression under any form of government, as an individual protects himself ærainst intoler- able oppression by brute force
No compact, no treaty, no constitution, no form of government, no oath or obligation can deprive a man or a com- munity of that sacred, ultimate right
Now, sir, I think I state that proposition as fully as I could be desired to state it by the gentlemen upon the other side
The question that arises between us i at once is: this right of revolution springilP out of the self-preservation belonging to communities, as to individuals, must bc exercised—how
In a case, and in a case only, where all other rem- edies fail; where the oppression is grinding, intol-  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL, GLOBB
227 erab*e, and permanent; where revolution is in its nature a fit redress; and where they who adopt it as a remedv can do it in the full light of ail- the examples or the past; of all the responsibilities of the present; of all the unimpassioned judgment of the future, and the ultimate determination of the supreme Arbiter and Judge of all
Sir, a right so exercised is a sacred right
maintain it; and I would exercise it
The question recurs: has South Cah•olina that right
I think the honorable Senator will not deny that one of the gravest responsibilities which can devolve upon a community or a State is to break up an established, peaceful form of government
If that be true as an abstract proposition, how much more does the truth strike us when we ap- ply to the condition in which we found our- selves two months ago 
South Carolina proposes now, according to the later doctrine, to secede as a revolutionary right; as a resistance against in- tolerable oppression; as an appeal to arms for the maintenance of rights, for the redress of wrongs, wheFe the one cannot be maintained and the other be redressed otherwise, Now, sir, demand of her and of those who defend her, that she should stand out in the broad light of history, and de- Clare, if not by the Senators that she ought to have, on this floor, by those who league with her, in what that oppression consists; where that injury is inflicted; by whom the blow is struck; what weapon is used in the attack
So much, at least, we have a right to inquire
After we make that inquiry, permit me to add another thing: a State claimintr to be sovereicn and a people part of a great Government ought to act with deliber- ation and dignity; she ought to be able to appeal to ail history for kindred cases of intolerable oppression, and kindred occasions of mao•nani- mous revolution
Sir, we are not unacquainted in this Chamber with the history of revolutions
We very well know that our forefathers rebelled against the domination of the house of Stuart
And why
The causes are as well known to the world as the great struggle by which they maintained the righ t, and the great renown which has forever followed the deed
When Oliver Cromwell broughta traitor- ous, false king, and gave him, "a dim discrowned monarch," to the bloclc, he did it by a solemn judg- ment in the face of man and in the face of -Heaven, avouching the deed on the great doctrine of re volu- tionary right; and although a fickle people be- frayed his memory—although the traditions of monarchy were as yet too strong for the better thought ofthe English people—yetstill, now, here, to-day, wherever the English languao•e is read, wherever that historic glowing story is repeated, the hearts of brave and generous men throb when the deed is avouched, and justify the act
Again : there was a second revolution—the rev- olution of 1688; and why
Because a cowardly, fanatic, bigoted monarch sought, by the exercise 'Of a power to be used through the bayonets of :standing armies, to repress the spirit and destroy the liberties of a free people; because he attempted to force upon them a religion alien to their thought and to their hope; because he attempted to tram- ple under foot all that was sacred in the constitu- Zion of English government
And, sir, in the history of revolutions thcrc arc examples more illustrious still—perhaps the great- est of them all, that revoiution which ended in the "tablishment of the Dutch Republic
My hon- orable and distinguished friend, I know, has read the glowing pages of Motley, perhaps the most accurate, if not the most brilliant, of American historians
I am sure that his heart has throbbed with generous enthusiasm as he read the thrilli1V pages of that story where a great people, led by the heroic house of Orange, pursued, dan- ger, through sacrifice, through blood, through the dcstruction of property, of hcnnes, of families, and the great Indestructible spirit of lib- of all but erty, the tenor of their way to liberty and great- ness and glory at last
Sir, I need not tell him the oppression against which they rebelled; that the intolerable ty ranny under which they groaned was of' itself sufiicient not only to enlist upon their t side and in their behalf all the sympt>thies of civ- ilized Eli rope then , but the sym Fiathies of the whole civilized world as they have read the story since
Yet once morc, in tbc full light of these revolu- tions, our forefathers rebelled against a tyrant, I declaring the causes of the Revolution, proclaim- i ing them to the world in an immortal document that is familiar to us all
We •recognize the right
Why
Because the oppression was intolerable; because the tyranny could not be borne; because the essential rights belonging to every human being were violated, and that continually; and in words more eloquent than I could use, Or than I have now time to quote, Mr
Jefferson proclaimed them to the world, and gave the reasons which impelled us to the separation
Sir, I ask the hon- orable Senator to bring his record of reasons for revolution, bloodshed, and war here to-day, and compare them with that document
If, then, Mr
President, the controversy is not upon the abstract right of secession, nor upon the revolutionary right of secession in a case fit and proper; but If, at last, it narrows itself down into a discussion of the reasons why South Carolina is to revolt, I mopose
to enter with a little minute
ness of detail' into the history of those reasons
I shall find them in several sources: first, chiefest, perhaps best, in the speech now before me of the Senator from Louisiana; secondly, in the very impulsive, very brilliant speech of the honorable Senator from Texas, [Mr
WIGFALL;] and, if I have time to pursue thc search, perhaps in the speech of the excited and excitable Senator from Georgia, [Mr
I VERSON.] The gentleman from Louisiana says that not devoting very much time to the catalogue, and not givirjo• it with any hope that it will avert the issue of arms, he will yet surgest some of the wrongs and outrages which thtit " dreary catalogue" presents, as having hap- pened to the State of South Carolina
Befbre he does so, however, he says that the wron•s under which she groans, the injuries which justify and dernand revolution, are to be found chiefly in a difference of our construction of the Constitu- Sir, is not that a lame and impotent tion
conclusion." I was astonished
have known— again to quote the words of Mr
Webster—I have known, perhaps I may know again shortly, that there are cases when the war does not always come up to the manifesto; butfrom the seriousness with which the distinguished Senator approached the subject, I did not expect to find a qualification which would destroy the import and force of his catalogue altogether
Why, sir, can it be that any man in his sober senses will pretend that there can be cause for revolution, war, because two parties in this Government differ as to their construction of onc article in the Federal Consti- tution
Can that be so
And yet, in the face of carth and Heaven, I recall the fact that
the honorable Senator declares that the principal causes of grievance are to be found in a difference in the construction of one article of the Constitu- tion of the United States
Mr
BENJAMIN
The Senator will pardon *ne
I do not think he will find that in anything I said
Mr
BAKER
Far be it from me to misrepre- sent the gentleman
If [ do not find I will withdraw what I have said
I quote his words, and they were words weli considered, beautifully chosen: Before, however, making any statement—that state
ment to which we have been challenged, and which I shall make in but very few words—of the wrongs under which the South is now suffering, and för which she seeks redress, as the diffculty seems to arise chiefly from n difference in our construction of the Constitution, I desire to read Something else
Now, sir, f ask him whether I am not justified in soying that his main ground of complaint in his catalogue of dreary outrages and intolerable wrongs, is that that catalogue is founded, to use his own words, chiefly upon a difference in the construction of the Constitution of the United States 
Mr
BENJAMIN
The Senator will pardon He stated that I had said they arose from a difference in the construction of one clause of the Constitution
Mr
BAKER
Well, sir, let it be " two rogues in buckram," or seven; the idea is the same
Mr
BENJAMIN
That is it
we have eight or ten grievances; because you all construc the Constitution on the erroneous principles you have announced this mornincy
Mr
BAKER
I herc to show that, so far as the arøumentu of the gentleman from South Carolina concerned , the chief cause of difference does not arise as to the construction of one article am told that, in the heat of the Constitution
of debate, said the Senator from South Carolina
Sir, if made the miståke, of supposmg, with Shakspeare; •thåtz A substitute stiihes.:brigbtly ag Wlzing; Unless king be by." Now, sir, suppose we differed about doZen articles of the Constitution: what "then.i- the catalogue of•wrorvs, and fid, that they must refer themselves prin6ipä-lFj Bat suppose there dre more: what Tbei•e
are some things that do not appear td Strike the honorable Senator- in this connection: For fili- stance: does he remember that although he may have one construction of the Constitåuon•, arid E' may have another, therc is betWéen usasupreme arbiter, and that upon every conceivable about which We may differ, or have diteré(.l', that arbiter has decided always upon one side
To begin: there have been debates-in nthiS Chamber, arid elsewhere; ag to t.he true construction of that clause of theConstitutiozi which requires the ren- dition of fugitive slaves
I will use that -term
There are very distinguished members:nowupon this floor who have argued with- greatgravity and wisdom and research and' eloquence, that-it was intended that the power of
rendition Should bé exercised by States
That question, with ques- tions kindred to it, about which any of' uS may havc differed, has gone before thc Supreme Court of the United States, and has been decided-asainst us, or some of us, and in favor of the constitu- tionality of the law as it now stands; and We have yielded to it, not •a submission, but a better word, obedience
Is not that true
Again, we have differed in late days—and I am here to show, directly, how late that difference is, and I trustl shall show how ill-considered—as to the construction of' the Constitution upon the subjectofthe govcrnrncnt of the Territoricg
That is not a political question mcrely
That is capa- ble of bein« made the subject of a suit in 'law or equity, unaer the provisions of the Constitution
That has gone before the Supreme Court of the United States
There has been, as we all agree, a judgmcnt; there has been, asmost here contend, a decision; there has been, as everybody admits, an opinion
All three have been adverse to us
Is there in that any cause of complaint
There are the two points; and as the honorable Senator asks me questions, I will ask him another rs t.here any other cause of complaint, except un- der these two clauses of the Constitution, be- longirp to the constitutional controversy
The fugitive slave law is one, the riffht to take your slaves into the rcerritories the other
Are there any others
Mr
BENJAMIN
Undoubtedly, Mr
Presi- I thought I enumerated six on Monday
If the Scnator will do me the honor to read the complaints wliieh I made in behalf of the South, he will find them
Then, if those, are not suff- cient, I can furnish halfa dozen more
Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, I may remark that those other causes of grievance which, upon an occasion so solemn as that presented by the Senator the other day, were not mentioned-ih that category, were best left unsurnrned
If they were notofsuffcicnt importancc to be enumcrated then, they ought not to be brought up by way of make- weight how
I hold him to Ins record
Mr
BENJAMIN
Read
Mr
BAKER
1 have now,aslunderstandit, presented two main causes of grievance arising, as he says, out of defective constitutional con- struction ;and, although I see many specifications, understand they are all parts of two charges arisino out of defective construction upon these two points
For ihstance: one of the six charges is, that wc slander you
Surely we do not do that under the Constitution
We slander you, we vilify you, we abuse you, you say
Well, (laughter;] that is not a constitutional difficultv, and if my distinguished friend will look at his " dreary catalogue," he will find that, gave the two which have mentioned, the remainder are but amplification, extension of grievances arising outside of the Constitution, from difference of sentiment, opinions, morals, or habits, and not the cause of constitutional complaint
Therefore I arn not answered when he says, Look at my I repeat once more, to make it still catalogue.' that there are but two constitutional plainer, causes of complaint: one in regard' to then rendi• tion of fugitive slaves, the other the government of the Territories
The difficulties arise out of  228 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 2, those two provisions
All the rest are matters of sentiment, of opinion, of habit; and of morals, which neither Constitutions nor laws can cause or cure
Mr
BENJAMIN
.Mr
President, Sen- ator wants me to answer whether the difficulties of which the South complains, and in consequence of which she refuses any longer to remain con- federated with her sister States at the North, arise exclusively from violations of the rights of the South in relation to her slave property, answer, yes
He may take one, two, three, five, or six, clauses of the Constitution; they all come back to that single point—your constant, persistent ••,var- fare upon our property, instcad of using thc pow- ers of the Federal Government to protect, pre- serve, and cherish it
Mr
BAKER
And thus, Mr
President, after questioning and cross-questioning, and cxcrcising that power of cross-examination which in courts, and I believe elsewhere, we sometimes call the test of truth, I bring the Senator, as I understand him, at last to agree that when hc says in his labored speech the diffculty arises chiefly out of a defective construction of the Constitution by us Black Republicans, or us people of the North, it is to be found upon two subjects: one in relatiorl to the fugitive slave question, and the other to the government of the Territories
Mr
BENJAMIN
Not simply as to fugitive slaves, but all slaves
Mr
BAKER
But that is included in this question of territorial government, of the Wilmot proviso, of the right of the South to take her slaves there, und go where she pleases and as she pleases
These are the uestions— Mr
BENJA%IN
Why, Mr
President, if the Senator will look once again at what I said, he will find that it does not comprise only a reference to such slaves as escape, but he will find that we refer constantly and openly in debatc to orcranized and persistent efforts on the part of entire bodies of people at the North, with the connivance, with the sccrct aid of their fellow-citizens, to rob us of oar property—II ot sir•npEy not
returnino• such slaves as may escape, but organizino• to takc away our property and hide it beyond our reach, and make the fugitive slave law utterly vul- uelcss, even it if was executed, by preventing our discoverincr even where a slave is
Mr
BAkER
Mr
President, 1 reply to that, that is nothing more than brilliant amplification
The point that I pross the Senator upon is this— he hus no reply to it: have you any other diffl- culty with us about constitutional construction except upon two subjects
I do not ask you now whether you complain thut we rob you of your slaves
That is not the point
Do we do it under I repeat: take the constitutional •construction
whole tenor of the spcech, the complaint, the cata- it all ends in this: logue, thc dreary calaloguc that there are dilfin•enc.es of opinion among us of sentiment
You complain of our bad morals and our bad manners; you say wc rob you; you say a cordon free States x,ve intend to establish persistent in around you; you say that •,ve are what we do on this point; but at last, in your better and your Inorc candid moments, you say that the difficulty seems to arise chiefly from a differencc in our eonst.ruction of the Constitution
I add to that, (and you will not contradict the ad- dition,) that it is a differencc in our construction of the Constitution upon two subjects—first, the rendition of fugitive slaves; second, the govcrn- ment of the Territories so as to exclude slavery from those Territories by Lhe power either of' the General Government or the 'l'erritorial Legisla- turc
I think wc arrive clearly at the points to be debated between us
Now, sir, first, of tho fugitive slave law
What is the construction that we trive to the fugitive slave law, of which the Senator c,omnlains
I have already answered that question
-we did in arcument give a construction
were de- feateä
The questi0b1 went before the Supreme Court
We were overruled
We have obeyed that decision loyally ever since
-we have neyer seriously endeavored to repeal it; nor have we as I a party, nor as a North, endeavored to defeat its execution
Nay, if vvre had, that is not within the Senator's counts, because he does not say that the diffculty arises out of malexecution of I the fugitive slavc law; but out of the differences of opinion between us as to the construction of the Constitution
Here I answer wain, and I will quote Mr
Lincoln, about to bc inaugurated as President of these United States—a man who seeks to make his opinions known in all proper ways and upon all proper occasions; a man who, for simplicity of purpose , directness of expression , is not surpassed in this country; a man whose hon- esty has already worthily passed into a proverb
You will find in the history of the debates, un- surpassed in ability in this country, between the distinguished Senator from Illinois, (Mr
DOUG- LAS,] and the President elect, that he was asked, and for obvious purposes, what his opinion was upon this fugitive slave law question, and he re- plied; Question
desire to know whether Lincoln to-day stands, as he did in 1854, in favor of the unconditional re- peal of the fugitive slave law 
.ßlnswer
do 110t now, nor ever did, stand in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave batcs of Lincoln and Douglas, p
83
Is that clear and distinct
And, sir, I echo him, not because he is President, but because he l, who want noth- is honest and wise and truc
incy of him; I, who tun not, and in no sense can over be, dependent on him; I reply with him; I, as a Senator on this floor, repeating the opinion of my constituents, without distinction of party, I, too, say that I am not, have not been, never will be, in favor of the unconditional repeal of the fugitive slave law
Again, sir: since the passage of that law, the Republican party has sprung into existence
W c In one, un- have had two politicai campaigns
tried, unorganized, without reasonable grounds for hope, we astonished ourselves, we astonished In the other, gat.h- the country, by our strength
erin«y together all the irresistible elements of free- dom in the North and West, we have gained a great political triumph, which we intend to use wisely, but which we intend to guard ••.vell
Have we, in any platform, in any resolutions, by any in any way evinced a disposition to repeal bill, that fugitive slave law
Do we not, upon all fit occasions, say that, though inany of us believc it is hard bargain, yet that it is so nominated in the bond, and we will endure it
Now, sn•, when we make t.hesc stat.emonts—we have inade them in the canvass; I make then) deliberately now—what is the reply
[know it of old
Why, it is said, " you-r platfbrm does not propose to repeal the fugitive slave law, there are States which pass personal liberty bills
" Will gentlemen listen to our calm, frank, candid reply
First, the sense of the whole North is opposed to )'lullification, in any way or upon any subiect
MT e will yield obedience—and I have said that it is better word than submission—to any provision of the Constitution of the United Slates, as it is construed by the ultimate tribunal
They have, as we understand it, declared that law to be constitutional, and to that decision we yield
If there be, States which have passed laws in vio- lation of it, preventive of it, to hinder, to defeat, in n) y judgment—and sir, what is to delay it, of infinitely morc consequence, in the judgment of the North and West—those laws ought to bo not because South Carolina threatens; repealed ; not because Louisiana will secede; but, because we desire to yield obedience to those hiellest ob- ligations, rieht and duty, of which I made men- tion in lhc conunence.me,nt ot this arcrurnent
the honorable and distinguished gen- But, sir, tlemai) upon the other side knows very well that debate whether there is very serious and grave those laws ure in any sense unconstitutiona\
We are told that sorne of them we rc Inade before the sAave law, bearing upon other questions arid directed to other objects
We are told that the provisions of many of them are provisions intended to guard and secure personal liberty, in- dependent of any question as to the fugitive slave law
Idut whether chat be so to any extent, or to what extenq we say that if it shall be proved before any cornpetent tribunal, and rnost of au, before the Supreme Court of the United States, that those laws, or all y of them, in any of their provisions, do hinder, deiay, defeat thc exccutlon reform it aftogether.• Sir, speak- of that law, ing in my place, with some knowiedae of" the R.epnl')lican party, speaking by no authority in the world for the President elect, but speaking of him because I have known him f'rom my boyhÖod, or nearly soy I say that, when the tin-te arrives I that he shall b.e inaugurated in this capitai, and exercise in the chair of the Chief Magistrate all the high responsible duties of that offce, he enforce the execution of all the laws of this Gov- ernment, whether revenue or fUgitive slave, or territorial or otherwise, with the whole integrity of his character and the whole power of the Gov- ernment
Now, I ask my distinguished ifiend if that is not a fair, frank reply to all the objections he may make as to differences of construction about the fugitive slave law
Mr
BENJAMIN
If the Senator the answer now Mr
BAKER
Certainly, sir; let the blow now
Mr
BENJAMIN
Itisnot at all satisfactory; not in the remotest degree, Mr
BAKER
My honorable friend will not say that that is a reply
If I were in court, or elsewhere, and not in so grave a body as the Senate of the United States, I would quote two very celebrated lines in reply to that, to the effect that those who suffer from the law do not always havc a good opinion of it; but I refrain
I repeat that, in the judgment of reasonable men, that is an answyer, and a fuli and complete answer to the objection made against us, that you are going to secede because of any difference of opinion be- tween us as to the construction of the provisions of the Constitution and our duty about the fugitive slave law
There are some other observations with which I be(T leave to detain the Senate, however, upon that subject
That can scarcely be considered one of the objcctions; first because the State of South Carolina, herself, through her only authorized expositor, the Charleston Mercury, declares and has declared that she believes the fugitive slave law to be unconstitutional anyhow
One of the most distinguished of her sons, Mr
Rhett, repeats and emphasizes the same remark
A distinguished gentleman, the Senator from Georgia, lately oc- cupying the chair, not now in it, [Mr
IVERSON,] has said lately upon this floor that the South does not complain of any construction which the North gives to that law; nay, more, that the law is well rnade, carefully guarded, just to the South, and so far as the Federal Government is concerned', properly executcd
Now, sir, can that bc the ground of complaint, about which South Carolina is o•oing out
Will slie separate the bonds that have bound us to- gether for morc than seventy years, because she does not think that wre quite perfectly obey a law which she, herself, in the person of her most dis- tinguished servants, declares to be unconstitu- tional
Not so, sir
Or will Georgia follow the illustrious example of South Carolina, and desert the Republic, when her representative on this floor declares that upon that subject the North performs all its obligations
These are questions which I leave to their honor and their dignity to decide
Again , sir, the distinguished Senator from Lou is- iana points out in the dreary catalogue, (and, as hold, it is the chief cause of complaint,) the con- straction which the North gives to the Consl.itu- tion on the subject of the government of the 'Ter- ritories; and the first, or if not the first in that exact charge, first in the general charge—and I will meet it here and now—is that we persistently refuse to consider, or in other and perhaps better words, that wre deny, that slaves arc property
Now that is a very serious ground of conop\aint
It is very persistently liladc
It is very frequently repeated
Nay, morc, I do bc]icvc that there are people who are firmly convinced that that is true; but the honorable Senator from Louisiana ought I believe I
do not mis- not to be one of them
quote you, sir
Mr
BENJAMIN
Docs the Senator deny that that is thc prov)osition manltamed BAKER
i do, sir
Mr
BEINJAiMiN
That is precisely the prop- osition your side of the house voted down our committee
They refused to vote that slaves were property
They voted ao•ainst it
Mr
GA KER
I will meet that directly
not meet ic at this moment, it in sonh
w Ise breaks the iine of thought l.hat I intend to pursue; but if before I close, I fail to allude to it, shall be obliged to the courtesy of the Senator fiom Louisiana to remind me of it again
N•lr
'Webster, a
great authority, in a speech which hc dcåvered upon the bill creating the Ter-  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
229 ritory of Oregon, in which he advocated the inclu- Sion of the Wilmot proviso, and perhaps through whose influence it •was then done, speaking upon this subject of slavery and slave property, held the following language; language which I believed then, and I believe now, embodies the general, I may say the universal, opinion of the Republi- cans, if not the whole North, upon that subject
Mr
DOOLITTLE read, as follows: The southern States have peculiar laws, and' by those laws there is property in slaves
This is purely local
The real Ineaning, then, of southern gentlernen in making this complaint is, that they cannot go into the Territories of the United States carrying with them their own peculiar law, u law which creates property in persons
'l'his, according to their own-statement, is all the ground of complaint they have
Now here, I think, gentlemen are unjust towards -us
How unjust they are, others will judge
Generations that will come after us will judge
It wili not be contended that this sort of personal slavery exists by general kaw
It exists only by local law
I do not mean -to deny the valid- ity of that local law where it is established ; but I say it is, after all, nothing but local law; it is nothing more ; and wherever that local law does not extend, property in per- sons does not exist." Mr
BAKER
Now, sir, 1 submit to the hon- orable Senator from Louisiana that that is a clear exposition of the opinion of what I think I may say is the universal North upon that point
that be the ground of complaint, I proceed to meet it historically and argumentatively
It there be any other ground of complaint upon that, if that bc not clear statement of what hc supposes we really do bclicvc, if we have any other heresy in- corporated with that, which that does not really express, I will wait now for a declaration upon that subject
I take it for granted then, Mr
Pres- idcnt, that that is the cause of complaint that we of the North— Mr
BENJAMIN
It is difficult to fonow linc of argument in this interrupted way; but I will state to the Senator that thc complaint of the South is: that forming a part of one common Gov- ernment, and owning that which was t•ecoffnizcd as property by all the States at the time of l,he formation of the Constitution, the North now un- dertalccs to say that under that Constitution slaves ate not property when found within the iurisdic- tion of the Federal Government outside of the State
We complain that the Federal Govern- ment docs not recognize slaves as property in the Territorics at the samc time that it does recognize slaves as property on the high seas; and we do not understand upon what ground it can be pre- tended that our slaves are property protected by the law of nations, and by the General Govern- mcnt under the law of nations, on the high seas, and not property in the Territories which belong Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, 1 understand that what the distinguished Senator has now' said is nothing more than specifying by items all the causes of complaint which are at last embodied in the original speech to which I am to reply
There is certainly this difference of opinion be- tween us now: we do beiicvc that slavery is the creature of local law, and does not, of its own force and power, extend beyond that jurisdiction
We do believe, when Senators claim the contrary, and insist as a cause of grievance that we do not agrec with them, that they attempt to interpolate a new reading of the Constitution, and violate the cardinal belicfwhich has been entertained in other and better days by all the distinguished statesmen of this country, by every party, by every organ- ization, and beyond that, which is now enter- tained by the whole civilized world
Slavery is the creaturc of local law
When we say that, do we deny that it is property at all
Do we doubt that it can be made thc subject of bargain and sale according to law
Cannot a note ora bond, given in consideration of the purehasc or sale ofa slave, be enforced in the courts ofany free States
Why, sir, the whole extent of our offense is to be found alone In the earnest repetition of thc great doc- trines of civilized humani ty—tho common law, the universal law, from the beginning of the world
I will not believe that, for that offense, the gen- it is an of- tleman would leave us; because, sir, fense not peculiar to us
It docs not originate with honorable and friend from New York, [iMr
SEWARD.] Following his lead, as I have donc for many years with pleasure and with of the Republican party, and find support in the opinions of all parties
Sir, the State of South Carolina has had many distinguished Senators
She has been zealously and ably represented
I propose to show that, as late as 1850, a distin- guished Senator from South Carolina, not now present among us, and whose loss, I have
no doubt, South Carolina has cause deeply to deplore, affrmed in this Chamber the very doctrine on account of which gentlemen now propose to dis- solve this Union
Mr
Butler said, in his speech of February 120850, as follows; and having said that, he was replied to by the distinguished Sen- ator from Illinois, [Mr
DOUGI.As;] both of which I ask leave to read
Mr
DOOLITTLE read, as follows: I wish to ask the Senator from Illinois [Mr
DOUGLAS] whether the South, or any southern member, or anybody else upon this floor, or anywhere else, has introduced a proposition to extend slavery
Has there ever been a prop- osition to extend it
Never; we have never expressed such a wish
We want no extension
Hands off
Let us alone; that is all we ask
Yet it is here asserted, as if it were positively a proposition made by the South, that we want to extend slavery
Sir, there have been too many mnendments to prohibit, but none to extend slavery
Mr
DOUGLAS was glad the Senator from South Caro- His (Mr
D's) constituents lina had asked that question
had believed the South called on us to extend slavery into the 'I'erritories
'I'he impression has unfortunately gone förth in the North, that the South asks the North to comc forward to their aid, and to extend slavery into the Terri- [ have uniformly maintained that the tories now free
South asked no sucti thing as was imputed to them; that they utterly denied it; that they not only expressed no de- sire to do this, but utterly dcnicd that it was in the power of Congress to do it ; that the position of southern gentlemen was that Congress nad no power to legislate on this subject, either iOr or arrainst.." Mr
BAKER
Now, sir, I have a right t•as- sume, as I do believe, that that was the opinion If it be not really and of South Carolina then
truly the opinion of South Carolina now, I appeal " from Philip drunk to Philip sober." Sir, I press the gentleman still further with an authorny which, lately, hc would not have been disposed to deny
I shall read from a speech made by the gentleman who yet, for the good or the cvil of this Republic, presides over its desti- Dies, on the 25th day of January, 1845; not to show so much what the South then believed, as to show what opinions were entertained by the most disti nguished Democrats of the conn try with whom, then, the South was in strict alliance, and whom they rewarded by the highest situations in their gift, as evidence of their approbation of their In 1844, the Demo- fidelity and good service
cratic party, or at least a portion of it, including Mr
Buchanan, then a Senator of the United States, advocated the annexation of Texas on the ground that it would limit and narrosv, instead of extending the institution of slavery
In Mr
Buchanan's spcech of 4th June, 1844, he said: In arriving at the conclusion to support this trcaty, I had to cncounte.r but one serious objection, and this was the question of slavery
While have ever maintained, and ever shall maintain, the constitutional rights of the southern States over their slave property, I yet feel a strong repugnance, by any act of mine, to extend the present lim- its of the Union over a new slaveholding 'l'erritory
After mature reflection
overcame these scruples, and now bciievc the acquisition of Texas will be the means of limiting, not enlarging, the dominion of slavery." Such was the opinion of Mr
Buchanan, now President of these United States
I repeat that I quote the two passages together—one from South Carolina and the other from Pennsylvania; one from Senator Butler, the other from Presi- dent Buchanan; one the leader of the South, the other the leader of tbc Democracy—to show that there Mtas between them then a perfect acqui- escence of opinion upon thc subject; and that that which is called heresy in us now, was in them orthodoxy pure and perfect
But, sir, to rise from the lesser to the greater, to speak of him who, in the hearts of his coun- trymen, was first in honor as in place—Harry of the West—let us see what were the opinions which he expressed upon the subject as late as 1850
Mr
DOOLITTLE read, as follows: Mr
Clay, on the 24th of July, ,1850, said : In uny opinion, therefore
the supposition that the Con- stitution of the United States carries slavery into C,'aliför- supposing her not to be State, is an assu:npt.iotl 1*Vhv, it' the C,on- tally' unwarranted by the Constitution privilege i: bc incompetent for $titution gave the , in fcn•rßing that pride upon most subiects, I have eludinz slavery) which to adopt the provision (ec opinion, followed a {cad still nlorc illustrious t.han 'J.'he C(RlSi-iauion of the U!) i- has in her his own

You cannot put your'
finger On:tbe part of carry {laves from one of the States of the Union tö any Territory of the United States, nor can I admit for single moment that there are any separate or several rights upon the -part of the States, or individual Qfa State,- or any portion of the people of the United States, to carry slaves into the Territories, under the idea that -those Tet- ritories are held in comtnon between the several States
It is joint property, held by a common trustee for the-gen• eral good, and to be administered by the General Govenj- ment, according to its deiiberate judgmenv of what wili best promote the common happiness and prosperity; and do justice to all." Mr
BAKER
Such, sir, was the opinion- of the great leader of the Whig party
I read now to overwhelm, as I trust, the Sena- tor, with authority which cannot be disputed or denied, the opinion of the great leader of the Dem- ocratic party, Mr
Cass
Mr
DOOLITTLE read, as follows: Mr
Cass, November 4, 1854, at Detroit, said ; Thc assumption which I have referred to is, that very is essential to the equal enjoyment of the publie domain
Now, the public do:nnin exists as well in the States as in the Territories, and cvery act of Congress in relation to its sale and settlement is equally in force where ever acre of public land is to be found
'l'here is not ope statute upon this subject which docs.not operate as fully in Ohio as in Oregon
If, therefore, the credit of the United States gives to the slaveholdm• thc right to take his peculiar property to the public dornain, how happens it that the public domain is closed to him the moment u State consti- tution is formed aod slavery excluded from it
Does the constitution of a State overrule and override that of the United States
Such is not the reading o
the general Con- stitution, which discloses its own supremacy upon all mat.„ ters committed to it over the constitutions of the States
Either, theretorc, this claim of the expansive powcrof sla- very over the public domain is unfoundcd, or slaves *nay be taken to Ohio, or to any other of the new States where any portion of the public land is yet unsold." Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, 1 have now quoted gcntlemcn who, in tho modern phrase, arc, as I apprehend, to bc classed as " conservative" By the by, I do not know but that ought to apologize for the use of that word conserva- I do not profess very wcli to understand ti ve
I apprehend that whatever we believe is con- it
servative, and whatever somebody else believes I am reminded of tbe old lines arising is not
out of the Jacobitc controversy: God bless the faith ; God bless the faith's defender ; God bless—no harm in blessing—the Pretender ! Who the Pretender is, arid who the Kiug— God bless my soul, thaPs quite another thin«." And I apologize, therefore, for saying conserv- ativc
They are better than that
They are men ; great, able, wise, true, devoted to the country, the whole country, its Constitution, its Rlory and where neither malice nor envy can reach him more
He has gone to that rest amid the tears and prayers of generations crowded around him to the last
The other has shown in a great crisis that he loved his country more than he loved either State, or place, ot• power, or party
May his memory remain green in the American heart forever and forever ! Mr
KING
If the Senator will give way—as he has already spoken a long time—and in order that he may finish his speech -to-morrow, I will move that the Senate adjourn
Mr
POLK
What is that motion
Mr
KING
The Senator-gives way to a mo- tion to adjourn, so as to complete his speech to- morrow
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
BIGLER in the chair.) The question is on the motion to ad inurn
Mr
BROWN
Perhaps it is not proper fm me to interfere in a matter of this sort The PRESIDING OFFICER
A simple tion to adjourn cannot be debated
Mr
BKOWN
The Senator from Illinois, now absent, [Mr
DOUGLAS,] proposes to take the floor to-morrow; and if we adjourn now, it neces- sarily interferes with that arrangement; and un- less the Senator from Oregon is unable td go on, I am unwilliw to assent to the motion
Mr
KING.D The Senator, 1 understand, will be able to c.omp]cte what he has to say in about I trust thc Senator will pursue the Ordi- an hour
nary course in this matter
The Senator from Oregon has already spoken over two hours, The PRESIDING OFFICER
The motion  230 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 2, refer myself entirely to its judgment, not holding of course, no interest whatever in it
If it is the to ådjourn cannot be debated
The Chair, how- it a matter of complaint if thcy should not
deem wish of the Senate to go into executive session, II I have no objection
ever, will hear a suggestion
it fit
to hear me at all
Mr
POLK
I merely wish to suggest that it Mr
CLINGMAN
Then, if it be understood will be probably better to have an executive ses- Sion
Mr
KING
Thero is no objection to that
Mr
POLK
A message has just come in from the President
Mr
KING
Then I will withdraw the mo- tion to adjourn, and move to go into executive session
'ithePRESIDING OFFICER
The motiofi to adjourn is withdrawn, and the Senator from New York moves that the Senate proceed to the con- sideration of executive business
That is the question now before the Senate
SURRENDER OF PROPERTY TO THE STATES
Mr
DAVIS
motion isput,/should like to oflö:• a resolution, which can be read for information, and laid on the ta ble
r I'hc Chair The PRESIDING OFFICER
hears no objection
T hc resolution will be road
The Secretary read it the first time
It is en- titled "A joint resolution (S
.No
53) in relation to the militia of the States, the condition of tbc forts, magazines, arsenals, and dock-yards, military power, withdrawal of troops from garrisons on the.application of a State, and the récognition of the right of State to keep troops and ships of war by proclamation of the, President
" Mr
KING
The Senator proposes, as I un- derstand, to let that resolution lie over
Mr
DAVIS
That pi•inted, and lie on the table
The PRESIDING OFFICER
That will bc understood as the sense of the Senate, unless objected to
The resolution was ordered to lic on the table, and be printed
ADJOURNMENT
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question now recurs on thc motion of the Senator from York, that the Senate proceed to the con- sideration of executive business
Mr
CLINGMAN
desire simply to say that I do not like to do anything discourteous to the Senator from Oregon, [Mr
BAKER ; ] but when the Senator frolü Illinois [Mr
DOUGLAS] left an I suppose there is hour since, he said to me a distinct understanding illat I am to have the I told him I so regarded it
floor toemorrow 
Well," said he, hope nothing will occur to prevent my occupying it." shall not consent, therefore, or at least I think it is not ji.1St to him, to agree to this motion
I think, after havincr given up thc floor to-day, he should not bc pre- vented from occupying it to-morrow
If thero can be an understanding that the Senator from Oregon will finish the day after to-morrow, I will very cheerfully agree to it
Mr
LATHAM
is day
Mr
CLINGMAN
well, the day when the Senate next meets
Mr
KILNG

I apprehcnd there will be no dif- ficulty upon the part of' the Senator froin Illinois, Frorn conversution which I have who is abscnt
heard, that is my opinion
The Senator from Oregon wili occupy but an hour, leaving the resi- due of the day to the Senat.or from Illinois
ig very possible that the Senator from Illinois will desire more time than a single day
If so, I shall be willing to give it to IlilN
Lct this discussion go on
I arn sorry to sce gentlemen on the other side so sensitive
Mr
CLINGMAN
There is no disposition on this side of the Senatc to avoid hearing either the Senator from New York, or his friend; but as a matter of common justice to the Senator frorn Illinois, who had the iloor to-day , as he supposed , and who yielded it with a distinct uridorst,anding of the Senate that he could occupy it to-morrow, I make this statement
My vote will be in ac- cordance with that understanding
Mr
BAKER
sure, if the senate think proper to indulge me until to-morrow, in the courtesy to which L have, perhaps, very little claim, that I can finish all I propose to say, as fuliy as it is in my power to do, in about an hour
I do not believe that my distinguished friend from Illinois, not now present, will make any objec- tion to that
But, professing myself quite igno- rant of the rules of the Senate and of the manner that the Senator from Illinois is entitled to the floor to-morrow, I have no objection if he volun- tarily yields the floor to the Sénator Oregon
I have no more interest in the speech of one than of the other; but, as I happen to sit next the Sen- ator from Illinois, and he made this statement to me, I felt it due to him that I should give it to the Senate
Mr
KING
No such understanding, of course, can exist
I apprehend that the Senator from Illi- nois will not havc the slightest objection to the Senator from Oregon completing what he has to sav to-morrow
PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on thc motion to proceed to the consideration of executive business
The motion was not agreed to; there being, on a division—ayes 21, nocs 22
Mr
KING
made the motion to go into ex- ecutive session on the suggestion of gentlemen on the other side
I will nov,r renew the motion that tbc Senate adjourn
Mr
TRUNIBULL
1 hope not
I will ask my friend to withdraw it
I desire to renew the motion to go into executive session
Mr
KING
For that purpose 1 yield
The, PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair understands the Senator from Illinois to renew the motion for an executive session
Mr
TRUMBULL
Yes, sir; do Mr
FESSENDEN
1 hope 1 may be allowed a single word
I cannot believc that «yentlerncn on the other side will so far depart from the uni- forni custom o
the Senate, as to dcny to a new Senator, who says he has spoken untll hc is ox- hausted, and has no longer the physical power to continue, the opportunity to continue his speech to-rnorrow; for that is the simple question
Mr
DAVIS
What is the question 
Mr
FESSENDEN
The question is, whether we shall go into executive session; the reason being that the Senator who now occupies the floor says hc is unable to proceed from exhaustion
Mr
DAVIS
Let him go on to-morrow
Mr
FESSENDEN
Ündoubtedly
Thut is the reason why the motion is made; but it is said he cannot continue to-morrow
Mr
DAVIS
I understand the Senator from North Carolina to put in a claim for thc Senator from Illinois
Mr
FESSENDEN
Undoubtedly
Mr
DAVIS
I am very sure that the Senator from Illinois would waive any claim to thc floor under the circumstances
Mr
FESSENDEN
That is what 1 was about to say
Mr
DAVIS
If the Senator is unable to go on, I do not suppose there will be any objection to an adjournment
Mr
FESSENDEN
The motion was made with that view, and I was about to obscrvc Mr
DAVIS
1 did 'near I am sure my friends here, if they did not vote
have voted the proposition down, (for I did not even observe
that,) could not have understood that the Senat.or frorn Oregon said he was ex- hausted, aud unable to go on
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 trust not
I presume they could not have understood it
Mr
IVIASON
Will thc Senator indulge me a momcnt
The motion was made to go into ex- ecutive session, and it was overruled
I think the Senator is wrono• if he interprets that negative vote to anv intimation of a purpose not to hear the Senator frorn Oregon
There aro other rea- sons, perhaps, for not
goinffintoexoc.utive session
journlnont, will vote for it
Mr
FESSENDEN
willing vote Shail be taken without further rctnark
about to say, when the Senator from Mississippi interrupted me the purpose of explanation, Mr
FESSENDEN
Certainlv we have no objection
Mr
POLK
Mr
President, I move that the Senate adjourn
Mr
LANE
Oh, no; Ict us go into executive session 
Several SENATORS

There is a commu- nication from the President
Lct us know what Mr
SLIDELL
I called for the yeas aud nays 011 the motion to adjourn 
Mr
LANE
I Will remind the Chair tllat the Senator from Louisiana called for a division on the motion to adjourn, and the quest.ion wns not decided so as to make it certain
I hope we shall have a division, to sce whether the Senate is not inclined to adjourn
.Nffr
SEWARD
Lot us have the question on the motion to adjourn by yeas and nays
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair had decided tiltu question
He certainly did not hear the Senator from Louisiana
Mr
SLIDELL
1 think 1 appealed in tilne
It is a matter of perfect indifference to me
I ask for the yeas and nays on the question of' goincr into executive session
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to adjourn, or to go into executive session 
'Mr
SLIDELL
On the question of adjourn- I am perfectly willing to have the vote taken on that
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will entertain that -call on the question of ad- journmcnt

I beg not to be counted
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- dcrstood the Senator from Louisiana to call far the yeas and nays
Thcy were not ordered
He then called for a division, and the Chair accord- ingly is making the division on the motion to adjourn
'Mr
SEWARD
Let us have the question over It is not understood
I thought it was a call for the yeas and nays
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will state the question
It is moved that the Senate do now adjou rn

still must raise a point of hc gentlenlan from Indiana [Mr
DA- offers his resolution
Objection is made, nnd he then moves to suspend the rules to enable him to offer it for consideration now
The Flouse act, upon that
Mr
QUA RLES
I rise to a point of order
Does thc gentlemar) from Ohio appeal from the decision of the Chair
Otherwise, debate is not in ordcr
Mr
SHERMAN
1 do take an appeal purpose of submitting my point
My point is: that the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
DAF1s] was submitted to the House, and the House suspended the rules for the purpose of considering it, 'I'hey acted upon and refused to order the previous qucstion
The gentleman from Indiana [Mr
I-IOLMAN] then offered an amend- ment
It was read for information, and the House has had two separate votes to adjourn with the •resolution pending before the House
It seems to me, the gentleman from Indi- ana cannot withdraw his resolution without the consent of the House; and I think it right that we should have a vote upon the proposition
I therefore respectfully take an appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr
BOCOCK
An appeal has been taken by the gentleman from Ohio, and I wish to make a few remarks in answer to the remarks made by him upon this question of ordcr
Asl understand it, Mr
Speaker, the proposition of tl'1C gentleman from Indiana behind mc [Mr
DAvrs] was to submit his resolution
He had no right, as thc gentleman from Ohio seems to think, to offer any rcsolution at all
When the gentleman from In- diana rose to ask the leave of the I-louse to offer his resolution, it was objected to, and the ques- of thc suspension of the rules was upon the point whcthcr the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
DAVIS] should be pcrmittcd to offer his resolu- tion
The rules were suspended, and the gen- tleman from Indiana was allowed to present his resolution
Being thus presented, it stood pre- cisely as if it had been offered by the genttmnan from Indiana at a time x.vhen it was in order to offcr resolutions
r I'he suspension of thc rules was not that the proposition should bc then con- sidered, but siznply that the gentleman from In, diana should have leave, then, out of order, to submit his resolution
I say it stood before the I-louse precisely as a resolution would havc stood, öflln•ed by the gentleman frorn Indiana or any other member, at a time when it was in order to offer resolutions
At the time that the proposition for suspending the rules was pending, the gentleman from Indi- ana over the way [Mr
HOLMAN] rose to offcr his resolution as a substitute for the proposition of the gentleman from Indiana behind me, [Mr
DAV!s.] It was not then in order, because the question had not then been dccidod whether the rules should be suspended to allow the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
DAv1s] to come before the I-louse
The rules were suspended to allow Mr
DAvrs's resolution to come before thc House; and he, immediately, and before any tion
Another gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] then took the floor, and offered his res- olution as a substitute; and while he had the floor, the first gentleman from Indiana [MI'
DA- VIS] rose and asked to withdraw his resolution
He had no right to do so, inasmuch as bis col- league [MI'
HOLMAN] had thc floor
Mr
BOCOCK
Does the gentleman mean to say that the act
of offering an amendment was action by thc House 
Mr
SHERMAN
The House had already acted upon the resolution by refusing to second the previous question
The other gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] then got the floor, and could not be deprived of his right to submit any proposition he might choose to submit
No man could take the floor till he had vacated it
After that, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
Dnvzs] might, if he chose, have endeavored to withdraw his resolution
Mr
BOCOCK
Allow me to call attention to the precise wording of the rule: After a motion is stated by the Speaker, or read by the Clerk, it shall be decnled to be in the possession of the
House, ; but may be withdrawn at any tinnc beförc a deeis•- ion or amendment," That does not mean thc simple offcring of an amendment, but the adoption of an A n y member can offer an amendment; but the mover ofa proposition cannot be deprived o
his right to withdraw it
When the rule says " be- före amendment," it means before any amend- ment is acrreed to
I las there been any decision on tl')e resolution, or any amendincnt agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
1 think that the on the 151st page of the Manual settles this matter: A vot.e on a rnotion to suspend the rules cannot bc reconsidered." " Where the proposition, if he fails to submit it, another Inen)ber Illay do so." Now, to avoid all controversy, I sul.)mit the proposition offered by the gentleman from Indi- the rules for the purpose of actintr on this partic- uhu• proposition
The SPEAKER
The question involved here is somewhat new
The Chair docs 110t recollect that any question of thc kind has arisen since he has occupicd thc chair
But the (Jhair'.s con- struction of the rule is what has been proposition föramendmentoranvsabstitute could given
The Chair docs not see what other con- be offered, asked that the previous question should I struction can bc given to it
'I'he rule is ! his: be sustained upon his resolution
It was not sus- tained
The proposition of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] would then have been in order, if Mr
Davrs's resolution had remained before the House
But before the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] had reached the Speaker's chair, Mr.I)Av1s rose in his place and withdrew his resolution
So, then, i the proposition of the gentleman from Ohio [MI'
SHERMAN] is incorrect in two particulars
In the first place, it is a mistake to suppose that the rules were suspended to require the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
DAVIS] to bc now acted upok')
The rules were suspended merely to allow him to offer the resolution
In the sec- ond place, the proposition of the gentleman is incorrect in this particular: the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] was not read after it was in order to offer it
He did I have it read before it was in order to offer it, and before the rules were suspended
After the rules were suspended, the gentlenlan from Indi- ana [Mr
HOLMAN] rose and offered a substitute; but before that substitutc was read at the Clerk 's desk, the other gentleman from ludiana [Mr
DAVIS.] had withdrawn his proposition
That proposition hacl bccn before the I-louse
The only question was, whether thc previous question should be seconded upon it
That failed
That is not considered definitive or decided acti01'1 of thc House
Therefore, I say, that before there was any action had by the House upon the prop- osition itself, thc gentlen-latl from Indiana [ MI'
DAY1s] withdrew it
Mr
SHERMAN
It to me that this is I n very simple proposition
The only question is this: has the I-louse taken any action on the res- olution offered by the gentlen)an from Indiana, After a motion is stated bv t.be Speaker, or re;ul by the Clerk, it shall be deemed to "be in the possession ot• I-louse; but may be withdrawn at any time beCorc a de- cision or amendment." Now, when the rules are suspended, it is for the purpose of placing the resolution in posses- Sion of the House
The suspension of the rules can have no further effect than that
Now the question arises on withdrawincr it
M/ hen may it be withdrawn
ft may bc ' withdrawn at
any time before a decision or amendment." The Chair supposes that the word " decision moans be- fore the resolution is decided, and that the word " amcndrnent, ' in the same connection, means be- fore there is any decision on an anu•ndment
The merc offering of' an amendmcnt, the Chair sup- poses, has no effect wrbatcvcr
Therefore, accord- incr to the construction which the Chair places on the rule,the Chair is bound by the decision already made
Mr
SHERMAN
1 now, under leave, offer the resolution submitted by the gentleman from li'ldiana, [Mr
DAvrs,] and claim the right to do so
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 rise to a point of order
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr
SHER- MAN] is out of ordcr in attempting to introduce a resolution of this descri ption at this time
fer to the decision to which he has directed the attention of the Chair and of tbc House
The SPEAKER
The Chair should be glad to hear distinctly the proposition of the gentleman from Ohio
Mr
SHERMAN
At the first session of Con- gress, this very point was dccided: that when the House suspends its rules for the introduction of a particular proposition, and when the metnber who submitted the proposition withdraws it, any [Mr
that it has
It suspended other member can submit the proposition, and de- the rules to enable him to introduce it
He in- mnnd a vote upon it
I therefore renew the propo- troduced it, and moved the previous question
si lion of the gonJleman from Indiana, [Mr
IDA vis 
] The House refused to second the previous ques- Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 raise a point of  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
233 order on that proposition
My point is based on the decision to which the gentleman from Ohio has directed attention
That decision is to the effect that when the rules are suspended to enable a member to submit a particular proposition, if he fails to submit it, another member may do so
The gentleman from Indiana did not fail tb submit his proposition
He did submit it
It was before the House; and he afterwards withdrew it, as he had a right to do
The SPEAKER
The Chair adheres to the opinion which it has already given
There being no decision on the resolution or on an amend- ment, the resolution may be withdrawn; and the resolution having been withdrawn, the amend- ment proposed by the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
HOLMAN] falls with it
The Chair does not see that the point made by tho gentleman from Ohio has any application to such a case
arneodmcnt be fairly before the House, and the tnover of it rises and wishes to withdraw it, then the rule provides that another gentleman may re- new it
But if the original resolution be with- drawn, then the whole matter fails
Mr
SHERMAN
r demand a vote upon the original resolution, on the precedent which I send to the Clerk 's desk
Mr
QUARLES
1 ask the gentleman from Ohio if he has withdrawn his appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr
SHERMAN
I have not withdrawn it
Mr
QUARLES
Then it is not in order for the gentleman to bring forward any other propo- sition until the appeal shall have been acted upon
The SPEAKER
The Chair desires to hear the precedent referred to by the gentleman from Ohio
The Clerk read, as follows: A motion was made by Mr
BOON that the rule be again suspended, to enable Mr
STEWART, who intimated a wish to do so, to rnake a motion that the said resolution do lie on the table
And, on the question, Shali the rule bc suspended for tbc purposc aforesaid 
" " It passed in t.he affinnative ; two thirds voting therefor
"A Inotion was then made by Mr
STEWART, that the said do lie on the table
"And before the question was put thereon, Mr
STEWART withdrew his said motion
" The inotion fhat the said resolution, and the arnend- Inent
proposed by Mr
CORWIN, do lie on the table, was then renewed bv Mr
MOORE ; and an inquiry was made whether the rnofion of Mr
MOORE could be received with- out aoain suspending thc rule, 'l'he SPEAKER (Mr
HUBBARD acting) decided that the suspension of the rule was for the purpose of receivin€r a motion LO lay the resolution on the table, and to come U) a decision on that motion, and it was immaterial by whorn the motion might be made ; and that the motion made by Mr
MOORE would, therefore, be entertained
From this decision Mr
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS appealed to the House, on the ground that
the 'notion was to suspend the rule for thc purpose of enabling Mr
STEWART to Inove that the resolution do lie on the tabic, and that, Mr
STEW- ART having made his said motion, and withdrawn it, it was necessary that the rule should bc again suspended, before the said motion could be renewed by any other member
Aud, after debute on t.he appeal, Mr
MOORE withdrew his motion that the said resolu- lion and aencndment do lie on the table
" An inquiry was then Inade of the Chair, whether the witlidrtuval of thc motion t.hat the said resolution do lie on the table sct aside the question on the appeal by Mr
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
The SPEAKER dccided that the appeal did not fan by Lhe withdrawal of the motion that the resolution do lie on the table, and that the question on the appeal was the question then pending before the House
Mr
VAN HOUTEN then renewed the motion that the said resolution and amendment do lic on the table
And the question was then put on the appeal moved by Mr
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, viz: 'Shall the decision of the Speaker stand as the judgment of the House And passed in the aflinnative—yeas 150, nays 13." Mr
SHERMAN
That is directly in point; and it was even a stronger case, for that was a proposition submitted the third time.•• In this case, It is only proposed to submit it for the second time
Mr
BOCOCK
Thc gentleman from Tennessee has raised a point of order, that nothing can be before the I-louse at this time except the appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr
SHERMAN
withdraw my appeal, and now submit the
proposition of the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr
DAY1s,] which has been withdrawn
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM
of the rlouse to Lhc report in the Daily Globe of Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I move to suspend the rules for the purpose of introducing the resolution
The question was taken; and the rules were sus- pended." The very purpose for which the rules were sus- pended, was to enable the gentleman from Indiana to introduce that resolution, and not to enable any Mr
LOVEJOY
1 understood the purpose of suspending the rules was to enable the resolution to be introduced, without any reference to the person introducing it
Mr
BOCOCK
Do I understand that there is an appeal pending
Mr
SHERMAN
I have withdrawn my ap- peal, and I do not understand that there is any appeal pending
I again offer the resolution of- fered on Monday last by the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr
DAVIs.] Mr
BOCOCK
1 raise a question of order upon that
Mr
GROW
In order that we may know precisely the state of the question upon which the gentleman from Virgima raises a point of order, I ask the Chair to state it
The SPEAKER
The gentleman from ln- diana [Mr
DAVIS] having withdrawn his resolu- tion, offered under a suspension of the rules on Monday last, the gentleman from Ohio now pro- poses to offer the proposition of the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr
IIOLMAN,] by way of amend- ment
Mr
SHERMAN
The Chair did not under- stand my proposition
I offer a.ffain the resolu- tion offered and withdrawn by Mr
IDA vis, of Indiana
I renew the fesolution in accordance with the precedent which I have cited
I do not offer the amendment proposed by Mr
HOLMAN, but the original proposition
Mr
KUNKEL
1 desire to call the attention of the gentleman from Ohio to the difference there is between the precedent read at the Clerk 's desk and the case now before the House
Mr
SHERMAN
should be very glad to hear the difference, for I confess I cannot see any
Mr
KUNKEL
I ask the attention of the gentleman from Ohio ar,d of the Chair to this, to me, very clear distinction
There the motion was to suspend the rules to enable the mover t.o lay on the tablc tho proposition before the House
The rules •were suspcndcd to enable this inciden- tal rnotion to be made relative to a main proposi- lion which was before the House
The Chair, perhaps properly, decided that, that incidental motion having bcen withdrawn, it was competent for any other gentleman to renew it, the main question being pending before the House
But, in this instance, the main question having, under another mile, been withdrawn, the gentleman from Ohio desires to renew it, It is clearly a case dis- tinct from the one cited as a precedent
Mr
BOCOCK
I believe I have the floor; and I rise to a question of order
• I submit that the gentleman from Ohio cannot submit again the res- olution submitted and withdrawn by the gentle- man from Indiana
I think the gentleman from Maryland, to some extent, is correct in saying that the two cases are not similar; and I think I can show that fact to the satisfaction of the Chair and of the gentleman from Ohio, if I can have their attention
I believe the decision of
the Chair in the case referred to by the gentleman from Ohio was not a correct decision in the first place
It has never I been reaffirmed
It was made years acro; and no decision, from that time to this *can be found of a similar character
I, for once in my life, find myself agreeing with the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts who then held a seat in the House, and who took an appeal from the decision of the Chair
The decision on that occasion was fining it to the cases to which•it was intended -to apply, and allowing it to,go no- -fürthor
What was the proposition then
It was, that a propor sitiön bemg before the House, the rules be -sus* pended for the purpose of allowing urnotionto be made affecting that proposition, which motion was not otherwise in order
The principal •prop• osition '•,vas then ponding before the House, and the question was merely whether this , Ör some other motion should be made in relation to it
The motion it was desired to make—to lay on the table—was not subject to amendment
e Now, the gentleman from Ohio, who is a fair- minded man, will not •deny that a motion to lay on the table, under the circumstances, is a motion involving a principle entirely distinct from .-this proposition to introduce a resolution, the subject of which is not before the House
The decision now sought by the gentleman from Ohio to be made is an enlargement of the decision thén made
That vvas a motion that could not be amended; while the gentleman from Ohio seeks, under cover of the resolution that he desires torenew, to adopt an amendment which is an entirely distinct prop-• osition
And I ask the attention of the Speaker and the attention of the House to this point: I think the present diffculty grows out of a mis- conception of the purpose for which the rules of the House are suspended
The suspension of the rules is allowed merely in order that a propo- sition maybe brought before the House
As 1• have already Stated, the gentleman from Indiana —and I invite attention to the point—had no right, without a suspension of the rules, to bring for- ward his proposition
The rules were suspended to allow him to bring it forward
He did bring it forward
The moment the proposition was in the possession of the House, that moment the question ofa suspension of the rules was " clean gone," and had no more to do with the prqposie fion submitted by the gentleman from Indiana than if there had been no suspension of the rules moved 
Understand my point
I say that it was in order for the gentlemen from Indiana too present his resolution; but objection being made, it was necessary for him to procure a suspension of the rules before his resolution could be introduced
The rtlles were suspended; and under thåt sus- pension of the rules, the gentleman from Indiana presented his resolution
The instant the rules were suspended, and the resolution was before the House, that instant the question of the sus- pension of the rules was " clean gone." That question was no more before us; and the proposi- Oon stood precisely as if there had been no sus- pension of the rules asked for and granted
Now, sir, the precedent cited by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr
SHERMAN] enlarges and varies that meaning of the suspension of the rules
I say that the gentleman from Indiana [Mr
DAYIS] did make the motion for a suspension of the rules; did submit his proposition under a suspension of the rules; and that when that proposition -was pending before the House, the question of how it came before the House was no longer a matter for our consideration
It was before the House, in the possession of the House; and being before the House, and in the possession of the House, the gentleman from Indiana, who had submitted it, withdrew it, as he had the right to do
Next, let me inquire, how do you get the prop- osition of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr
SHER- MAN] before the House
The thing proposed to be done under the suspension of the rules, asked for by the gentleman from Indiana, has been done the purpose which he sought on Monday last has been accomplished
The gentleman from In- diana, [Mr
DAY1s,] who asked for a suspension of the rules, did what he had a right to do; and now, two or three days having elapsed, the gen- tleman from Indiana, in pursuance of authority not mado by the regular Speaker of the House
granted him under the rules, comes forward and It was made a member temporarily occupying the withdraws his resolution
The gentleman from Chair, and we know how' often questions of order Ohio [Mr
SHERMAN] claims thc right to bring are decided by merc questions of party suggestion that proposition again before the House
In the case alluded to by the gentleman from, Ohio, the or feeling
But admitting, for tho sake of argument, that question before the House was on a motion to decision to he can•ect, I hold that it does not a_p
lay upon the t.able
The motion to lay upon t}'iC it is a principle which wili not table did not affect the proposition whether the ply to this case

 234 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 2, The question now proposed by the gentleman from Ohio is, that upon a leave granted to the gentleman from Indiana—upon a privilege exer- cised by the gentleman from Indiana, and which he has renounced altogether by withdrawing his resolution—he (the gentleman from Ohio) shall be enabled to bring a new subject before the In the case alluded to, the subject was House
before the House
Now there is no subject be- fore the House
And the gentleman from Ohio cannot, in all the records of Congress, find one case where it was permitted to a member who had not asked a suspension of the rules to bring any distinct proposition before the House not already before it
And especially is the gentleman from Ohic wrong when hc wishes to bring one question before the House with the view of get- tnncr an entirely different one acted upon
As it is, K hold his motion to be out of order
Mr
GOOCH
This seems to me, Mr
Speaker, to be a very plain question— Mr
BOCOCK
I hope the gentleman from There is another Massachusetts will allow me
point that I would like to suggest in connection with the rernarks I havc already submitted
It may be that there were considerations influencin« and controlling the Chair when the rules were sus- pended which have no application to the decision which it is his duty now to make
You will ob- serve that the motion was made and agreed to for a suspension of the rules on a day when it was in In tkie case referred order to suspend the rules
to a gentleman moved to suspend the rules with a view to submit a motion to lay upon the table
That was withdrawn, and it was in ordcrforuny gentleman ao•ain to move a suspension of the rules in order to (yet in a motion t') lay upon the table
That is not the case here
The gentleman from Indiana, on a day when the motion was in order, moved to suspend the rules, and, under the ope ration of a suspension of the rules, submitted a In the exercisc ofthe privilege cra•an ted resolution
to h un under that suspension of the rules, he cornes forward and withdral.vs his resolution
' r he gentlernan from Ohio, on a duy when it is not in order to suspend the rules, seeks to accmnplish a suspension of the rules
In that view, then, the precedent whicl'l has been cited and read fron'l the Clerk's table does not apply
I hold thatiÜis not in order for the gentleman from Ohio to subinit the resolution
Mr
GOOCH
Mr
Speaker, the gent,lcrnan from Virginia to say that, in the case which has been referred to, the subject-rnattcr -was If the subject was pending before the House
before thc House, why was a suspension of thc in order to reach it
rules ncccssnr Mr
BOC08K
'I'he suspension was moved order to enable a motion to lay upon the table to be nitride
which that precedent has been reversed
His is If the Chair desires to hear further debate, cer- not the way to meet the question
The decision tainly I shall not interpose; but unless he does, has once been made and sustained as the decision of the House; and it is of authority as a prece- dent, unless the gentleman can show that at a sub- sequent period the House reversed it
Mr
BOCOCK
I do not take the floor to speak again on the point, but only to respond to the gentleman from Massachusetts, that it has fallen within my experience frequently to see propositions thus introduced and withdrawn, and i do not remember that any one thought enough of that old precedent to bring it forward and make a• question on it until the honorable gentleman from Ohio brought it up this morning in the exer- cisc of his ingenuity
Mr
GOOCH
The gentleman knows very well, when a member asks for a suspension of the rules, that it is usually because he has a par- ticular object to accomplish—he desires to get a vote of' the House on a particular proposition
If ho withdraws it, it is usually the case that nobody else cares for the matter and lets it pass over
That is not the case herc
The House wants to act on the subject introduced under a suspension of the rules
Mr
SHERMAN
think the argument on this matter is exl-aaustcd
It seems to me that thc reason for the precedent is plain and obvious
A gentleman offers a resolution, and no action is had on it
The rules give him the right to with- draw his resolution
That is right enough
here two thirds of the House suspended the rules
W bat for
Merely to enablc a particular gentle- It is to man to offer a resolution
Not at all
enablc the House to conÅider a certain proposi- tion
This House, by a vote of two thirds, re- solved that they would consider these resolutions
r l'hcy resolved that on Monday, and those reso- lutions now come up in the regular order of busi- r Ilhe House, by that two-thirds vote, re- solved not merely whether Mr
DAv1s, of Indiana, shall offer them, whether Mr
SHERMAN, of Ohio, shall offer them, but that the Housc shall now consider them
It seems to me it is a perfectly the House clear and obvious proposition that, having determined by a two-thirds vote to consider these resolutions, they are before the House, and that no member can withdraw them
According to this rule, the House has a right to consider them, and any member has a right to demand a vote upon them
I hope, therefore, we shall have the decision of the Speaker, without further de- bate

f'rorn lie-forc the House
who moved it cannot withdraw it if the House de- sires to act on it; and even allowing the gentle- man from Indiana can withdraw it, it is in order 'l'hat for tho gentleman from Ohio to renew it

Mr
HOUSTON
1 desire to say that unless subject without another suspension of thc rules
It semns to that
this is precisely parallel to the Chair wants to hear further debate, I would I propose that the Chair shall give his decision before the debate proceeds further
The SPEAKER
Thefloorwasgiven to the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania, and the Chair would be glad to hear any remarks he has to make
Mr
GROW
I have but one word to say
This is a question which could arise but seldom in the course of leoislation, and therefore there would be but few precedents, and that is the rea- son, as referred to by the gentleman from Vir- ginia, why but few cases are found applicable to it
We have but one day in the week on which we can move to suspend the rules, and that of it- self would make cases of this kind of rare occur- rence
But when the rules are suspended to re- ceive any proposition, you receive the proposition subject to all such amendments as are germane; so that the point which has been made, that the rules were suspended to receive the proposition, not for the purpose of acting upon it, but for the pur- pose •of having it amended, amounts to nothing
We have frequently suspended the rules to re- ceive a bill appropriating lands for a railroad in a particular section, and it has beén amended by putting half a dozen other railroads to it
The Chair has always held that any amendment ger- mane to the proposition might be received under a suspension of the rules
Therefore this case is divested of all trouble in reference to the point raised by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
Bo- in relation to amending it
The only point is: can the gentleman renew' a proposition which the rules have been suspended to receive, and which has been withdrawn by the gentleman who proposed it, after such suspension of the rules
Now, the precedent which has been cited by the gentleman from Ohio seems to be precisely applicable to this case
The gentleman from Virginia [Mr
BococK) did not seem to deny that, but questioned the correctness of the decis- ion, und argued that even if the decision vvere to taken as precedent, it ought not to be fol- lowed
Now, when the rules are suspended to and being received, the receive n proposition, House has voted to sustain the previous ques- tion, there can be no question that the gentleman could not withdraw the proposition
W c took a vote in this case upon seconding the previous question
If it had been carried, Che proposition could not have been withdrawn
But it was car- ricd in the necrativc, and the question is, whether a action is thc same as an affirmative one
In ordinary legislation, we know that where a proposition is withdrawn, other gentlemen may renew it; and now I ask whether, where a gen- tleman withdraws resolution received under a suspension of the rules, another gentleman can- not renew it as the mover himself might do 
Mr
HOUSTON
I-le cannot do it
Mr
GROMI
That is the point in issue
I ask if the gentleman from Indiana could renew it, whether another member might not
Gcntlemcn have argued this point as if the right to offer the proposition for which the rules were suspended was a personal privilege
Now, it can make no difference, whoever offers it
There is no per- sonal consideration about it whatever
The ques- tion is simply whether, after the rules have been suspended—which might be for the very purpose of having this proposition consi(lered•, and having action upon this amendment —the will of the House can be defeated by one Inernber withdra w- ing the proposition, and denying to another mem- ber the right of renewinty it
In most cases when a gentleman withdraws a proposition, it is the right of anybody to renew it
Is this an excep- tional case
If it is, and the proposition cannot under such circumstances be renewed , onc person micrht be able to defeat the will of the House It sccms to Ine that through a whole Congress
recedent cited, fair legislation, as well as the requires in the case before the ouse a recogni- tion of the right of any member of the House to renew' the proposition which the House suspended If that is done, then any its rules to consider
the case referred to; and even if' there were, no like to hear the decision of the Chair, which is amendment, germane
to it may be offered as an such precedent, the decision is waiat one would li the thing first
in order
• tunendment
Mr
GROW
The gentleman has not the floor Mr
GOOCH
It seems to me, Mr
Speaker, nattu•ailv expect whenever question arose
'Ilie Virginia says that hc does to interfere
that the, which you are to decide is this: Mr
HOUS'TON
lhave the to make if ask and obtain a suspension of the rules in not know I here has been a sinøle instance in It is certainly not in order to I order to makea particular motion, and that should i that point of order
which that precedent has been sustained
him whether hc knows a single instance
in il debate a point before the decision of the Speaker
be granted—  1861
Mr
BARKSDALE
debate
Mr
GOOCH
And then decline, after the rules have been suspended for that purpose, to make the motion which I have indicated, can not any other member make the motion, and bring before thc Elouse
the subject-matter which the House has suspended its rules to consider
rl'he SPEAKER
As objection is made to further debate, the Chair will decide the question
'l'he'40111 rule reads as follows: After a motion is stated by the Speaker, or read by the it Shakl be deemed to be in the possession of the House; but may bc withdrawn at any time before a decision or atnendmeut." The Chair has already decided that the gentle- man from Indiana had the right to withdraw his proposition, for the reason that there has been no dccksion upon it or amendment to it
From that decision no appeal was taken
The gentleman from Ohio now insists that he has the right to renew the proposition of the gentleman from In- diana, and claims that when the rules are sus- pcndcd to enable a member to submit a particular proposition, if hc fails to submit it, another mem- ber may do so
Now, the question between the gentleman from Ohio and the Chair is, whether it can bc said, according 10 a fair construction of the rules, that the gentleman from Indiana has not submitted his proposition
The gentleman from Indiana submitted his proposition, and some- time was spent in its consideration; but before a decision was come to, he withdrew it
Now, the question for the consideration of the Chair is sim- ply this: whether that is within the rule referred to by the gentleman from Ohio
I confess that I think it is not; and especially, as the rules have been suspended to admit the resolution of the gentleman from Indiana; and now, the business having been continued to this day, the rules could not, under the rules of the House, be suspended again
The Chair thinks the proposition cannot be renewed
Mr
SHERMAN

1 do not sec any particular reason why we should act upon those propositions now

Mr

Mr

Mr
ANDERSON, of Missouri
It seems to me, Mr
Speaker, that the action of the House upon these resolutions will be calculated to irritate the public mind, and tend to hasten impending I therefore move that the House resolve events
ifselfinto the Committee of the Whole on the state of-the Union
The SPEAKER
That motion is not in order pending the motion to adjourn, upon which the yeas and nays have been ordered
Mr
SHERMAN
With the indulgence of the House, and for the purpose of facilitating busi- ness, I will state that, if the resolution is allowed to come in, I will move to refer it io a selcct com- mittee of five
Mr
VALLANDIGHAM
1 object to that without amendments
Mr
HOUSTON
The gentleman from Ohio could get the floor on Monday and move to sus- pend tho rules, without making a struggle here to the obstruction of the public business by in- sisting on his appeal
Mr
SHERMAN
I give notice to the House that if I have an opportunity to renew this reso- lution, I will move to refer it to a select committee of five, with instructions
Those instructions, probably, will not excite opposition or debate
Let the whole subject go to a select committee of five
The committee of thirty-three is too large to consider the propositions
Mr

It has become con- veniently small

During the roll call
Mr
DAVIS, of Mississippi, said: I had paired with Mr
POTTER', but by the consent ofhisfriends the pair has been transferred to anothergentleman, and I am allowed to vote to-day
I desire to make that statement in order that Mr
POTTER may understand why I vote
Mr
I-IINDMAN said: 1 shall insist on voting aoainst all motions that evince a desire to dela action on thisquestion, and I therefore vote " no
I want gentlemen to bring the issue up
The result of the vote having been announced as above recorded, the question recurred upon Mr
HILL 's motion to reconsider the vote by which the House rcfuscd to lay the appeal upon the table
Mr
HOWARD, of Michigan
Mr
Speaker, there seems to be an unwillingness to vote upon these propositions; and I confess that I am un- willing myself
They refer to some events that are allco•ed to have taken place at Charleston, and yet tl'ley contain very important propositions and I would prefer to have more abstract principles
information upon thc subject; and, if the appeal can be will-.mo*e the <ippoibtment of a special committee, to whom the whole mat" ter shall be referred, with -instrÜct:ions to mike inquiries
If the House will allow me, I
willsend those instructions to the Clerk's -read for information
Mr
HOUSTON
-1 shall object to that
Mr
HOWARD, of Michigan
read for information
Mr
HOUSTON
If-the gentleman €vill intro- duce his resolution, aid 'let it go to the committee to which all others have been referred, of course I cannot very well object to it
Butl believe the• Speaker has decided the question of order c•or• rectly; and I do not intend to consent to any ar- rangement by which another special committee will bc raised upon this subject
Mr
HOWARD, of Michigan
The motion to refer will, of course, be amendable; and the gen- tleman can name any other committee
Mr
HOUSTON
1 shall not consent
Mr
HOWARD, of Michigan
Let the in- structions be read, and perhaps there will be no objection
Mr
HOUSTON
1 be certain to object to a special committee
Mr
MAYNARD
1 hope the allow the pro osition to be read
The SPEAkER
If there be no objection, it will be read for information
There being no objection, the Clerk read Mr
HOWARD's proposition, as follows: Resolved, That the whole subject:be referred to a-special conunittee of this House, to be appointed to make imme- diate inquiry and report : First, Whctber any executive officer of the United States has been, or is now, treating or holding communication with any persons or persons con- cerning the surrender ot any .iOrts, fort-resses, Or public property ot the United States ; and whether any demand fi)r such surrender has been, made, when, and
by whom, and what answer has been given
Second, Whether any officer of this Government has at any time entered into any pledge, agreement, or understanding, with any -person or persons not to send reinförcements to the forts ot• the Uni- ted States in thc harbor of Charleston; and the particulars of sueh agreement, pledge, or understanding, when, where, and with whom it was rnade, and on_ what consideration
Third, What demand (Or reintörcements ofthe said forts has been made, and for what reason such reinforcements have not been furnished
Fourth, Where the ships of the United States are now stationed, with what commands, and with what orders
Fifth
VVhetherthe custom-house,-post oflice, arsenal, and other public buildings of the United States at Charleston, have been seized and are held in possession by any person or persons, and the particulars of such seiz- ure and possession
Sixth, Whether any revenue cutter o
the United States has been seized, and fs now held in possession by any person or persons, and the particulars thereof; and whether any efforts have been made by the head of the Treasury Department to recapture or recover possession of said vessel ; that -the committee have power to send for persons and papers, to take testimony, and re- port from time to time, as facts material to the national safety and national honor may be disclosed by the evidence
Mr
COBB
The committee will v.rant to have a clerk, of course
Mr
HOUSTON
The Chair understands me, of course, as objecting to any special committee, with or without instructions
The SPEAKER
The proposition was merely read for information
Mr
SHERMAN
Then 1 give notice-that; in case the appeal is sustained, I will not press a vote on the resolution, but shali be perfectly will- ing that it shall be referred without any debate
I hope that course will be pursued
Mr
HOUSTON
I can make no compromise
Even if I wanted to refer the resolution With those instructions, Icould make no compromise which, in my judgment, would overrule the law of the House, and the very correct and sensible decision of the Sieake.r of the House
Mr
SHERMAN

BIGLER presented the memorial of Alex- andcr WV iison , praying for expenses incurred and compensation for his services, white United States attorney for the Territory of Utah; whic.}l was referred to the Committee on Claims
Mr
BIGLER
Mr
President, 1 present two memorials of like import, numerously signed by citizens of the city of Philadelphia, setting forth that they " earnestly pray your honorable bodies to pass the resolutions introduced by Hon
Mr
CRITTENDEN, of Kentucky, a copy of which is hereunto annexed," or any other resolutions cm- bodying the same principles and measures
They believe this course will be acceptable to our con- stituents in all sections of the country, and will have the effect of allaying the present excitement
These mernorials purport to be signed by men of all political parties
I move that they be laid on the table
The motion was agreed to
Mr
BIGLER
I also present the proceedings of a public meeting held at Harrisburg, the seat of government of my State, called to take into consideration the present imminent condition of the country
Also the proceedings ofa meeting at Carlisle, Pennsylvama, on thc same suhject
I will remark in this connection, Mr
President, With the indulgence of the Senate, that meetings of a similar character have been held in different parts of that great State, and I believe in every Instance their proceedings have breathed a spirit of loyal devotion to the whole country, and fidel- ity to •the institutions of the country, to the Con- stitution, and the Union as they now stand
They further manifest the utmost disposition on the part of the people of that State to avoid even an ap- pearance of evil, for the purpose of producing har- mony and peace in this great Confederacy
Fur- thermore, they indicate very distinctly a desire to adopt promptly the measures of adjustment sug- gestcd by the Senator froin Kcntucky; and I Will venture to repeat what i have said before, that if the Congress of the United States will give the people an opportunity to act, they will enabracc any reasonable measure of adjustment
Ourfriends in the South will discover tliat the people are pre- pared and willing to meet their complaints in the spirit of kindness and generosity, and respond favorably to any demand which the States com- plaining Qiay make
With these renmrks, I ask that the proceedings of the meetings be laid on the table
They were ordered to lie on thc table
SLAVERY QUESTION
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 rise, Mr
President, for the purpose of presenting to the Senate a res- olution
The times upon which we have fallen, sir, are ofa vcry ext.raordinary character; full of danger to the peace of the country, and oven to the Union of the country
Its extraordinary character to me to require of us all efforts, ordinary and extraordinary, for the purpose of averting the danger which now so threateningly hangs over us
The measure which I am about to propose, sir, is of that extraordinary charac- ter; and I shall be at a loss fora justification and excuse for it, if it cannot be found in the perilous condition of public affairs, and in that law, the safety of the people
lhopc the measure may be productive of some good
I shall therefore låy it on the table, with all other measures tending to that object, to be considered by the Senate
beg leave, sir, as the resoluti01') is vin my hand- writing, and perhaps not readily to be read by the Clerk, to read it myself: Whereas the Union is jn danger, and owing to the un- happy divisions existing in Congress, it would be difficult, if not inwossibke, for that body to concur in both its branches by the requisite Inajority so as to enable jt eilher to adopt such measurcs of legislation, or to recommend to the States such amendments to the Constitution, as are demned neces- sary and proper to avert that danger; and whereas in so great an emergency the opinion and judgment ofthc peo- ple ought to be heard, and would be the best and surest 'I'herc*öre, guide to their representatives : Resolved, That provision ought to be made by law with- out delay for taking the sense of the people, and submitting to their vote the tOllowinc resolutions as the basis tar the final and permanent settkement of those disputes that now disturb thc peace of the country and threaten the existence of the Union
Then come the propositions to be submitted, in the shape of amendments to the Constitution
The VICE PRESIDENT
Shall the resolu- tions bc read 
Mr
BIGLER, Mr
GWIN, and others
Let them bc read
The Secretary commenced to .rcad the resolu- tions
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 will take occasion to say that the rcsolutions arc the same that have been, perhaps, in the hands of •everi- Senator for some weeks, which were 'laid- on the table Esome timc ago, and printed—she same that I :had 'the •honor of offering to the Senate, with the addition of two others proposed by the.honorable Senator from Illinois, (Mr
DOUGLAS,] which also have been printed, and in the hands of Senators: Ido not oppose the reading of them, if gentlemen sire to hear them
The VICE PRESIDENT
Shall the reading be continued 
Mr
BIGLER
The reading is called for
The Secretary concluded the ' reading of the resolutions
The PRESIDENT
The Senator from Kentucky is entitled to the floor
Mr
CRITTENDEN
Mr
President, it was not rny intention, knowing how this day is -pre- engaged, to interfere with the occupation of the day by the gentlemen who havepossession of the floor
If I were to enter on any discussion of this subject, it would occupy much more- time than remains between this and one o'clock
I could only invoke, out of the fullness*of my own heart on this subject, the earnest and- serious at' tention of my colleagues in the Senate
We are, sir, in the presence of great and startling events
We must do something
It will be an open shame to the Senatc of the United States, an open shame to the Government of the United States, if, under such circumstances as now exist, this great Gov- ernment is allowed to fall in ruins
Gloomy as the time looks, unbroken as the clouds are that surround us on every side, and as little reason as I can see, as little solid ground as we seem to have to stand firmly upon, I yet have a conviction—it nmy be u superstitious conviction—that we are not going to be so unequal to our positions as to allow this ruin to come upon our country while we occupy such honored places among her rulers
It cannot be, sir
The sacrifice to be made for its preservation is comparatively worthless
Peace and harmony and union in a great nation were never purchased at so cheap a rate as we now have it in our power to do
It is a scruple only, a scru- ple of as little value as a barleycorn, that stands between us and peace and reconciliation and union; and we stand here pausiDg and hesitating about that little atom which is to bc sacrificed
Sir, it may be that we are spell-bound in our part.y politics, and in opinions which they have generated , and fastened and bound upon us against our will; but I appeal with cohfidence tö that great source from which we derive our power
When the people are in danger, and the people's institutions, I appeal with confidence to them
If we are at fault, if we cannot combine the requi- site majority here to propose amendments to the Constitution which may be necessary to the set- tlemcnt of our present diffculties, the people can
Give us their voice and their judgment, and they will be our safest guides
I do not look to this appeal as one that in any resuft can prostrate the Senate of the United States
Not at all
I have too long shared in its honors, its d'ignity, and its independence, to desire ever to see that day; but I do hopc that the representatives will respect and regard and give a proper influence to the scnsc of the people, when fau•ly and properly as- certained—no more than it is entitled to, but the full measure of all that it is entitled to
This is their Government
Its preservation is dearer and more inestimable to them than to all the world beside
They have the greatest interest in it; they have the greatest care for it
I have believed myself, and have often said, in the humble ad- dresses which I have been called upon to make to the people, Take care of the Constitution, my fellow-citizens, and thc Constitution will take care of you; take care of the Union, and the Union will be sure to protcct and preserve you
This is the doctrine of the people; this will be the sensc and the sentiment of the people; and the peoplc will give good advice as to how this mat- ter ought to be settled
I look with confidence to the advice which they shall give; and, so far from feeling myself, if I should ever sit here, humbled at all, or consider myself* as a submissionist (a term now commonly applied to law-abiding men) I shall waik more proudly upon the 'Vhighway which they have pointed out, and more surely, and more firmly, when I am strengthened with If their strength and honored withy their advice
further ineans fail, I trust that we shall avail our-  238 selves of this meats and make our appeal to the pcople
Sirs I will not occupy your time longer I had not contemplated it, As I this morning
said before, I do not wish to interfere with other gentlemen who are entitled to the floor

DOUGLAS,] whose just expectations of addressing the Senate to-day will endeavor not very long to postpone
I am not of those, i'vlr
President) who cntcr- tain the opinion that discussion upon all points of difl'erence between What I hate to call " S(..c tions" of the Confulcracy, can be otherwise than useful
Idcsirc, for mypart, to understa nd clearly and distinctly from gentlemen upon the other side, what it is of v.,'hich they complain
sire to understand, as i may, the ground, the rea- son, thc proof of that com ')laint; because I very sure that I intend, faitlfully and loyally to the Constitution, to obviate, all just, reasonable, and Inanly ground of opposition to us
I do not propose, in c yes of posterity, to place Iny- self (if, indeed, they may ever glane.o upon rne in a position where good and wise Inen inay say, " that, Inan, froli) pride of opinion 0k' pridc of party, ft)stcred the feeling which led to the dissolution of the Union, and refused to listen to honorable and just complaint ncyainst him.' 1 do not mean to do that
Therei'(ire it is that I respectfully, earnestly, probing it, as I believe, to the bottom, if I can, what it is that gentlcnje.n arc going to dissolve this Union about
J say, with ail rcspect to my distinguished friend frorn [Centucky, [Mr
CRITTENDEN,] that to do that in a good tempcr, cannot do any harm; and, sir, I fee); as I oåght to feel upon this floor, noth- i ng but sen timen ts ofcourtesy to wards every mem- ber of this body
I hope that so far I have thus conducted the discussion, and so I shall continue to the end
may remark, sir, that when the Senate journed ycsterduy I was endeavoring to demon- strate that the complaint made by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana that we were endeavor- ino• to establish a construction of the Constitution that slavery was the creature of local law, thereby CONGRnSStONAL GLOBE
January 3, foundation either-
in the Constitution or in the nature of the Confederation
It rested on the assumption that the public domain being a'cquircd by the
whole Union, the wholc Union had equal rights in the enjoyment, This postulate is undeniable
But what then
It was contended tin•ther that the United States could not enjoy its equal right of settlement upon the public lands, unless a com- paratively small portion of its inhabitants, say three hun- dred and fifty thousand out of niore than six million white persons could take their slaves with them, or, in other words, that every man from every state in the Union, had a right to take ail his property to the public domain and there hold it—whisky, banks, or anything clse—thougli pro- hibited by the local law
A true answer to this pretension is, that if any rnan, North or South, holds property not recog- nizcd as such or prohibited by the local law, his rcrnedy is to be found, not in the violation of it, but in thc conversion ot' such property into money, the universal representative of value, and take that to his new home, and therc com- mence his work of enterprise in a new and growing com- uujty

Now, sir, it may be said that this is the opin- ion of u northern man
While it is none the better, I i arn sure it is none the worse for that
Gentle- men will remember that I quoting on all sides, from the chieftains of the people and bhe leaders and indeed of the war
But, not to be singular, to be, as I tnean•to be, pcrfi±ctly respectful to all sections, I shall show by my l')cxt extract that Virginia, the mother of States and of statesmen, speaking by an authoritative voice on this floor— banishing it from the rrerritories of the United I States, if true,• was not just as a matt.(n• of that whether hc attacks the Republican yu•ty, of wh ich I am hu member, or whether attacks the great majority of the people of the North, with whom I feel a connnon sympathy, the attack is unjust, becåuso the leading !ncn of the South, the i)ublic opinion of
the South, the leading incn of the North, the public opinion of the North, the Democracy of the North, the Re- ! publicans of the North, the Whigs of the North, nay, all classes of politicians arid all classes of \nen have agreed, according to the doctrine and teaching of our filt.hers, that slavery was in fact the creature of local law only, and could not go into the Territories by virtue of that local law
"I'hat is W' hat 1 have been endeavoring to establish , not so much as a matter of argument as a matter of authority
For that purpose, sir, I have read passages from the speeches of many dislinguished gentlemen known to the country
I have one or two more; but out of respect to the time of the Senate I will pass to the discussion of other topics

Cass, ex- Dressed in a spccch delivered November 4, 1854, Detroit
a voice which we all hear with pleasure, one of her distinguishe(l Senators, [Senator HUNTER]— says what, according to thc opinion of the Scna- tor from Louisiana, rnust, think, bc considered of itself cause for dissolution
Mr
DOOLVI'TLE read, as follows:
Mr
Senator II(INTF.R, in his speech, fall, betOrc the Breckinridge Dexnoeratie State convention, at Charlottes- Ville, Virginia, said : When [ first entered the Federal councils, which was at the conunenc.etnent of Mr
Van Burcn's adtninistration, the moral aud political status of the slavery question wag 'l'hcn the southern very different froin what it now is
Inen thernselvcs, with but few exceptions, adnnitted sla- very to be moral evil, arid palliated and excused it upon the plea of necessity
'Then there were few men of any party to be t'ound in the non-slavebolding States who (lid not maintain both the constitutionality and of the anti-slavery now generally known as the Had any man at that day ventured the Wiltnot proviso
prediction that the Missouri restriction would ever be re- pealed, he would have been deetncd a visionary and theorist oftbc wildest sort
What a revolution have we not witnessed in all this! 'I'he discussion and the contest on the slavery question have gone on ever since, so ns to absorl) alinost cn- tire!}' the Arneriean mind
In nnany respects the results of that, discussion have not been adverse to us
Southcrn inen no longer occupy a (leprecatory attitude upon the question of negro slavery in this country
While they by no means pretend that slavery is a good condition of things, under any circumstances and in all countries, they (In tnaintain that, uuder the relations that the two races stand to each other here, it is best hoth that the inferior shoul(l be subjectcd "l'he satue opinion is extending even in to t.he superior

BAKER
havc caused this passage to bc read, Mr
President, for one purpose
With the ar"ume.nt I have now nothing to do; with the opinion of the Senator from Virginia, that France and England are endeavorino• to advance slavery in their own peculiar and pct way, I do not pro- pose to deal; but I do present It to show that I southern men have been always of the opinion of the fathers, that Congress had the power to restrict slavery in the Territories, because slavery was the creature of' local alone
'l'hat is all
I do not say it proves it
I am sufficiently in the habit of clifi.öl'ing from the Senator from Virginia not to take what he rnay say as evidence always; but ao•ai net the Senator fl•on) Louisiana— Mr
HUNTER, 1 ask Senator, does he DOOLIT'VLE read, as follows: say that he quoted *how that admitted doctrine [oi' equality, &e.J never had any real that the Sennt0i'S Of' the South believed there vva.s power in Congress to restrict slavery in the Tera ritories 
Mr
BAKER
Repeat, if you please
Mr
HUNTER
he mean to say that he quoted that in order to show that I maintained that it was the opinion of southern men that there was a power in Congress to restrict slavery in the Territories 
Mr
BAKER
Not but 1 apprehend that I can ask the Senator two or three questions that will make bim admititright out now
[Laugh- Mr
HUNTER
All 1 can say is, that 1 have never admitted it yet
IVIr, BAKER
And all 1 say, in answer to that, is, that ii is never too latc to do well
Now, I submit to gentlemen everywhere; I understand b —I will not say them to bc in favor of establishnv b protecting slavery in the Territo- establishincy— ries; I understand that that arises from the pöwer of Congress to govern Territories
The Repuba licans generally admit the power to govern; and from that they argue the right to prohibit
lievc that, according to the later phase of southern opinion—and it has many phases—the southern gentlemen admit
the power of Coneress to govern the Territories; from thence they argue the power to establish, or, at least, to protect slavery; and when, now, with the new fit, many of them profess to be In favor of the Missouri compro- mise, 1 suppose it will not be denied that that means just this: Congress has the power to gov- ern the Territories; and governing them, it may govern thern upon slavery as upon every other Subject; the Constitution takes it there; they may regulate and protect it there; and if they may do it upon all thc Territories, they may refuse to do it upon part
Some of them say so, and sonne of thcm deny it; but, at any rate, they all say, in making the Missouri compromise line, that it is the power of prohibition on one side, and of pro- tection on the other
The distinguished Senator from Virginia does not deny that, as I understand hinl
The distinguished Senator from Louisiana has not, in former years, denied that
as I have understood hiun
Mr
BENJAMIN
Do 1 understand the sen- ator from Oregon to say that I ever adlnilte.d the power of Congress to exclude slaves from any pottion of the l)üblic territory
Mr
BAKER
I will not say that I am quite certain that the distinguished Senator has so done; and if he says otherwise, of course I would cheer- fully yield to the correction, if I had so said; but I may say that I do understand that gentlemen upon that side of thc Chamber, at some period of their lives, in some of the phases of politics— when my friend was a Clay man; when my friend was a Whit" ; before thc repeal of the Missouri cornpromise was proposed—ata time when most of' us •vverc singing hallelujahs to it, I should think it very st.range if I could not prove that the gentleman was in favor of some line of separation bctt.vcen slavery and freedmn
Mr
BENJAMIN
Mr
President, 1 will swer the Senator, so far as I am concerned, that I never have admitted any powcr in Congress to prohibit slavery in the "I'erritorics anywhere, upon any occasion, or at any time in my life that I can will say fimrther to him: so far as the remember
question is concerned about the desire of the South to extend the line—that the southern States, at the period of the acquisition of Territory from Mexico, proposed to ext.end that line—not upon the idea that Congress had the power to exclude slavery froin any part of the territory, but that, the representatives of the southern States in both Houses consentin«y to that act, it would operate as an acrreement or compact, not binding consti- tutionnlly, but binding upon the good faith of the people of all parts of the Confederacy
In that light they proposed to settle the question forever
r rhey never did admit
that Congress had the power, constitutionally, that I am aware of
Mr
BAKER
When the Senator says that he himself never did it, I am by no means disposed to dispute it, and particularly so, as I believe have not asserted it; but the Senator docs now say that thc southern people were in favor oc the Missouri compromise Mr
BENJAMIN
Excuse me
Mr
BAKER
1 think that is Senator said
Mr
BENJAMIN
That the southern people  1861
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
299 were in favor, at the time of the acquisition of the new' Territory from Mexico, of extendino• the line to the Pacific ocean, and leaving it undisturbed, as a matter of compact, not as a matter of consti- tutional power
That was refused by the North
Mr
BAKER
well, Mr
time and on a proper occasion, I think I could show the Senator that it would be very difficult to establish the proposition that any body has a rimht to do by compact what will violate the Con- stltution
That is the sum total now of all he is saying
Mr
BENJAMIN
Does the Senator deny that a State has a right to abandon any privilege ac- corded to it by the Constitution, if it does not choose to exercise it
Mr
BAKER
No, sir; but this is what I do say: that if you, the Senator from Louisiana, do, in your conscience, believe that an act of Congress to prohibit slavery in the territory of the United States, or in any part or parcel thereof, is in vio- lation of the Constitution of the United States, and in derogation of the rights either of the States or the people—if, in your heart and conscience, you really do believe that, you are false and per- jured when you do it
Let me add, as the lan- guage is strong, that I am quite as sure as i live, that, with that view the Senator never would do it
Mr
BENJAMIN
Mr
President, 1 endeav- ored to make my proposition as plain as I know how to do it
i say that, under the Constitution, Congress has no power to exclude the southern States from participation in the
territory, from going thero with their slave property, and there finding protection
I say that, notwithstanding the absence of all that congressional power, it is perfectly competent, and in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, for southern members, cven by way of an act of Congress, to pledge the honor of their States that they will not avail them- selves of the privilege of going into that part of the territory that is north of a particular line, and proposing that to the people of the North as a settlement of a disputed question—not because tho act of Congress would thereby be binding, under the Constitution itself, but because it would be good and authentic evidence to the people of the North of an agreement by the people of the South not to insist on that part of the Constitu- tion which gave that right
Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, 1 do this time certai n Ey clearly understand the distinguished Sen- ator from Louisiana, and yet I do not see any- thing fairly in reply to what have urged upon him
Now, he tells me that the southern people have agreed t.hatslaverymay be prohibited
How
Sir, in passing the Missouri compromise bill, they did not merely agrce to do it—the act of Congress is not a mere evidence to be used in a court of honor that the people of Louisiana will not inter- fere with the bargain
That is not it; but the act of Congress is a positive law, made under the sanction of an oath, in the licrht of the consciences of the men who agrced to it; and I ask him in all fairness and honor, if he or I to-day vote in this Senate Chamber to prohibit slavery in a certain Territory, whether, If' we believe that ••.ve have no right under the Constitution to do that, we do not violate both the Constitution and our oaths x,vhen we render that vote
I think that from this po- sition there is no escape
When Mr
Clav gave that vote, he had no-constitutional doubt
When the South urged it, and the North agreed to it, they who voted had no constitutional doubt; or if they had, it vanishcd before the clear light of reason and argument
The North, as it is said, accepted it reluctantly; at least they abided by it
When gentlemen destroyed it they ran after strange gods; and now when many of them propose to come back to it, they are offering a truer and more acceptable worship
But, sir, the point of the arcrument is not to be evaded by any pretense that it is a mere vreement in a court of honor to do that they have no legal and constitutional right to do
Suppose a gentleman from Alabama comes up and says Sir, you, the Senator from Louisiana, .havc voted to prohibit me from taking my slaves into the territory north of 360 ; what do you mean by it; have vou any right to do it
" Oh no, " the Senator says, " no rightin the world ; of a right which theoretically we do hot claim; we have just done it—we do not exactly know why in point of law, but we have done it because we "hope, having done it, nobody will undo -it
What will the strict constructionists on the other side say to that
What words will they put in my mouth 
"I dö not think the argument can be defended other than upon the ground assumed by a justice of the peace, well kno wn to my distinguished friend from If•linois, [Mr
DOUGLAS,] old Bolling Green, in answer to a little law advice that gave him on one- occasion when the Senator and I were both very young men, and (if he will excuse me for saying so) very poor lawyers
[Laughter.] Old Bolling Green, then a magistrate, came to me and said: " Baker, want to know if I have jurisdic- tion in a case of slander
I put on a very im- portant air; looked at him steadily—looked as wise as I could, and I said to him: Squire, you have no such authority; that is reserved to a coui•t of general jurisdiction
Well said he, 'S think again; you have not read law very well, or very long; try it again; now, have I not jurisdiction; can I not do it." " No," I said, "you cannot." Said he: ' 'Try once morc; now, cannot take jurisdiction
" " No, sir," said l, " you cannot; i know it; 1 havc read the lav,.r from Blackstone ; well, I have read Blackstone, and I know to said he I you cannot do it
' 'Now, sn•," know I can; for, by Heaven, I have done it
[Laughter.] I understand, now, that the sum total of the answer which is made to my objection as to the constitutionality of the Missouri compro- mise touching the consciences of the gentlemen who proposed to pass it without power, is just the reply of my old fricnd Bolling Green
They say, " Theoretically we have not the power; con- stitutionally x.ve have not the power; but, by Heaven, we have done it." [Laughter.] Well, sir, I do not assume to deal with them in a court of conscience
That is their matter
I do not pretend to discuss the propriety of making a solemn act of the Congress of the United States merely evidence in a court of honor, subject, as I think, to a demurrer to evidence at least
That is none of my-business
What I am (lealing with is this: if that be the opinion of Virginia, of Lou- isiana, of the entire South; if they have gone it by their leaders, by their speeches; if they have lived by it; if, being a compact, it is an cxecuted compact; if under it State after State has come into this Union, is it not too late for them to deny now that we are justified if we wish to adhere to that principle
Have they a right to come and say: You are declaring slavery to be a creature of the local law, and we will justly dissolve the Union by revolution in consequence thereof." That is the sole purpose for which I have read all these extracts; and I think, from the conclu- sion, that this is neither fair, nor just, nor right, nor constitutional
Thcrc is no escape
But, sir, passing from that; the Senator from Louisiana, in the second item of the " dreary catalogue" which he recounts in his speech, says, in substance, that we attack slavery generally
Now, I am going to reply at some little length to that count in the indictment
I begin thus: if the gentleman means that, in violation of the Constii tution of the Unit.ed States, we of the North or'
West, by any bill, resolution, ot act* do in any-- wise interfere vv'ith the state and condition of slavery where it exists within the States of this Union, or any of them, by virtue Of local law, by which alone it can be created, we deny it; We have offered no such interference; we claim no such power
Sir, as I remember the history, as early as 1790, a committee of the House of Rep- resentatives—composed, with one exception, of northern men—reported to that Congress a reso- lution, which you will find in the great speech of Mr
Webster upon this point, declaring that we have no right or power to interfere with slavery in the States
That resolution was adopted by a I northern Congress—a body near two thirds of whom were northern men; and I say that from that day to this, according to my recollection, and in my best judgment, and on my conscience, I do not know, nor do I believe, that Congress has attempted seriously to doubt practically that it is just a sort of legislative flourish, a compact I doctrine, or in anywise to interfere with the con- between us and somebody else, that having done dition of slavery {n the slave States
Upon that it, we will never take it back; it is the exercise point I am subject to corrcction,on either hand

very man; and with the dixiectness- which-belongs•t-o his character, and the courtesy which he Otifi never forget, I shall be hdppy if, only:to Carry down the argument, whenever he sees a pope* place, he will just direct my attention to •the pith and marrow of the matter as he does now
be it understood* on this given day of Jahuäl•y; in the year of our Lord 1861, the great chdmpion of the South upon this question gets up in
his place in •the Senate and admits that there is ho ground of complaint that the Federal Government ever has attempted to interfere with the existence of slavery in the southern States
We will get that down upon the record, and apprehend it will be quoted before this controversy IS over, again and again
But it is said that the northern States, the west- ern StateS, in other words, the free States, do so interfere
Again we deny-it
The fact is not so'
'The proof cannot bc made
Why, sir, I might ask, in the first place, how can the States so in- teriöre
Suppose Illinois, of which I desire to speak always with affectionate solicitude, and of which I can speak with considerable knowledge, t.vere to violate all the opinions which she has manifcsted in •her history, and desired to inter- fere with the existence of slavery in Virginia, how would she go about it
I have the profound- est respect for my friend asa lawyer; but I would like to know what bill he could frame by which IllinoiS could interfere with the existence of sla- very in Virginia
Mr
BENJAMIN
Mr
President, will tell Senator, not how they can do it by bill, but how they do it in acts
A body of men -pene- tratcd into the State of Virginia by force of arms, into a peaceful village at the dead hour of night, armed with means for the purpose of causing the slaves to rise against their masters, seized upon the public property of the Uniteff' States, and murdered the inhabitants
A man was found in Massachusetts who, in public speeches, declared that he approved of that, and that the invasion was right; and the people of Massachusetts, by an enormous majority—the fact of that man's action placed before the people as a ground why he should- be elected their Governor—elected him theif Governor, indorsed the invasion of a sister Slate, indorsed the murder of the peaceful inhab- itants of the State of Virginia
The people of Massachusetts, by the election of Andrews as their Governor, have indorsed the act of John Brown, have indorsed the invasion of a sister State, and the murder of its peaceful citizens at dead of night
The people of Massachusetts in their collect- ive capacity have done more
They have sent Senators upon this floor, whose only business has been, for year after year, to insult the people of the South; here, ih this common assembly- of confederate embassadors, to cast slander and op- probrium upon them; to call them thieves, mur- derers, violators; charge them as being cri:ninals of the blackest dye; and because the meh who here represent Massachusetts did that, Massa- chusetts has sent them back to repeat the wrong
They have done that, and nothing else, since':ver I have been in the Senate
Mr
WILSON
Mr
President— Mr
BAKER
Oh, never mind
Mr
President, I asked the gentleman from Louisiana to point out to me and to the Senate, how, if the State of Illi- nois v.tere desirous to interfere with the existence of slavery in Virginia, it could be done
to his cooler temper and his better taste to amine how hc has answered me
Why, sir, he runs off into a disquisition upon John Brown, which would not dignify a stump
Now, sub- 1 hold mit that that is not the point between us
that his answer is an acknowledqment that a free State cannot, as a State, interfere in any conceiv- able way with slavery in a slave State; and that being so, we advance another step
We agree now that Congress never have interfin•ed, and that States never can
But the gentleman says, (and i do not reply to it now on account of what he has said at thzsrno• ment, but because it ig another of the counts in the indictment,) that •individuals in the northern  240 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

States have interfered with slavery in the south- I believe that to be true; but being ern States
true, 1 ask, what then
Is that the chief ground of dissolution
Are you going to revolt for that
Will you plunge us into civil war for that 
Is that all
Sirs let us examine it a little more closely
pass, as unwortliy the dignity of the debate, the incidental attack which the Senator from Louis- iana has chosen to make upon the people of Mas- sachusetts, upon the Governor of that great State, and -upon the distinguished Senators from that State, who, in my judgment, are an honor on this floor to this body
It is not my purpose—they would not intrust me with their defense; nor is It needful that I should make
it here or anywhere
That is not within the scope and purpose of this debate; but it is within the scope and purpose of this debate to examine how much of truth thcre is in the general sweeping charge which the Sena- tor has chosen to make, and how much justifica- tion in the fact, if the fact bo true
Sir, the peoplc of the northern and western States are a free people
wc have there various rights guarantied to us by our State constitu- tions, among the chiefest of which are liberty of thought and freedom of speech
We are an in- quiring people; 'W'e are an investigating people; and we are, no doubt, very subject to tlie charge often made against us, that we, are a pcoplc of isms
Where there is perfect freedom of opinion, that rnust be the case Ln the nature of things
It is in the nature of the human mind itself
Laws will not restrain it
We cannot bind lhc human mind with fetters, nor can we limit it to modes of expression
It will think, and it will act, spite of all government, and beyond all law
It follows, as a consequence, that thc people will not think alike; and, of course, as therc cannot be two ways perfectly right upon any one subject, thc people will always think truly and wisely
What then
'Ithere are people in Massachu- setts and in Jilinois and in Oregon, who will not only violate the rights of the siavc States, but the rights of the free
Thcrc arc people in the North who will not only steal nig«rers, but steal horses
There are people in the North who will not only try to burn down houses in the slave States, but who will bc incendiary in the free States
the duty of thc distinguished Senator from Louis- iana arid myself' sometimes, as counsel, to defend such men
Nor do I know that such rnen or such defenses are confl)'lcd to the North or the West alone
I apprehend if a grateful procession of t.he knaves and rascals, who are indebted to tho dis- tinguishcd Senator from Louisiana for an escape frou-n the penitentiary and the halter, were to sur- round him to-day t, It would be difficult for even admiring friends to get neur him to congratulate h iln upon the success of his efforts upon this floor
[Laughter.] W her), therefOrc, he says that in- Stales, not Congress—but individ- dividunls uuls in the free Slates, do attack in their ill(livid- and (lignit.y of the slave ual capacity the honor States, and do run off thcil' nicmrcrs, and do steal and do various their properly, and do kidnap, ()thca• things contrary to their duty as good citi- zens, I inclined, while I regret it, to believo the whole of it
Sprinaino• from that, and cvidcnced, as I think, by the excited enumeration which the guisbed Senator has chosen to makc of the •wrongs I Rnd crimes of the Slate of Massachusetts and her Senators; springiliR from that exag(reratcd mo(le of thought and expression, as to the free States, arises the spirit of the count in the indictment amninst the whole of us
Now, beg leavc to say I to the honorablc Senator, that the desire to inter- fere with the jights of slavery in the slave States is r) Dt thc dcsirc of the northern people
It is not the desire of the i.)eople of Oregon, I kncnv•, it is the desire of the people of California
, sure; it is the desire of the people of I Elinois, I swear; and I nvay say inore, that ill all my association with the Republican party, I have yet f.o find tunong them, from their chiefs down l' humblest' private, one man who proposes to ir to intcriöre with the existence of slavery io the slave States by force, by legislation, or VI) y con- 
have known no such nu_ll) na! action
n: all short experience, nor do I believe that the L.;nnator frcnn Lou•isiana can point out any such 
NIr
BENJAMIN
If the Senator merely de- sires me to answer him, I will ,tell him exactly what I said the other day: that the belief of the South is, and I admit I share it, that without in- tending to violate the letter of the Constitution by going into States for the purpose of forcibly emancipating slaves, it is the desire.of the whole Republican party to close up the southern States with a cordon of free States for t.he avowet pur- pose of forcing the South to emancipate them
Mr
BAKER
Very well, sir
See how glo- riously we advance step by step
We abandon now the charge that Congress does it; we aban- don now thc charge that States do it; we abandon now the charge that tho individual members of the northern and x,vcstern communities as a body desire to interfere with slavery contrary to law; to violate any existinm right in the slave States; but we insist tenaciously and pertinaciously on our fourth count in the indictment; and it is Mr
BENJAMIN
The Senator, 1 trust, does Y10t desire to misrepresent what I said
Mr
BAKER
1 do not, sir
Mr
BENJAMIN
1 am confident that he does I understood the Senator to ask me, in rc- not
lation to the Republican party, what proof i had of their desire to destroy slavery in the States
I gave it to him
I did not say that independently of that, (herc were not offer attacks upon south- ern slavery
I just this moment referred him to the direct attack of the State of Massachusetts— Independently of that, by the State as a State
the further exemplification of the State of Massa- chusetts, will refer him to the fact that her Legis- lature indorsed the vituperations of her Senator on this floor, by an enormous majority, and made that a State act; and furthermore, that she passed a law in violation of' the rights of southern slave- holders, and all her eminent legal men now ur«ing State to repeal the law as a gross out* the constitutional rights of the South
Mr
BAKER
Why, Mr
President, in where all her eminent legal men are desirous to I do 110t think, if the Senator rectify a vvn•ong, will wait a while, there can be any very great danger
Our profi2ssion is a verv powerful one; and have never known a State in which we all ao ree upon a legal proposition that we could not inducc her to to It too
'1' hat is a mere an- swer passincr
I insist, however—I know it is not qnite pleas- ant to my friend, and I regret that it is not so— that I have brought him down to a clear state- ment by way of abandonment, of tln•cc or four of the specifications
It is now true that the great o•round of con)plaint has narrowed itself down to this: that., as a people, we desire to circle the slave States with cordon of free States, and thereby destroy the institution of slavery; to treat it like the scorpion trirt by fire
I take that to be an t of the Inuin counts in the il)dictment, unless that bc considere(l one of them
Now, I first, if we, a free people approach that question: hearts and consciences, believing, really, in our that freedom is better for everybody than slavery, do the ad vance of frec sentimel'its, and do endeavor to assist that advance in u constitutional, legal way, is that, I ask him, cyround of separa- Mr

'l'hat is well
And I say just Mr
KER
perhaps rnorc emphaticaEly, as decidedly, and him why
The no! A 1 will proceed to tell artrument is a little d iscursive to-day than yesterday, but perhaps not less instructive
Sup- pose that circling slavery with a cordon of free States were a cause of separation, and thercfovc war with us: is il not just as rnuc,h so with any- It is no m•eater crirne for a Massachu- body else 
setts tnan or an Oregon rnan to circle, to girdle, and thereby kill slavery, than for Frenc.innan, or an Englishman, or a Mexican
It is as much a cause , of war ao•ainst France, QI' England, or Mexico, as acrainst us
Affain,sir: how are you ooiug to help it
How can we help it
Circle slaver v with a cordon of free States! NV h y, if read history and observe creoryraphv rightly, it is so girdled -Which svay can s•ltu ery extend itself' that it does not cn- *Oil of' freedorn

It cannot reach the islands of the sea, for they are under the shadow of France, that guards their shores tvainst such infectious approach
circled; I will' not say girdled
I recollect the figure, familiar to us all, by which he int.imates that that which is girdled will die
Therefore , I do not say girdled; I say circled, inclosed, sur• rounded; I may say hedged in; nay, more, I may say—where is the Senator from New York, [Mr
SEWARD.] he is a prophet, and I will not predict; but, if I were not warned by his extmple and his ' irrepressible conflict," I prediction as to the might say that, being so hedged , circled, guarded, encompassed, it will some day—it may be infin- itcly far distant, so far as mortal eye can see— but it will be sc,mo day lost and absorbed in the superior blaze of freedom
And, sir, that would be the case, just as much as it is now, if there were no northern free States
What harm do l, in Illinois or Oregon, to the Senator from Louisi- ana
Whcre can his slavery go, that it is not now, unless it bein this disputed Territory of New Mex- ico
Where else
If it go anywhere else, it will go incursive, aggressive upon freedom 
It will go by invading the rights ofa nation that is inferior and that desires to be friendly
It '*Vill go in defi- ance of the wish and will and hope and tear and prayer of the whole civilized world
It will go in defiance of the hopes of civilized humanity all over the world
'I'he Senator will not deny that
Therefore it is that it appears to me idle—and I had almost said wicked—to attennpt to plungc this country into civil war, upon the pretense that wc are endeavoriner to circle your institution, when, if had no such wish 01' desire the world, it is circled by destiny, by Providence, and by human opinion evcrywhcre
I will press the Senator from Louisiana a little further
W cof the northern and western States— and it is the complaint that our Abolitionists make a "ail'lst us—are the only allies you have crot in the world
It is to us (and speak it Lo you with affectionate kindness) that, in the hour of your extremest trial, you are to look for sympathy, for succor, for support
You have with us what you call a league; what you call a compact; what we call a united Government, by which we are bound , in some points of view, to recognize your institu- tion, and by that to afford you support in the hour of your danger
Why, sn•, if your slavcs revolt; if there be among you domestic insurrection—God grant the hour may never come !—we are calked upon by our constitutional obligation to march to your support; an(l, though there bc nothing worse than to fight in a servile war, unless it be to suffer in one, we of the North, when that hour shall arrive, will march to sustain you, our brethren, our kindred, the people of our race, with all our It is a painftll subject to re-fZ*1' to, and I po we r
pass it with a single remark
Again: by the Constitution of the United States we are required to protect you against the escape of your slaves through our territories, to return them, and to return them in violation of conunon law and against the principles of international relations acknowledged by the whole civilized world
Would France do that
Would Mexico do that
Would England do that
Would the It is to us, and Czar of Russia do that
No, sir
to us alone, that you are to look for whatever of safety, of succor, of synlpathy, you can find in the whole world, and—I had well niffh said—in the whole universe
There is, then, no "round of complaint against us, even if ali you say be true, that wo sur- roundii')g you by a girdle, a cordon, a circle of free States
Why, you soern to Ine to have the same notion m,vith an old man in my country who ',vas complaining that he was not rich enough
He was a farmer
He said he would' be per- fl.'ctly happy if he only had all the land that jomed hin)
[Laughter.] It appears to tne that the coin- plaint of the honorable Senator is, that slavery docs not extend everywhere, without border, or iitnit, 01' girdle, or circle in the world
Again: does the Senator remenlk)er, when hc a.sn-s us to restrain this process Qi' circling the slave States by tl'ke settlement of free communities upon their ijm•dcrs, that he is asking us to do  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C
RIVES, WASHINGTON, D
C
TIIIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, 2D SESSION
what we have no power to do by our system of government, or by out* Constitution
What is the process
When slavery is circled, it is cir- cled by the elastic, expansive power of free labor
California so circled it; Oregon so circles it
Make Arizuma a Territory to-day; steal Sonora to-morrow; and t.here free labor will so circle it, spite of laws, spite of government
Now, why should the Senator from Louisiana propose to dissolve with us because this is so
I would ask gentlemen on the other side: will it be any the less so i
you dissolve with us
Will not our young men take their axes upon their shoul- ders, or their ox-whips in their hands, and drive their teams out in the wilderness upon the very edge and border of civilization, adventurous, fear-' less, elastic, expansive
Do you not know that we will gear up the team, put the wife and chil- dren in the wagon, and be half way there—nay, that we will sexze and poskess the goodly land, while you are hallooing " Pompey, Jube, Scipio, get ready and come." That, sir—the peaceful progress of settlement and civilization—must be the real substantial ground of complaint, if there be any
The Senator talks about John Brown; and he says the people of Massachusetts approved of John Brox.vn
Let us rise to a higher view
Let the wing of our genius )lume itself for a nobler flight than that, here—talking of pcacc and war in this Senate Chamber
Let us not confine our- selves to the mere bitterness of partisan discus- sion
John Brown is in his grave
We, as a party, do not condemn the act of Vi rginia
We, as a party, do condemn his act
We acknowl- edge it w•as in violation of the Constitution and of your law
We recrret it
It found no sanction in thc public mind
If there were men who were sorry, who admired his courage, who sympa- thized with what they believed to be the integrity of his purpose, though it were a very dangerous, and, in my judgment, a very unworthy purpose, will you dissolve for that
Why, sir, all that line of complaint—I may add all the aroument based upon that complairlt—is akin to the very eculiar remark made by the Senator from Texas, Mr
WIGFALL.] He turned •to us the other day and condescended to give us a list
of the condi- tions upon which they would be graciously pleased to receive our capitulation
I do not remember It was speculative, fanciful; but there were some things in it kindred to the complaint and the argument of thc Scnator from Louisiana
For instance, he said to us: " You representativc men: you SEW ARDS and SUMMERS and HALES and WILSONS, go home and instruct your peoplc to repeat your personal liberty bills; abolish your Abolition societies; stop your presses, and do va- rious things kindred to these, and when you have done that, come back to us and tell us that you have done it, and we will think about it." Well now, sir, I think the mode of expression was ex- It was hardly what I had expected— travaryant
it was the first speech I heard here—to hear in the Senate of the United States
The sentiment that rompts it is 110t unlike that of the Senator from ouisiana
He says: Do not girdle us; do not circle us; do not inclosc us; do not migrate so as It would to surround us." That is our right
be our right if you were not in a common union it would be your necessity and your with us
misfortune, if there were no free States, no North and no S'Vest
Then, sir, as for destroying the liberty of our press, as for -abokjshing societies formed to promote the, abolition of slavery, or for any other purpose in the world , do Senators think when they ask us to do that
Sir, I ask then-I how
'Whether Lhcy do it in their own States, it is not for to determine
Whether the
severe nc- cessilics of their condition will allow free and unre- strained discussion , it is not for me now to inquire MONDAY JANUARY 7, 1861
I think I could read in the biography of every Senator near me, as given by his enemies, things very far from complimentary; a.nd I suspect they make a good many people believe them
I understand, sir, that wherover free govern- ment is, and wherever, as a consequence, free speech follows, there things may be said and will be said very unpleasant to hear, and very im- proper to be believed; and think that could show in commentaries in England, even in Hol- land, and even in Belgium to-day, or wherever clsc besidc herc free speech is allowed , reflections upon Government, and upon the personal charac- ter of the rulers, as offensive to their tastes and their opinions as any the Senator from Texas or the Senator from Louisiana could point out ut- tered in any State of the Norih and West against them
The abuse is, if you like, an evil, incident to free government; and how and why do you ask us to obviate in your case what we cannot remove in our own
Will you really make war upon us, will you really separate from us, because we cannot alter the model and frame of our free Government for which your fathers and ours fought side by side
You will not do that
Mr
Presidont, do gentlemen propose to us seriously {bat we shall stop the right of free dis- cussion; that we shali limit the free press; that restrain the expression of frec opinion we shall everywhere on all subjects and at all times
Why, sir, in our land, if there be any base enough, unreflecting enough, to blaspheme the Maker that created him, or the Saviour that died for him, we have no power to stop him
If there be the most bitter, unjust, and vehement denun- ciation upon ali the principles of morality and goodness, on which human society is based, and on which it may most securely stand, we have, for great and overruling reasons connected with liberty itself, no power to restrain it
Private character, public service, individual relations— neither these, nor age, nor sex, can bc in the na- ture of our Goveri)t-ncnt exempt from that liabil- ity to attack
And, sir, shall gentlemen complain that slavery shall not be made, and is not made, an exception to that general rule
You did that i when you made what you call a compact with us
You were then emerging out of the war of Independence
Your bad fought for that right, and more than that, they had declared that the violation of that right was one of the great I causes which impelled them to tho separation
i submit these thoughts to gentlemen on the other side, in the candid hopc that they will sce I at
once that the attempt to require us to do for them what we cannot do for ourselves is unjust and cruel in the highest degree

Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires, And unawares morality expires." Sir, we will not risk these consequences, even, for slavery; we will not risk these consequences even for union we will not risk these conse- quences to avoid that civil war with which you threaten us; that war which you announce as deadly, and which you declare to be inevitable
Sir, while I say that it is quite well that I should announce, at this moment, my opinion as to what we might do, I shall enter into no detail
I shall endeavor to bind nobody else
I shall express my own convictions at the moment, subject, Of course, to all the changes that events and circum- stances hereafter to transpire may justify
will never yield to the idea that the great Govern- ment of this country shall protect slavery in any Territory now ours, or hereafter to be acquired
It is, in my opir,ion, a great principle of free gov- ernment, not to be surrendered
It is, in my judge knent, the object of the great battle which we have It is, in my fought, and which we have won
poor opinion, the point upon which there is con- cord and agreement between the great masses of the North, who may agree in no other political opinion whatever
Be he Republican, or Demo- crat, or Douglas man, or Lincoln man; be he from the North, or the West, from Oregon, or from Maine, in my judgment, nine tenths of the entire population of the North and West are devoted, m the very depths of their hearts, to the great constitutional idea that freedom is the rule, that slavery is the 'exception, that it ought not to be extended by virtue of the powers of the Govern- ment of the United Ctates; and, come weal, come woe, it never shall be
But, sir, add one other thing
When you talk to rne about
compromise or concession, I am not sure that I always understand you
Do you Incan that I am to give up my convictions of right
Armies cannot compel that in the breast ofa free people
Do you mean that I am to concede the benefits of the political struggle through we have passed, considered politically, only
You are too just and too generous to ask that
Do you mean that we are to deny the great principle upon which our political action has been based
You know we cannot
But if you mean, by compromise and concession, to ask us te see whetherwc havc not been hasty, angry, passion- ate, excited, and in many respects violated your feelings, your character, your right of property, we will look; and, as I said yesterday, if we have, we will undo it
Allow me to say again, if there bc any lawyer or any court that will ad vise us that our laws are unconstitutional, we will repeal them
Such is my opinion
Even if our own courts do not believe so and yours do—I say yours, because I do speak now ofa supreme court, not subordinate, but acquiescent—if that court shall declare these laws unconstitutional in any particular, we will yield
I will not yield one in.ch Now as to territory
to secession; but there
ure things that will yield, and there are things to V•hich will yield

DOOLITTLE read, as follows, from Pres- , ident Jackson's instructions to the collector at Charleston, of thc 6th of November, 1832: Upon the supposition that the measures of the convcn- tion, or the acts of the Legislature, may consist, in part at least, in declaring the laws of tbc United States impos- ing dut.ies unconstiiutional, and null and void, and in for- bidding their execution and the collection of the duties within the State of South Carolina, you will, initnediatcly after it shali be formally announced, resort to all the means provided by the laws, aud particularly by the act of the 2d of March, 1799, to counteract the Ineasures which may be adopted to give effect to that declaration
For this purpose you wilt consider yourself authorized to employ the revenue cutters which may be within your district, and provide as many boats, and enrploy as Inany inspectors as rnay be necessary for the execution of the taw, and for the purposes of the act already referred to
You will, rnoreovct•, cause a sufficient nurnber of officers of cutters and inspectors to be placed on board, and in charge of every vessel atriving from a iOreign port or place with goods, wares, or merchandise, as soon as practicable after her first coming within your district, and direct them to anchor her in solne satö placc within the harbor, where Bhe may be secure any aet of' violence, and froln any unauthorized attenujt to discharge her cargo before a com- pliance with the laws; and they will remain on board of her at such place until the reports and entries required by law shall bc made, hoth of vessel and cargo, and the duties paid or secured to be paid to your satisfhction, and until the regular perniit shall be granted for landing the ; and it will be your duty, against any forcible at- tempt, to retain and defON(l the custody of said vessel by the aid of the officers of the customs, inspectors and offl- cers of the cutters, until the requisitions of the law shall be fülly con•iplied with; and in case of any attempt to re- move her or her cargo froin the custodv of the offcers of -the custmns, by the forin ot• legal process from State tribu- nals•, you will not yield the custody to such attempt ; but will consult the taw officer of the district, and ernploy such means as, under the peculiar eirctunstances, you inay le- galåy do, to resist such process, and prevent the removal of the vessel and carao
Should the entry of such vessel and cargo not be com- pleted, and the duties paid, or secured to be paid by bond, or bonds with securities to your satisfaction, v,rit.hin the timo limited by law, you will, at the expiration of that time, talf possession of the caroo, and land and store the saxne at Castle Pinckney, or sonne other safe place ; and in due time, if the duties are not paid, sell the sarne, accord- ing to the direction o
the fifty-sixth section of the act of the 2d Dt- March, 1799; and you are authorized to provide snch stores as may be necessary for that purpose." Mr
BAKER
Mr
President, there is my an- swer to the whole argument of inconvenience and impossibility on the part of the distinguished Senator from Louisiana
There is the manner, allowing all the itpenuity he can claim for his plan of defeat; there is the in which the Old Hero cut the knot which some people cannot un- tie
And that is neither an acknowledgment of the independence of South Carolina, nor is it war
If, from that, collision come, let him bear the danger who provokes it
there is noll'ling practical in this Why, sir, attempted idea that we cannot punish an individ- ual, or that we cannot corn pel hilli to o oev t be law, because a sovereign State will undertake to succor him
There no more sense in that, than there was in the excuse by a celebrated ohief for profane swoar;ncr
The comrnander-in-n Duke of York, as you may remember, sn•, was, his father, not •rei«n of Georcye Ill during the only commander-in-chief of the British forces, buÜhc was titular Bishop of Osnaburgh: that is, he had a little principality in Germany, which was originally related to the Church, and he '•,vas notninal bishop of that principality
At a tav- ern one day, while the commander-in-chief was swearing profanely, a gentleman of the Church of England felt it his duty to reprove him, and said to him, " Sir, I am astonished that a bishop should in the manner that you do " Sn d he, "I want you to distinctly understand that I do not swear as the Bishop of Osnaburgh; I swrear as the Duke of York, tho commander-in- " A h, sir, said the old man, " when the Lord shall send the duke to hell, xxvhat will be- come of the bishop

think that is the plain common-sense ansv,'tn• to all that has been said on that subject
Sir, as I leave that branch of it, indeed as I the subject altogether, I will sinopiy say that I hope it will never come
W hatever moderation, , whatever that great healer, time, whatever the ness or danger there may be, let us proceed in the country

WILSON
I desire to say words As take my leave of a subject upon which I in reply 10 some remarks that have been made, have detained you too long, I think in my own especially by the Senator from Louisiana
The mind whether I shall add anything in my feebfe Senator from (*rgia has the floor for Monday, way to the hopes, the prayers, the .%spirations that are going forth daily thc perpetuity ofthe Union of these States
I ask myself, shall I add any- thing to that volume of invocation which is every- where rising up to high Heaven, " spare us from the madness of disunion and civil war ! " standing in this Chamber and speaking upon this subject, I cannot forget that am standing in a place once occupied by one far, far mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose
It was upon this subject of secession, of disunion, of discord, of civil war, that Web- ster uttered those immortal sentiments clothed in immortal words, married to the noblest expres- sions that ever fellTrom humarf]ips, which alonc would have made him memorable and remem bered forever
Sir, I cannot improve upon those ex- pressions
They were uttered nearly thirty years aøo, in the face of what was ima&inod to be a great danger, thon happily dissipated
They were ut- tered in the fullness of his genius, from the full- ness of his heart
They I'lave found echo since i then in millions of homes and in foreign lands
They have been a text-book in schools
They have been an inspiration to public, hope and to public liberty
As close, I repeat them; adopt them
If in their presence I were to attempt to give utterance to any words of my own, I should feel that I ought to say, And shali the lyre so long divine, Degenerate into harlds like rnine Sir, I adopt the closing passacyes of that im- mortal speech; they are my sentiments; they arc the sentiments of everv man upon this side of the Chamber; I would fhin believe they are the sentimentsof every man upon this floor; I would fåin believe that they are an inspiration, and will bccome a power throughout thc length and breadth of this broad Confederacy; that again the aspira- tions and hopes and prayers for the Union •may rise like perpetual h y Inn of hope and praise
But, sir, howcvor this may be, these thoughts arc mine; {hege prayers are mtne•, and as, reverently and I should like to follow him; -and foe that purpose I move to assign the resolutions of the Senator from
Tennessee, which we ha(.r undef t consideration this morning, for Tuesday 'next at one o'clock

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
The SPEAKER
The regular order of busi- ness is the consideration of questions in respect to the District of Columbia
Mr
CARTER
Mr
Speaker, have been sick ever since this day was set apart for the consid- eration of the business of' the District of Columbia, and have, therefore, been unable to call the Com- mittee for the District of Columbia together
So far as I am concerned, I am unprepared for the consideration of that business to-day
move, then, that its further cow)sideration bc postponed until Tuesday next, and made the special order for that day
Mr
HUGHES
1 object to that
Mr
CARTER
I modify my motion, so as to make it no x t 'I'hursday
Mr
HUGHES
There are several bills before the House that do not require for our action a meeting of the Committee for the District of Co- lumbia
I will remind the House that last year the 9th of May was assigned for the transaction of thc business of this District
On that day there were two or three bills under consideration; but there was no final action taken on them
The committce rose pending an important bill; and there is no reason why the House should not now go 011 with that measure
There are also several bills which have been reported from the Commit- tee for the District of Columbia
Tho railroad Dill, to which I refer, was lcft in the commit.tce oy the committee rising to permit thc announce- ment of a member's déath
I do not sce why ive should not at once go on with the special order set apart for this day
Mr
HA RRIS, of Maryland
If there be no spc- Cial order fcn• next Thursday, and the wholc day cannot be given to the business of the District of Colutnbia, I am satisfied
There is one bill in which In y constituents fccla deep interest, and in which my colleague feels some general interest
That biil cannot be well taken up to-day, and I hope that tbe business will go over, according to the suggestion of the chairman of the committee, until next Thursday
I think it will accommo- date the views of my friend
Mr
HUGHES
It does not accommodate me; I am prepared to go on with the discussion 01 this busin,'ss
When we have disposed of the bill before the committee, the House can then post- pone this District of Columbia business to any day it pleases
T hc bill is one in x.vhich m v con- stitucntg are deeply interested
Mr
HARRIS, of Maryland
What is the bill
Mr
HUGHES
The city railway bill
Mr
FLORENCE
Has the Committee of Ways and Means any business to present
Mr
SHERMAN
1 desire to-day to have ac- tion on the legislative appropriation bill
Mr
HUGHES
to go to the bill 1 hav referred to
When that is disposed of, I am wil - ing to go to any other business
The question was taken; and Mr
CARTE 's motion was agreed to
UNITED STATES JUDGES IN 01110
The
SPEAKER
The business next in order is House bill No
335, to fix the salaries of the •udges of the district courts of the State of Ohio
he bill was reported back from t.he Committee on the Judiciary with two amendments
The pending motion IS a motion to lay the whole sub- iect upon tho table, made by the gentleman from 'Illinois, (Mr
IV10RR1s.] The Clcu•k read the amendments, as follows: First amendment: In the first section of the bill, insert the words Ken- so that it will read ; tuck y and Indiana That the salaries of the judges of the district courts of the ünited States within and t'or the districts of the States of )hio, Kentucky, and Indiana, shall be, and the same are hereby, fixed at the rate of $3,500 per annum, from and after the passage of thig act
Second amendment: Amend the second section, so as to make it read as fol- lows : SEC

.nnd be it further enacted, That said judges re- spectively in the State of Ohio, be, and they are hereby, authorized and required to hoid special terrns of their If the salary of the judges these courts is: to meneelnent of such special tern), by publication in at least tvvo uewspapers published aud ofgeneral circulation within be regulated, as colii•aøue [MI", STANTON) said districts
The SPEAKER
The first question is upon the motion of the gentleman from Illinois, to lay the bili upon the
table
I made the motion Mr
Momus, of Illinois
to lay the bill and the amendments upon the table because I thought it was an inopportune time to press the passage of tbc bill
With the view, however, to give the friends of the bit! an oppor- tunity now to have a vote upon the measure, I will witlidraw the motion
thinké they should be, by the salaries of the judges of the courts of common pleas of Ohio, then, thie • bill will be voted down
Mr
STANTON
i understand gentleman
to say that the judge o
the northern district of Ohio, held codit two hundred and forty-seven days in 1857, and received salary of ten dollars a day
Now, I- ask the gentleman if a judge'S labor is worth more than his is

might answer the gentle
Mr
BINGHAM
man by putting the same question to him; but Mr
SIMMS
If the House will indulge mea shall not allow my Colleague to avail himself of [bat sort of an aroament, for he does not give moment, desire to make an additional statement in reference to the amendment I proposed to this I will not detain the House five minutes
bilk
During the last session of Congress an act was passed requiring the
district judge of the State of Kentucky to hold three additional courts in that State
Under that act hc is compelled to hold terms of that court at the town of Paducah, three hundred miles from Frankfort, where the courts wore formerly held; also two terms of the court at Louisville, sixty miles distant from Frankfort; and also two terms at Covington, one hundred I-Ie is com- and twenty miles frotu Frankt•ort
peiled to travel to each of these points threo or four times during the year, which will make the actual distance he is compelled to travel under the provisions of t.he act of the last Congress, two that number of days to the public service
He I gives but ninety days this year to the country, I and the rest of lhe time he is devoting tolaw prac- tice for his own benefit
That is
my answer to that question
The judxes who discharge with fidelity and ability ihe duties of these respective courts of-the State of Ohio,are generally gentlemen who do not ao•ree with me pdlitieally; and therefore I l:mve only to say here, that the State of Ohio is cnti{lcd to the same consideration at the -hapds of the Fcd- era} lecislation in her courts ras is given to any Slate '•.vcst of the Allegbanies
have made these I remarks for the information of the House
I ask I for nothing for these judges which is not already civen to ot-her iudges whose services arc not so I only ask that they be put upon an thousand miles
For his services as district judge onerous
hc receives a salary of $2,500 per annum
The I equal footing vv'ith the
judgesof the northern dis- duties of his office have been increased; he is rc- quired to hold more terms of his court, and to travel an additional distance of two thousand miles; and my proposition is to increase his sal- ary from $2,500 to $3,500, cqual to that proposed for the judges of the State of Ohio, who perform similar services
My object is not, as have
be- forc stated, to prevcnt the passage of this bill, or to prejudico its consideration before the House
believe the bill ought to pass
While I would accord this justice to the judges of the State of Ohio, who have high and responsible duties to perform, I think it only justice to the district judgc of Kentucky, considcring the duties which 'devolve upon him by virtue of the offce be fills, that his salary should be raised to $3,500
If you increase the salary of the judge of Kentucky filom | $2,500 a year, which hc has heretofore received, to $3,500, and deduct from that the actual expense of the additional travel he is compelled to perform by virtue of the act of last Congress, you 'Vili not leave him more than the $2,500, which he has heretofore received
I desired to make this statement before the prop- osition is voted upon; and I hope the bill will be amended according to the proposition I have sub- mitted, and then that it Will bc passed by the House
Mr
BINGHAM
1 desire to state that the salary intended to be provided by this bilt for the distrtct judges of the State of Ohio, is the same that is now paid by law to the district judge for the northern district of Illinois; is $500 more than the amount paid by law to the district judge of Wisconsin; and is the saine as that paiä by law to the United States judge for the District of Co- lumbia
I desire to say further, that, so far as I am ad- vised, there is no district judge west of the Alle- ghany mountains who sits as many days in court, and who conducts as many jury trials every year, as the several district judges of the State of Ohio
If there is any propriety, therefore, in the present compensation allowed to judges in Wisconsin, in the northern district of Illinois, and in the Dis- trict of Columbia, and to other judges I might specify, it is proper to give the same compcnsa• I am very tion to the judges in the State of Ohio
conversant with the business before the district courts of Ohio; and, as my colleague, [Mr
Cox,] trnct of Illinois and of the District of Columbia
I leave it to the House, therefore, to determine whether the bill as reported by Ibe Committee ought not to pass
Mr
SIMMS I have taken some trouble to estimate the salaries of the judges of the different States and districts
Virginia has two judges, two districts, at a salary of $2,500 between them; South Carolina has one judge at a sala ry of $2,750; Georgia one judge, one court, salary $2,750; Flor• ida two judges and two districts—northern dis- trict, safary $2,250; southern district, salary $3,000
Mr
BINGHAM
If the gentleman will par- don me for a moment, I undertake to say that cach one of the district judges in Ohio sit.s more days in the year than both the judges of Virginia sit
IS'fr
SIMMS
I admit all that the gentleman says; and I contend that thc salaries ought to be arranged in proportion to the duties discharged
Alabama bas one judge who holds two terms of the court, salary $2', 750; Louisiana has two judges and two COUtLS, salary $6,000 between them; 'Ten- nessee has two courts and two judges, salary #5,000 betwccn them; Missouri has two courts and two judges, salary $5,000 between them; Ohio two judges and two courts, salary $5,000 bet ween them; Indiana, one of the largest of the north- western States, bas one judge apd one court, sal- ary only $2,500; Illinois two judges and two courts, salary $5,000 between them; Kentucky has one judge, who is now compelled by law to hold four courts at different localities in the State, ten terms of the court in ail, each to be at least two weeks, and may be more, and he receives a salary of only $2,500 a year
Mr
EDGERTON
Before that bill is voted on, i wish to say a few words in relation to it
I know that the argument is always used, in cases of th is kind, that some other receivesgreater compensation, and that, therefore, the compensa- tion should be made equal
I believe that officers of the United States Government are generally paid too much; and I believe that if any class of United States officers are paid too much, it is the judges of the United States district courts
Now, I know something of this court of the I know that the work northern district of Ohio
performed by that court is not arduous work
when the bill was before the House before, made I know that that performs during the year i a statement in reference to the business of the but very little labor comparatively
I know 'i]jat they meet frequently, but they sit only a few district court of the southern district of Ohio, I will present here a statement in refercnee to the hours during the day; and I say (hatthccourts northern district of Ohio
In 1857, there were of common pleas sn more hours during 'dav in almost
every county in northern Ohio thau this two hundred and forty-seven days of actual at- respective courts at least once each year at Toledo, in the In 1858, there court of t hc northern district Ohio—sit rn d istrict of said State, and at, Columbus, in the tendance in court for business
eermswbietl hereaftét were two hundred and One dcys of actual attend• hours during the arid  246 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 3, and with equal ability
If the salaries of the other judges are too great, they should, if possible, be diminished, wliich I suppose, cannot be done
But certainly that is no argument for raising the compensation of the judge of the northern district of Ohio
As to the judge of the southern district, I know nothing about the amount of la- bor that he performs; but I do know, from expe- rience and observation , that the judge in the north- ern district of Ohio is abundantly compensated at present
I hope the bill will be defeated
I move to lay it upon the table
Mr
PORTER
Mr
Speaker, it does seem to me that, in the present condition of our•national finances, we ought not unnecessarily to increase the salaries of public offcers
The question which addresses itself to us is this: whether we can command competent talent at the present salaries
I think we can; and I think there is not a west- ern State in which the best legal talent cannot be obtained for judicial stations at the present rates
In the State of Indiana, where the judge has to perform very laborious duties, the district judge has been for a year past in very bad health; and, in anticipation of a vacancy, the most eminent lawyers of our State havc cxprcssod a willing- ness to accept the position at the present salary
In Indiuna, we can command the best le•at talent at the present salary, and I have no doubt that is the case in Illinois and Ohio
Of course, if the salary of the district judges in Ohio is increased, the salary of the
judges in Illinois and •Indiana, where the duties are quite as onerous, ought also to be increased; but do not think it ought to be It: rnay bc increased in either of those States
said that these salaries do not amount to as much as the same legal talent would command in the profession, That is very true; but it Inust be recollected that these offices are held by a life tenure, and any gentlcman in the profession will cheerfully accept a judgeship for lift) at a much less sum than he receives from the practice of his hope, therefore, the bill will profession
pass, although it proposes to do an act of kill(.l- ness to a judge of In y owl') State, whom I highly I move to lay the bill upon the table
esteem
M p
STEVENSON
I hope the gentleman will withdraw thc motion to lay upon the table
desire to say a few words in reply to him
Mr
PORTER
1 will withdraw it if gen- tleman will agree to renew it
Mr
STEVENSON
1 renew it
1 donot think, Mr
Speaker, that the basis upon which the argument of the gentleman from Indiana is rested, as to his opposition to this bill, can bc sustained
Now, sir, it is patent fact that, in many of these States, the labors of the judges by no It is not the case in means equally distributcd
Kentucky; and I imarrine it is not the casc in Ohio or Indiana
In some of the large cities the duties of thc judgc occupy three fourths of the year; and vet, upon the arguinent of the gcl)tiernan, ho should only receive the same ns a judge whose official duties do not occupy morc than half that time
It (loes not, therofbre, foltow that the Ohio judge, whose duties occupy tlu•ce fourths of a year, should receive, no more com- pensation than a jud«ye in Indiana, whose d\.lties do not, perhaps, occupy him more than two months in the year
Mt
PORTER
1 beg to state to the that, in Indiana, there is only onc district, and the duties of the judge are very laborious; but my experience is this: t_hat the length of t.he terms of these courts usually depends upon the adnainis- trative ability of the judges, that all these courts sit twice as long as they ought to
Mr
STEVENSON
Mr
Speaker, 1 certainly could not have misunderstood the gentleman from Indiana when he assumed, as a postulate, that if the salary of the Ohio and Kentucky judges vy'as increased, that of t hc Indiana judges must conse- queutly bc increased
That was certainly his position; and was undertaking to show that it was not a necessary coronary
Mr
PORTER
The gentleman has misunder- stood the basis of n) y arfftnnent
It was this: that the present salaries ought not to he increased if they could cornmand the best legal talent; and they do command the best legal talei)t in the coun- try; because, whenever one of these judgeships becomes vacant, the xnost eminent lawyers al ways apply for the place Mr
STEVENSON
1 must beg my friend's pardon for saying that that is a non sequitur; be- cause $2,500 may command the best legal talent in Indiana, it does not follow that it will command the best legal talent in Ohio or Kentucky
I here offer against his opinion rniuc, that there are a hundred lavvyers in my State who would not accept the offce as a gift, and twenty whose practice would quadruple, if not quintu- pie, the amount of the salacies of these judges
But it certainly does not follow that that which applies to Ohio or Kentucky, either in regard to the labor imposed on the judges, or in regard to the talent which thcy should possess, is equally applicable to Indiana
I take it that the true cru- terion for fixing judicial salaries is to be found in the amount of labor that is to bc performed by the judges
A judge who holds court in Cincin- nati and Columbus, where multifarious duties arc imposed upon him, where admiralty cases are to be tried, ought not to be restricted to the same compensation that is given to judges who have not such onerous duties to perform
Nor does it follow, that because the salaries of Ohio judges are increased, every western State has a right to demand increase of salary for hcp judges
What are the facts in regard to Kentucky
We have but one district judge there
He has to hold court twice a year at Paducah, at Louisville, at Frankfort, and at Covington ; placcs
some of them, four or five hundred miles apart
The increase proposed to be made to his salary would abso- luteiy not pay his increased expenses in traveling to and from and living at these various points
And yct the gentleman [Mr
PORTER] says that, if tho salaries of these judges in Ohio and Ken- tuck y are increased, the salary of the district judge of Indiana ou"ht also be increased
I protest u«ruinst
uny such idea; and I hopc the House f.vill not allow such a principlc to enter into its decision when fixing the salaries of these judges
-When the district of Kentucky , place to hold court in, his salary \vas had but on e late Congress, however, that court should bc held at three additional places, and I confi- or five hundred miles apart; dent! y assert that if this bill were passed, so far as the salary of the district judge of Kent-tick y is concerned, [he increase wotild not
noorc than pav I thercf'ore his 1 ucreascd t.t•avciinc.r expenses
hope, not only in rega rd to thc St,atc of Ohio, i.)t.lt also in regard to t hc Slate of li.cntucky, that this I now, under my promise to the bill shall pass
gentleman Indiana, rcnew the motion to lay bill on the table
I would not be willing to do it
, except
at his request
Mr
ETHERIDGL'

PORTER

Mr
BINGHAM
If this of farming out is to on, 1 shall not consent to any such thing
I suppose that if this NII•
ETHERI DGE
were a Inere questio of increasing salaries, erallv, at this time, arga wo uld 110t- change the opinions of any one
But I would suggest to the gentleman froin Ohio, [N'.lr
BXNGIIAM,] whosoerns so exceedinaly arn-ious to have the salary of t_his that within the last th ree or four iudge increased, rnon tbs t,l) ere ret, an * ncreasc the salaries of all tbc oflicers of the Government I {eretofore, of at least one hundred per cent
when salaries havo been increased, the was that nooney was not worth hati' as much as a telegraphic dispatch—that the Treasury is bank" I never pay rnuch attenti6n to telegraphic statements made by sensation writers; and, there- fore, this may be all untrue, and the Treasury may not be bankrupt
But I suggest to the gen- tieman that, if the Treasury be bankrupt, and if the credit off the Government be a }ittle üllåer par j it is quite as well for us to postpone the increas- ing of salaries till a healthy condition of our mon- etary affairs be restored
I am satisfied that this House does not intend to increase the salaries of any public officers
Therefore, in compliance with the request of the gentleman frorn Indiana, [Mr
PORTER,] I renew the motion to lay the bill on the table

I object to this then the matter is regularly before us, and no ob- bill being placed in o position where it will be jecf.ion can prevent its consideration
If not, then within tl,e power of the gentleman who reported the report was made irregularly, and an objection i it to call it up at any time

•I have, 
I will object
The SPEAKER
The report was made on a lherefore, called the previous question in order motion be entered
Mr

I would have no sort of ob- jection to that course being pursued, for think myself that the bill ought to go to the Committee of the Whole on the st-ate of the Union; but the honorable gentleman from Ohio has already given notice that 'he stands ready to make a privileged motion, and to cut off the motion to refer to the Committee of the M.Tholc on the state of the Union
The only way in which we can prevent the bill being put into position where the gen- t[emen of the Judiciary Committee can call it up at their pleasure, is by coming to a vote now, and either disposing of the bill or recommitting it to the Cominittee on the Judiciary
In that point •of view, I decline to withdraw -the demand for thc previous question

ASSOCIATED PRESS
Mr
SLIDELL
Some ten or twelve
days since, I offered a resolution that the reporters of the associated press, or any reporter connected with it, should be expelled from the gallery of the Senate
The reason for presenting that res- olution has already been given to the Senate
A dispatch, purportin• to come from tbe associated press, appeared in the papers of the city of New Orleans on the 18th of December
In the New Orleans Crescent of the _18th of December, under the general head of " dispatches to the associated press," appeared this article: Proceedings in the House
WASHINGTON, December- the House, a motion recomtnending the repeal of all St.ate laws that conflict with the Constitution and the laws of Congress passcd by a vote of 51 against 14
" Mr
JOHN COCHRANE, of New York, presented a reso- lution," Proceedings in the Senate
In the Senate, Mr
CLARK'S resolution of inquiry con- cerning ports Moultrie and Sumter and the Charleston arsenal was laid over
Senator F Kprcq, of Indiana, is said to be preparing a speech, in which he vvill strongly urre coercion." Which surprised the Senator, no doubt, very much when he heard it
Senator SLIDELL, of Louisiana There can be no mistake; it is not a misprint, or anythino• of that sort— In his speech to-day, Senator SLIDELL, of Louisiana, charged President Buchanan with imbecility, imputing to him ihe cause of the present troubles, and the authorship of the present crisis." On the eveffing of the same day in which this news appeared in the New Orleans papers, I re- ceived a telegrapl)ic dispatch, informing me of the fact, and asking me if it was true, arid if any correction were necessary
I called the attention of the Senate to this matter the next day, and then said that if an explanation were not given to me, I should treat the matter as a question of privi- legc, and ask that the reporter or reporters of the associatet press should be expelled from the gal- let•y
This movement on my part produced a call from the chief agent of the associated press here, a gentleman by {he name of Gobright, who, I am told, enjoys a fair reputation here, and is spoken of favoi•ablv by gentlemen who say they know him well
'It is not at all necessary for my pur- ose, to impeach the character or the integrity of Gobright
The associated press is a close corporation, no doubt receiving sufiicient remu- neration from thc public for the information that it conveys
am willing to say that I believe Mr
Gobright, himself, did not originate this menda- cious dispatch; but he has it entirely in his power to ascertain by whom it was sent, and by whom l
the agent of the press there—-who, he says, for- warded this fraudulent dispatch—and obtain the name of the individual by whom
this fraud was committed
I should have been cntircly satisfied if the immediate agent in the fraud had been dis- missed from the service of the company; but the company , or association, stands upon its rights and its dignity—it makes no explanation and no apology
My-colleague also found himself in a similar situations some time since, very grossly misrepre- sented
And this is not a mere freak of the press, Mr
President; it was intended to effect an object
The day when this dispatch was published in the newspapers, primary mectings were held in New Orleans for the purpose of nominating candidates for the convention of our State, which is to meet on the 23d day of January
That dispatch, think, failed to effect the purpose for which it It was undoubtedly intended to injure was sent
me, and all those who, with me, have thoåght favorably of the administration of Mr
Buch- anan
Now, Mr
President, to me and to my colleague it is a matter of great indifference, or will be in a very few days, what the associated press may say of our course in the Senate of the United States
We shali have other and higher duties to perform, perhaps upon some other theater; at least, we think so
At any rate, my course to- day is dictated by no selfish purpose at all
The reporter here of the associated press, or the off- Cial agent of that press, is contumacious
They have asserted a gross falsehood, and have made no attempt to correct it
It may be said, how- ever, that they did make such an attempt
Let us see what it was
As I said before, on the 18th of December this notice appeared in all the papers of New Orleans
On the 21st of December there appeared in the papers of New Orleans, the fol- lowing attempted contradiction of this slander: WASHINGTON, December the, Senate to-day, Mr
SLIDELL denied having charged President Buchanan with illibecility and the authorsbip of the present crisis, as reported by the correspondent of the New York Times, adding that he never felt such a sentiment." the statement that I made to the Sen- Now, sir, ate was on the day after the dispatch was pub- am asserted to have made lished—on the 19th
this declaration on the 20th
It is not denied
The false assertion that [ had made a speech on the floor of the Senate is not denied
No notice is taken of this false dispatch purporting to ema- natc from the associated press; but the attempt is made to fix it on the correspondent of the Times, although no such article ever appeared in the I only repeat, that i feel no personal in- Times
the Senate may take such terest in this Inatter; action on it as they think proper, such as they think due to their own dignity and to the pres- ervation of some degree of veracity in the reports of the proceedings of the Senate
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Senatorfrom Louisiana moves to takc up the resolution in rela- tion to the exclusion of the reporters of the asso- ciated press from the reporters' gallery
The motion was agreed to
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Secretary will read the resolution
The Secretvry read it, as follows: Resolved, That the Vice President be requested to ex- clude from the reporters' gallery of the Senate any reporter or reporters who may be etnployed, either partially or ex- clusively, by any agent or agents of the associated press
Mr
WILSON
Is the question on the adop- tion of that resolution 
The VICE PRESIDENT
That is the ques- tion
Mr
WILSON
I do not rise for the purpose of vindicating the reporters of the associated press, or the reporters of any character here; but I do not see that it is proved that the reporters of the associated press here in Washington , here in the gallery of the Senates or in- House of Represen tatives, are responsible forthis dispatch ; and, until it be proved that these reporters sent this dispatch, I do hot think the Senate: of the United States ought to adopt this resold_ti--on.: If it is the purpose to press this matter, I think' it due to the Senate that thc& should make
thO proper investigation
It is said that-ahis dispätch was sent from the city of New York
If that be so
it cannot have originated with the reporters of the associated -press here
Where the persons who manage the associated press in the city of New York obtained-this information, I know not
Certainly the.Senator from Louisiana made no such declarations on this floor as were imputed to him
Whoever sent that dispatch as to those re- marks having been made here, certainly must have manufactured it
I think I saw about that same time in a press of this city, or in a press of New York—I do not recollect which, but I think of this city—that the Senator from Louisina had expressed, notin the Senate, but somewhere else, probably in private conversation, some remarks of that character
The probabilities are that that publication must have been the foundation of this dispatch
Now, sir, we all know that reporters often do injustice to all of us, either by omission or com- mission; we all know that newspapers -do the same thing; but I think it wiser in public men to let the reporters of the newspapers, whether of the associated press or any other, exercise their freedom
Let them say what they please
In regard to myself, they have exercised that right for many years, and I have often thought unjustly; but think it better to bear it, to go along and live these things down if we can; and I do not think we ought to adopt this resolution
I think we had better let the matter pass over
The Sen- ator from Louisiana has vindicated himself here; indeed, he needed no vindication here, for we all know he made no such dec.laration; but I think we had better not press this question or take this action
Before we pass such a resolution, think it due to the reporters of the associated press here in the galleries that the matter should be investi- gated, and that they should not be punished for what it does not appear they are responsible for
Mr
ANTHONY
Mr
President, think that the honorable Senator from Louisiana is under a misapprehension as to the origin of this dispatch
I recollect seeing it, when it first appeared, in a New York paper
I do not remember in what paper I saw it; but I remember that it struck me as so singular, that I looked to see if itcame under the head of the Associated Press," the reports of which I think are generally very accurate
did not
Itcame from some independent reporter
But a small portion of' the telegraphing here is done b' the associated press; I think not more than one tenth of it
This dispatch came from some other reporter than those of the associated press, to a New York paper
The agent of the New York associated press very probably thought it wus authentic, and sent it to New Orleans; but we ought certainly not to punish a reporter- here for what another agent of the same company did in New York, if that was the origin of the dis- I certainly think the patch, as 1 think it was
subject ought to be investigated, and we ought to find out who is the guilty party
If any reporter here has manufactured a dispatch of that kind, I will vote for a resolution to expel him, for I think it would be due to the dignity of the Senate that such a resolution should pass; but I do not wish to see a number of innocent men in Washington punished for an offense committed by an entirely different man in New York
Mr
SEWARD
Mr
President, as a matter of respect and courtesy to the honorable Senator from Louisiana, I should be half inclined to vote for the resolution if I thoughtl could see my way to a correction of the abuse of the telegraph from It has become an essential department of the it
Government—supersedincr the press at the capi„ tal, and superseding private correspondence
But thc resolution would seem to be vindictive in pun- ishing past abuse, and providing no adequate rem- ed y against other abuse, which, perhaps, would be the only real justification we could have for
passing it
My experience has been, that the re- porters of the associated press, on the whole, are much more careful and much more accurate than unknown and irresponsible reporters, or occa

-am willing to be generous to them; but I think I I ought to be just, and vindicate my own wrongs in this department while redressing the wrongs of other Senators
Now, it so happens that I have been here a month in the city of Washington, and I have been honored with occasional notices in the telegrams from this city, and 1 scarcely re- member a single instance in which what was truth was told about me; but, on thc other hand, every- thing that seemed to be suid about Ine was just cxaclly the thing which was the Inost untrue of I do not know what share thc asso- all others

CAMERON
Mr

there is not only fraud, but corrupti0n, in con- nection with this associated press and its system I have been reflecting on this of telegraphing
subject for a good while, and I think it is about time for the Government to take charge of the I know that, for Inyself, I can rcpcat a deal of what has said by the Senator frorn New York, and cark safely say that scarcely has thcre been a truth in to yself ever passed over the wires Any- thing uncivil or ('int.rne or unkind, that is said me, (renerally goes all over t.he country

committees, with all the wisdom I possessed, sub- jecting, always, mv own views and preferences, at last, to the majority, when i could thereby, and not otherwise, receive favorable reports
Some- times I have advocated such bills at some length, presen ting, as well as I could, the great arguments derived from the commercial, financial, and po- litical purposes of the enterprise
At other timcs I have lent what seemed to me more effective aid, by keeping silent and discouraging debate, in order that we might reach the opportunity of se- curing the favorable vote which was expected to crown our efforts
The same motivc will induce me to be brief now, in the hope that, if my ex- arnp]e shall bc followed by other friends of the measure, may speedily secure its adoption
A word, Mr
President, on the details of the I have heretofore exprcssed the opinion that bill
the most feasible, and the most natural, and the best roule for a Pacific railroad is tho more north- erly one, to connect1V1innesota with the northern ports of the United States on the Pacific
also on record as havil]ff entertained the opinion, which I do now entertain, that it would be rnore wise, financially, to construct one railroad than two 01' more
rilhis bill does not confor)n to these It presents two routes, a northern and v lews
a southern route; and while thc southern route is unobicclionablc to me, the norther\') route is less nmihern than I would prerev
It will be pro- by sub- posed, 1 understand, to amend thc bill, stituting for its northern route that one which I would have preferred
I shali, under existing circumslanccs, not vote for the amendinent
My reason is, that the bill, as so amendcd, I appre- hcnd, could not be passed, while I hope that the , in its present shape can be passed
This reason, whether satisfactory or not, inust my justification to those sections of the country which would prefer, as I do, the route which is pro- posed to be substituted by amendment
I vote for two railroads, instead of onc as I would prefin•red , because I satisfied that o can - and I trust und believe that now, at not be passcd ; last, two can

Sir, it is rai:- roads and canals and connections and facilities for comrnunication, commerce, and affection, that bind together and assimilate discontented and ill- assorted communities
'This is a great measure of conciliation, of pacification, of compromise, and of union
The bill commends itself to all the friends of the Union, upon the ground that it is exactly equal and just
It distinctly that which we are alf required to recognize: that, owing to the peculiar conformation of the country and the people, there is one interest and habits of our civilization North, and another distinct interest and civilization South; that the competition, the rivalrv, between them is what has brought upon the country apprehcnsions of' disaster and disso- lution

Practically, Sir, this road will cost nothing
Only bonds are to be issued for it, and those bonds payable at the ex- piration of thirty years
The wealth of the Uni- ted States will •double in thirty years to come, as it has more than doubled in thirty years past; and that which was a debt when it was begun, will, in some sense, cease to be a burden at the time when it comes to be paid
The interest, it is sug- „gested by my honorable friend from Maine— Mr
FESSENDEN
Oh no; 1 made no sug- gestion
You overheard a remark in conversation
Mr
SEWARD
I overheard my honorable friend raisirv a very proper question, that interest will have to be paid in the mean time
The inter- est that is paid until the work is completed, is part of the cost; but then the services that road will render, when completed, to the Post Offce, thc naval and military departments, will be an equivalent for the interest as well as the principal, and I think we may compromise very ',vell on that
I have one word to say more upon these sev- I have said already that I thought eral routes
the northern route fixed in tho bill was too far south for financial purposes, and that I would pre- fer a more northern one; but I beg my honorable friends from the Northwest to remember that at the present time there are found between a line drawn one hundred miles south of the parallel of 380, and a line drawn one hundred miles north of thc parallel of 420, twenty out of thirty million inhabit- ants in thc United States, while a railroad north of that line would subserve the convenience of a pop- ulation iow far less—I think not more, perhaps, than two million or one million and a half
They Now, sir, if you will carry your recollection back to the period of the Ptolemys, and-bring before you the condition of society in Europe and in Asia at that time, and imagine that there ' had been a ship canal or a railroad from Alexan- I dria to Suez, thus connecting the east and the west of the Old World, I think you will find rea- sons for believing that the civilization once exist- ing in that region that would have been traversed by that route, would never have fallen; that it would have been a progressive civilization ever since, instead of an ephemeral one, rising and declining according to the tempers and passions of the belligerent nations of Europe and Asia
I The railroad is already built from Alexandria It is a monopoly; but it is inadequate; to Suez
and the great enterprise of the day is the open- ing ofa canal through the desert, from Marietta, on the Meditterranean, to Suez
When that is done, which is the great desire of all European nations, and which has only been prevented from being done by the jealousies of England and France, and possibly Russia, then the civiliza- tion of that part of the world will be rcncwed effectually and established.' That is precisely what I want to anticipate on this continent, while i•ve are yet young and vigorous, and stroncy, and rich, and hopeful, and ambitious

it is a wrork for the use of the is no narrow work; must be patient, then; they must wait and con- nect with this road; they must develop—Heaven knowrs that they are developing fast enough to-day I to secure very soon the most auspicious progress and success
No part of the world has ever im- proved or developed itself faster than the region of country lying between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains, and around the Fails of St

The southern routc seems to me peculiarly ad- whole world
'When it is completed, you will have effected that without which you cannot hold this Union together
You are building up to-day, on the coast of the Pacific ocean, powers which illust communicate with foreign nations, and through foreign conunerce, and have

You are building up on the coast of the Pacific ocean Asiatic powers instead of American powers, and you are turning your people, with their commerce, theirenterprise, their spirit, and their ambition, all over to follow in the crusade of England in China and in Iiidia, when, if you will only construct this road, complete this great work, you make tho Pacific coast American, and you combine the energies of the East and of the YVest, extending the civilization of thc world westward in its proper way, with American in-

Immigration and capital will be diverted fi•om Minnesota and, •Wisconsin, and from the entire lake the lines of these roads; and the commerce of the great lakes will, to a certain extent, be sacrificed to build up interests that are inimical to theirs
The manner in which legislation has heretofore been conducted has been extremely unfortunate for us in the Northwest
The Government is now paying millions of dollars for overland mail routes, all starting from southern States, and running to the Pacific—not to the center of the Pacific coast, but to the southern shore of our possessions there
Upon two occasions the Sen- ate passed a bill giving us an overland mail route in the North, at a very small expense compared with the amount given to the southern route, but by some process inexplicable to me, those b.ills failed in the other branch of Congress
I find that there is an ability in some quarters to make combinations that prevent us from receivinT our rights, while at -the same time we are compelled to pay our share of the expenses
I shall not detain tbc Senate long, for I presume it is a foregone conclusion, that this bill is to pass I have it from high author- without amendment

What strikes me as remarkable in the speech of the Senator from New York is, that he sup- poses the passage of this bill will save the Union
I am a Union man; would sacrifice anything that any one could ask to save the Union; and if he has found the means of doing it, I shali be very much gratified
The venerable President of the United -States, his able Cabinet, the Senate, the House of Representatives, the great men and the little rnen all over the country, the sane and the insane, have been racking their brains for months past to find some way by which they could save this great and glörious Union; but afl to no avail
Every proposition that has been brought forward, no matter from what source, has received little, if any favor
But the Senator frorn New York has at last discovered the philos- opher's stone; he has found the spring of life, of He thinks that the which we used to read
Union can be saved if we cive to the South two railroads to the Pacific ocean! I am sorry that there are so few southern Senators in their seats, for I wish to cail their attention to this wondrous proposition
I wish to learn from them if they are prepared to sacrifice for money the principles for which they have been fighting
If dollars and cents will redress their wrongs, I am prepared to vote the money—not only $36,000,000 but | #100,000,000; but upon one condition

January 5, which is, in the first section, seventh line, after the State of Iowa; and thus, in truth, so far as the to insert "at the mouth of the national character of the work is concerned, it word " Missouri," Kansas river; thence up the valley of the said will be as though the road had but one fork at the I eastern commencelnent of it
river to the vicinity of Fort Riley." Mr
POLK
I will state, Mr
President, briefly, in explanation of the amendment, that when it is adopted, the first section wili read thus: Starting from two points: one on the western border of the State of Missouri atthe mouth of the Kansas river, and thence up the valley of' the said river to the vicinity of Fort Riley ; and the other on the western bdrder ot Iowa
Fort Riley is an important military station in the western and central section of this country that belongs as yet to the United States
My amendment requires the road to run in the vicinity of that fort
One great obiect of the road, and I believe one of the principal objects upon which its constitutionality is defended, is, that it is to facilitate the transportation of troops and supplies for the United States
This, therefore, in an emi- nent deøree, coöperates in carrying out that ob- ject of bill
In the next place, the United States have a mil- itary road now, I believe, extending from Fort Riley down into New Mexico; New Mexico be- ; ng u little south, but a good deal west, of Fort Riley
This, therefore, coöperates still further n facilitating the transportation of troops and sup- 'lies on the part of the United States
Hence, one of the great objects of such a measure is neces- sarily and directiy secured by an amendment of this kind
If the road is to start from the •western border of Missouri, at any point north of the Kansas river, it cannot be thirty miles shorter than it will be if it starts at the mouth of thc Kansas, and pro- ceeds westwardly in the valley of the Kansas river as flu• as Fort Riley
It will then proceed, as it must afterwards, going west, so as to pass in the neighborhood of the Great Salt Lake, on what is known as the South Pass route
You therefore have but a vcry trifling and insignificant increase of the distance, probably no increase of expense, or certainly not in a greater proportion than the number of rnilcs will bc; and yet you accommodate the United States in thc transport- ation of public supplies
Then, sir, by starting at the mouth of the Kan- sag, or near there, a connection is cstablished with the Kansas branch of the Pacific railroad that is in progress of building in the State of Missouri, und is well nigh completed—so far completed that it is a certainty that the State of Missouri will very soon be able to finish that branch of its Pa- cific railroad to Kansas City
Mr
President, the State of Missouri was one of' the first—perhaps the very first—to take steps that were earnest and were hopeful success towards carrying railroad communication from thc Mississippi river to the Pacific coast
Of her own means she has pros- ecuted that road, until she has got it nov,.' near the point of completion to the mouth of the Kansas river
Then, if this connection is made, another object is gained; and that is, that when the Kan- sas branch of the Pacific railroad is made to con- nect with this road, there is a connection directly through central Illinois, central Indiana, ccntrul Ohio, and, by Incans of the Pennsylvania Central road and by Incans of tho Baltimore and Ohio road, first with this city, with Baltimore, with Philadelphia; and then, by the branches that con- nect laterally with all those great central stems of railroad, there is connection north and south in all the regions between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic sea-board
It does seem to me that no point could be se- lected, and no system of connections could bc cs- I do not propose to detain the Senate with re- marks on this amendment
Any Senator who i is familiar with the geography of the country, there will see, I think, that whatever may be his objections to the general tenor of the bill, this wilk I know the amendment will not re- improve it
move the objections of the Senator from Minne- sota; but that Senator himself, I think, will see that the amendment is one that would make the road better, if the bill is to be passed and the road is to be built as this bill intends it should be
Therefore, I think that whoever may object to thc bill as it stands, on the ground that the more I northern of the two great routes provided for is not far enough north, must yet be satisfied that li the routes will be made better by this amend- ment
Mr
G WIN
Mr
President, I am in favor of this branch of the central route starting from the point indicated by the Senator from Missouri; but the bill as it comes from the House of Rep- resentatives leaves that an entirely open question
I preferred that the bill should indicate the mouth of the Kansas as the starting point; but it has been left open in order that the best point may be selected—end I have no doubt that is the best one —on the western border of the State of Missouri
But, sir, I cannot conceive of anything that would be more dangerous than the amendment of this bill as it came to us from the House of Represent- atives, on an immaterial point as to where the road shall start on the western border of Iowa 01' Missouri either; because either of those States will bc consulted, and their intcrcst must be con- sulted in the eastern terminus
If it starts from the mouth of the Kansas, it will be very easy to connect it from St
Joseph; it isa very short con- nection; and thc State of Missouri and the parties interested in thc route would, of course, start it, having the Government aid, frorn the furthest point, which is the Inouth of the Kansas
There- I do hope that the Scriator from Missouri will not press his tunendrnent„ for it is ahnost re- duccd to a certainty that, if the bill passes in its present form, the railroad will bc located at that verx point, because it will go in the neighborhood of St
Joseph, and there can be connected bene- ficially, and at Inuch less expense to the parties who are interested in that point, than if private I cnterpnse were to build it further north than the mouth of the Kansas
I hope the bill will not be amended as proposed by tl'C Senator
It is of such dangerous conse- quence to amend t hc bill at all unless on some vital point, as I conceive this is not, that I appeal to the friends of a Pacific railroad bill here not to vote in favor of this amendment
I have but a few words to add to what the Senator from New York said, so much better than I possibly could, this morning
It is impossible for us, in my judg- tnent., to nmcnd the bill as it came from the House without jeopardizing its passage during this Con- For myself, being in favor of only one gress
route, as he stated that hc was, preferring the bill to pass with provision for one route, I vote for this bili because I believe it is practicable not only to pass it throngh this body, but to build both routes
I shall, therefore, go against any amend- ment, and hope evcry friend of a Pacific rail- road whose views are not entirely embodied in this bill will do away with those objections which are not of vital consequence to his section, in order that we shall have the bill as it came from the tablished, that would so entirely carry out that II House passed through thc Senate; which will, to object of the bill, which is professed as one Of its u certainty, secure the building of both these main objects, to accommodate the United States I will say to my friend from Minnesota roads
in the transportation of military supplies and mu- that when the time comes, be it
to-morrow or nitions of war, and also in its mail and postal fa- next day, or any time while I am in the public cilitics
While that is so, it also accommodates service, I will stand by a separate bill to give him as have already said, the central States, and ac- what he wants—a route fronl Lake Superior to commodates them so that there is necessarily easy i Puget Sound
I have always been in favor of connection between the central line and the States every project that has been brought before the lying both south and north
It makes it, there- Senatc, since I have been here, for mail communi- fore, a central railroad so far as this branch is con- t cation 01' railroad communication on that route
If this bill had cokne from the House of Repre- nected
If, however, this road shall be started ata point sentatives providing for that route, I should vote materially north of that, then its connections, as for it with greater pleasure thall I do for the bill you go east, will be such as will meet the same with two routes, because it would create no dis- connections that are made with the fork of the satisfaction in any section of the country
If more road that is to start on the veet boundary of tho than one route is to be built, three would Satisfy all sections of the country
I appeal to him, and all those interested in his section of the country, not t' jeopardize this bill by tunending it; but rather trust to those who are ready and willing now to vote for a separate bill giving them pro- I believe we can pass cisely what they want
such a bill through both Houses of Congress
These remarks are intended to apply to all amendments to the bill
I hope x.ve shall pass it without amendment
I do not intend to cor)sume the time of the Senate in discussing this question
It is well known to all of us
We have had it under consideration for the last ten years
All I have to say is, that I am opposed to the amend- ment of the Senator from Missouri, although I am in favor of the point named by him as the terminus
I am opposed to the amendment of my friend from Minnesota, because it will jeopardize the bill; but I will vote for a separate Gill to-mor- row, or any day on which it may be brought for- ward, for the route which he has at heart; and i think it can be passed through the present Con- gress
Mr
RICE
I wish to do justice to thehonör- able Senator from California
I believe he has, on all occasions, voted for measures that would pro- mote the interests of my section of the country; and I must say to him that, from past experience, I have found ita losing business to part from good company; therefore prefer going along with him on this biil, and connect the interests of my State with those of his
Mr
GREEN
Mr
President, this process of legislation is to me very extraordinary
When the Constitution was frnrned, and the legislative power divided into two branches—one called the Scnate, representing the States, and the other the House of Representatives, representing the peo- ple—it was intended that
each body should delib- erate and pass in review upon all questions con- nected with the subject-matter presented to them, whether by indiviüual members of their own House, or by the other House
But now a new system is to be inau«rurated, and the Senate is to be muzzled, and its power is to be crippled, and its constitutional functions destroyed, by being told the other I louse will not do this, and that we Inust not do what our judgment dictates, we must not exercise that power with which we are in- because the other House will not agree to vested , I will not submit to that kind of legislation
it
I will take the responsibility imposed on me by the Constitution, and I will discharge my func- tions and my whole duty, whether the other House fulfill theirs or not
When a measure comes up here proposing to take more than out of the Treasury, and when we are seeking to throw it into the best possible shape to accommodate the people and the public interests, and we are told, Let it go wrong, let this money be wasted, because
if we do not Ict it go this way it cannot go at all," we are, in point of fuct• .nullifying the Constitution that made us a coördinate branch of the Legisla- ture, by pursuing such a coarse
We ought to discharge our duty as our judgments dictatb
I have heard it said sounetin-lcs,atld I have heard it rebuked for being said, that if certain measures werc passed the President would veto them
The rebuke always was this: Each departrnent must discharge its own duty in its own way, and leave the others to meet the case just as it is presented to them." But the Senator from Califörnia is at fault in another thing
He says that if we make this chanee now we defeat the whole bill
Mr
GWIN
Jeopardize it
Mr
GREEN
Jeopardize (he whole bill; but yet hc said before he closed II-hat he had no doubt we could pass a separate bill proposing the same thing
Mr
GWIN
The Senator will permit me to correct him
Mr
GREEN
Certainly
Mr
GWIN
1 said 1 had no doubt thatama- jority of the Senate and House of Representatives were in favor of a norlhern route; that is to say, from Lake Superior
Mr
GREEN
Oh, 00
Mr
GWIN
Yes, from Lake Superior to Puget Sound
I may be mistaken in this opin- ion; but that is what I said
I said that if this bill becarne a law, l, at least, was in favor of an- I do not know whether other bill for that route

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
253 Mr
GREEN
I understood the Senator to say distinctly that he thought my colleague's prop- osition right; and that if he had the originalfram- ing of thc bill, he would put it so; but that it would,ieopardize the bill now to make any change; and yet, that he believed thåt if we passed this bill, we could then pass a supplemental bill con- taining the same arnendment, which he now says would jeopardize the Original bill
Mr
G WIN
The Senator is entirely mistaken as to my views
YVhen I made that remark, I referred to the amendment of- the Senator from Minnesota
Mr
GREEN
I will take the correction; but the arcrument is as stroncr in the one case as the other
He appealed to the Senator from Min- nesota: ' 'Do not make any amendment; it will jeopardize the bill if we put on that amendment
And We can never get it through the House
yet, before he closed, he said to the Senator, " I have no doubt we can pass a supplemental bill you all you ask." Now, if that is so, let us put the amendment on, and let it be ratified by the action of the House
They will do it in the do not believe one way as readily as the other
the House will defeat the bill because we are seeking to perfect it
We are not making radical changes
The preposition of rny colleague is simply this: when you undertake to accommo- date the State of Missouri, let Missouri be con- sulted; and do not let few strangers living in Massachusetts and New York have the power to make the location ofa branch which is ostensibly throsvn out as a tub to the whale to deceive the people of Missouri
Let Missouri locate it, and not the people of New York, Massachusetts, or other States, who, however honest and patriotic they may be, have interested motives conflicting with the interests of our locality
I shall, there- fore vote
for the proposition of n') y colleague; but, at the same time, I want to announce to the Sen- ate that there is another amendment which ought to be proposed, and which, if nobody else pro- poses, will, before the bill is perfected, giving any road, and every road, the ri"ht to form con- I want St
Joseph nections with this, to tap it
accommodated
I want the road from Burlington, Iowa, accommodated
I want all roads accom- modated
Without a provision like this, they can refuse connection, as I know they do in many States, and in many localities
The consequence is, that the cross roads are driven to the wall, and broken down, because these general, mammoth lines will not accommodate thcm in running time; nor will they permit a connection, but iOrce a change of freight frorn one car to another
All that ought to be provided for, so that any road should have the privilege, at its own cost, of form- ing connections with this
Then St
Joseph could have its tap, and Burlington, Iowa, could have 
its; and so could all the roads crossing from the Mississippi westward
That ought to be attend- I do not like other features of the bit}; and 1 will name one difficulty
Certain individuals are picked out and presented to Congress as the re- cipients of this bounty; yet they are not to act until they obtain charters of incorporation from the localiLics through which the road is to pass
It will, therefore, be observed, that we are first dictatincr to Kansas and Nebraska, to Texas and California, who shall be the corporators
I deny to Congress the right to say to California, " You shall make A, B, and C, corporators, and nobody else;" and yet this bill puts it exactly in that shape
We narne the persons who shall be incor- incorporation at all
By the frame of the bill, these mcn cannot act until the incorporation is had
As the linc goes through a locality not or- ganized as a Territory, inhabited by Indians who have no politicai power as recocrnized by us, no act of incorporation can be passed,' and hence that branch of the road is defeated forever; be- they can cause the Indians can refuse to sell; refuse territorial organization; and I doubt, if thc Cherokee nation, the Chickasaw nation, and the Choctaw nation, should all agree to it, whether it would come up on the conditions of the bill; and if we intend to secure M,'hat is promised, i•ve ought to put it in a shape not liable to be defeated
These are diffculties on the face of the bill
They ought to be provided against
If Iowa is to be accommodated by a branch of this road, Iowa ought to have a voice in its selection
If Missouri is to be benefited by a location of it, Missouri ought to be consulted in its location
If we are to provide means for the execution of this work, we ought to make it so effective that it never can be' defeated,' and not leave it in the power of Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Cherokees, and the Mormons, to defeat the whole cnterprise any moment they please
Again, sir, t.he practical effect of the bill, as it now stands, will be to pay an enormous bonus to make a short branch of the road, which wouid be useful as far as it goes—a heavy profit and an immense fortune—and the through road fail for- Fl'hat will be the consequence until some ever
subsequent legislation is had
As we foresee these things—and they are difficulties striking and paramount—can we not shape our legislation so as to avoid them
May we not take some effective steps which will prove, in the future history of the country, that we have legislated as wise men, who intend to accomplish what we propose 
Mr
WILSON
Mr
President, 1 think the amendment proposed by the Senator from Mis- souri a just one, and shall therefore vote for it
I disagree entirely with this idea that we cannot make this bill what it ought to be, and then carry it through the House of Representatives
I do not think we shall want to amend it to any great extent, but I think we ought to make it as perfect as possible; and I believe, with the disposition now in Congress, that we can carry through these Pacific railroads at this session
I shall vote for the amendment proposed by the Senator from Missouri, because I think we ought not to do anything that shall appear to strike a blow at St
In my opinion, fixing this starting point Louis
at the mouth of the Kansas river, connecting with I the Pacific railway now extending from St
Louis, would be just and right; and I shall therefore vote for the amendment
Mr
G WIN
As I have stated, we cannot command the vote of the Senator from Missouri, who has just addressed the Senate, for any bili— or we cannot get the Senate to agree to such a bill as he
would vote for—and therefore think it hopeless to attempt to reconcile his diffculties
What I said in regard to the amendment of the other Senator frorn Missouri [Mr
POLK] was this: that it was not of vital consequence that the measure should bc thus amended; and it would I jeopardize the passage of the bill, probably, if we amended it in that form, when it •was not of vital It may not be
proper to refer to been presented to us
-I regard the connection of the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts -by-direct rail- way communication across our•own Territories; as demanded alike by thc interests of commerce; by the necessities of our postal intercommunica- tion, and by the necessities of our national deö fense; and above all, such a •connection •would furnish, in my judgment, a strong, and, trust, an enduring and indissoluble bond of union be- tween the Atlantic and Pacifie sections of
the coun try
Entertaining these views, sir, I am prepared,as I ever have been, to vote for almostany bill which shall give us such a connection, whether it pro- vide for one road, or for two roads, or for three roads, and, as I- trust, without a too pertinacious regard as to any particular line or latitude of its location
I say, let us, at all events, have a rail- way connection between the valley of the Missis- sippi and the coast of the Pacific, somewhere, and within the limits of our own territories
While I prefer, and shall vote for, the bill of the honor- able Senator from Minnesota, if that fails I shall still vote for the original House bill
I prefer that In my opinion, the questiOn with to none at all
us is between one of these bills and no bill at all
I repeat, the question with us is between one of these bills, as it stands, without amendment or modification in its details, and no bill at all for a Pacific railroad
i will say to the friends of Pacific railroad, if we begin with propositions of amendment in respect to the details of the bill, whether in re- gard to the termini of the road, in respect to the line or lincs of its direction, in respect to the amount of lands or the amount of bonds appro- priated, &c., there will be no reasonable limit to these propositions, and we shall run into an interminable debate, and the bill will be sacrificed and lost, as it was two years ago; not because the House of Representatives may not concur in our amendments, but because x.ve shall not terminate discussion here during the session
While there is an undoubted majority of the members of thig body in favor of some bill for a Pacific railroad, it is not to be supposed that a majority, or even any six members of the body, would be found to agree that every provision, every minutia, every detail of any bitl whatever that could be presented to us, was the best that could possibly be devised
We must yield something of our opinions and our preferences in regard to these minor questions of detail, for the sake of the great measure itself, or your bill is lost altogether
If we begin to amend m this particular, so that the bill in all respects shall conform to our own individual, personal opinions and preferences, there will be no end to amendments, but there will be an end to your bill
I repeat, then, again, that the question with us is, •between one of these bills as it is, and nothing; or, in other words, whether we will take one of these bills as it is, or have no bill at all
Both of these bills, I believe, have been very well consid- ered; their provisions are plain and easily under- stood, and I doubt not, well understood by every- body who desires to understand them
The general question ofa Pacific railroad, as presented to us in bills at different times, and presented in various forms, has been debated at length here, at successive sessions for the last ten years
The whole subject, in all its variety of forms and plans, consequence
is well understood, I believe, by all of us, and by the action of the other House of Congress; butl am justified in stating that the very amendment I the country
I trust, then, that we may come to now proposed was voted down there; and hence an early and direct vote, first, upon the substi- we have positive evidence of the fact that there is i tute offered by the Senator from Minnesota, and, if that fails, upon the original bill of the House, danger of thus amending the bill in the Senate, If neither of these bills, in their pres - because the House has already indicated by a as it stands
porated, and the bill says nobody else shall be admitted, except by the vote of a majorily of majority that they are not in favor of that amend-
ent form, can command the vote ofa majority of this body, I have no expectation and no hope, I therefore hope, Mr
President, when it them
Hence, they can put it as they please

Mr
President, i -am sorry that  254 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 5, the Senator from Vermont, following so closely upon the line indicated by the Senator from Cal- ifornia, gives us to understand that we musteithel' take this bill or be charged with defeating the whole project
I wish to vote for a reasonable and fair bill to aid in the construction of a Pacific railroad; but I cannot vote for this bill, especially uniess the amcndmcnt of the Senator from Mis- It is evident souri be adopted

that the cities of St

it is left to the choice of particular individuals to locate the Missouri branch

So that, even if a man comes forward and offers to subscribe stock, i' is purely atthcir discretion to decide wil&rther the cash value of his estate is sufficient for him to bc allowed to becmuc a stock- the bill is full of it from be- holder

Now, sir, that is to what I was about to say

It proposes to It has never been confer a principality in land

I have pointed out two or three objectionable things which have occurred to me, and I doubt not, there are others
The way to pass the bill is, to refer it to a committee of this Seriate, and havc it examined fairly and carefully
Then, if the House of Representatives are anxious for a bill, I take it for granlcd they wilk give the same fair consideration to our proposition, if we ao•ree upon onc, that we shall give to theirs; but I think, in its present shape, the bill is utterly de- fective, and as soon as the amendment of my friend from Missouri has been voted upon, I think the best thing the Senator from California can do is to connnit his bill, either to the stahding Com- mittce on Military Affairs, or, if he prefers it, to a select conunittee

Mr
President, this great republican Confed- eracy is yet bound together by other ties than mere political ones
We have yet other intcrcsts to subserve besides those of personal ambition, geographical predilections, local prejudices, or sectional bias
We are a great people, spread over a vast continent, having not only a thousand thoughts, feelings, aspirations, and hopes, in com- mon with one another, but havincr also a common languacyc, a common' history, an a common and indissoluble future destiny
We belong to each other, because we belong to ourselves, and because we could not be ourselves and be separated
It is our Union, for our mutual benefit, and without individual sacrifice, which bestows upon us the distinctive character of name hith- erto cherished, honored and exalted throughout the civilized world, and which we would lose, and with it all its prestige, and all the hopes which mankind attach to it, were we, in fratricidal ha- tred, to commit a monstrous suicide, with our task but half done, our historical mission left un- finished, our power as yet undeveloped, in the full enjoyment of our youthful energies, and with , as yet, scarcely the consciousness of manhood, hopelessly and despondingly tottering to the grave
There is a classic proverb, Mr
Presiden t, but it those " whom thc gods love, die young; docs not apply to nations
They have no life beyond the grave
Their rewards and punish- menls are of this world, and recorded in the his- r i'hey arc judged upon earth; tory of mankind
and their example is a warni1V, or an incentive to emulati0[1, to future peoples
And would it not be strange if, ill the latter half of the nine- tccnth century, when the disjected members of the nations of Europe pass through an heroic rivaling, in patriotic intens- strutro•le for reunion, ity and noble self-sacrifice, the most brilliant deeds recorded in classic history, we, the last born and most favored of' civilization, enjoying the benefit of the lessons of all preceding a(.res, should madly rush into disruption and political annihi- still hope that the passions of the times will subside, and that the checks and balanccs fur- nished by the Constitution will prove equal to the preservation of all our institutions and laws, and that we Shail rise from the present crisis in our national affairs, stronger, wiser, and more united than ever
Cherishing these hopes, and unshaken i)) my political faith, I, for one, shall continue to discharge my duty to rny constituents and to the whole country, regardless of the terrorism of fac- lion and the hypothetical threats and menaces of Inen unduly excited by the apprehension of evils which it is still in our power to avert or to over- cmne
And what tneasure farnishcsa more stiff'.res- tive subject for public discussion than the long-pro- rnuch-discussed, and diversified schemes of national railway, connecting our vast posses- sions on the Atlantic with our new empire on the Pacific ocean
What other measure is better cal- culated to increase the faith of Lhe people in the permanency of' our institutions
What proof can we give to the civiiized world of our determination to remain united than to fasten an iron girdle round our loins, which shall be both emblematic and indicative of our indissoluble unton
All our railways are so many iron clamps which present distracted state of our give solidity and strength to our Federal relations; whether, country, this is a propitious moment for urcrino but the Pacific railway wili be more than that

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
255 It is, in this point of view alone, an object of the j greatest magnitude, inseparable from our national existence, and our progress as a world Power
rnay enlarge on the commercial advantages such an iron artery; we may speak of the trade of Europe and Asia, of which such a railway will I become the carrier; of the exchanges of the prod- acts of our own soil, which it will facilitate; of the thousands and hundreds of thousands of acres of wild lands which it will bring into cultivation; of the vast mineral wealth which it will help to explore, a", all that; but the great, statesmanlike consideration, that which, in my humble opinion, outweighs all others, is, that it is essential to our unification, to the reintegration of our vast na- tional domain, to the redemption of' our great em- Pire on the Pacific from its present colonial posi- lion
As long as we are separated fi•orn you by deserts and mountains, as long as the grea,er portion of our traveling people
in going to and returninff from California and Oregon, liave to traverse for- eio•n countries and seas, we lack that continuity of power and influence necessary to the full en- joyment of possession
And if this be true in time of peace, how would the case stand in time of war
Would the Pacific States, in case of such a calamity, not be obliged to rely mainly on their own resources for all irnmediate purposes of dc- fense
Would not, in this case, California and Oregon, as far concerns the General Govern- ment, be lost possessions
And would not tbe inability to rely for assistance on the General Government destroy that national feeling and that unity which, in tirne of danger, is the essence of patriotism 
We must preserve the continuity of our terri- tory, if the same national scntitncnts, the stillie attachment to our Government, the same devotion to our institu tions, and the sarne fraternity of feel- ing shall pervade us ail; and this union of feeling, of interest, of attachment to a con•n-non cause, can- 
not exist as long as we are separated from one another by distances to overcome which threo times the number of days is required which it takes to reach the continent of Europe
An ab- solute ruler, like the Emperor of Russia, may con- trol his subjects spreading from one continent to another; buta free Governrnent like ours requires constant interchancre of thought, and an actual commingling of the people, to perform its func- tions, and to fulfill its mission
The present condition of the Pacific States in , regard to our Confödcracy is abnormal, and so is the condition of the States reciprocally
Our mutual attachment is traditional rather than actual; it is based on our comrnon origin; but the children who are born and grow on that coast may not cherish the satne family ties,and, in their corn parali ve isolation, devote theinsc\ves to SILP- arate interests
A second or third generation fropa ns will bc unwilling, as I heard a learned Senator say, to come six thousand miles, through a for- • eicrn country, to learn how to be governed." It is to prevent this gradual alienation of senti- ment; thig growing diversity of interests in State and national aflåirs•, this impossibility of acting in concert in tilnes of great national calamines, which, than all other national considera- tions, ought to prompt Congress to accelerate, by all legal and constitutional tneans, the construc- tion ofa railway to the Pacific
Looking upon this as sufficient to justify so great a national enterprise, I am far frotn under- rating its rnilitary alid commercial importance
There are still considerations necessarily involv- ing the questions of connncrce, and the more urg- ino• one of military defense, which peremptorily challenge the attention of legislators, and of the whole country
I have already said that in time of war vvith any considerable maritimc Power, California, Or- emon, and NV ashingt0il r L'erritot•y, in their present would be lost possessions; because, condition, without direct comrnnnication with the main line able means of reinforcing our military posts, and of rendering that Federal assistance to the Pa- cific States which they have a right to claim at our hands, and which we are bound to render them by the terms of the Federal compact
That this assistance would become necessary, cannot for a moment be doubted
The geographical po- sition of Cakifornia, Oregon, and Washington Territory, but especially of California, invites aggression from an enemy
The continuity of the Atlantic States, the facility with which Federal troops or volunteers may be transported from one city to another, the dense rural population con- nected by railway with all those cities, render any attempt to surprise, take, and hold any one of them, not only hopeless, but rash and dangerous to the most powerful invader
This doesnot hold of the golden State, separated from tho center of our population and power, and stimulating, as she will ever do by her wealth and maritime advantages, the cupidity and envy of other nations
An isolated position may be held after it is taken by an invading force, when the latter is sup- ported by a fleet sufficiently powerful to keep pos- session of the sea-ports
With our small nucleus of a Navy
, with the few national ships we have in commission, and the constant rapid increase of European navies, our man-x reliance ftn• the pro- lection of our territory must be the Army and the militia, and the facility with which these may be directed fi•orn any point that may be
threatened to another, by means Qf steamboats and railroads
Destroy or diminish oar means of internal com- munication, and therc is not a harbor which may not be insulted, and no city on either coast which nnay not be sacked and burned
Our warlike pop- ulation would be of little avail in the defense of oar cornrnon country, if it had not the po•wcr of locomotion and concentration in considerable masses
But there is not a harbor or a city on our whole coast as much exposed to a forei«n Power as the city and harbor of San Francisco— no point from which an enemy's fleet, after hav- once taken possession, could with greater dif- ficufty be dislodged
San Francisco is the capi- tal of western America, of the whole western por- tion of our continent, as New York is the capital and commercial emporium of the whole eastern shore; and its loss or destruction would be equal to the fall o
a kingdom
it would, with one fell blow, rob us of our present supremacy on that ocean which is destined to become the larsrestcar- l'ier of international exchanges,and whose waters will wash the shores of the mightiest empires
In view of these dangers, to our already acquired Mr
President, looking abföa'd We Gee the riå- tions of the old world gradiially and'unavoidably drifting into a general struggle—aconflict of irrec- oncilable principles—which not Only threaten to upset the public law as it now stands, but the States themselves where it governs
The cohesive attraction of nationality and kindred is writing its protest in blöod against)thé arbitrary distribution of lands and peoples by hereditary Princes; and it is impossible for the public lav.' to be changed in one of those countries without invalidating its foi•Oe and application another
Happily for us, we have passed through that ordeal, and have shaped our public law in mutual accordance with reason and justiCe
While old empires are crumbling and new empires forming under controlling ideas, we may ourselves enjoy tranquillity and peace, if we have the wisdom, moderation, prudence, and strength necessary to maintain our neutrality
Our coun- try becoming, meanwhile, the depository of vast stores of wealth, our ships the carriers of Europe and Asia as during the long wars of the first French revolution
But ean we, without a railroad to connect the Atlantic with the Pacific, hope to derive all 'the benefits which must naturally flow from so ad- van tageous a position
Assuredly not
The commercial circuit round the world will not be completed; free interchanges of commodities will be impeded , as long as there is no adequate transit from Europe to India, across the American con- tinent
In case of a general war, the European Powers would surely be interested in keeping that transit open to their products and merchandise; for the Mediterranean would become the great theater of maritime war, and the Atlantic and Pa- cific oceans the only seas comparatively free from hostile cruisers
But it is not Europe alone which is changing her political map and her international law
Asia is in a state of revolution, from the Black Sea to Japan, and it will require generations before that old stage of the world-drama called history, will again enjoy comparative rest
not selfishness in us to profit by these events, any more than it is selfishness in a young and vigor- ous plant to thrive in the vegetable mold of pre- ceding organizations
And it seems to me to be the business of legislators to foresee events, and to shape their country s course to derive the greatest I advantaces when they actually occur
Hence, I say, let us improve the position and the hour, to establish bonds of commerce, which, protected by civilization and wise laws, shall invite the stranger as well as protect the native, and which once es- ad varitagc, there, is certainly just cause alarm, tablished and enjoyed, will not easily be aban- and for regarding a delay in the commencement ii doned for others, less secure or more diffcult of of a work which is so indispensable, to our na- 
i accornplislunenl
But i have said there is no need of advocating Lional safety, as unwise and unpatriotic
Hence, thc construction of the Pacific railway the construction of a Pacific railway on account by indirect Govern tnent aid is not only justified of its commercial importance; and my only object in this digression was but to show that time is by the clause of the Constitution which makes it dnty of Congress to provide for the " national pressmg•, that if we would derive all the advant- ages expected from the road, we must be up defense;" but actually enjoined by every consid- and doing, not pausing with our arms folded till eration of common prudence and -public duty

the capital stock; others have made loans or do- nations to private companies; while a few have themselves become part owners of the roads
A similar policy has been pursued in Europe, where the Governments, in some instances, have guarantied tho payment of a certain rate of inter- est on the capital stock, on condition that the road, after a certain number of years, shall revert to the State
are, fortunately, in many respects richer than any European Government, and able to afford much substantial aid without increasing thc charges of our Government or the burdens of the people
We have a vast domain whose value depends entirely on the use which we make of it, and of which wc may dispose, with reasonable care and prudence
for the benefit of the whole country
Such aid, it is believed, would be amply suffi- cicnt to secure the building of the road; it remains for us only to determine the mode and measure of its application
This leads, naturally, to the consideration of the constitutionality of the measure—a subiect on which many representatives in both Houses, mostly from the southern States, entertain more or less conscientious scruples
I confess I entertain no doubt on the subject; not, I can assure Senators, because I have the honor to speak for one of the Pacific States which may be supposed to derive the greatest advantage, but because I think the Constitution enjoins the duly on us to provide for the "common defense " and the " general wel- fare." Having shown, at the beginning of mp remarks, that the construction of the Pacific rail- way is necessary to the efiicicncy and continuity of the Union, it follows to every lover of the country, and to every well-wisher to America and to freedom th roughout the world, that whatever confirms and strenglhcns our Union is conducive to lhc general welfare
believe it equally clear—if not from the few rennu•ks I have made on the sabject, from those able arguments which have been madc in Con- gross—that the construction of the road is indis- pensable to our national defense, and as such, a proper subject Federal lcgislation
And I maintain further, that, even under the head of connuercial rogulations," the Federal Govern- ment ougfrt to reserve to itself' a certain control over the road, which it cannot do without con- tributing by some means to its construction
'I'he transportation of the mails, of troops and military stores, ought at no time, and at no place, to de- pcnd entirely on the kind of bargain which the Governmet!t may be able to drive with individ- uals or private companies, but to be regulated as far as possible by the law, which should place the disbursements of the different departments of the Government, as far as practicable, beyond contingencies that may prove embarrassing to the Treasury 
In the old States, the period for making such arrai')'re.ments has passcd, but in the I'lew Slates and 'I'crritorics they are still practicable—in former, by means of concessions and leffislat.ive enactinents of those States; in the latter, by Federal legislation 
I am not a latitudinarian in the con- struction of the Constitution of the United States, but it is my firm conviction that the authority for aiding in the construction of the Pacific railway, for the pureose of securing the transportation of the United States mails and of troops and military stores at all times, at certain fixed rates, may bc legitimately derived from almost any power I granted to Congress by the Federal Constitution, cspecially froni the duly imposed upon it to pro- vide for the United States mail service
The ful- fillmentofthat duty necessarily implies the choice of means and the mode and time of compensation, which rnay either be in advance or on completion of the service; either in money or its equivalent in lands, as may be found most advantageous to the public
sitate rei
It is a casus omissus in the Federal Con- stitution; and we, must supply the deficiency as best we mays and ought, and can, fraternally
The right to annex territory seems to flovv' natur- ally from the war-making power
The power to make war implies the right of conquest, and the right of conquest necessarily implies the right of taking possession of and retaining the conquered territory
But the territory thus conquered and retained, must, according to the genius of our institutions, be placed on the same footing as atl other territory of the United States-—the joint property of all the States
On this principle we have heretofore acted; and thcrc is no good or sufficient reasons why we should depart from it now
We are bound to pro- tect the new States and Territories thus founded from time to time; and we owe them a govern- ment
Asa principle of American statesmanship, sve must endeavor to assimilate the new popula- tlons as soon as possible to the population of the old States, which cannot be accornplished by the simple introduction of similar laws and political instltutions; but requires also, as I" have before stated, constant interchange of thought, and fre- qucnt contact with the people of the old States
I-Iom0Teneity is an element of political power; and similarity of thought and feeling are essen- tial to the harmonious action of our political sys- tem
However rigorously the Federal Consti- tution may be construed in its application to the old States, the powers granted by it cannot but be invoked beneficially when their exercise tends to assilnilate und harmonize the inslitutions and peoples of distant Territories
'The new case which is presented by this rail- road bill, could not have been foreseen by the frntners of the Constitution; and all our action in relation thereto, must be dictated by enlarged views rather than by the necessarily contracted form of abstract law
The means employed ust be proportionate to the object; while all legisla- tion on the subject ought to be regarded as rather supplenuentary Chan immediately derived from the Federal compact
riAhe old plea ofa dangerous precedent" and the invasion of established lund- marks," can have no application
For case here presented is an isolated, exceptional one, so peculiarly specific in its nature, that there is no other part of the habitable globe which we tnay acquire and annex to which it could possibly find another application
I thereiöre repeat, it is my conviction that there is scarcely any power conferred on Congress by the Conslilution, which could not be legitimately construed so as to justify Federal legislation in aid of so great a national enterprise
But, if I am mistaken in this view, and the constitutional- ity" of' this bill admits of any doubt, then it is no small consolation to know that, in the ordinary course of human and natural events, it is not likely to be repeated, and that the immediate good of which it will be productive wikl not be counterbalanced by its misapplication to future cases
'I'hc next qucst.ion is, how and in what manner shall Congress aid in the construction of a rail- way to the Pacific
'T hcrc is not a Senator on this floor who believes that t.he work ought to undertaken by the Govcrnnlent alone; and it is needless , therefore , to combata proposi lion w h ich , after the experience we have had in Goverl'lrnent works, is not seriously entertained by any mt.»n- ber of either House
No Government can com- mand faborascheap as private individuals; neither can it take thc sarne advantage of the n-:arket,
Be sides, Government IS not always the best admin- istrator of property, and its responsibility cannot be fixed with the same degree of certainty as that ofa private individual
ions; and I am ready to give it my hearty support, without amendments, trustine to experience to provide such supplementary legislation •as may be found necessary
In time we can see where evils grow up, and correct them
I would here say to my friend from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH,] that he could not draft a bill,.with all his legal ability, which would not
be found defective in some respect, before it had been in operation a year
We certainly do not part with all our power over the subject the mo- ment the bill passes
We have the right— Mr
FESSENDEN
Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question 
Mr
LATHAM
Certainly
Mr
FESSENDEN
As 1 understand, bills of this nature are in the character of a contract
The Senator says that we can have supplemental legis- lation, if we only pass the bill, by which to right all these things
Now, I ask him, as a lawyer, to tell me—because that is a diffcuity thatopet•ates upon my mind—what right shall we have to pass any bill hereafter affecting this in any degree whatever, after it has once gone into operation 
We cannot touch rights that arisc under it, as 1 understand it, in any way, either in oeneral or in detail
We can change nothing, as the bill stands If he will add to it a provision retaininc' now the power in C0i)gress to legislate hereafter as it may deem expedient, then it may be done; but war)t to knowr how it can be done without some such provision
MI': BRAGG
Ifthe Senator will allow me, I wish to make a in that connection
There is but one passatye in the bill that refers to that subject, and that is: in case the corporation conternilated in the first part of the bill, fail to perform their work, and it is to be done by a sub- sequent corporation cominc in their place, tl)ere is a provision that Congress may legislate as to this subsequent corporation, but not as to the first one
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 am speaking as the bill stands now
When the corporation named get possession under this bill, if it passes into an act, want to know what possibility there is to touch it in any sha e or form
MI'
BRA I agree with the Senator en- tircly
I merely wished to state that there was only this one provision: that if the first corpora- tors named should fail to perform the work, and subsequent parties should do it, then Congress may legislate as to those subsequent parties
Mr
LA'I'HAM
understand the questions
My answer is simply this: So far as the
giving of general privileges to the cmnpany, I suppose the Goverumcnt will have passed away its inter- cst; it will give to it vested rights which no sub- sequent legislation can chance
But I do not im- acrine that we have
not the power to make any subsequent legislation which may be required to correct such abuses as time may show, violating the spirit and intent of the bill
Why
In one section of the bill there is a pro- vision that the offcen•s must report its condition annually to thc President of the United States, which may show abuses that may require supple- merittu•y legislation
I do not apply this to the lands or credits given by the Government
I Inercly speak of the man- agement of tbc company in securing the great end tn be attained by the bill
If other Senaors say thut there is no such security in the bill, I would certainly vote for such an amendment, no matter what mieht bc the fate of the bill; because, with- out it, a great door to ('l'aud would be opened, and rny constituency would, in the end, be great suf- fen•crs a total failure of' the work
But to proceed
I want to sec Congress make such liberal of aid as shall induce respect- al)le capitalist.s, and not rncre speculators by pro- It is better for the Government, therefore, that fession, to take hold of the cnternrise and to com- a private company undertake the work, offerino• plete it without corning before Congress for addi- that company such inducements and enconra«re tional grants, •which we might be obliged to vote In treating of this subject, and especially at
this ments, in the shape of conditional donations of for, if we would not
lose what we may hayc ap- , it is acrreeable, as well as wise, to reflect, ti me Mr
President, that in the forming of our Federal Constitution little or no attention was paid to the IY)0dc of acquirincr nex.v territory, either by pur- chasc or conquest, consequently no mention is made as to t.he manner in which those Territories i' shall share the benefits of our Federal system, as well as the privilege of independent States
All our legislation on this subject has been ec neces- lands and Government contracts for tl'le trayns- propriatcd in furtherance of' the work
Fully as portation of the luails, of troops, and military many frauds may be committed by giving public stores, as unay be suffcient to insure its final contracts to the lowest bidders, us by giving them completion
Such a of procedure avoids to named corporators
I E) this project, where the many constitutional objections, and is Inore prac- main point to be secured is the perfortnance of tical than n n y other plan which has yet been pro- i the work in a creditable manner, it would not posed

tion would be ample security to make the fulfill- ment of the contract certain
I shat] now consider a point which has given rise to endless discussions, and which is more likely to hamper the friends of this measure in their support of the present bill, (Mr
CURTIS'S,) or any other bill relating to the same subject, than all the constitutional objections urged by its op- I mean the diffcu!ty of selecting the ponents
propcr startin(F point, and the proper direction of the road to the desired terminus
Various routes, in d ifferent latitudes, have
been surveyed,or rather reconnoitered, each route havino• its own particu- lar parlisans in and out of Congress
It would be a hopeless task to endeavor to unite all the friends and partisans of all thcge routes on a par- ticular plan; but I believe the present bill before the Senate satisfies a larger majority of the friends of the measure than any other bill ever before Congress
I am not the advocate of any partic- ular route or routes; neither am I the partisan of a particular latitude
A great deal, perhaps more than is conducive to the success of the measure, has been said on this subject, without produced Inuch conviction, ora disposition on the part of either to yield their predilections
Neither 'have we, I believe, suåcient data to come to a satisfactory conclusion on the subject; for much that has been said and written in regard to it is purely conjecture; for while thc Government omcers have done immense service in their ex- plopations, yet no actual mathematical survey has been had to enable us, or any one else, to determ- ine with absolute accuracy which of all the routes proposed is cheapest, most direct, and the most advantageous
A reconnoisance is not a survey; and for this reason a wide maro•in must be left, as in the present bill, in the computation of the cost and the appropriations necessary to cover such a part of it, as to prevent a failure or the total aband- onrnent of the enterprise
Again: to suppose, as many real friends of this measure contend, that one route only ought to be selected, and that the whole of that route is already sumciently indicated by the explorations which have been made by ordcr of the Government, ap- pears to mc more than hazardous
Some years ago, when the Erie railroad was constructed, that road was thought capable
of absorbing all the trav- e], and even superscdinx steamboats and canals, to the great lakes and Mississippi valley
Now, one and the same Slate, New 'York, furnishes two such roads—namely, the Central, connecting with the Canada railways; and the Erie—while Pennsylvania and Maryland have the Pennsyl- vanja Central and thc Baltimore and Ohio rail- For a time we roads to perform the same offc.e
may have but onc railway to thc Pacific; but as certain as the country will increase in wealth and population, additional roads, brancl)es, and con- nect.ions, will be built to divide the travel and the forwarding of merchandise
It is only the be- ginning which is difficult, and which rcquires an I outlay-of capital disproportionate to the probable It is to start the work, and immediate return; to complete it within a reasonable so as to meet the in-nnediule oc the country and of the civilized world, that the aid of Congress is now invoked
Although it may seem strange that, wl)ike we can 110t acrree on one route, this bill should propose two roads on different routes, yet, in my .l;umblejadgment, we considerably increase the probability of havinæany road built by makii1T provisions for a northern and a soutliern route as the only means of satisfying the majority of Con- TUESDAY, JANUARY 8, 1861
No doubt exists in my mind, that in the course of time both roads, as provided for in the bill be- fore the Senate, will be built, and that they will materially add to the prosperi!y and power of the whole Union
if we cannot divide the road, as seems impossible, between the North and the South, to the satisfaction of all parties, let each of them have a whole road, and let the result show which of the two is the most feasible, and on that account most likely to yield 2-1 return to its stockholders
There seems no other way to bring the difference on this point to a close, or of unitino• a majority on any Pacific railway bill that rntiY at any time be acted upon by Congress
In presenting this view, I am aware it may con- flict with the judgment of the Senator from Mis- sissippi, [Mr
DRvrs,] who has given to the coun- try the benefit of so much patient research and reflection
But even he employs language, in speaking of
the impracticability of the norihern route, whose moderation is worthy of imitation
The honorable Senator says, in his speech before the Senate, in January, 1859: In treating of this northern route, I did not, as the Sen
ator seems to assume, declare that it was irnpracticable
On the other hand, stated that it was practicable—prac- ticable, but vastly expensive; expensive because of its tunnels ; expcnsivc because of the short curves so well described by the Senator fronl Iowa; expensive, also, be- cause of the heavy e:nbankment.s which were to be made, and which, in the very brief period of these explorations, could not be accurately detennined." Now, is it not possible that further explora- tions, for which sufficient time shall bc granted, guided by the interest of the company named in the bill before the Senate, in section one, may, in some measure, modify the conclusions drawn from the results of this hurried exploration
Again: in the Secretary 's report, Captain Pope 's testimony in regard to • the route of the thirty- second parallel is referred to in the followirp terms: From the report of Captain Pope, it would appear that the belt of iZrtiIe land, •vvhieh lies on the west Side of the Mississippi throughout its length extends on this route nearly to the head waters of the Colorado of Texas, in about Ionoitude 1020—that is about, three dearees further west evidence adduced than on the Inore northern routes
in support of this opinion is not., however, conclusive." I quote this language as not only showing the candor of the Senator from Mississippi, but that, oven in his judgment, the explorations made (at least some of tfiem) did not present sufficient datc to bc conclusive on the feasibility of the routes explored
The langua&e, also, of the different reports of the exploring officers made to the Secretary of War, (1Mr
Davis,) is similarly guarded, such as befittcd inen of science to employ, considering their limited opportunities for observation , and the almost entire absence of actual scientific measure- mcnts
Though these reports and thc report of the honorable Secretary of War may sumcc to excite hopes, or to confit'ln predilections in favor of one or the other route, they would scarcely justify a company or companies in making an actual ex- penditure of Ilioney•, and for this reason, the bill beforc us is very properly silent as to the selec- tion ofa specific latitude, giving that privilege to the companies, under certain named restrictions
It is not likely that any company, composed of practical business will commence building either road before a scientific survey has been Iliad—I mean an actual mathematical survey, with proper measurement of distances, and a thor- ough exarnination of the ground at different sea- sons
Alld '•.vheil this is done, though the present gress and of the people of the different secti€ns of bill provides for two roads, I do not think any the country

It is doubtful, in the first place, whether, in the present expanding condition of chemical and geo- logical sciences, any one can justly say, " Tliis is, orforever will be, an irreclaimable wilderness
The valleys of Arizona in July do not look worth the

Whether a wilderness may be reclaimed, oris of value, de- pends alone upon the climate, variation of sea- sons according to latitude, and the character of the people who explore an-d occupy it

How many thousand acres of land in both hemispheres have already been reclaimed by the applications of science ! Again: it is said the land will not support a population, except by artificial irrigation, which IS ministering to it in extremis
To say nothing of the artesian wells so successfully used in my own State, I need only remind Senators that ca- nais are not only now used there for agricultural as well as mining purposes, but have been in Mex- ico and Arizona from immemorial times

17  258 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBEo January 5, The argument " of deep snow," so much writ- ten about, is hardly worth a reply, as there is not a railroad in any of our northwestern States, cer- tainly not one in Canada, that does not, on the return of each winter, undergo as many trials from this much-exaggerated cause as -would any of • the contemplated lines for the road; as it is equally true that there is scarcely a railway in Germany, nono loading through the mountains of Styria, Switzerland, and the Tyrol, which is not occasionally covered with snoi,v to the depth of several feet, and which does not at times require embånlcments of snow to be thrown up to the height of eight ten feet to allow a train to pass
The French marshal, Lacourbe, lost some tcn thousand men on his march through the Tyrol by ravines and precipices; yet, over such roads, a railway is nos,v constructed on which Austria, during the last Italian campaign, in three days, infantry, cav- transported thirty thousand men, alry, and artillery, with horses, am munition, and If the Austrians, who are not the most cannon

The objection also made to the northern route, as to its inutility in winter fi•orn thc ' cxtrenne severity" of the climate, is not worthy of reply, except to remind Senators that it has not bccn many years since he who went from the extremc cast of our country, as it now is, to the valley of thc Ohio or Mississippl, was supposed to himself as a nuu•tyr (to the inhospitable clima-to) in the advancincr eau.se of our institutions

I repeat, Mr

remove, as far as possible, all sources of disagree- rnent and discord on extraneous topics, in order that
our view of the measure itself may not be ob- scured by political mi.vivings and doubts in re- ' gard to ourselves—doubts which can only lessen i us in the eyes of the civilized world, and which, unfortunately for the prestige of our common coun- try, have, for some years past, palsied our legis- more or less, immediate sect.ion of' country will, lation on all national subjects, and enervated our conflict even with Roman devotion to patriotic duty; and we are bound, therefore, to take these i policy till we have seriously endangered—but not and many other things—even the prejudices of' too late to return—that universal respect and ad-

too important Lo pass t.hc bill to make it definite in that point; and furthermore, as I said in my subsequent remarks, the question had been decided in the other House, and had been voted down, and therefore it would endan- ger the bill to insert the amendment in it
of Representatives Inay assume in refusing to do II Now, hope that the Senate; by its vote upon what is just, in refusin<r to do what ought to be the amendment of the Senator • from Missouri, done
I will only add that a refusal of -that sort will indicate that it will not amend the-bill Of the wili not make me submit to do what I do not think House

The Senate bill itself will regard to the infÖrmation I have had of it; but L be destroyed
it cannot get through this body
recollect hearit)ff a gentleman say that this -biil,as The tmn»nent we commence adopting amendments it passed the House, passed as an amendment to to tho bill, it svill bc cut all .to pieces
The Sena- \ an amendment; and, as understood, it passed the I tor from Ohio has indicated that hc is •to I-louse in such wise as that by the parliamentary propose amendments, as has also the-other Suna- Mr POLK
I do not see the difference betwixt rules such amendments could not be offered as tor from Missouri', [Mr
GREEN.] The objections admitting that the point of departure fixed in the would make it acceptable to many members of i indicated by Senators must show those who are bill is the proper point, the onc that the Sena- that House—I will not saya majority—and there- tor prefers, arid saying that the amendment is a fore it was put to the House, take this or noth- proper one
So fur as that point is concerned, ing," just as it is attempted to put it to this Sen- that is all that have just said
I am willinr-» ' takc this or nothing, because the House I am not prepared, however, to be corrected by the Senator, and if will not take anything else.' the Senator from California who spoke last denied on the rumors I have heard, to admit that that is that the amendment is a proper amendment, am I true
I am not prepared to believe, as far as I willing to be corrected in that regard
have had intelligence on this subject, but that this Mr.' LA 'l' HAM
I neithcl' adrnitted nor denied f bill might be amended so that ii would be more i it
I simply said it was encumbcring the bill with an amendment upon which the other branch- had passed its judgment; and therefore deemed it entirely unnecessary to attempt to force it now on the bill, unless he could show that the failure to pass it would open the door to some
o•reat fraud that might be committed
That is what I said, and X.vhat I repeat
Mr
POLK
That is just what 1 said—that no Sei'Y1tor had taken the posilion of denying that the amendment was right in itself, and was cal- culated to advancc the great objects of the bill
'That is exactly what I said; arid I think the re- marks that have just fallen from thc Senator from California justify that assertion on my part
T hen, Mr
President, we come to this: that when au tuncndmeut is proposed to a bili in t Senate, a coördinatc branch of the national Legis- latnrc, we arc not to votc for it, although wc kYiay believe it to bc right and proper, and the very thing that the bill requires, because the bill will be by it; because the bill cannot pass in the House
{ , for one, have never been willing to , allow myself to be controlled by a
consideration hope that the Senate
will do, and of that sort
I intend as an individual, if can, to do what is right, and let the responsibility of defeating the right fall on the other House, or whei•ever else it may belong
acceptable to the House than it
is in the shape in i which it corncs hcrc
But, as I said, I shall not bc bound by such considerations as that
The simplc question now before the Senate is as to the propriety of this amendment
I think the Sena- lor from Ohio, my colleague, and other gentlemen, have made that are vital to this bill; in favor of a Pacific railroad bill—the House bill—that if we commence this system of amend- ment at this period of the session and the present state of the country, we can get no legislation at all
Therefore, I hope the amendment of tho Senator from Missouri will be voted down
The (Mr

POLK] to the original bill
Mr
GREEN

As the Senate is not full, and there are several members absent who perhaps did not expect the vote to be taken to-day, I pro- pose that the bill go over; and therefore move that look to amendments which ought to be put an adjournment, so that we can in & full Senate in it; and when those amendments are offcrcd in vote on this question
I think it is vital to the proper form * have no doubt they will control measure the vote of a majority of this Senate; they will Mr
LATHAM
I hope not; I think my col- certainly control' mine; but, at present, I do not wish to present anything to the Senate beyond which is contained in this simple amendment, and it seems to me The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr

Mr

 260 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 5, amount of shall, on certain terms named in the bill, be delivered to these corpora- tors, and lands be set aside for the purposes and lb is provided to the amount stated in the bill
in the bill that, before the title to these lands shall vest in these gentlemen, and before these bonds shall be defivered to them, certain acts of incor- poration shall be obtained from the different States and Territories through v.zhich this line of railroad is proposed to be constructed
Something was said about that by the Senator from Missouri, (Mr
GREEN,) and an allusion was made to it, It Chink, by my friend from Ohio, [Mr
PUGH.] strikes me as most extraordinary legislation, in the first place, to select certain named gentlemen, and to give them the exclusive power of selecting their associates; and, in the next place, we are to give them very great privileges, and to bestow upon them an immense amount of money in the way of bonds of this Government, besides lands, and xall that, without knowing what privileges they are to obtain from the different States and rrcrritories through which this line of railroads is to be constructed, how long they are to last, what amount of capital is to be llaised for the purpose, anything about it
The whole matter is left to these individuals, controlled alone by the action of the States and Territories through which this kine of railroad is proposed to be constructed
In other words, the bill, as it now stands, allows a perpetuity to these gentlemen
There is no limit whatever to the corporate privileges which they may obtain from the States and r l'erritorios through which this line of road ig to pass; and, as was well said by the Senator frotli Maine, [Mr
FES- SENDEN,) there is no power contained in this bili by which Congress can control these corpora tors r..here is but one pro- in the slightest (lem•ee
vision, as I stated before, looking to that, and that is Ihat, in case these proposed corporators, they have obtained those acts of' Incorporation, fail to discharge the duties which they asstnne t they forfi„qt all discharge
under this bill, and tlieir rights and franchises go to It, ot.ller corporations, 10 be forrned and to be recei ved by this Govern tmnt
as the parties under tl'ie bill; then, and in that case, the Government im- pose other and additional terms; but in that case alone is that retained to Congress
It will be seen at once by the Senate, I think, that this is an immense power (riven to these gen- tlernen, and given to t.hem without limit and with- out
control
Ought •,.ve to do that
The amend- ment whicl'h I have, offered is, that this act shall not tilke effect so far as vesting the bonds and the Innds in these (rent\emen is concerned, until the of incorporation which thcy shall obtain shall be first subt•nitled to and approved by Congress
I It is n think we ought to exact that from them
I-natter of too nluc,h itn portanc,e for us to in trust just such powers as they can obtain thein with t•ro nl tho Stales and r I'errit,ocic.y through which this liuc of railroad bc constru ctcd
ought not
to them such sec wn to Ine that posed to vest in them upon certain conditions and in certain contingencies
Mr
HARLAN
1 desire to ask the Senator from North Carolina if his amendment does not propose to retain jurisdiction in Congress over the laws hereafter to be passed by the States of the Union 
Mr
BRAGG
If the Senator will hear tho amendment read—I ask theQClerk to read it—he will sec that its only effect is, not to give them what this bill proposes to give them until we ap- prove of the acts that may be passed by the States or Territories
Certainly •wre have the power to withhold what is our own until we approve of what it is said they shall first do before they can obtain these benefits which we propose to bestow upon them—nothing more, nothing less
It does not interfere with State legislation at all
Cer- tainly we ought to retain the negative, and for that reason I object to the bill in its present shape, and for that reason I have offered the amendment
Now I ask the Clerk to read the whole proviso as it will stand if amendment be agreed to
r rhc Secretary read, as follows: 'Phnt the said persons and their asso- Provided further, ciates shall not be or bcconne vested with any grant, right, or interest ilitQ11ded to be secured bv the provisions or this act otherwise than in a corporate character and capacity, to first acquired by thenn or such of thern as shall ac- cept the tenns and conditions of this act, within the terri- torial and State jurisdictions into and through which t.he railroad contemplated by this act shall be constructed, nor until said acts of incorporatiorl shall bc submitted to and approved by the Congress or the United States
Mr
PUGH
I syn)pathize with the general proposition of the Senator f'rorn North Carolina; and yet it' wc ever can save the delay which his I am anw•ndmcnt Inn y cause, I would prefer it
averse to the close corporation rnentioned in the e-en t.lernen and letting thorn l)il!, selectin«r certain as.socialcs, and letting thorn shut choose their I would rather sec that part everybody else out
of the bill reconstructed, and appoint these gen- any o t.he comn•) issioners to books of subscription, and let the su t.)scribers have the benefit of the grant, and then they rnay be in- ra t.ed at, t ho d iscrelion of the Legislatures of I object io the exclu- thc States and ' rerritorics
II If we wttit
for these (rentlemeri to sive.ncss of it
eyet acts of incorporation, they rnay not get thern•, they froin one State or one r I'crrUory, and not from another
As the Senator from Mis- souri truly remarked, the whole enterprise 'nay break down frotn the non-acl,ion of the Territory of Utah
She rnay refuse to give any act of in- corporation, and then you have no railroad by the terms of the bill
I am struck also by the fact, that I cannot now recollect any provision in this bill, whereby Con- press or the Governnoent can, at any future time, the owner of this work by purchase
think there was such a provision In the bill we had bci'ore us two years since, and [ should like to know whether it has been omitted from this bill framed, and upon which the grant bv Congress is to be made, is so objectionablc that; if gentlemen will for one monaent reflect upon it, it is impos- Sible that anybody can vote for it
What is [he proposition, sir
The proposition is, by bill, to select fifty-three citizens of the United States; to select them from fourteen States, leavinr-r nineteen States out; and tö give to these fifty-three individ- uals, thus selected from fourteen States, control over and do not know how many million acres of public lands
The bill proceeds, if it is worth anything at all, upon the supposition that by granting ths privi- leges contained in the bill, you will induce unen to encaoe in this work because they can make If that is not the purpose, the money out ot it
bill falls without effect
No man will ever en- gage in this enterorise and invest in it his rneans, his labor, and his time, except upon the expecta- tion that he will make money by so doing
It is If this bill, then, a purely industrial enterprise
as by its theory it must, confers privileges upon its corporators or grantees, upon what basis can this Congress undertake to select fifty •three indi- viduals in the United States residing in fourteen States out of the thirty-three, and give them the whole 
for is what this bill does—no 'nore, no less
The bill, after selece.ing, this number of citizens, provides that the whole of the grants con- tained in it
of land and money shall go to them and to such persons as a majority of them shall admit as their associates
The State of Kentucky is generously provided for in the bill
One of her citizens is picked out that may share in the benefits of the bill
The State of Tennessee also, with the kind consider- ation of those who have provided us with the arrangements made in this bill, will have one cit- izen within its limits provided with a share of the benefit
New York takes ten, Pennsylvania six, Ohio four, Indiana four, Illinois four, Missouri four, Iowa four, California four
Where are the other States
Have they seceded, are they to bc expelled
If there is to be any opportunity the citizens of the other States of the Union to take any interest in the grants contained in , let some provision be made, by which each citizcu of thc United States, upon agreeing to coy) tribute his share of money and responsi- bility towards the building of this road, shall I-lave his share of the advantages conferred by it
Now, certainly with this feature in the bill, it does not seem to me that any gentleman '.vho is here to legislate for the Union and not for a job, can give his consent to any such scheme as this
You observe, sir, that there is no provision in this bill by which the citizens of the United States under any circulnstances can share in its benefits, without the consent ofa majority of men whom you picked out yourselves as the grantees
not know inany of these gentlemen
They may be very good and very proper gentlemen to be the recipients of such a great favor of Congress; but If there is no way by i has any connnittee of this body examined into i by accident
or design; the nan')es of the
persons who are to be these an irn ot' the public (l ornain, and of which we can ever pu rchas•e the road, and these I-noncy, without knowing how it is to persons may corporators in perpetuity, grantees
Who has selected them 
We are told th<'i p u l.)lic It will certainly be a very great obstacle to the by the Senator from California that we must not be managed, and by whon), and to what extent, II change this bill, or it is gone; so that we are not colonization and settlernent the new 'l'erritories
and how long t.hese powers ure to continue
It all, however, cotnes back to what I said ut only to givc thcsc great powers and privileges, INow, sir, -if the amendment bc adopted, as I ink it ought to , tile only oflöctQfit which can be cornpläined of will be thtlt it inay delay this great work a little
Gentlemen are in hot haste eun be no great xtvl)iEc before it into operation
acts of' incorporation, if they can be obtained all, will be obtained and submitted to Con(rress
We Shall then know what we are doing; we shall if this amendment be the acts before us
have adopted, or if it be not adopted, I expect to follow it with one providing that those acts of incorpo- in so rnany and grants of land and rnonc•y to a body ot• men; I think the i.)ill needs revision places to a-uard against
abuse, und to guard ü2ainst we ure not only to have fifty-three in the what may turn out to be a injury to the l')ub- United States picked out to whom these grants are to be given, but we are not even allowed thc that, while _t tun disinciined to vote an privilege of picking out the men to whom operation of the arnendrnent

I find that the Senator frorn State Legislatures or from the 'Ilerritorial Assem- Nort.h Carolina was right in the nuunber, and that what scheme or what speculation may be behind I do not know what bodies of men may have , it; I wish it to be like any I I was in error

All these matters none I propose to leave blank

I that, for many years past, have departed from certilinly the mention of certain names in the bill will be no obstacle to including others in the spe- Cial privileges granted to those individuals named in the bill; and if he regards his State, or the cit- izens of his State, as cut out of any of thosc priv- ileges and benefits, if he will propose the name of any gentleman, or any number of gentlemen, whom ho regards as respectable, enterprisincr men, who will take hold of this niattel' and push it through, as it is supposed the gentlemen named would do, I have no doubt the Senate would vote them in, •if he makes that a cause of complaint
Mr

That is my answer
Mr
BENJAMIN
I will prepare an amend- ment in accordance with the views I have ex- pressed, by which thc privileges of this bill shali be thrown open to every citizen of the United States, and not confined to a close corporation
those with whom was usually associated, in ad- I vocating some plan of coupling the Pacific coast with the valley of the
Mississippi
i have con- , sidercd it a physical problem, worthy of the high- cst cfTorts of a great pcoplc, to overcome that diff- culty which, in ail history, has shown that inen could not be aggregated together under one Gov- ernmcnt if they were divided by ilnpassable I have thought it an achievement mountains
worthy of our age and of our people, to couple with bonds of iron the people of the Pacific svith the valley of the Mississippi, and show that even the snow-capped mountains intervenin«ycould not divide them
At the saune time, I have believed also that this was only to be done by throwing the route open I to the selection of the capitalists who were to build the road, and giving those advantages which the Government might give as a party in interest, to be, benefited by the construction of a road for its •purposes; not making a Government road, nor making it out of the Treasury of the United States, regarding it as a road which had commercial and political considerations in which individuals might have interests, and in which the Government had an interest for the transportation of its troops, its munitions, its mails, and to that extent become a party to its construction
But, sir, there never has been a day, emulous as I was to see t.his great triumph achieved by my country, when I would have consented to turn over this great enterprise to the hands of a self- constituted corporation, men who have, named themselves, and get Congrcss to take their namcs, that they may be recipients of grants so extensive ill their character, that the world has never seen the like—powers, the cnd of which no man can see, for this great artery that couples the pro- We have seen now -:mode "Of objection, which the time will it, with the appearance frienaship, but with all the tenacity of enmity
Gentlemen forget in their objections, as I think, whatever may be learned from experience as to legislation upon subjects somewhat kindred
Now; I usrk derstand the distinguished Senator from Missis- sippi, who has just spoken, to sty that he-will not go for any measure which will give the Gov- ernment political control, and that he will not go for any measure which will tend to enrich- indi• viduals
Mr
DAVIS
• Isaid nothing of that sort
Mr
BAKER
Did you not say so, sir
Mr
DAVIS
1 said I would go for no organ- ization which was for the purpose-of enriching in - dividuals
Any public work m which individuals engage may enrich them; but if the object is to enrich them, I scorn the cormection
Mr
BAKER
And, Mr
President, that scorn will no doubt be very effectual in that respect, from the present appearance of things
am afraid the gentleman will scorn any road
I think the scorn that you express as to that will attach itself to any proposition that we, who really dc- sire a road, may make
I think what the gen- tleman has said foreshadows that very clearly
That line of objection which attacks a measure because the Government, may have too much to do with it, and which expends itself in increased zeal of attack because individuals may have too much to do with it, will leave it between two stools, and Ict it fall to the ground
One gentleman objects that he will not make grant of land to anybody, for anything, exccpt subject to the condition that Congress shall super- vise State legislation and approve the acts of in- corporation that individuals may get at the hands of the State governments: All that class of ob- jection is—I will not say intended, but I will say framed—to defeat the road
Now, after ten years' struggle; after hope so lonc delayed; when the Repi•esentativcs of the peopl) by a large ma- jörity, after every conceivable objection has been made and answered and overcome; now, when the condition of public affairs, when a desire to end sectional strife, when desire for the Union, when every reason so well presented by the dis- tinguishcd Senator from New York would seem to point out LO us the necessity of doing it now, ductive recrions of the Pacific coast with the pro- i and at once, it appears to me that weare further off from it to-day than ever; and the
reason why it dact.ive regions of the valley of the Mississippi, is to have a controlling power, financial and po- litical, beforc which the United States Bank stands but asapitrmy
To turn this all over, then, to a self-constituted corporation, and here to vvrrangle i about whether it shalk start from a certain initial point or not; whether it shall wind through a ccr- tain valley, or whether it shall take some other linc, is to waste the encrcries of a great people upon the greatest physical problem that has ever been offered to the consideration of man
have none of it
I will support no bill which bears upon its face t.he brand of being the means of It nmst be thrown enriching certain individuals
open as a great public work to the people of the United States
The Government must have no other connection with it than as u party in inter- est
The Government mast be separated from all political control over it; and thus alone will I ever vote for it, devoted as have been to the idea that I it was an essential work, not only to secure these parts of the Union together which were divided by an impassable mountain, but for the achieve- ment of the great objects for which our Govern- ment vv'as instituted while it lasts
have, therefore, not attempted to offer any amendments, and had not intended to intrude into the debate
have intended to vote against every proposition which attempted either to establish the road or to organize a company for the con- struction of such a road
Let the Government offer those privileges which it is authorized to give
to any company which will build it; let that company locate it where the hand of nature has designated the road should be built; and then I say we should all give it our support

strikes me that we are further than usual (if that be possible) is this: that Objections which I think have been answered in every State Legislature on every incorporation bill from the time legislation cornrnenced on such subjects, seem to weigh here with unwontcd force on the minds of a large majority of this body
Take the sectional objection offered by my dis- tinguished friend from Louisiana; and I attempt to answer it, for I see it must devolve on some- body to answer these objections briefly
Let mic say that I came here, scarcely having time
to read the bill caretülly
1 came here finding it in the charge of men very much abler and more expe- rienced thau myself; and I regret that it appears to me proper that I should take up the time of the Senate to reply at all
Still, I think it is proper; and I do it
The gentleman from Louisiana says —looking at the sectional aspect of the subject— (for what can be considered in this body without being sectional.) here are fifty-three individuals, your corporators, from fourteen States
Now, sir, this bill proposes two roads, and not one: two sets of corporators, and not one; and I think the gentleman, in fairness, ouo•ht to have stated that fact in conjunction with what he has said
It is true that thc corporators for one road are selcctcd in fourteen States of the Union; but it is also true, as a matter of fact, as I am informed, that the grant which is made to the persons who are to be Incorporated to make the second road—the Texas road—inures really to persons all over the south- ern portion of this Union
And if gentlemen had paid the attention to this subject they do pay to most others, I think they would have learned that Mr
BAKER
1 had been led to suppose, when from the history of its passage through the other I came here, that there was a party in Congrcss House, and would have accommodated their views to that fact
Now, I submit to the Senate that in favor ofa Pacific railroad

Bui again, sir, everybody knows that the his- that may be offered wliich think has a tendency that is proposed into the hands of its enelnies
 262 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 5, tory of making railroads in this country is an at- tempt upon the part of the Government, where they do give advantages to somebody, to combine individual skill and effort and caution with Gov- ernment power and authority and money
That is the use ofa bill incorporating individuals, and has been from the beginning
if, according to the plan which, perhaps, is suggested by the gen- tleman from Mississippi, the Government alone were to do it, we have always been told that the Government would spend money in the most wasteful and inefii)ctivc way in the world
There- fore, the usual course has been to unite the skill and care of ind i vidnals in the Govern ment expend- It follows iture
This bill endeavors to do that
out the plan that States adopt, and, I believe, the plan that Congress has often adopted before
adopts the plan upon which the great railroads of Illinois have been built—a plan which , in my judg- roent, has proved itself more successful than any other upon which a Gc»vernment has ever at- tempted to complete a great work for the benefit I submit that as, I think, an an- ot• its people
swer to that class of objection
It may be, Mr
President, that it is very vn•ong for the gentleman from California to say, Do not 'I'he artyument springs up on arnend this bill." every hand: What! not amend the bill
cx- crcise our judgment
notdo what we think rioht." Why, sir, these objections are Inade QI) every petty bill in every State Legislature, and they are r Ilhe obicc- answered us often as they are made
lion has for its foundation this, and no more: that we, as Senators here, ave not to vote for any noeas- ure which does hot, in all its details, meet the entire approval of our judgment; or, voti ng for such a klieusure, we are not to accord anything to the wishes, the in terests, the apprehension of other }ilco us, ure vested with gentlen.en, who, tive authority
Sir, it• l.hat rule svere to prevail, what nneasurc would pass, what bill bc- come a law
that spirit of conces»ion— —I will use Again, sir, the word, foi• it is corn f')rornise, for —which the gentlmnan fro n'h California it is usual invokes hero to-day , is onc essential to legislation, not only so far as the thing itself is concerned, but as to the mode of accornp!ishing it
Look at the state of things to-day
At the et')d of ten years' struggle, I •repeat, thc House of Representatives, one branch of Congress, has, after three years' continuous labor upon one by its co:nrnittees, tested by all of aro•ument, in the midst of a very c.xcitino• *fictional contro- acn•eed upon aml passed by a large jorit.y
"I' hc gentlcnnen who opposed it there were from Mississippi, und from Louisiana, and frot•n various other States frorn which these objections conue here; arid without having all the
gra.vily and all the experience and perhabs all the wisdot•n of who so worthily represent their States , in the other branch of Congress—this bod y—they at
any rate, as thc debat.es will shov

if
is t hc best measure, but
that it is the only practical , and it is a real, philosophic concession to events and of extending the power this Government; I wish it was a more consolidated and a stronger Government than it is; I have nota bit of respect for this idea of States' rights, Which I think is now convulsing the country to its center; and if I had my choice, my way, I would build the road with the power of the Govern merit, with the money of the Government, for the benefit of the people; and I would build it at any cost, and I would build it right off
But I cannot have my way; am obliged to concede, to compromise
Accord- prominent and powerful men with your act
You beean that policy
That has been the idea gov- erning this bill from the beginning, and I ask you why you are to abandon it now
As to the
selection of individuals, let me say but one word: I think I beard the distinguished Senator from New York say, within half an hour, that so far from New York having any particular interest in this biil by prearrangement, for hin")• self he hardly knew who thc indi viduais were that ingly, i meet the Senator from California, with whom it is not my fortune to agree about hardly anybhing in the world, and I adapt myself, as far as I can, to his plan; and, as I understand it, he, in turn, conforms himself to the opinions of va- rious other distinguished gentlemen on this floor, not getting that which he would desire, but get- Lino the best that he can, harmonizing all intcr- ests, and, if he can, settling all conflict
[s any great Sir, is not that statesmanlike
measure over adopted otherwise either in Gov- ernment or in administration
Was not the Con- Is not everything done so stitution formed so
in a free Government
And to say to will not go for the greatest nueasut•e of the acre or of the world, because it does not begin exactly at the right spot, because the money is not spent by exactly the right man, because it docs not end would be to divide exactly in the right place," us into endless fractions ot• opinion, never able to arrive at a sensible result
Therefore it is that I appeal, not to the enemies of the bill; but to its friends—men who have advocated it in the country, in the discussions beföre the people; men who come here to reflect the real, true opin- ion of their States—I ask them now, in the timc in its very agonies, to 'rive up I-nere of its trial, questions of locality, to give up objection* as to this rnan or the other, and agree with v,' hat the deliberate wisdom of the popular branch, afiel Lhrec years' effort, has determined to be practical
Now, sir, there are objections which nuq
in this another way, and i allude, way Inn y be met in Wilh great deference, to the opinion of In y friend f'ron) Maine
He says the bill is a contract, antl before we make it, we ought to be very careful in amel')ding it, because we cannot amend it after- 'l' here is, in in y dcrnent, ore wa rds
ill that objection than in any that has been offered here
Let Ine Iry, however appealing to his can- r i'he c.xporie.ncc o, ita I cannot at')swer that
legislation, worth much, shows that whenever a legislative bodv, either ot• State grove VI) rne.nt or the Federal Government, p roposes a Incas u kind red to this in anywise, there are many defects and iliac.curac:es
MT hilc it assumes the charac- ter of grant to parties, and therefore a contract, there is also between them and the much that is mandatory ül)d director" the and there are sons who are t.o execute the also things in which the persons who receive the benefit of the grant are ns nnu:li interested to ve possibly a chano•e Inade as t lie Govprnnu»nt can when make the title-papers, by be

can be no trouble found in get.tincr practical the corporation to arrree to all sensible, , amend Inerlts, because it is always their interest were named in the bill at all
Sir, if that class of objection is to prevail, I should not be astonished if, after the Senate were to vote down an amend- ment to strike out the individual corporation idea altogether, somebody should get up next and at- I repeat, that tack some individual corporator
is the plan which I think matured reflection has proposed, and it is not becoming tho friends of this bill to allow the measure to be defeated by striking out that part of the plan now
I have but one, other word, and I close
I have spoken already longer than I intended

My distinguished friend from Louisiana knows that that is so when he attacks it with I think the gentle- I his acuteness and vigor

Mr
DAVIS
I do not intend to answer the Senator at any length; but he speaks of econony, and I suppose he-means certainly not econotuy in words, from the manner in which he has dis- cussed it
But hc announccs, with somewhat a we, the friends of this bill,' 'and and 1 points to others as the cncmics of the bill; was at a loss to know what he meant

quite apparent, sir, that the Senator well said that had barely had limo to read the bill, though he annou i')ced hirnself that he had bce.n studying He seemed to pass over alto- it for ten years

263 body, to its special committee, its majority and minority report; and if he knew it, he was bound to have referred to it, because then he must have understood better than he seems to understand the character o
the proposition which i suggested in lieu of that which was before us, because it has been before.this body, printed, and discussed in it when we had not the advantage of being in- structed by the Senator
With his view of Gov- ernment, in "'hich he holds light the doctrine of State-right, and would build this road by the Government alone, there could be very little of constitutional obiection to any plan which could be presented
rithcre is still, however, a party in the Senate who do not hold such views; there are still those who believe this to be a Government of the States; who believc it to be a Union of Slates voluntarily associated together; and that every measure is to have a distinct reference to the interests and the safety of the States; that we live under a Constitution, a written compact made by the States, and that a measure is not to be passed here because it is the behest of a party
That man forgets his duty as a Senator who would put the interests of a party above the in- tct•ests of the country
i do not know, Mr
President, what right the Senator has thus to assume to mark out the bounds und lirnits within this body of the friends and enemies of the great measure of coupling the val- 1 ley of the Mississippi with the Pacific ocean
do not know what right he has to introduce a Flew banner hore under which men are compelled to I do not knoi'i,y what labors the Senator march 
may have performed, nor how deep his interest I might match my labors against his, how- is
ever, on the
great Ineasure, and leave others to decide which 'had done most to advance it
The rernarks I made, sir, were not made as an enemy of u railroad which shöuld couple the Mississippi river and the Pacific ocean; but as a friend of the measure, which I believed could be efiuctuated only in one method, which, on former occasions, have more fully explained than it is needful for me to do now
I'vly objection to thc present plan is one which I have a right to make, and, most of all, because ofthc deep study I have given to the subject, and because of another proposition, which I once before presented to the Senate, which I believed rendered it, easy to construct a road, and to separate it from all dregs of party and sectional politics, by puttino• it on the basis of a great national construction, to be made by those who chose to invest their Htoney in it; and leaving to thorn, (in order that no sectional ad- vantage might be acquired by anybody,) by a study of the face of the country, and followmg the precepts of nature, to decide where they would build the road, which they could thus make prof- itabie to themselves, they furnishing the money, they locatine the road, and the Government giv- ing that aid iR the Territories to couple the States of the valley of the Mississippi with thosc of the Pacific, which it was competent for the Govern- ment to give as a areat party in interest
If, r_./lr
President, this mcasure shall fail; if we shall never achieve the great ßbiect of overcom- ing the physical difficulties thÅt threaten some day or other to separate two portions of country now united together; if, indeed, we may hope to look forward to their remaining together until thus separated by natural causes, the cause of the failure of the measure will not be the opposition which I havc presented; but if men confine the reward to a corporation, to particular individuals who are to be enriched by the bill, I leave them to the enjoyment of it, and will remain under the consolation that I have followed, so far as could, the doctrines of the Constitution, and been gov- erned by the finger of nature as it pointed to the location ofa road where physical obstacles most disappeared
