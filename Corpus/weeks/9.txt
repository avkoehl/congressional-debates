 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBFR the proper
 inquisition and pass the deserved
 and appropriate judgment upon it
 Entertaining the opinions which I
 have thus very briefly expressed
 in reference to the amend
 ment now pending before the
 Senate i shall give I
 my vote so as to
 rctain thc duty upon sugar
 as provided in the original
 bili of the House of
 Rep resentatives which provides a
 specific duty of 1 cent
 upon the pound and is
 just about equivalent to thæ
 existing ad valorem duty of
 24 per cent upon the
 cost Mr 1 did not
 desire to say a word
 upon this subject because I
 believe it is always unwise
 to make speeches on measures
 which you wish to hurry
 through but this sub ject
 of the duty on tea
 and coffee has not bcen
 very often discussed and I
 wish to say a word
 in I have always been
 opposed to relation to it
 taxing the prime necessaries of
 life My own feeling and
 I very often act more
 on my feelings than my
 judgment is against interfering with
 the duty on sugar My
 motives at this time are
 that in raisino a system
 of revenue it is wise
 and right that all the
 varied interests and various sections
 I one of the country
 should be taken care of
 who has no difficulty in
 saying that I am in
 favor of protection to American
 man ut ac turcs and
 Amer ican products of every
 kind Some gentlemen on I
 have both sides have a
 delicacy on that subject I
 believe too that in raisino
 revenue for none this country
 this great and extensive country
 as it was the other
 day and as I hope
 it will al ways be
 the duties required to meet
 the wants of the Government
 when properly distributed will protect
 every great interest of the
 country I do not look
 upon Louisiana as having left
 us I look upot that
 rather as the prodigal son
 who has run away at
 present but who will come
 back after awhile throwing himself
 upon our kindness and our
 protectiorv and thorefore if were
 ieft to myself would leave
 this protection to their great
 industrial interest sugar Other gentlemen
 think differently and in accordance
 with all rny motions in
 legislation 1 go with a
 rnajority of those who act
 with me havinø no faith
 in my own judgment especially
 I trust to the aggregate
 judgment of those with whom
 I act They think it
 is wise to reduce thc
 duty upon sugar one fourth
 and put the remainder on
 tea and coffee which are
 in relative _positions with scvar
 and I yield to that
 I do not believe that
 this revenue upon tca and
 coffee is going increase the
 price at all The uniform
 practice of the world and
 of the tea and coffee
 producing countries especially has been
 to put on an export
 tax which is vaned from
 time to time to accommodate
 itself LO the unportation I
 remember that tax levied in
 other countries was the case
 with Cuba some years ago
 When we reduced thc duty
 on sugar they put on
 a slight to hear the
 honorable Senator from Vermont de
 clare that the party about
 to cömeinto power ex pected
 to conduct the Government upon
 more economical principles than has
 heretofore been I had supposed
 from the votes of Sena
 done tors on that side
 of the Chamber that they
 in tended to take a
 different course They have not
 only voted at this session
 to borrow 35 000 000
 but there is a provision
 in this very bill to
 bor row 21 000 000
 more making an addition of
 56 000 000 to the
 public debt and besides that
 they have carried through this
 body bill appro priating 121
 000 000 to the three
 Pacific railroads That is an
 addition to the indebtedness of
 the country of at one
 session Just t hink of
 it Oat preSent debt is
 about 69 000 000 and
 here is to be an
 addition of 177 000 000
 to it am gratified however
 to find that the purpose
 is not to carry out
 that system Again the Senator
 from Pennsylvania says that he
 is very averse to lam
 very much pleased with that
 declaration but it does seem
 to me that his line
 of action is very in
 consistent Surely iron is a
 necessary put the question to
 a farrner whether he would
 rather give up his plows
 and axes or up his
 tea and coffee I think
 he would say he must
 have his working tools Ask
 a man whether his shoes
 and coat and blanket are
 more important to him than
 his tea or coffee and
 I think he Would be
 apt to say that the
 former stood in the first
 rank If thc honorable Senator
 will go of neces sariés
 with us in making a
 bill which relieves the com
 munity which chables those who
 are obliged to have these
 necessaries of life to get
 them on the cheapest terms
 he shall have my codpention
 But if it is merely
 limited to smne particular things
 which may be regarded as
 necessaries and the great burden
 nf t er all is
 to fall on what everybody
 is obliged to use so
 as to fall heaviest on
 the poor of the country
 I cannot go with him
 IVIt CAMERON A single word
 to the Sen ator from
 North Carolina He talks about
 the I want to know
 how a farmer will get
 farmers his tea and coffee
 they come from abroad Mr
 CLINGMAN Then why the plow
 dear by taxing thc material
 of which it is made
 I desire Pennsylvania to That
 is the question make plows
 but I wish her to
 make them and sell them
 at as cheap rates as
 tl lcy can be had
 else where I am willing
 to impose some tax on
 it I am willing to
 tax everything that is consumed
 but unfortunately the discrimination is
 ævrainst thc poor mainly it
 is against the necessaries of
 life and if you will
 look over the list you
 will find that those which
 are cheapest generally arc lux
 I should say tea and
 coffee were nearer to unes
 luxuries than other articles that
 we are speaking of WILSON
 The Senator from Vermont exportation
 tax to correspond l hat
 has been I expressed the
 hope that we are to
 have an Admin istration that
 is to be more ccononoical
 than the the case with
 the Brazilian coffee and I
 have concur with him in
 that hope and I trust
 looked with astonishment and wor
 der at the wis that
 that l ope is not
 to be disappointed V hat
 has been dom with which
 that Empire of Brazik ever
 however rnay bc the failings
 of the incom They always
 manage their affairs for the
 benefit of their and their
 people and ing Administration I
 do not think it becomes
 any I wish our people
 would pay a little attention
 to of the gentlemen who
 have sustained the past Administration
 to make any reflections in
 advance I do not believe
 this duty will in that
 subject should like to reduce
 the duty uon sugar Every
 body feels that that duty
 has been high thatyii never
 ought to have been so
 high as it has Euled
 4for the past few yearsi
 have myself beenGn favor of
 its reduction and I am
 so still buts as tha
 Senator from Vermont has Saidi
 we cannot now sparo the
 money which We receive ffo
 m thdt sou rcc and
 besides 1 do not wantito
 giVe aavobe liere that can
 be unders_tood by anybody inLthe
 country as having bcen Oaused
 by an yfeeling groWings out
 of the action of Louisian
 r I regaid Louisiana a
 part of my country and
 whatever may be the action
 of that Statenowiil have undoubting
 to nfidence that timé will
 come and that not far
 istant when those wan dering
 States that have rushed out
 of the Union without the
 shade or the shadow a
 cnåses will see their errors
 at d will return to
 this Govern ment and in
 the future uphold the Constitution
 and the flag of our
 common country 172herefoée do not
 wish to give a vote
 thabmay be supposed to strike
 at any of the peculiar
 interests of that State and
 besides we want the revenue
 to be de rived from
 sugar If the present rate
 of duty was not there
 by taw I might not
 consent to put it there
 would place it at n
 lower rate Now a single
 word in regard to the
 proposition to tax tea and
 coffee That we need an
 increase of révonue we all
 admit but tea and coffee
 for years have come into
 this country duty free They
 enter every family they are
 used in every cabin of
 the country if we here
 in the Senate amend this
 bili by putting a tax
 on tea and have the
 irnpression that it will fail
 in the House of It
 it be put in the
 bill although Represc n tatives
 it will gi ve us
 4 000 000 or 5
 increased revenue it will be
 the theme of demagoguism all
 over the country The charge
 will be made thåt we
 h avc made a tariff
 for the protection of certain
 interests of iron in of
 textile I fabrics and that
 becausewc have madea protect ive
 tariff we have been forced
 to tax teaand coffee In
 111 y judgment the friends
 of this measure had better
 not incur the opposition that
 may be made ill the
 I louse of Representatives had
 better not incur the hostilitv
 that may be excited in
 the coun try by imposing
 a lax on tea and
 coffee and so I fee
 constrained to vote against the
 believing proposition of lhc Senator
 from Rhode Island I know
 we have debts impending upon
 us forced upon us by
 extravaoance some perhaps by thc
 grossest dishonesty I hope that
 these things are to be
 corrected in the future but
 to day here and now
 I feel that my duty
 requires me to vote against
 the amendment moved by the
 Senator from Rhode Island Mr
 HALE I want to ask
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 a question I understand that
 he submitted an estimate of
 what would be the amount
 of duty on tea and
 coffee together sire to know
 if he is prepared to
 state to the Sen ate
 what it would be severally
 how much of it would
 come from tea and how
 much from coffee Mr SIMMONS
 i have not the paper
 here on which the estimate
 was made but I should
 think there was about two
 thirds of it from cof
 fee It is com Mr
 HALE lam glad to hear
 it mob in this discussion
 to speak of tea and
 coffee as if they occupied
 precisely the same relation to
 the consumption of the country
 and it is said that
 they are used in every
 cottage in every home however
 humble I apprehend that it
 is not true of them
 equally ahat what is true
 of tea is nat true
 of coffee Tea comes nearer
 to being con crease the
 price of tea and coflöe
 at all I never make
 appeals to the Senate or
 the coun 1 you Mr
 President try about thc poor
 that the poor people are
 the least exacting of all
 the people of t his
 country Thev always take care
 of themselves As I said
 the other day give them
 protection to their labor and
 J mean by that give
 thern fair wages for what
 they do and they I
 have seen very few ask
 no other protection poor people
 in this country because I
 believe no man is poor
 who lives within his means
 The man who gets a
 dollar a day and lives
 within that dollar a day
 is as rich as the
 millionaire s vho lives up
 to his income That sort
 of people only want to
 get a fair price for
 their labor and to be
 protected against t be labor
 of other countries who have
 not the same virtue or
 the same intelligence and the
 same industry which they have
 All our revenue laws for
 the last ten or fifteen
 years havo tended to protect
 the pauperlabor of Europe which
 sends your false invoices in
 here and which drives I
 say I the Arnerican laborer
 frotn his supper shall for
 this alteration the stvat duty
 not frotn n y own
 judgment or my own heart
 but because sviser nu n
 think it right IVIr CLINGMAN
 I was very muchgratified in
 regard to what the next
 Administration rnay do concerning the
 revenue and the finances of
 the Government The present Administration
 came into power four years
 acro with in the public
 Treasury and with the creditofthe
 country hich advanced r I
 hev go out of power
 with a pub lic debt
 of 80 000 000 and
 the credit of the coun
 try impairdd and a most
 destroyed And sir the sidered
 a necessity coffee a luxury
 records of the present Congress
 will show that by Mr
 GRIMES I t is right
 t he reverse with us
 the action of the majority
 the responsible ma i in
 the West I Mr HALE
 am told that I am
 going on my joritv of
 the House of Representatives t
 he ex pendituresofthis Government have
 been cut down i Nesv
 England habits and that while
 what I have said is
 true of New England it
 is not true of the
 by millions from what the
 Executive Departinents asked and their
 recommendations were generally West i
 know that among the people
 whom i represent it is
 eminently true that tea is
 an arti supported by their
 friends in Congress tare here
 to day to say that
 the record will show I
 cle of universal consumption among
 the very that those who
 are now cormnff into power
 have i poorest and coffee
 is very filthepe are checked
 the expenditures of the out
 croin r Admin very many
 families who have a laree
 consump tion of tea that
 never use coffee I told
 by istration millions of dollars
 below what they dc the
 Senator from Michigan Mr BINGHAhf
 that manded sb ould like
 then to have Rut sir
 I suppose these remarks are
 made be is so everyxyvhere
 cause we on this side
 of the Chamber are in
 favor a division of the
 question on this amendment so
 of sorne measures of public
 policy that may bc as
 to have a vote first
 upon the duty on coffi
 e separate from that on
 tea Is it divisib e
 a drain on the Treasury
 of the country On re
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FOSTER
 flection I think I shall
 vote against the proposi tion
 made by the Senator from
 Rhode Island i I The
 amendment proposed is subject to
