 at this as an impotent

 we shali bc amply supplied
 from the same sources as
 now almost exclusively furnish the
 means for car rying on
 with such unexampled vigor the
 Afri can slave trade New

 mercantile marine must either sail

 these remedies we will pass

 civilized nation now is governed
 in its foreicrn relations by
 the rule of recognizing Governments

 doctrine of the de jure

 their power within their own
 limits How long think you
 will the great naval Powers
 of Europe permit you to
 im pede their free intercourse
 with their best cUs tomers
 for their various fabrics and
 to stop the sup plies
 of the great staple which
 is the most important basis
 of their manufacturing industry by
 a mere paper blockade You

 much of this We desire
 not to speak to you
 in terms of bravado or

 who determined to break off
 unpleasant incom patible and unprofitable
 relations cease to bandy words

 differences shall be decided by
 blows or by the code

 rcc oonize as that of
 honor We shall do with
 you as the French guards
 did with the English at
 the battle of Fontenoy In
 a preliminary skirmish the French
 and English guards met face
 to face the English guards
 courteously saluted their ad versaries
 by taking off their hats
 the French re turned the
 salute with equal courtesy Lord
 Hay of the English guards
 cried out in a loud
 voice Gentlemen of the French
 guards fire Count D Auteroche
 replied in the same tone
 Gentle men we never fire
 first The Encriish took them
 at their word and did
 fire first Being at close
 quarters the effect was very
 destructive and the French were
 for a time thrown into
 sorne dis order but the
 fortunes of the day were
 soon re stored bv the
 skill and courage of Marshal
 Saxe and the English under
 the Duke of Cumberland suffered
 one of the most disastrous
 defeats which their military annals
 record Gentlemen we will not
 fire first We have often
 seen it charged that the
 present movement of the southern
 States is merely the consummation
 of a fixed purpose long
 enter taincd by a few
 intriguers for the selfish object
 of personal ago randizement There
 never was a i greater
 error if we were not
 about to part we I
 should saya grosser or more
 atrocious calumny Do not deceive
 yourselves this is not the

 such be not the case

 its truth we can give
 no stronger illustration than the
 vote in the Lou sianacoavention
 Of one hundred and thirty
 mem bers every delegate being
 In his seat one hun
 dred and thirteen voted for
 immediate secession and of the
 seventeen who voted against it
 thcre were not more than
 four or five who did
 not ad Init the necessity
 of separation and only differed
 as to the time and
 mode of its accomplishment Nor
 is the mere election by
 the forms of the Constitution
 of n President distasteful to
 us the cause as it
 is so often and so
 confidcntly asserted 46 TUESDAY FEBRUARY
 5 1861 of our action
 It is this we all
 consider the elec tion of
 Lincoln with his well known
 antece dents and avowed principles
 and purposes by a decided
 majority over all other candidates
 com bined in every non
 slaveholding Stale 011 this side
 of the Pacific slope noble
 gallant New Jersey alone excepted
 as conclusive evidence of the
 de termined hostility of the
 northern masses to our institutions
 We believe that he conscientiously
 entertains the opinions which he
 has so often and so
 explicitly declared and that having
 been elected on the issues
 thus presented he will hon
 estlv endeavor to carry them
 into exccution While nosv we
 havc no fears of servile
 insur rection even of a
 partial character we know that
 his inauguration as President of
 the United States with our
 assent would have been considered
 by Inany of our slaves
 as thc day of their
 emanci pation and that the
 4th of March would have
 witnessed in various quarters outbreaks
 which nlt hougl l they
 would have been promptly sup
 prcssed would have carried ruin
 and devastation to nmny a
 southern home and have cost
 the lives of hundreds of
 the misguided victims of northern
 negrophilism Senators six States have
 now severed the liliks that
 bound then I to a
 Union to which we s
 vere all attached as well
 by many tics of material
 well bcine as by the
 inheritance of common glories in
 the past and the well
 founded hopes of still more
 brillial t destinies in the
 future Twelve seats are now
 vacant on this floor The
 work is only Jt requires
 no spirit of prophecy yet
 but begun to point to
 many many chairs around us
 that will soon like ours
 be unfilled and if the
 weird sis ters of the
 great dramatic poet could here
 be cou jured up they
 would present to the affrighted
 vision of those on the
 other side of the Chamber
 the deep who have so
 largely contributed to damnation of
 this taking off a glass
 to show them many more
 Thev who have so foully
 murdered the Constitution and tl
 e Union will find when
 too late like the Scottish
 Thane that f they Banquo
 s issue they have filed
 their have but placed upon
 their heads a fruitiess crown
 and put a barren scepter
 in their gripe no son
 of theirs succeeding In taking
 leave of the Senate whilc
 we shall carry with us
 many agreeable recollections of intercourse
 social and offcial witli gentlemen
 who have differed wil h
 us on this the great
 ques t ion of the
 affe we would that wc
 could in fittinc language express
 the mingled of admir ation
 and regret with which we
 look back to our associations
 on this floor with many
 of our north ern colleagues
 They have one after the
 other fallen in their heroic
 struggle against a blind fanat
 icism until now but few
 alas how few remain to
 fight the battle of the
 Constitution Several even of these
 will terminate their offcial career
 in one short month and
 svill give place to men
 hold ing opinions diametrically opposite
 have recommended them to the
 suffrages of their States Had
 we remained here the sarne
 fåtc would have awaited at
 the next election the four
 or five last survivors of
 that gallant band but now
 wc shall carry with us
 at least this one consoling
 reflec tion our departure realizing
 all thei predictions of ill

 new era of triumph for
 the Democratic party of the
 North and will NEW SERIES
 NO 46 the States that
 were original parties to the
 Con stitution even m anting
 their right to resume for
 suflicient cause those restricted powers
 which they delegated to the
 General Government in trust for
 their own use and benefit
 still Louisiana can have no
 such right because she was
 acquired by purchase Gentlemen have
 not hesitated to speak of
 the sovereign States formed out
 of the territory coded by
 France as property bought with
 the money of the United
 States belonging to them as
 purchasers and although they have
 not carried their doctrine to
 its legitimate results I must
 con clude that they also
 mean to assert on the
 same principle the right of
 selling for a price that
 which for a price was
 bought I shall not pause
 to comment on this repulsive
 dogma ofa party which asserts
 the right of prop erty
 in free born white men
 in order to reach its
 cherished object of destroying the
 right of prop crty in
 slave born black men still
 less shall I detain the
 Senate in pointing out how
 shadowy the distinction between the
 condition of the ser vile
 African and that to which
 the white freemen of In
 y State would be reduced
 if it indeed be true
 that they are bound to
 this Government by ties that
 cannot be legitimately dissevered without
 the conserlt of that very
 majority which wields its i
 simply deny the powers for
 their oppression fact on which
 the argument is founded I
 deny that the province of
 Louisiana or the people of
 Louisiana were ever conveyed to
 the United States for a
 price as properly that could
 be bought or sold at
 will Without entering into the
 details of the negotiation the
 archives of our State depart
 rnent shour the fact to
 be that although tl ie
 do rnain the public lands
 and other property of Iörance
 in the ceded province wcrc
 conveyed by absolute title to
 the United States the sovereignty
 was not conveyed otherwise than
 i n trust A hundred
 fold sir has the Government
 of the United States been
 reimbursed by the sales of
 public property of public lands
 for the price of the
 acquisition but not with the
 fidelity of the honest trustee
 has it discharged the obligations
 as regards the sovereicrnt 1
 havc said that the Government
 assumed to act as trustee
 or guardian of the people
 of the ceded province and
 covenanted to transfer to them
 the soverei nt y thus
 held in trust for their
 use and benefit as soon
 ns they were capable of
 exercis ing it What is
 the express language of the
 treaty The inhabitants of the
 ceded Territory shall be incor
 poratcd in the Union of
 the United States and admitted
 as S007L as possible according
 to thc principles of the
 Federal Constitution to the enjoyment
 of au the rights advantages
 and imrnunities of citizens of
 the United States and in
 the mean tirne they shall
 be maintained and protected in
 the enjoyment of their liberty
 property and the religion which
 they profrss And sir as
 if to mark thc true
 nature of the cession in
 a manner too significant to
 admit of misconstruction the treaty
 stipulates no price and the
 sole consideration för the convcyance
 as stated on its face
 is the desire to afford
 a strong proof of tho
 friendship of France for the
 United States By the terms
 of a separate convention stipulating
 the payment of a sum
 of money the precaution is
 ao ain observed of stating
 that tho payment is to
 be madc not as a
 consideration ora i price or
 a condition precedent of the
 cession but it x vc
 firmly believe reestablish its lost
 ascendency IS carefully distinguishcd as
 being a conseqnence It was

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 4
 we are told that the

 hardihood to deny Here is
 a treaty promise to protect
 tliat property that state property
 in that I that the
 revenues must be collected that
 the South Territory bcforc it
 should become a State That
 i is in rebellion without
 cause and that hcr citi
 this liromise was openly violated
 in the adjust zens are
 traitors ment forced upon the
 South at the time of
 the ad I Rebellion l
 he very word is a
 confession an mission of Missouri
 is matter ofrecorded history avowal
 of tyranny outrage and oppression
 It The perspicuous and unanswerabloexpositicm
 of is taken from the
 despot s code and has
 no terror Mr Justice Catron
 in thc opinion delivered bv
 him in the Dred Scott
 case will remain through all
 time as an ample vindication
 of this assertion If then
 sir the people if Louisiana
 had a right which Congress
 could not deny of the
 admission into the Union with
 au the rights of all
 the citi zens of the
 United States it is in
 vain that the partisans of
 the right of the majority
 to govern the minority with
 despotic control atternpt to es
 tablish a distinction to her
 prejudice bet wecn her rights
 and those of any other
 Slate The only distinction w
 Iiich really exists is this
 that she can point to
 a brcacl of treaty stipulations
 expressly guarantying her rights as
 a wrong superadded to those
 which have impelled a number
 of her sister States to
 the assertion of their independence
 The rights of Louisiana as
 a sovereign State are those
 of Virginia no morc no
 less Let those who deny
 her right to resume delegated
 powers successfhlly refuie the claim
 ot Virginia to the same
 right in spite of her
 express reservation made and notified
 to her sister States when
 she And sir permit consented
 to enter tbc Union me
 to say that of all
 the causes which justi v
 the act ion of the
 southern States I knovv none
 of greater gravity and more
 alarming magnitude than that now
 developed of the denial of
 the right of secession A
 pretension so monstrous as that
 which perverts a restricted agency
 constituted by sovereign States for
 common purposes into the unlimited
 despotiS1ii of the majority and
 denies all le ititnate escape
 i roili such despotislü when
 powers not delegated are usurped
 converts the whole constitutional fabric
 into the secure abode of
 lawless tyrnnny and degrades sovereign
 States into provincial dependencies It
 is said that the right
 ot secession if conceded makes
 of our Government a Inerc
 rope of sand that to
 assert its existence imputes to
 the framers of the Constitution
 the folly of planting the
 seeds of death in that
 which was designed for perpetual
 if this imputation were true
 sir It existence would merely
 prove that their offspring was
 not exempt from that mortality
 which is the cornmon lot
 of all that is not
 crcated by higher than hu
 mau power But it is
 not so sir Let facts
 an swer theory For two
 thirds of a century this
 right has been known by
 many of the Slates to
 be at all times within
 their power Yet up to
 the present period when its
 exercise has bccomc indispensable to
 peopie menaced with absolute extertninati0
 1 there have been but
 two instances in which it
 has l een c ven
 threutcned seriously thc first when
 Massachusetts led the New Encr
 land States in un attempt
 to escape from the dan
 Insl war with Great Britain
 the sec gers of our
 ond when the sun ic
 Slate proposed to secede on
 account of the ad uission
 of rrexas as a new
 State into the Union Sir
 in the language of our
 declaration of seces Sion from
 Great Britain it is stated
 as an estab lished truth
 that all experience has shown
 that mankind are more disposed
 to suffer while evils ure
 sufferable Lhaii to right then
 nselves by abol ishing the
 forms to which they have
 been accus tomed And nothin
 can be more obvious to
 the calm and candid observer
 of passinc r events than
 that the d isrnption of
 the Confi deracy has been
 due in great rneasure not
 to the existence but to
 thc denial of this right
 Few candid men would refuse
 to admit that the Republicans
 of the North would have
 been checked In their mad
 ca for other than slavish
 souls When sir did mil
 lions of people asa single
 man rise in organized deliberate
 unimpassioned rebellion tvainst jus tice

 which Chatham launched his indignant

 Lord North and his royal

 Good God sir since when
 has the necessity arisen of
 recalling to American legislators the

 in lisping childhood by lovino
 mothers that pervade the atmosphere
 we have breathed from infancy
 that so form part of
 our very being that in
 their absence we would lose
 the consciousness of our own
 identity Hoaven be praised that
 all have not forgotten them
 that when we shall have
 left these fmniliar Halls and
 when force bills blockadds armies
 navies and all the coercive
 appliances of despots shall be
 proposed and advocated voices shall
 be heard from this side
 of the Chamber that will
 make its very roof resound

 Mr President and to my

 of this Chamber I bid
 a respectful farewell with many
 of those from whom I
 have been radically separated in
 po litical sentiment my personal
 relations have been kindly and
 have inspired me with a
 respect and esteem that 1
 shall not willingly forget with
 those around kne from the

 men part from brothers on
 the eve of a temporary

 pressure of tho hand and
 a smiling assurancc of the
 speedy renewal of sweet intercourse
 around the family hearth But
 to you noble and generous
 friends Who born beneath other
 skies possess hearts that beat
 in sympathy with ours to
 you who solicited and assailed
 by motives the most powerful
 that could appeal to selfish
 natures have nobly spurned them
 all to you who in
 our behalf have bared your
 breasts to the fierce beatings
 of the storm and made
 will ing sacrifice of life
 s most glittering prizes in
 your devotion to constitutional liberty
 to you who have made
 our cause your cause and
 from many of whom I
 feel I part forever what
 shall I can I say
 Nought I know and feel
 is needed for my self
 but this will say for
 the people in whose narne
 I speak to day whether
 prosperous or ad verse fortunes
 await you one priceless treasure
 yours the assurance that an

 But with still sweeter and

 When in after days the

 on the erring men who
 have driven their unofferiding brethren
 fronl the shelter of their

 derive fresh luster from the

 the President and the Senator
 rom North Carolina is entitled
 to the floor Mr CLING
 MAN Mr President a the
 very interesting occurrence which has
 just taken place it is
 difhcult for me to address
 ibe Senate as I would
 wish to do It is
 not my purpose to day
 to attempt anything like an
 elaborate speech upon the questions
 thathave been so much debated
 The whole country so thoroughly
 understands them that that is
 now unnecessary I shall rather
 direct my remarks to some
 of thc practical ques tions
 which are daily presented for
 the phase of things is
 constantly changing and new issues
 are cohtinually presented The message
 of the Presi dent is
 commendable in its spirit und
 tern per what cvor gcntlemen
 may think of its specific
 recom mendations I have myself
 regularly voted with the honor
 able Senator from Kentucky Mr
 CRITTENDEN for his proposition to
 compromise existing diff cullies and
 I shall continue to vote
 for any meas ure that
 may improve the existing status
 whether it in my judgment
 be all that the South
 is entitled to ask or
 not leaving to my constituents
 and other southern States the
 right to determine how far
 it satisfies them But I
 have felt all the time
 that unless some Inovcmcnt camc
 from the other side of
 the Chamber or was at
 least taken up by them
 any effort on our part
 would be futile Even though
 every Democratic member should vote
 for a proposition and that
 should chance to be ama
 jority yet we could not
 here pass a proposition for
 an amendment to the Constitution
 by the ne cessary two
 th irds vote nor carry
 any proposition through the House
 of Representatives much less cause
 its adoption by the free
 States The wholc country looked
 to the speech of the
 honorable Senator from New York
 Mr SEW A RD made
 some two weeks since in
 the hope that it might
 present a basis for adjustment
 Though that speech was conciliatory
 in its tone in its
 practical rccommendations it failed to
 meet I anl sorry to
 say the anticipations of the
 people of tho South I
 understood him only to say
 kn substance that he was
 willing ih the first place
 to provide that slavery never
 should be interfered with in
 the States a point about
 which no great anxiety is
 felt at this time next
 that hc was willing that
 that provision of the Constitution
 which relates to the ret
 urn of fugitive slaves should
 be made a perma nent
 and irrepealable one that is
 a provision which heretofore has
 been in fact very incmcicn
 t But upon the great
 question of the Territories I
 understood l im to say
 that he would be disposed
 to vote for the proposition
 of the honorable Scin ator
 from Minnesota Mr RICE provided
 there were a repeal of
 the existing organic laws if
 it were not that the
 proposition of that Senator making
 arranoen ents for the future
 division of the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 723 Mr SEWARD The honorable
 Senator from North Carolina in
 endeavoring to state my posi
 tions has perhaps conw as
 ncar to accuracy as onc
 standing in his posi lion
 would be apt to under
 stand them If he will
 allow me I wish barely
 to correct him in one
 or two points 1 required
 the repeal not of the
 laws of New IVIcxico but
 of all the ormanic laws
 of all the Territories of
 the Uni ted States that
 were to be created into
 States ac cording to the
 proposition of the Senator from
 Minnesota Mr RICE to organize
 States 1 then stated that
 I did not see how
 provision could con stitutionalfy be
 made at this time which
 would secure a proper subdivision
 of two such vast States
 at proper limes and that
 it seemed to me the
 embarrassments that would result if
 this were not done would
 be as great as tho
 advantages to be derived from
 adopting the rneasure There is
 not much misunderstanding about that
 When the honorable Senator says
 I suggested a national convention
 he means to state the
 prop osition fairly but gives
 it the effect ofa proposi
 tion for a national convention
 one two or three years
 after these secession movements could
 have been arrested So I
 understood him iVhat I said
 i vas when thcsc erratic
 moverncnls of seces Sion or
 dissolution shall have becn arrested
 one year two years or
 three years hence that is
 whenever arrested within one year
 and suppos ing that the
 disunionist might require more than
 one I stated two thrcc
 just so just so long
 as the seceding States should
 require before being ready to
 go into convention as that
 1 could wait in order
 to have a proper consulta
 tion whether any of the
 States have such griev ances
 as require relief by amendments
 of the Con stitation Mr
 CLINGIMAN Mr President 1 very
 happy to afford the honorable
 Senator from Now York an
 opportunity of making this explanation
 I did not greatly misunderstand
 Ilis position though I may
 not have been felicitous in
 stating it My purpose was
 to call the attention of
 the honorable Senator to the
 presen t emergency with a
 view of showing him that
 the remedy which he indicated
 would not reach the case
 1 greatly fear sir that
 the Senator from New York
 and gontlcmcn on that Sidc
 of the Chamber if they
 are candid in stating their
 impressions and I do not
 question their candor altocrether stand
 the naturc of this movement
 Before speak ing directly to
 thosc points to which I
 wish to call the attention
 of Senators if they wifl
 pardon me I will endeavor
 to state in as few
 plain sen t ences as
 can conunand what I deem
 it to be that is
 nosy operating on the mind
 of the southern Slates and
 driving then into resistance FINhe
 honorable Senator fr02n Ncvt York
 in one of his speeches
 last fall in the Northwest
 said States was in his
 judgment unconstitutional and that the
 Governynent of the United States
 had if that division did
 not take place the mischief
 I in 1820 diverted from
 its former course would be
 greater than that under which
 we now I and thrown
 intoawrong direction in other words
 that for forty years past
 it was movine upon labor
 In other words and I
 do not wish to do
 injus an improper track and
 that its coursc was now
 I undersiood to bc essentially
 changed Well sir during that
 tice to thc Senator from
 New York him to state
 three formidable objections to that
 proposition First requiring the repcal
 of the I orqranic laws
 by which I presume he
 meant that the New Mexican
 slave code should be repealed
 and oven if this x
 vcre done there stood a
 consti tutional objection which he
 cannot get over and if
 it were modified so as
 to provide that these States
 to be permanent then he
 hoEds they will be so
 vast that they will brincr
 greater mis chief on the
 country than it is already
 laborincr under Upon other points
 do the Senator the justice
 to say that he eulogized
 the Union hand sornely and
 showed 4 that it might
 be productive of great mischief
 to dissolve it and he
 also de clared that after
 this eccen tric secession move
 ment had come to an
 end Ollie two or three
 years hence he would be
 disposed to see a convention
 called to amend the Constitution
 It struck Ine that thc
 position of the hor orable
 Senator on the present crisis
 was like that of a
 man who when timc our
 Government has been administered by
 Monroe and John Quincy Adams
 by Jackson and Van Buren
 by Elarrison and I yler
 by Polk and Taylor and
 by Fillmore Pcarcc and Buch
 anan During these forty years
 therefore ad ministered in that
 way t he honorable Senator
 and those who act with
 him hold that the Gov
 ernment has been wrong and
 they now propose to reverse
 its action Wroncr in what
 respect Why in admitting the
 act of 1820 that the
 I southern States were entitled
 to go with their property
 into a portion of the
 public territory I understand it
 and as The whole purpose
 as the people df the
 South understand it of this
 Rc publican movenncnt is to
 produce a now condi tion
 of things They say in
 effect you of the South
 are not to have the
 influenc o or the privi
 lcges of the Government that
 you heretofore had It cannot
 bc pretended tllat during this
 period we have had an
 undue power over the Adminis
 a city v ras on
 fire and the flames were
 spreading tration for the presidential
 office has been fairly far
 and wide instead of advising
 means to stop divided between
 the sections and for the
 last even if they menaced
 us with no practical wrong
 in my judgment sqch a
 policy would justify re sistance
 for I know of no
 nation no community that ever
 consented to acceptan inferior position
 without in the end being
 ruined But the practical measures
 which these gentle I men
 propose are in my in
 the highest degree dangerous Look
 Mr President over the southern
 country and ask yourself what
 would be the greatest injury
 that could be done to
 it It would not be
 the establishment of a monarchy
 or a military despotism because
 we know that mon archies
 and military despotisms often afford
 a high degree of security
 and civil liberty to those
 sub ject to them The
 greatest possible injury would be
 to liberate the slaves and
 leave them as free negrocs
 in those communities It is
 sometimes said that they are
 worth in money This I
 suppose is true L ut
 that is only a portion
 of thc pecuniary loss if
 we were deprived of them
 In the North for example
 if the horses and work
 ing cattle were removed in
 addition to their other property
 such as vehicles and working
 utensils the lands themselves would
 be rendered value less to
 a great extent and so
 in fact if you svere
 to liberate the slaves of
 the South so great would
 bc the loss that financial
 ruin w ould be inevitable
 And yet sir this is
 not thc greatest evil that
 social destruction of our society
 by infusino E into it
 a large free negro population
 that is most dreaded Northern
 gentlemen may realize the evil
 perhaps by considering this case
 which I put to them
 Thenegroesofthe South are in most
 of the States worth more
 than the lands Sup pose
 there was a proposition now
 to abolish land titles through
 the free States that if
 adopted would produce immense mischief
 but in addition sypposc there
 were to be transferred to
 those States a fi ce
 necrro population equal to half
 their own or as they
 have eighteen million people turn
 loose among them a population
 equat to nine mil lion
 frec blacks and that accompanied
 with thc destruction of the
 land titles and abolition of
 the landed property would not
 the people of those States
 at once rise in rebellion
 agaipst such meas ures The
 British newspapcrs seem at a
 loss to ac count for
 the excitement and revolution prevailing
 in this country It is
 very natural that they should
 not understand it because they
 draw their ideas altogether from
 opinions expressed in the North
 which are tit ljust to
 our section and partly also
 from the condition things prevailing
 in Europe There revolutions do
 not occur except from ex
 treme physical suffering The consequence
 that Great Britain before our
 Revolution could not understand that
 our people would make a
 rev olution upon what Mr
 YVebstcr declared was a mere
 preamble a merc assertion of
 the right of Great Britain
 to tax us and they
 never did real i e
 unt il the war had
 actually begun that we would
 fight merely to escape a
 contemptible tea tax of three
 cents a pound So seeing
 that the United States is
 one of the most prosperous
 coun tries upon the earth
 they do not scem to
 realize the idea that we
 should go to war upon
 a mere question of right
 bcforc actual suffering had be
 gun Now Mr President our
 slave property exceeds the national
 debt of England in value
 Flow long could a ministry
 stand that was for the
 abolition of that national debt
 too that the population of
 the British Isles is three
 times as great as ours
 and it would have to
 be increased threefold to make
 the losses there pro portionatcly
 as great as those the
 abolition of slavery would inflict
 upon us But again sir
 this is only a partial
 statement of the case In
 England they arc very hostile
 to a Catholic monarcil I
 f tl ierc were a
 Catholic monarch on ho throne
 it might produce a revolution
 But suppose England were unit_ed
 with a country like France
 greater in population and that
 that coen try had the
 power to impose a Catholic
 monarch on England against the
 wish and feeling of the
 cntirc body of the people
 in the British Isles and
 that it was known that
 that monarch favored thc the
 fire immediately should enter into
 an elabor i twelvc years
 during which the sectional troubles
 abolition of the national debt
 does any man doubt ate
 speech upon the inexpediency and
 mischief of a city burnt
 and suggests that when I
 the heat and fury of
 the conflagration had come to
 an end it might be
 well to have an assemblage
 of the poopie and see
 if there could not be
 madc some provision to prevent
 similar evils it has been
 entirely in the that the
 British Isles would be in
 a blaze of revo have
 been acro ravated I say
 that the whole lution And
 yet sir that is not
 as strong a casc hands
 of northern rnen purport of
 thc movement as understood at
 the as that which is
 now prcscntcd to the South
 I am told however by
 gentlemen with a great South
 is this Your institutions are
 not equal to ours and
 you must accept an inferior
 position deal of semning plausibility
 that this is a condi
 tion of things that cannot
 be carried out that 1
 am free to say sir
 under the Govcrnmcnt 724 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 4 the
 Union and the seventh Texas
 has probably I though Mr
 Lincoln may have said that
 tbe war gone out during
 the past week There are
 causes l must never cease
 until slavery is abolished and
 in operation which will inevitably
 too if they that he
 hoped during his tifetime to
 see this result In are
 not arrested drive out other
 slave States produced yet under
 the existing Constitution North Carolina
 in Kentucky and in Virginia
 he will not be able
 to effect it and we
 are told for example a
 large number of the people
 now that we ought to
 wait at least for overt
 acts are waiting to see
 if there can be any
 proper ad Now sir when
 an honorable Senator tells me
 justment If it fails if
 some such scheme as the
 for example that he stands
 upon the Georgia honorable Senator
 from Kentucky has offered is
 piatform and that he is
 ready to resist its viola
 not adopted a large and
 powerful body of con tion
 1 give him credit for
 the utmost sinc erity servative
 men will at once go
 to the side of the
 but I tell you Mr
 President as a Kentuckian secessionists
 Even if that does not
 carry out as one wbo
 represents a conservative and a
 bor those States there is
 onc 0th er contingency u
 t gen t der State
 I do not beiievc if
 we submitted now and pressing
 which will do it Your
 State sir to this election
 that those overt acts would
 be re has determined by
 an almost unanimous vote of
 sisted Take for example the
 fugitive slave law her Legislature
 and so has Virginia that
 any If it were repealed
 twelve months hence it might
 attempt to coerce the seceding
 States should be be said
 that this law violated grossly
 northern resisted by force True
 gentlemcn say they are sentiment
 that it was very inefficient
 that we not for coercion
 but they are for enforcing
 the did not recover more
 slaves under it than we
 did laws and collecting the
 revenue will enter undertheold law
 that we would be simply
 throWn into an arcument to
 prove to any Senator that
 tins back to where we
 were in 1850 and the
 border If I were met
 on the highway by a
 States being those most interested
 ought first to IS coercion
 man with a pistol in
 hand and he should say
 that move and no resistance
 would in fact bc made
 he had no right to
 rob me but that he
 meant to Again suppose the
 Wilmot proviso or the cx
 take my money and would
 use force to accom clusion
 of slavery in the Territories
 was adopted plish his purpose
 I should not cntcr into
 an argu it would be
 said this was what had
 been often ment with that
 man to convince him that
 this was done it had
 beén repeatedly passed and cvcn
 robbery So when honorable Senators
 tell me sanctioned by southern
 men that slavery never that
 they are for enforcing the
 laws I will not would
 go into the Territories This
 question was argue that this
 is coercion All that Great
 Britain a mere abstraction and
 the question would be ever
 demanded in the Revolution was
 that the asked Will you
 dissolve this glorious Union colonies
 shouid obey the acts of
 Parliament und for a mere
 abstraction I do not think
 there pay such taxes as
 she imposed and there was
 no would be resistance by
 the southern people after day
 during that long struggle when
 if George they had been
 demoralized by submission to Washington
 and his compatriots had agreed
 to Lincoln pay the taxes
 and obey the acts of
 Parliament Again suppose slavery were
 abolished in this that the
 British armies would not have
 been with District it would
 doubtless be done with com
 pensation to the owners The
 people of the North drawn
 This is the only sort
 of coercion that is ever
 would not object of course
 to paying a small used
 among civilized nations Great Britain
 amount for that purpose and
 those who arc favor France
 Russia or any other civilized
 country able to a high
 tariff might bc very willing
 to make docs not send
 out armies to shoot down
 peaceable the leading that expenditure
 Even now sir All they
 require is that the laws
 obedient men Republican journals are
 discussing the propriety should be
 obeyed and the t axcs
 paid This idea of buying
 ull the slaves in Maryland
 your State of sending out
 armies to kill people who
 arc obc sir and in
 Missouri and Delaware and thereby
 It is done I dient
 prevails only amono savaoes malKing
 them free I his proposition
 finds favor in Africa where
 one necro community turns out
 If therefore slavery in this
 District were abol It was
 the mode of en ished
 in that way it would
 be said and destroys another
 w hat right forcemcnt used
 among the aborigines of this
 coun has South Carolina or
 North Carolina or any try
 when one Indian tribe went
 outand destroyed other State to
 object While these things were
 another Thcreföre when Inonorable Senators
 going on you would see
 a division to some extent
 tell rne that they are
 ITOt för coercion but they
 created in the South I
 here arc in all communi
 are for enforcil g the
 laws I understand them as
 ties discontented elements there are
 everywhere simply saying that they
 are civilized rnen and who
 are ready for change and
 ripe for revo mean to
 resort to that process which
 prevails in lution So powerful
 is this element in most
 coun civilized nations and not
 amono savages tries in the
 world the people have to
 be kept down They suppose
 Mr President that they will
 be by force There is
 perhaps not a country in
 able to have a little
 war and I have been
 aston Europe where there would
 not bc a revolution ished
 in conversing even with Senators
 to say every ten years
 if it were not for
 the arms and power nothing
 of the newspapers to find
 that the idea of the
 Government But whena Government un
 prevailed that you could have
 a small war con lertakcs
 to foment revolution it is
 omnipotent fincd to the blockading
 ofa ports and that it
 and I have no doubt
 that with all the patronage
 would stop therc At an
 early day of this ses
 and all the power which
 a Republican President sion my
 attention was called to a
 plan coming could bring to
 his aid with a free
 post office dis frorn a
 distinguished source in which the
 opinion tribution of abolition pamphlets
 you would see a was
 maintaincd that there wcrc not
 at that time powerful division
 in portions of the South
 In the in several ofthc
 planting States provisions enough mean
 time the forts and arsenals
 could all be well to
 support the people for two
 rnonths and that cer occupied
 and strengthened and all the
 public arms tainly with all
 they could get by June
 they would removed from the
 southern States Last winter be
 starved out and brought to
 terms of submission bcfhre these
 d ifficulties happened when Mr
 Floyd by a simple blockading
 of their ports made an
 order directing the removal of
 arms from tonished that such
 an idea should have been
 enter the norlhcrn to the
 southern Slates though he tained
 in the quarter from which
 it came Why removed less
 than half of them he
 was vehemently sir everybody familiar
 with the South knows that
 denounced for it You are
 too well read in hlS
 those States have ample means
 of livinqr until the tory
 not to remember that Carthage
 was destroyed next crop is
 produced because she permitted the
 Romans under a prom If
 you could enforce a strict
 blockade there is ise of
 good treatment to remove all
 her public no country on
 the earth that it would
 injure so arrns and if
 the South in that condition
 with little as the South
 All that is mad e
 in the Uni additional armaments
 in all the forts with
 some ted States can be
 produced there in the greatest
 division among our people and
 threatened with l ecrro insurrection
 and deprived of all share
 in II abundance as fur
 as axriculture is concerned and
 the public arms were then
 to resist morc serious we
 might manufacture everything on earth
 that is needed and if
 the whole cotton crop were
 de acroressions we should fight
 under great disad vantages and
 perhaps if not subdued have
 a tainedathome it would not
 in a material degree long
 a nd a bloody struggle
 before us afiéct our ultimate
 prosperity I say that if
 the say therefore to the
 honorable Senator from wortli of
 cotton which is annually sent
 from the slave States were
 kept there or Kentucky in
 all sincerity that in my
 judgment never produced we might
 still be one of the
 most the issue which his
 State and mine have to
 determ there shall be a
 manly resistance prosperous countries on
 earth but how would it
 ine is whether now or
 whether our States shall become
 freé be with Europo and
 the North Can they do
 neo ro communities It is
 nay deliberate judgment without cotton
 It was said boastingly at
 an early stage of the
 that if this issue had
 met with no resistance the
 be in fact so powerful
 When this panic began and
 Aher kinds of property felt
 cot ton rose rapi y
 The monarch had but to
 waive his scep ter and
 the bankers of the east
 opened their cof fers and
 sent a stream of gold
 across the Atlantic in ships
 such as old Neptune never
 saw when his trident ruled
 the Mediterranean Neptune s power
 was limited to the sea
 Alexander claimed to have conquered
 the world but hisdominions were
 confined to Asia and the
 territories on the shores of
 the Bosphorus Julius Cæsar a
 still mightier monarch ruled only
 on the eastern continent King
 cotton governs two hemispheres and
 dom inates on land and
 sea and the kings of
 the East and the merchant
 princes of the West obey
 his bidding Most fortunate was
 it for New York and
 the North that his power
 was unbroken for when the
 panic was progressing everywhere and
 the banks were faihng and
 traders were being ruined and
 New York itself was staggering
 and likely to go down
 with the mercantile interest of
 that section producino wide spread
 misery it was this stream
 of gold which came Europe
 that upheld the New York
 banks and enabled them to
 sustain the merchants and prevented
 scene of ruin such as
 we have not hitherto seen
 Suppose New York had lost
 that gold suppose the cotton
 which her ships were enTaged
 in car rying had gone
 out in foreign vessels directly
 to i Europe above all
 sir suppose it were kept
 ut home and that neither
 the North nor England could
 obtain it you would see
 such a commercial revulsion such
 a panic such a pressure
 as has not been known
 in a century Things would
 in deed look as if
 chaos had returned to assert
 his ancient dominion over the
 world I find a short
 extract in one of the
 British papers the London Chronicle
 of January 18 which cornes
 to me in the mail
 this morning that illustrates the
 view that they are now
 taking in England of this
 danger Rhe question is in
 fact little short of life
 and death Ruin to Inerchants
 and ilhill owners and starvation
 to the rest ot the
 population haug immediately in thc
 balance One year s Failure
 of the Atncrieålll crop or
 posiponement ot the Atnerican supply
 would produce calanfities worse than
 any war or fanline within
 Inodern experience That is the
 statement of a British organ
 not at all friendly to
 us and our institutions l
 he south ern coast is
 too extensive to be actually
 block aded by the greatest
 naval Power on earth and
 do you think Great Britain
 and France would re gard
 a rnnre paper blockade You
 know they would not they
 could not afford to do
 it and It would never
 be effective if attempted Again
 sir as was said by
 the Senator from Louisiana Mr
 SLIDELL this morning the wholc
 ocean would swarm with privateers
 and the northern ship owners
 would find themselves deprived of
 our freights and also liable
 to capture on the high
 seas But I ask does
 anybody suppose that the var
 would stop there Does anybody
 suppose for one rnoment that
 the people of the South
 would sit dosvn quietly and
 be cooped up in that
 way No sir They would
 march until they found an
 en emy on land and
 with two thousand miles of
 fronticr stretching from the Atlantic
 to the ex treme VVcst
 does anybody really suppose they
 would not find vulnerable points
 ask gentlemen what is to
 prevent nn attack upon this
 capital This city could be
 destroyed by an army that
 did not cross the Potomac
 A shell could be thrown
 from Virginia into this very
 Senate Chamber 1 do not
 say this by way of
 menace but to let gen
 tlemen sec that there is
 no difficulty in findino points
 of collision and lest I
 should be suppose to insinuate
 that there on foot a
 plan tö attack this capital
 1 wish to disclaim emphatically
 an purpose of any design
 to with it as far
 as I know or believe
 This capital is not of
 the smallest consequence in a
 military point of view It
 was said by a great
 commander that as to for
 tificd places and cities he
 would leave them to the
 end of the war for
 they were the prizes svhich
 fail to the conqueror Chis
 is eminently true of It
 is obliged to follow the
 fate of this District the
 territory around it Though the
 whole South were anxious that
 a northern should be kept
 here if Maryland and Virginia
 or Vir ginia alone should
 leave the Union we all
 know hat the North would
 not find it to bc
 to its in terest to
 keep a capital either surrounded
 by for reign territory or
 on its border I should
 regret latter alternative would have
 been the result session that
 king cotton was dethroned There
 deeply any struggle for a
 place like this which is
 But sir six States have
 resisted and are out of
 never was a time I
 vhen that monarch seemed to
 of no value in a
 military point of view and
 which would impel the country
 into civil war but I
 am free to say that
 if a war b insdown
 in the Soutll it is
 as likely to comc up
 here as to any other
 point that I know of
 It cannot be confined to
 Charlcs ton harbor it cannot
 beconfined to Pensacola but when
 it begins there it will
 find its way perhaps to
 this very city Gentlemen will
 see that with these two
 thou sand miles of frontier
 it is practicable to have
 war and it would certainly
 occur a regular old fashioned
 war if the present line
 of policy be con It
 is so tinued There can
 be no doubt about it
 clear to any gentleman who
 reflects that I do not
 think it necessary to enlarge
 upon it But it is
 sometimes said that if a
 war begins the North being
 the n iore powerful of
 tho two sections will certainly
 be able to overrun the
 1861 ments went abroad and
 our own people occupied ing
 to this mode and their
 Indian empire would THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 725 No human ingenuity
 can find any other result
 The best course undoubtedly would
 be to adjust things now
 if possible on a satisfactory
 and per I manent basis
 The next best is a
 peaceable rec ocynition of the
 in dependence of tbc seceding
 States and the worst of
 all but inevitable if neither
 of tell gentlemen if the
 others be taken is war
 they sit still war will
 make itself it will come
 of its own accord Look
 now at the condition of
 forts in the South They
 were originally built mainly to
 protect those States in which
 they are situated as a
 portion of the Union but
 there wcré some additional reasons
 for their erection When States
 secede the Government is entitled
 to be paid for its
 property undoubtedly but the States
 have a moral and a
 political right to occupy and
 they will hold those fortifications
 in thc cnd may say
 in rclation to the rnanner
 in which they South Mr
 President there are a million
 and a half of men
 in the s avehoiding States
 capable of came to be
 taken something by way of
 explana bearing arms and it
 is generally supposed that a
 country can maintain permanently In
 the field onc sixth of
 its able bodied men That
 calcula tion would afford two
 hundred and fifty thousand men
 for a fighting force You
 must recollect however that among
 our four million slaves there
 are at least two million
 laborers This circum stance would
 largely increase the force we
 coul l I have no
 doubt that a million keep
 in the field of men
 at home with all the
 slaves would carry on our
 industrial occupations while we might
 have at cast four or
 five hundred thousand men capable
 of being kept in tl
 lC field Such a force
 would certainly require an immense
 sum ofmoncy to rnaintain it
 but a community slrug pling
 for existence will not count
 the cost of armtunents How
 will it be in the
 North You ought to havo
 a larcrer force than this
 to enable you to carry
 how are i on war
 abroad Suppose it is no
 larger you to keep in
 the field a body of
 four hundred thousand or five
 hundred thousand tnen At the
 outset I grant that your
 bankers might come for ward
 and enable you to begin
 the war on credit I
 but all wars of any
 length cannot bc nvaintåined in
 that way The exports of
 the free Slates are generally
 less than hundred millions and
 your imports can be no
 grcater without draining you of
 specie Any tariff you can
 impose will arivc no more
 money than you will want
 to sup port your Government
 in time of peace put
 this matter to gentlemen seriously
 because it is wcll enough
 to look at these things
 now for in a few
 weeks we may have then
 upon us as actual real
 I aslc Senators to exercise
 no greater fore si Yht
 than at y farmer enanifests

 in u and vintor Ccw
 weeks Now do you believe
 that you can get your
 peo tion On the last
 day of December there vcrc
 orders issued from the War
 Department for the II is
 true that purpose of sending
 troops South late in the
 evcnino perhaps as late as
 eleven o clock these orders
 were countermanded but in the
 moan time telegraphic dispatches wore
 sent to the South and
 a number of forts were
 taken In my own State
 on the day following the
 1st of January we were
 advised there was a similar
 movement on foot and a
 dispatch wont dDwn which prevented
 it by assurances that the
 orders had been countcrnmnded Not
 long after t he sending
 down of the Star of
 wards however the VI cst
 occurred other reports of hostile
 move member that China had
 earnestly resisted the seizure of
 her people by British agents
 and done all in her
 power to suppress this trade
 in the bodies of her
 subjects Of this coolie trade
 i need not speak Every
 body knows that it is
 vastly more inhuman than the
 slave trade was in its
 worst days that the proportion
 of Chinamen who arc destroyed
 in Cuba and other countries
 to which they are sent
 is vastly greater than chat
 of Africans who perish under
 the slave trade and in
 the countries to which they
 are carried but yet if
 the papers are to be
 relied upon Great Britain is
 improvmgon the old coolie traflic
 and instead of holding them
 to labor for eight years
 she is going to work
 them for twenty years Eight
 years wassuffcicnttodestroy three fourths of
 them I think and they
 are novv i going to
 try itfor twenty vears and
 my friend from Missouri Mr
 POLK uggests that she makes
 them pay their own passage
 back That is she will
 take Chinamen bring them to
 her colonies to work for
 twenty years and then let
 them pay their passage home
 if they survive till that
 time I do not say
 these things with any view
 of creat ing ill feeling
 against Great Britain but look
 at her line of policy
 Her humanity does not pre
 vcnt her allowing the enforcement
 of the collec lion of
 rents in India by torture
 A commission of the British
 Parliament has shown that thou
 sands of Indian people were
 tortured to death by the
 most infernal devices that the
 wit of man ever imagined
 yet that does not stop
 because they say they cannot
 collect the rent without resort
 some of tho forts ill
 North Carolina but they be
 valueless Great Britain s hatred
 of slaverv were informed again
 that there was no purpose
 does not prevent her recognizing
 Turkey a coun on the
 part of the Government to
 reinforce them try where they
 hold slaves of all races
 and all In fact Great
 Britain went to war with
 colors and they were I
 mention this in order that
 Senators may un Russia to
 prevent the destruction of that

 of our people They do
 not slaveholding Government want to
 interfere with thc Government property
 But it is supposed that
 Great Britain has such they
 do not mean to interfere
 willi its rights while a
 sympathy and friendship for the
 North and it may be
 disposed to do thern justice
 but they that there is
 such a feeling upon this
 slavery ques do not intend
 that these forts shall be
 used for I tion that
 she would not recognize a

 726 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 4 ain as was intimated
 by Sir Robert Peel to
 make use of this anti
 skavery rnovement with a view
 of breaking down slavery in
 the United States 01 a
 dissolution of the Union gentlernen
 may ask me what motive
 Great Britain has to de
 think she has at least
 four sire such a result
 powerful reasons any one of
 which of itself mi ht
 be sumcient to direct her
 action Her great rival on
 the seas now is the
 United States The North furnishes
 the ships and the South
 the freights I may say
 to gentlemen that an orp
 those freights furnished by the
 North tillere is not a
 great deal of bulk The
 gold of California could be
 carried in a small ship
 and manufactures of the North
 take up a little space
 but tho cotton the tobacco
 the rice the naval stores
 and in part the breadstuffs
 of the South mainly furnish
 the freights for the immense
 northern shipping Sup pose Great
 Britain can succeed in dividing
 your ships from our freighls
 it reduces America com paratively
 to a small Inat ititne
 Power That is one powerful
 motive A second onc is
 this Great Britain is seeking
 to carry her manufactures into
 all the countries of the
 world They are now kept
 out of the South by
 this tariff of twenty and
 thn ty per cent because
 the North has that ad
 vantage but if the South
 becomes independeYlt British goods and
 northern goods come to us
 ex actly upon the same
 terms and I saw enough
 of prices in Europe a
 little more tban a year
 ago to know that our
 northern friends will find their
 in dustry very much supplanted
 by an equal tariff between
 their goods and those of
 Great Britain and other countries
 While the South would be
 a great gainer by this
 operation as well as Eng
 land the North would lose
 immensely But there is a
 third motive which would natu
 rally operate on the British
 Government and to The United
 States has some extent on
 others now over thirty million
 people In twenty five years
 we shall probably bavc rnore
 than sixty million If the
 Union continues in fift y
 years from this lay we
 ought to have onc hundred
 and twenty million We certainly
 shall have rnore than a
 hundred million We will be
 a Power so great that
 we might control civilization and
 it is very natural that
 an ambitious nation like Great
 Britain should be wilfing to
 cut that Power down MT
 e would do the same
 perhaps in a similar position
 But Mr President there is
 a fourth reason It is
 x vell known that re
 which operates on her publican
 ideas and liberal principles are
 making great progress in Europe
 and the governing classes the
 privileged classes there are struggling
 against them The division of
 this Union would throw back
 liberal ideas fbr tcn years
 perhaps twenty God only knows
 how long in F uropc
 These four powerful unotives may
 operate upon the British Governmeflt
 and indeed those cspe cially
 interested in its success as
 at present organ ir ed
 to regard a lissolution of
 the Uni011 of these States
 as erninently advantageous Now suppose
 that a certain class I
 do not pretend that the
 whole people are so but
 suppose sacracious persons in Europe
 wished to this result what
 would they do They kilow

 be no hope of keeping

 will be drawn by a
 natural af finity to detach
 themselves from the North and
 join tho slaveholding fbdcration North
 Carolina Tennessee Ken tucky Missouri
 Virginia Maryland Delaware will then
 be dissociated from the free
 States Such an event cannot
 be regarded without dismay by
 the most staunch abolition 1st
 It would in thct nvakc

 is concerned and reduce the
 North to what our ances
 tors would havo called a

 to a country with hardly
 a greater future than Canada
 Every natural advantage would be
 on thc side of the
 slave States Look at tile

 country cornposes the frec soil
 of the Aznerican federation Only

 of terri tory to vvithin
 less than a hundred miles
 of Lake Erie and thus
 divides the Atlantic free States
 from the West in a
 manner highly dangerous to their
 future union Indeed it is
 doubtful whether the connection between
 New York and New England
 on the one hand and
 Eilinois and the neigh boring
 States on the other could
 long survive the totai sep
 aration of the South i

 Union IVIr CLINGMAN Mr President
 1 think that illustrates pretty
 wcli the line of argument
 which I have been endeavorinty
 to make that Sen ators
 on the other side of
 tl le Chamber will find
 themselves wholly mistakel if they
 imagine that that the North
 is very sensitive to British
 opinion Great Britain and France
 will not recognize us while
 the South is not at
 all so The South they
 know will march forward with
 its own ideas and views
 without regard to what may
 be said in England but
 the North sensitive to their
 opinion what morc natural than
 that the Lon don Post
 which is understood to bc
 Lord Pal mcrston s organ
 should corne oat in article
 after article tellin the North
 if they now give way
 they will be utterly disgraced
 that the United States will
 bc held in contempt by
 the world if i they
 make any concessions to the
 slave power This is inTcnious
 flattery to the anti slavery
 feel of the Republican party
 I recollect Mr President in
 my boyish days reading in
 the Pik grim s Progress
 of a certain black man
 who wore a very white
 robe who met the two
 pilgrims and with fair speeches
 invited them to acconuoany him
 They soon found themselves entrapped
 and caught in n net
 and then the white robe
 fell off the shoulders of
 the black man Has it
 never occurred to Senators on
 the other side that there
 may be a mistake in
 all their calculations As a
 confirmation of this sucroestion namely
 that these In addition to
 all those reasons which would
 just ify the recognition of
 couritrics generally ié the absolute
 necessity they are under of
 having cot ton from us
 Another mistake which I think
 gentleman make I is this
 they supposc this movement at
 the South rnay bc tho
 rnerc result of tho efforts
 of designincr politicians and that
 the break up at Charleston
 has caused it No one
 was more averse than my
 self to seeing this separation
 of the Democratic party and
 I thank the honorable Senator
 from Ohio Mr PUGH for
 his efforts on that occasion
 and those of all others
 to prevent it But sir
 so rar from its contributing
 to this secession move it
 has bocn the main obstacle
 in its X vay ment
 The great body of the
 peoplc of thc Soutl l
 do not hate the North
 I think as has been
 said by some I know
 it is not true in
 North Caro Senators lina There
 is a very groat distrust
 of the dom inant majority
 of the North and an
 apprehension of mischief but the
 great body of our people
 would far prefer a union
 with the North upon honorable
 terms While this is true
 however I say to you
 sir that but for this
 division of the party if
 we had however been beaten
 the whole South would have
 gone out just as South
 Carolina has done I IT
 ean without division was that
 party division and the discussion
 grow inø out of it
 and the charges and crimination
 and recrimination of Union and
 disunion in the can vass
 were the great obstacles in
 the way But our people
 are gradually getting over those
 prej udices and they see
 that the Republicans of the
 North intended to beat us
 whet her we were uni
 ted or not and the
 very men who most regretted
 the divisions of the party
 are gradually fallin into the
 movement They sec we will
 be ruine by submission to
 the election of Mr Lincoln
 The Republicans meant to beat
 us whether we were united
 or not and the injury
 from their rule is the
 samc either way and it
 is not for them to
 say that we fought the
 battle unskillfully I adrnit ve
 did ficrht unskillfully bat everybody
 in thc South was aoainst
 them Wo say that their
 domination is just as mischievous
 to us as if we
 had been well united Another
 fact presents itself that they
 have a clear large overwhelming
 x najority in the northern
 States enouøh to Tive thern
 the control of tho Government
 and it isa knowledffe of
 this fact that is drivi
 vv our pcopke forward and
 they will gradually come up
 to one line of action
 His tory reproduces itself hmnan
 naturc is the same and
 it might have been said
 in our struggle with Great
 Britain that the colonies were
 divided They did not defend
 themselves well Gates by his
 rashness incurred the defeat at
 Camden There were disensions in
 tbc colonics and even many
 tories among them but that
 was no excusc for Great
 Britain She intended to subdue
 thcm whether they were united
 or not and the injury
 to her domination would have
 been the same in cither
 event Again it is said
 very plausibly I admit that
 we ought not to abandon
 our northern friends our allies
 That idcntical remark might have
 been made and was in
 substance made during our Revolution
 for there were Chatham and
 Burke and others whom our
 colonics had to abandon Lord
 Chatham never justified but always
 con demned the secession of
 the colonics but that secession
 or revolution vindicated him and
 Burke and Fox And sir
 if v re were now
 to submit where would our
 northern allies be Trampled under
 foot by a resist less
 anti slavery party It would
 bc said Your soutuhcrn friends
 are gas conading brag yarts
 ready to subluit to us
 jike whipped spaniels They would
 be trodden down and annihilated
 but by our resisting we
 vindi catc the Senator from
 Ohio Mr PUGH as a
 pa triot a stwacious statesman
 auda just man We vindicate
 the Senator from Illinois Mr
 Douc LA s the Senators
 from Indiana the Senator from
 Oregon Mr LANE the Senators
 from Penn sylvania Mr BIGLER
 and New Jersey Mr rl
 HOMSON aud last though not
 Icasl the generous Senator from
 Minnesota Mr RicE They will
 stand in after times as
 men who had the sacracity
 to see the ri Fht
 and the couracre to defend
 it Again we are told
 that having gone into the
 contest we are bound to
 submit to the result just
 as a gambler who plays
 a game must pay the
 stakes hc loses Why Mr
 President on this principle if
 the Republicans werc to nominate
 a free negro I suppose
 we would be bound to
 let him be elected without
 opposition for if we run
 a candidate a ainst him
 we w ould be bound
 to submit to him if
 elected and therefore ought to
 let him go in without
 opposition If we had not
 attempted to defeat Lincoln in
 fhct by runnil ff a
 rival candidate we Illight have
 been obliged to submit and
 ought to have been and
 would have bccn justly lucid
 responsible We however did our
 duty to the country by
 making an honest effort to
 defeat him though possibly we
 may not have conducted the
 conteét skillfully I maintain that
 no party in the South
 is justly chargeable with Lincoln
 s election as in spite
 of their re sistance he
 obtained a large rnajorily over
 all opposition in States enough
 in the North to elect
 him I will say in
 candor also to Senators that
 there British organs may change
 their tone aftcr thc i
 it is equally well known
 tb the division of the
 result has been effected I
 will ask the Secretary Democratic
 party has retarded the action
 of the to read an
 extract which I find in
 tho London South in defi
 nse of its honor and
 its rights are three measures
 now passing which wili add
 very much to this secession
 movement in the South I
 allude first to the Pacific
 railroad biil by which ve
 have undertaken as far as
 this Senate can un II
 derlake anything to build three
 railroads ata cost of 120
 000 000 Now sir some
 of our people 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 727 deny your
 right to make improvements Those
 slavery question The Legislature of
 my own who admit the
 right doubt very much whether
 you ought to go to
 the expense of Inaking a
 single railroad across a thousand
 miles of desert and un
 inhabited country and this proposition
 for build ing three railroads
 under these and incurring a
 debt perhaps to be increased
 to two or threo hundred
 million fot the best in
 formed men say It cannot
 fall below will drive many
 of the most sagacious and
 reflcct ing men of the
 South mcn of philosophical minds
 to acquiesce in dissolution Again
 sir here is this tariff
 bill likely to be adopted
 which passed the House by
 a large vote containinry most
 iniquitous provisions for the ben
 efitof particular classes and then
 there is another measure which
 with due respect to those
 who in the most indefensible
 of dorso it to my
 mind is all propositions hitherto
 advocated I mean the homestead
 bill The idea up the
 public property by wholesale at
 any time to men many
 of whom are the least
 meritorious of the commu nity
 is wholly indefensible in rny
 judgment but now with a
 ban kruptTreasury borro wilV 117
 oney at the ratc of
 forty or fifty million a
 year the policy of giving
 up these public lands in
 a body to any one
 who chooses to take them
 shocks the whole community Our
 people arc coming to the
 conclusion that this Government has
 become so vast that it
 is an impracticable one Iam
 not sure of this I
 think large as the country
 is that the Government might
 be well administered but for
 thc anti sla very excitement
 When a family is divided
 in to two sections who
 are warrino acrainst caca other
 of course household duties must
 be neglected We have had
 a struggle for the last
 ten years the North pressing
 and the South struggling for
 its honor and safety against
 the movernent and in fact
 they are such measures are
 its results directly traceable to
 that hostility of the norihern
 anti slavery men Tby sir
 the people of the Northwest
 do not want high protective
 tariffs by no means and
 many Republicans do not want
 them and yel you find
 the Republicans in a body
 almost in the House and
 on this floor we sce
 them corning up and voting
 for a most enormous tariff
 Why It is to secure
 tho support of the tarifF
 men of Pennsylvania and elsewhere
 Again sir New England does
 not like this homestead bill
 At any ratc when I
 came here fifteen years ego
 I found the men from
 New Eng land were in
 favor of holding on to
 the public lands and so
 far frorn wishing to encout
 tvc settle ment in the
 West they used t o
 object strenu ously to opening
 that territory because it took
 off their laborers frono them
 They wished to retain them
 at home and thus keep
 down the prico of wacyes
 Now you find the solid
 vote of New England I
 believe for this homestead bill
 to tempt their people to
 go avvay MT h y
 is this r I hey
 want to satisfy the NrVest
 and vou find tho north
 western Republicans Toing for t
 his high protective tariff to
 secure the votes Pennsylvania and
 the East The anti s
 avery Inen form the great
 nu clcus of the party
 and they spread out their
 arms in all directions and
 eather in allies Now I
 am free to say Mr
 President if when this homestead
 bill was up I could
 substitute for it a proposition
 giving the lands absolutely to
 the new States in which
 they lie I would prefer
 it Sbüt e as well
 as that of Virginia has
 planted it self firmly on
 thc basis of the Crittenden
 propo sRions with certain additions
 and they will not bc
 satisfied with less I tnn
 astonished that the North hesitates
 to take the proposition of
 the honorabic Senator from i
 Kcntucky YVhat is it of
 the existing gives the South
 about one fifth and the
 I North Our fifths We
 are entitled to have two
 fifths according to population They
 say it is car rying
 out the platform on which
 Mr Breckinridge was nominated I
 allude tn the presidential can
 didate All that is a
 mistake By that platform as
 they understand it slavery was
 to be protected in all
 the Territories and the people
 of the South honestly believe
 that it ought to be
 so and that according to
 thc true intent of the
 Constitution it is protected and
 the opinions of the Supreme
 Court sustain this view Now
 instead of carry ing it
 out that proposition proposes to
 cive the North four fifths
 of thc territory and only
 one fifth to the South
 Why sir a Inan who
 claims a tract of land
 and offers as a compromise
 to Tive up four fifths
 of it would not obtain
 his claim certainly It scorns
 to therefore the Repub licans
 ought not to hesitate one
 moment but ought at once
 to have taken it They
 say however that their platform
 rcquircs that they shall have
 the whole of the territory
 and exclude us altogether I
 submit to honorable Senators as
 just men or I know
 that in the or dinary
 transactions of life they are
 just men thcro is not
 u Senator on that side
 of the Chamber Ihat does
 not know that the South
 has contributed its nnoncy fairly
 with the North that in
 every war we have turned
 out inorc than our proportion
 of rnen and I ask
 them if it is iü
 st that our people should
 altogether be excluded from those
 acqui sitions which we jointly
 made But some of them
 object to that provision which
 applies it to future i
 crritories I hcy say we
 will take Mexico Central America
 c Why Mr Presidcut if
 none of thc States had
 seceded the North would have
 a majority now of eight
 Sen ators on this floor
 With all the States repre
 sented in the other branch
 she has fifty seven majority
 and under the incominff apportionrnent
 will have over sixty They
 know that no terri tory
 can cvcr be acquired without
 a large support from them
 and the new States of
 the Northwrest con ing in
 will vcry soon swell still
 more their it is idle
 thereforc for these gentle majorities
 men to try to convince
 any one that they arc
 afraid of acquisitions acrainst their
 wishes No sir I apprehend
 that they want to kccp
 this ques tion open I
 fear they q vant to
 have materials to cicctionecr at
 home and putdown those men
 who are just enough to
 recognize our right I fear
 that they want to kccp
 an opcn question by wl
 iich ing out of the
 application of the principle to
 Kan sus and possibly we
 might have had peace But
 ever since then looking at
 the future I have had
 apprehensions and in examining the
 map of America I have
 often been brought to the
 conclu Sion that it seemed
 as if Providence had marked
 out on it two great
 empires one lying on the
 Mis sissippi and around the
 Gulf of Mexico the other
 upon the basin of the
 St Lawrence We know Mr
 President that natural boundaries control
 very much the form of
 nations A great and pow
 erful force may sometimes carry
 a nationality over boundaries but
 nature conquers in the end
 Italy has extended itself into
 France and Spain and France
 and Spain have each extended
 them selves into Italy the
 Pyrennccs still stand as the
 boundaries of those empires Now
 sir there are States which
 lie partly upon the waters
 of the Mississippi and partly
 upon the St Lawrence Which
 empire they will go with
 if this division occurs is
 a matter of spec ulation
 Whether they will be divided
 I know not but it
 would seem that political feeling
 now is tending to such
 a division The secti01 1
 nearest the St Lawrence is
 anti slavery strongly while in
 the southern borders of thöse
 States there are opposite sentiments
 It would seem sit as
 if the political and social
 feelings of the northern and
 southern sections of the Union
 were moving in tl le
 direction of the flow of
 these immense rivers and that
 future nationalities were to have
 their forms determined by these
 natural divisions Mr President we
 have had thirteen Presidents of
 the United States elected by
 the people i mean Mr
 Buchanan is the thirteenth man
 thus chosen who has presided
 over all the States At
 the time the Confederacy was
 formed was it written in
 the book of fate that
 it should endure until there
 had been a man elected
 for each of those States
 Senators on the other side
 of this Chamber will determine
 that question The honorable Senator
 from Now York spoke with
 regret of a division of
 the Union when the dome
 of this Capitol was almost
 completed The tower of Babcl
 was not fillished when the
 nations of antiquity were divided
 T herc was a provi
 dcntial purpose in that movement
 to humble the pride of
 man and to extend humanity
 over t he castcrn continent
 Whether there is such a
 pur pose now by dividiåg
 this Union to send two
 streams of civilization over America
 or whether this unfinished tower
 is to stand as a
 monument of human folly and
 dissension upon a contineut strown
 far and wide wit h
 the immense ruins of a
 oigant ic political and social
 fabric timc alone can If
 evil should happen the finger
 of his disclose tory will
 fix the responsibility on those
 who com menced and carried
 ont t bis anti slavery
 revolu tion When Jalius Cæsar
 looked over tbc field I
 of Pharsalia and saw it
 strown with the bodies It
 is a less evil to
 the Government If they choosc
 agitation otherwise it cannot bc
 ended ar d to give
 them out to tbc landless
 Ict them do it I
 the sakc of our northern
 friends 1 think we ought
 now to take a stand
 and cave the Union at
 once would in that way
 if I could cut them
 loose from In the same
 way sir if you unless
 a complete adjustment can bo
 rnade this combinati01 1 Ten
 years ago Mr President I
 appre present to me a
 well guarded Pacific railroad bill
 hensive that ve should have
 a dissolution of thc for
 u single track I will
 vote it through if it
 ison the cheapest and best
 linc but if you ask
 me to Union bctwecn these
 States Up to that time
 I I think there was
 a had not thought it
 possible tax no y people
 outrageously to bcncfita few man
 ufacturing capitalists I will not
 do it What I great
 error committed then I have
 at ways re grcttcd that
 Mr Clay and Mr Webster
 patriotic desire then is this
 we should even if this
 Gov ernment is to endure
 dissolve this combination Remember sir
 the South has no share
 in this co nitudc of
 the question and did not
 place that sel If that
 Missouri tlemcnt on its proper
 ground partnership The Northeast is
 to get the tariff line
 had been run through as
 was dcqnauded by the Notthwest
 tho Pacific railroad and the
 home and if they had
 gone for it it could
 the South stead bill and
 the Republicans or Abolitionist s
 are to get anti slavery
 These arc thc parties to
 have been done possibly we
 should have had they can
 crush out such northern Democrats
 as of his slain countrymen
 he exclaimed n 1Y friend
 from Ohio If not why
 object to set Posterity will
 say of those would have
 it so tling the whole
 territorial question for all time
 to who persist in this
 warfare You would have these
 results come Again sir why
 not acrrce that slavery shall
 be The Inost impressive ceremony
 h fr President which have
 witnessed in this Chamber was
 on protected in the District
 of Columbia the forts and
 arsenals in the slave States
 and the slave thc occasion
 when anutnbcr of Senators frorn

 Senator has do that if
 they placo this entire question
 where died but wras far
 morc imprcssivc because the an
 nunciation of the death of
 a Slate of this Confcd
 it cannot be reached you
 may perhaps end this et
 acy is more momentous than
 that of its rcprc son
 tativc 1 use the term
 because thcrc is an anal

 a Senator dies his spirit
 goes from onc state of
 exislence to another it may
 be a l rightcr and
 a better one When those
 Statcs no longer livc to
 this Government they pass into
 a ncw Confederacy The Israelites
 with wailing and lamentation deplored
 the loss of onc of
 their tribes When recently the
 annun ciation of the departure
 of a single State was
 made as they were did
 not seem to appreciate thc
 mag li here it was
 met with strange levity on
 the other side of the
 Chamber I low will it
 I C sir when the
 ten tribcs have gone when
 fifteen States have departed In
 those States were born and
 rnour ished such slaveholders as
 Washington and Jef ferson ar

 and Marshali the cornbinat ion
 The sagacious men ofthc South
 see the danger and sooner
 than submit to be cheatéd
 and plundered in this mode
 with the pros pect in
 the future of the abolition
 of slavery and the utter
 dest ruction of their section
 they are coming resolutely into
 the struggle Nor will they
 pause now unless full justicc
 be done them on this

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 4 Forsyth
 and Scott and Harrison and
 Johnson When pressed by a
 formidable foe the North did
 not refuse the aid of
 these southern barbarians If it
 has now grown to be
 so great that it regards
 a further association with them
 an encumbrance or a disgrace
 then for the sake of
 past recollec tions why not
 let them go in peace
 The Senator from New York
 said on one occa sion
 not long since that in
 this dispute beween the North
 and the South it was
 a matter of con science
 with thc North while with
 the South it was only
 a matter of interest and
 therefore the South ought to
 yield By this mode the
 con science ofthe North can
 be relieved without sub jecting
 the South to financial bankruptcy
 politi cal degradation and social
 ruin The anti slavery current
 can then run its course
 unchecked and untrammeled It has
 already demanded at Bos ton
 the removal of the statue
 of Daniel Webster because he
 was willing to colnprornise with
 the South How long will
 it be until it roaches
 that stage when it will
 require that the statues of
 such slaveholders as Washington and
 Jackson shall be thrown into
 the Potomac the monument of
 the former razed to the
 ground and the very name
 of this city chånged to
 one of harmony with the
 anti slavery feeling Hereafter if
 the North should meet adverse
 fortune and again change its
 views then there might be
 a reunion and a recon
 struction of the Government Twice
 did the Ple bians secede
 and twicezdid the haughty Patricians
 make such terms of conciliation
 as rendered Rome the foremost
 empire upon earth If the
 States were now divided into
 two con federacies and their
 interests required a union I
 do not know why it
 might not occur But war
 places an impassable gulf betwcen
 them A Ro man embassador
 addressing those to whom he
 was sent said I carry
 in my bosom peace and
 Reversing his dec war which
 will you have laration I
 say to Senators on the
 other side of this Chamber
 You carry in your bosoms
 for the country peacc or
 war which do you rnean
 to give it If you
 say war then our people
 will meet you and strucygle
 with you all alon the
 lines and wherever else you
 come and they will defend
 their honor and the safety
 of their wives and children
 with the same spirit and
 resolution which was exhibited at
 Sullivan s Island and at
 King s Mountain at Yorktown
 and at New Or leans
 and over the many battle
 fields of Mexico I have
 no doul t the South
 will make a triumphal defense
 if assailed but sooner than
 submit io dis grace and
 degradation she would if fall
 she must rather go down
 like the strong man of
 the Bible carrying with her
 the main pillars of the
 edifice the edifice itself and
 the lords of the Philistines
 into one common ruin Mr
 HALE I only wish to
 saya word or two but
 desire to notice one or
 two things that the honorable
 Senator from North Carolina has
 said Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 Mr Presi The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr in the chair The
 Chair understands that thc Sen
 ator from Tenncssce is next
 entitled to the floor on
 the special order Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee I was about
 to move that The PRESIDING
 OFFfCF R The Senator from
 New Ham pshire is entitled
 to the floor unless he
 yields it Mr HALE I
 do not want to occupy
 the floor more than ten
 minutes but if there was
 any ar ratvernent by which
 the Senator was to have
 it of course I will
 give way Mr JOHNSON of
 Tennessee I will yield to
 the gentleman Mr HALE I
 simply wanted to call attention
 to one or two things
 that dropped from the hon
 orable Senator from North Carolina
 I want to protest here
 for one of the northern
 States against the tone of
 the Senator s speech in
 which look in to v
 rar he talks to us
 as if we were the
 war makil ig power Have
 we seized upon any forts
 Have we taken any arsenals
 and seized upon any mints
 Have we done one single
 act looking to accrression Have
 we fired into any flag
 State or llational On the
 other hand is not the
 con dition of the northern
 States one that subjects them
 in the eyes of thc
 world to the charge of
 pusillanimity and reproach for wanting
 manliness in repellitv the attacks
 that havc been made upon
 to us as if we
 were the aggressive party as
 if t he responsibilities of
 war must rest on us
 Why sir if we have
 any of the responsibilities of
 war resting upon us it
 will be by a course
 of conduct which subjects us
 in the eyes of the
 world to the imputation of
 cowards that lies still and
 invokes ao cvresslon The Senator
 was eloquent but I want
 to cor rect one other
 misapprehension only one Speak ing
 of the contingencies of war
 and I was sorry that
 the Senator went so far
 into that matter be cause
 talking about such things has
 a tendency to bring them
 on it is said the
 Devil is never so near
 as when you talk about
 him and this devil of
 war never will be so
 near as when he is
 constantly talkcd about in speculating
 upon the contin gencies that
 await the state of war
 the honorable Senator dwelt upon
 that force which would be
 found in the northern States
 favorable to him and adverse
 to the country where they
 lived Sir I would do
 anything to avoid war that
 any honor able man could
 do but Ict not the
 Senator lay that flatterirv unction
 to his soul I tell
 him if we do have
 war God in his providence
 avert It the first thing
 we will do Will be
 to dispose of north crn
 traitors We shall not go
 South Mr LANE Mr President
 if Senator will allow me
 I should like to know
 whom he calls traitors Mr
 HALE 1 was about to
 state Mr LANE I should
 like to know whom he
 means when he speaks of
 northern traitors Mr HALE I
 will tcll him cxactly so
 that he can know every
 one of them I mean
 just exactly the men who
 as the Senator from North
 Carolina said would be found
 in the northern States fight
 ing against their own States
 if war came Mr LANE
 Fighting for the Union Mr
 Pres ident for the rights
 of the States and let
 not him or any other
 man call them traitors not
 allow any gentleman to use
 the term I say northern
 Incn that he will have
 to fight belong to that
 portion of the Norlh that
 stands by the Constitution by
 the rights of all the
 States by the equality of
 the States and the right
 of every naan from every
 Stale to go into the
 Territories with his property and
 neither he nor any other
 man must call them traitors
 Mr HALE Mr Mr CLINGMAN
 If the honorable Senator will
 allow me I think he
 is laboring under quitc a
 misapprehension I did not state
 that all y man in
 the North would fight on
 our side I referred to
 what Lord Chatham said in
 England that he rejoiced America
 had resisted and I said
 that many men in thc
 North would entertain those sentiments
 and would not cordially coöperate
 in any movement against us
 Thatwasalll said sir Mr HALE
 1 am glad to hear
 that tion I think the
 Senator went a little further
 but however do not want
 to press him I do
 not want to have any
 controversy with the Scn atop
 from Oregon I am not
 going to definc any man
 s position nor am going
 to define it before he
 selects it or after I
 leave every man to choose
 for himself but I repeat
 what I began with that
 if we arc forced into
 a war I tell you
 we will deal with all
 domestic questions without any advice
 from anybody Now I have
 but a single v ord
 more to say in reply
 rather to the Senator s
 rhetoric than to his logic
 He says the most imposing
 thing that he has seen
 in this body wras when
 those Senators announced that they
 verc about to retire thc
 other day Sir I saw
 a ceremony simpler than that
 and vastly more imposing about
 the same time It was
 when my friend from the
 State of Maine Mr MORRILL
 coming here under an election
 of his State walked upto
 that desk and held up
 his right hand and called
 God to witness that he
 would support the Constitution of
 the United States That was
 vastly more imposing to me
 The hon orable Senator asks
 in that overflowing rhetoric with
 which he has delighted the
 Senate so long What will
 you say when the ten
 tribes go out Sir I
 was glad to hear that
 Ten tribes did go out
 from the kingdom of Israel
 but the ark of i
 the covenant of the living
 God remained with the tribe
 of Judah A_pplause in the
 galleries The PRESIDING OFFICER called
 to order Mr HALE 1
 think the galleries ought to
 be exctlsed for applauding a
 referencc made to the Scriptures
 Laughter I say there is
 where the I them Gentlemen
 come here and preach peace
 ark of the covenant remained
 What became of the ten
 tribes They have gone God
 only knows where and nobody
 else It is a matter
 of spec ulation what became
 of them x vhether they
 con stitute the Pottawatomies or
 some other tribc of American
 savares I recollect a friend
 said to me the other
 day when the Japanese were
 here I am glad the
 Japanese came for said he
 I have learned more history
 from them than i did
 from all the books I
 ever read I now know
 what became of the ten
 tribes they settled Japan Laughter
 Wcll sir thatisaspcculation Now this
 was suggested by the honorable
 Senator from North Carolina and
 it is full of meaning
 There were ten tribes Nient
 out and remember they went
 out wandering They left the
 ark and the empire behind
 them They went as said
 before God only knows where
 But sir I do hope
 and pray that this comparison
 so eloquent and Instructive suggested
 by the honorable Senator may
 not be illustrated in the
 fate of these other tribes
 that are going out from
 the household of Israel Mr
 GREEN 1 hope the special
 order will now be taken
 up the unfinished business of
 last Saturday The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The special or der is
 now before the Senate which
 is the ques tion of
 printing extra numbers of the
 President s message transmitting to
 the Senate certain reso lutions
 of the Legislature of the
 State of Virginia Mr GREEN
 That was taken up by
 common consent without displacing the
 other Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 I will move that it
 be postponed until to morrow
 Mr GREEN Let it postponed
 until to mor row because
 it was taken up by
 common con sent without displacing
 the other order which is
 a bill to establish a
 territorial government for the Territory
 of Idaho Mr JOHNSON of
 Tennessee With the per mission
 of the Senator from Missouri
 I will move to postpone
 it until one o clock
 to morrow and make it
 the special order for that
 hour The motion was agreed
 to TERRITORY OF COLORADO The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair will
 observe that there is another
 special order which appears to
 have been informally passed over
 rel ative to which there
 is no motion made It
 is the bill declaratory of
 the acts for carrying into
 effect the ninth article of
 the treaty between the United
 States and Spain NIr GREEN
 The unfinished business has priority
 over that ThePRESIDINGOFFICER unfinished business
 is the bill S No
 366 to provide a ter
 ritorial government for the Territory
 of Colorado and that is
 the business now before the
 Senate The Senate resumed the
 consideration of the Mr GREEN
 There is a slight change
 in the boundary suggested by
 the friends of the adjoin
 ing Territories of New Mexico
 and Utah aid as it
 seems to meet with general
 acceptance I send it to
 the Secretary s table to
 be read I will briefly
 explain it and the Senate
 will un derstand it in
 a moment It proposes only
 two changes The reason for
 that is that a portion
 of the inhabitants of Utah
 Territory have settled there and
 this would have a tendency
 if the bill rctnains as
 it now is to divide
 them They had better all
 remain together I have no
 objection to that modification T
 hc other change is to
 take off that notch above
 370 of New Mexico Iam
 opposed to that but still
 I rnovc it because I
 want the thing all settled
 and see no good reason
 why it should not bc
 adopted The only thing can
 say is this the Delegate
 from that Territory says a
 portion of his people natives
 of New Mexico speaking that
 language have settled up there
 and he wants a homoffeneous
 people all kept together There
 is some force in that
 but still I think in
 parceling out and shaping Terri
 tories and States we ought
 to have reference to the
 permanent good of the Territory
 rather than a lernporary accommodation
 The Secretary read the amendment
 to strike outin the first
 section thc following words The
 said boundary line of New
 Mexico to the point of
 intersection of its easterly part
 with the thirty seventh degree
 and to insert in lieu
 thereof the wordso the thirty
 seventh parallel of north lat
 itude so that it will
 read Thence south on said
 rneridian of New Mexico thence
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 729
 along the thirty seventh parallel
 of north latitude thence easterly
 on said parallel c The
 amendrnent was agreed to Mr
 GREEN I believe there are
 no other pend ing amendments
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 un derstands that there is
 a pending amendment on which
 no vote has been had
 Mr GREEN There was a
 pending amend ment proposed by
 the Senator from Texas Mr
 HEMPHILL but I think I
 can make a slight mod
 ification in the bill that
 will satisfy him and ren
 der his amendment unnecessary and
 I think he I wish
 to call the attention of
 will withdraw it the Senator
 frotn Texas to a suggestion
 that I have to make
 which will render his amendment
 unnecessary I ask the Secretary
 to read the sug gestion
 that I marked on the
 margin of the bill It
 is in the sixth section
 to insert the words prop
 erty subject to which will
 just cover the case The
 Secretary read the amendment in
 line eleven of section six
 after the word all to
 insert the words property subject
 to so that it will
 read But all property subject
 to taxation shall be in
 proportion to the value of
 the property taxed Mr GREEN
 It leaves it to the
 Territory to say what property
 shall be taxed They can
 exempt any they wish Mr
 HEMPHILL My only in making
 the motion I did xvas
 inasmuch as perceived the system
 of ad calorem taxation was
 to be adopted in that
 Territory that every person that
 was taxed at all should
 have a certam amount of
 property exempt from taxation that
 no man should be taxed
 in his property unless he
 possessed over two hundred and
 fifty dollars worth of property
 I am not familiar with
 the organization of Terri tories
 and I do not care
 about insisting upon the thc
 amendment Mr GREEN This will
 just cover the case The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on the amendment as modified
 The amendment was agreed to
 Mr WILSON I mové to
 amend the name of the
 Territory by striking out Idaho
 and in serting Colorado I
 do it at the rcquestof
 tl ö delegate from that
 Territory who is very anxioug
 about it and came to
 sec me to day to
 have that change madc He
 said that the Colorado river
 arose in the Territory and
 therc was a sort of
 fitness in it but this
 word Idaho meant noth ing
 There is nothing in it
 Mr GREEN The Idaho was
 put in at the instance
 of the Delegate from the
 Ter ritory Mr WILSON He
 has his opinion Mr GREEN
 But 1 Colorado more appropriate
 and more harmonious The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Chair will suggest
 that that wili more properly
 conie up as an amendmcnt
 to the title of the
 bill Mr WILSON It has
 got to be changed in
 the body of the bill
 Mr GREEN Yes sir wherever
 it occurs in I prefer
 that name and will the
 body of the bill vote
 with the Senator The amendment
 was agreed to The amendments
 made as in Committee of
 the Whole werc concurred in
 The bill was ordered to
 bc engrossed and read a
 third time It was read
 the third time The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FITCH The question
 is Shall this bill pass
 Mr CRITTENDEN 1 wish to
 say one word If the
 information which I only on
 this subject have received be
 correct there is not only
 a very inconsiderable population in

 ask leave to offer the
 Following resolution to which I
 think there ought to be
 no objection and to which
 I hope there will be
 no objection Whereas it is
 reported that near a million
 dollars con sisting the money
 of the United States and
 of individual deposltors was lately
 in the custody of the
 superintendent of the mint of
 the United States at the
 city o Netv Or reans
 and whereas it is also
 reported that that officer has
 refused to pay a draft
 of the United States out
 of their own money in
 his custody and has appropriated
 the whole of the contents
 of said mint to the
 use ot the revolutionary authorities
 in the State of Louisiana
 and has put the Uni
 ted States at defiance and
 whereas it is also reported
 that the same revolutionary authorities
 have seized the custorn house
 of the United States at
 said city Therefore Resolved That
 the President of the United
 States be re spectfully requested
 to communicate to this House
 at an early day if
 in his judgment 110t incompatible
 with the public interests the
 facts in relation to the
 atOresaid mat ters and what
 if any steps he has
 taken or contcrnplates to recover
 possession of said treasure and
 property Mr BURNETT If thegentleman
 from Illi nois will just
 offer his resolution of inquiry
 I will offer no objection
 to it but with tho
 preamble to his resolution I
 think it objectionable I there
 fore cannot go for the
 preamble but I will go
 for the resolution with a
 great deal of cheerfulness I
 cannot agree to the reception
 of the resolution in its
 present form Mr McCLERNAND Theprcamble
 only re cites what is
 represented to be matters of
 report It avers nothing Mr
 BURNETT 1 understand that If
 the gentleman will just call
 on the President of the
 Ünited States to furnish any
 information not in compatible with
 the public service in regard
 to the seizure of money
 belonging to the Federal Government
 in the city of New
 Orleans or in regard to
 the refusal to pay drafts
 drawn on any United States
 officer there by the Government
 I will vote for it
 but I cannot agree to
 its reception in its present
 form Mr MAYNARD It seems
 to Ine that the resolution
 of the gentleman from Illinois
 Mr CRAIGE Carolina 1 object
 to debate Mr McCLERNAND 1
 am willing to accept tho
 modification suggested Mr BURNETT 1
 move to amend the reso
 lution of the gentleman from
 Illinois so as to call
 on thc President for any
 information in his possession in
 regard to this matter Mr
 McCLERNAND 1 modifica tion Mr
 CRAIG E of North Carolina
 I object to the reception
 of the resolution Mr McCLERNAND
 am surprised that any member
 of this House should object
 to a res olution of
 this kind Mr CRAIGE of
 North Carolina And 1 am
 surprised that a gentleman professing
 to enter tain the principles
 held by the gentleman from
 Illinois should present such a
 resolution Mr McCLERNAND 1 am
 surprised that any gentleman here
 objecting to submission should not
 object to the usurpations of
 revolu tionary authorities Mr CRAIGE
 of North Carolina 1 deny
 all the allegations in the
 preamble of the gentlernan s
 resolution Mr McCLERNAND There is
 no in the preamble sir
 It only recites what pur
 ports to be matter of
 report and the resolution is
 predicated on that Mr CRAIGE
 of North Carolina If we
 were to base resolutions on
 every idle newspaper report we
 would have plenty to do
 Mr MAYNARD 1 must object
 to debate The gentleman from
 North Carolina objected to my
 making a remark EVENING SESSION
 Mr SHERMAN Several gentlemen desire
 that the debate on the
 report of the committee of
 th irty three shall bc
 carried on in even irwr
 session thcrcforc ask unanimous consent
 that a recess shall be
 taken from four o clock
 till seven for this week
 for debate Mr LOGAN I
 hope that the proposition will
 not be adopted Mr SHERMAN
 benefit of gentlemen generally Mr
 LOGAN If the evening session
 is for tho purpose gentlemen
 to read what they havc
 written as speeches I have
 no objection but gentlemen who
 have the floor now are
 not in the habit of
 reading communications to tho House
 and do not want to
 spepk in the night to
 the Chair without any one
 LO pay attention to them
 have been here during two
 of the night sessions and
 I have not noticed the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr SHERMAN
 at any of them Mr
 SH RMAN I never attend
 nightsessions Mr LOGAN Now sir
 if eveninT sessions are to
 be held for the purpose
 of allowing gentle men to
 read written speeches I have
 no objection But I have
 a right to the floor
 whenever the House takes up
 the report of the committee
 of thirty three I have
 no written speech I never
 write one and do not
 intend to speak at night
 to empty benc hes and
 hope the House will not
 force me to it Mr
 SHERMAN 1 have only made
 the mo tion for the
 benefit of other gentlemen entirely
 it will be no benefit
 Mr LOGAN well sir to
 me 1 do not want
 to speak at any night
 ses sion Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 would suggesta compromise in
 relation to this question pose
 that none but extemporaneous speeches
 shall be made in the
 morning and none but vritten
 speeches shall bc made at
 night Laughter Mr LOGAN I
 have no objection to that
 Mr CA REY I take
 this opportunity of ascer taining
 if I can what a
 gentleman has to do in
 this House in order to
 obtain the floor to speak
 Mr KILGOR E Oh that
 is a bargain to be
 made with the Chair Mr
 CA REY I have been
 wanting to make a few
 remarks for some time upon
 the matters pending before the
 House but I do not
 under stand precisely the way
 of getting the floor understand
 there is a system here
 of farming out the floor
 and that a gentleman cannot
 have the right to speak
 except he complies with all
 the requirernents of that system
 I want to know how
 precisely the right is to
 be obtained I low did
 the gcntlcman from Illinois obtain
 that right Mr LOGAN I
 obtained the right by comincy
 here and sitting here until
 ten o clock for t
 wo sucossive nights beftn c
 I could succeed in being
 recognized by the Chair Mr
 CA REY That is all
 vcry satisfactory as far as
 the gentleman is concerned but
 that does not answer the
 question how these rights are
 generally obtained Mr LOGAN That
 is the way I obtained
 my Mr CAREY well sir
 1 hoar ofgentlemon having their
 names recorded for tbefloorfor weeks
 before the subject even comes
 up for discussion I protest
 against such a practice prevailing
 here The SPEAKER The gentleman
 from Ohio is laboring under
 a very great mistake so
 far as the Chair is
 concerned in supposing that gentle
 men s names arc recorded
 for the floor for weeks
 in advance The gentlcman from
 Ohio has never infomned the
 Chair of his desire to
 address the House T hc
 Chair ncvcr heard a word
 of it bcCorc I hope
 the Mr LEACH of North
 Carolina motion of the gentleman
 from Ohio MI SHER MAN
 will prevail in reply to
 the gentleman fi orn Illinois
 Mr LOGAN I have only
 to say that but few
 speeches delivered in this House
 are listened to but are
 read by t hc constituencies
 of the gen tlemcn who
 deliver them on this floor
 and heir respective merits passed
 upon by the people of
 Mr KILLINGER resolution The motion
 of Mr SHERMAN was agreed
 to and the order made

 the pending amendment of the
 Senate to the deficiency bill
 in two hours after the

 SHERMAN 1 now move that
 the rules be suspended and
 that the House resolve itself
 into the Committee of the
 Whole on the state of
 the Union The motion was
 agreed to The rules were
 accordingly suspended and the House
 resolved itself into the Committee

 BURNETT in the chair and
 resumed the consideration of the
 special order being the Senate

 valuable privileges and rights speci
 ed in said contract and
 which said contract is hereby
 pproved 300 000 On which
 Mr M0RsE vvas entitled to
 the floor Mr MORSE addressed
 the committee for an hour
 in favor of a concurrcnce
 in the amendment I lis
 remarks will be published of
 the Senate in the Appendix
 Mr STEVENS Mr Chair man
 I am aware that but
 few gentlemen in the House
 at this time can be
 expected to examine a subject
 of this kind thoroughly enough
 to form a conclusion by
 wading through the mass of
 matter relevant and irrelevant authentic
 and spu rious to be
 met with in the report
 in this case But it
 became my duty as one
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Means bound to look
 into this thing to examine
 it thoroughly from top to
 bot tom I have done
 so according to the best
 of my ability with a
 grcat desire to find it
 a just claim for some
 of my most intimate friends
 are deeply interested in its
 success but I have come
 to dif ferent conclusions These
 conclusions are as fol lows
 In thc first place Mr
 Thompson has nota par I
 ticle of title to any
 onc of the things which
 he oflörs to sell us
 and I will demonstrate that
 be In the next place
 if he had fore I
 get through the best title
 in the world the privilege
 is not the country I
 do not proposc to read
 a written worth a farthing
 to himself or anybody else
 In essay but I do
 desire to submit my vicsys
 to the House on the
 political crisis and then to
 review and write them out
 that my constituents and the
 people of my State may
 know my views on the
 sub ect SPEAKER The question
 before the House is shall
 the House take a recess
 for the present week from
 four o clock to seven
 o clock for the purpose
 of debate only Mr LOGAN
 1 object Mr LOVEJOY Why
 sir 1 the debate upon
 this subject is to bc
 closed on Thurs The SPEAKER
 The question before the House
 tlicn is upon closing debate
 in two hours on the
 pending amendment of the Senate
 to the deficiency bill I
 Mr CRAIG of Missouri The
 gentleman I from Ohio yields
 to me to offer a
 resolution for I reference only
 the third place if hc
 had thc title and if
 the priv ileges were valuable
 he could not transfer them
 to the United States and
 the very transfer which hc
 has attempted to make now
 has forfeited all If I
 do not demonstrate these things
 his rights clearly and to
 the satisfaction of the few
 gentle men who are accustomed
 to look into matters of
 this kind thcn I have
 deceived myself Mr Chairman the
 scene it is well we
 should know its location of
 this South Sea bubble is
 tract of land which makes
 the northern part of the
 Isthmus of Panama I infer
 it from Morse s GC
 ography and our own treaties
 I cannot be mis I
 taken in that so far
 as the New Granadian con
 It is the northern part
 of the tract is concerned
 Isthmus of Panama about sixty
 or seventy miles north of
 the railroad that crosses at
 Panama That railroad is forty
 seven miles in lcnffth From
 the I lagoon of Chifiqui
 to the town of David
 where I the first grant
 goes and which the chairman
 of 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 731 the Committee on Naval
 Affairs candidly admits authorizes nothing
 but a clay turnpike is
 sev enty five miles The
 other route granted by Costa
 Rica from Golfita to the
 Atlantic ocean is between ninety
 and onc hundred miles in
 length selecting almost the widest
 part of the Ist hmus
 of Panama The two oceans
 are divided at these points
 by a chain of called
 the Cordilleras the lowest elevation
 of which is four thousand
 two hundred and seventv feet
 and the highest about nine
 thou sand feet The engineer
 says he looked down from
 a height of eight thousand
 feet and above him towering
 sublime he had a spectacle
 of a volcano which went
 up I do not know
 how high The country is
 uninhabited on the Atlantic side
 the grant for the purpose
 of transporting soldiers ammunition and
 munitions of war acroSs the
 Isthmus Why sir the attempt
 of Bonaparte to cross the
 Alps was mere child s
 play in compar ison with
 the attempt to cross these
 South Amer ican mountains with
 soldiers and munitions of war
 If then you grant the
 right of Thompson which he
 proposes now to cede it
 confers no pres ent value
 to the Government in respect
 to the transportation of munitions
 of war in return for
 the 300 000 which this
 bill appropriates It is in
 fact the right to travel
 a road that is inaccessible
 to anything but goats or
 mules which is about thc
 same thing Laughter Now suppose
 we had the title perfected
 the gentleman from Maine Mr
 MORSE was candid fifty miles
 each way except by a
 small village of I enough
 to admit that it would
 be of no present value
 to the Government But sir
 what we arc negroes On
 the Pacific side there arc
 a few towns _ ne
 of thein the enyine er
 gravely sets forth as of
 buying is the present value
 YVe are not buying the
 road at what it wilt
 be when it is finished
 considerable importance för he says
 there are eighty families in
 it In other words the
 whole country is uninhabited and
 the Government of the province
 is oflöriiv to o ive
 a i vay all the
 lands to any persons who
 will colonize them without asking
 anything for it The New
 Granadian ran tis a grant
 to Ambrose Thompson to improve
 an old provincial road I
 which had been opened fourteen
 years before that grant so
 as to make it passable
 with wheeled vehic es from
 the Chik iqui lagoon to
 the city of David When
 that road is opened and
 is so cer tified by
 the Governor then the grantee
 has the right to transport
 and charge tolls upon it
 to all except the Government
 of New Granada Now sir
 what was that provincial road
 About twenty years ago fourteen
 years from the date of
 the grant the Government of
 Chiriqui a pro vince u
 ninhabited except by a fitw
 Y an kees R vho
 went there to speculate oponed
 a road by blaz ing
 the trees from the town
 of David to the Chiriqui
 lagoon That is the road
 which was to be opened
 and improved in a solid
 way so as to make
 it pass able with wheeled
 vehicles After that the right
 was to attach and not
 before Now it is not
 pretended that the road is
 pass I able for wheeled
 vehicles Mr Thompson him self
 who is an iivenious man
 admits that they have cut
 it open wide enough for
 wheeled vehi cle s for
 two or throe leagues but
 that they have cut down
 the trees for the rest
 of the distance so that
 mules can pass fronl one
 poil t to the other
 and have got the certificate
 of Mr Morel and others
 that they have known it
 to be passed even with
 loaded beasts of burden Now
 my friend who has argued
 so eloquently on the value
 of com mcrcc over mountains
 eight thousand feet high has
 not told us how it
 is that any right a
 ttaches which was not to
 attach till after the certificate
 of the Governor T herc
 is no such certificate amona
 thcsc papers He has not
 examined it but there is
 a certificate by the alcalde
 Mr MORSE I he gen
 tleman from Pennsyl vania will
 do me the justice to
 say that I set no
 value on this road except
 in regard to the coal
 grounds Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 The gen tlcman from Maine
 is candid in that He
 does not rely on it
 as a railroad Other gentlernan
 have Inade that the chief
 burden of their sona and
 one inøenious gentleman from New
 York Mr SICKLES went so
 far as to say that
 the right to im prove
 a road so as to
 make it passable for wheeled
 vehicles meant a railroad and
 he asks the House to
 believe it There is as
 much nonsense in that as
 in thc rest But sir
 I sav that up to
 this dav therc never has
 a wheeled vehicle of any
 kind passed between the lagoon
 of Chiriqui and the Pacific
 ocean But they have certificates
 that are before us by
 which any gentleman can ascer
 tail by looking into these
 reports one two three and
 four certificates of most respectable
 gentlenoen that tbc road has
 actually been passed from sea
 to sea with loaded beasts
 of burden And which permit
 mc to say will in
 my judgment be not many
 days before the rendering up
 of our final accounts Laughter
 W c are now pay
 ing this money and we
 have not the assurance of
 a single dollar that it
 will ever be finished Why
 sir if it is ever
 finished it must be at
 the expense of millions of
 dollars and Mr Thomp son
 is not the shrewd man
 I take him to be
 and I know him well
 I know hirn to bo
 a most adroit just the
 man to get up this
 kind of a spec man
 ulation but I say he
 would lose his character for
 sagacity and his character for
 truth if after get ting
 hold of this 300 000
 hc over felt called upon
 to spend a dollar there
 Laughter know the man woll
 enough and his sagacity well
 enough to bc perfectly sure
 Illat such a thing will
 never take place under God
 s heaven If he oncc
 gets hold of this after
 paying off his assistants in
 crcttin F it through this
 House he will put t
 he balance in his pocket
 and be a rich man
 But here are gentlemen in
 this House ask us to
 vote for such a measure
 as this not know what
 is operating upon them I
 know they are honest Laughter
 I know they are capable
 but I know they are
 terribly deluded in sorne way
 But there is another view
 of this Inatter to which
 I wish to call the
 attention of this House I
 havo been presenting the matter
 as if Ambrose W Thompson
 had the title wh ich
 he proposes to grant I
 will say that hc has
 not any title to it
 not a particle By tbc
 New Granadian grant which is
 to be found in this
 report of the gentleman from
 NTaine on page 14 let
 us see at what period
 this l ant is to
 bc vested in Mr Th0D1pson
 It is stipulated in article
 three that so soon as
 the im provement of the
 whole road shall bc concluded
 according to the tcvm s
 stipulated in the ordinance that
 is to make a good
 passable road for the transit
 of wheeled vehicles Mr Thompson
 or no evidence that any
 certificate has been given by
 the Government of the prövince
 We have also tliC certificate
 of Mr Motel whöi as
 we cero ina formed was
 the first to denounce the
 road and therefore to acquire
 a title to it and
 I think we shall continue
 to denounce the road as
 a very great swindle Well
 sir it is said there
 are coal mines there that
 coal has actually been taken
 and that it ex ists
 there in inexhaustible quantities Why
 sir if coal actually existed
 there so that it could
 be excavated and sold for
 fifty cents a ton cheaper
 than that brought from Virginia
 from Pennsyl vania and from
 Liverpool do vou suppose it
 would not have been opened
 by this enterprising Yankee Thc
 wholc story is too incredible
 to I believe that Dr
 Evans was sold by believe
 I these men who induced
 him to really believe existed
 there Why sir if coal
 existed there in accessible localities
 do you suppose the whole
 Yankee nation with the exorbitantprices
 paid for coal in that
 region would have allowed the
 mines to remain unopened to
 this time No sir two
 thirds of the peo le
 of Maine would have been
 there long ago Laughter But
 gentlemen say that that question
 has been decided that Dr
 Evans the geologist has made
 an examination and said there
 was coal there Well sir
 I have nothing to say
 against Dr Evans I have
 read with great admiration his
 book on the dirts in
 I Oregon which he has
 been getting up for years
 at a very great expense
 to the Government and which
 is not ofa particle of
 value to any human Laughter
 He says they gathered a
 i barrel of the coal
 and took it to Norfolk
 vherc I it has been
 analyzed Well sir about thirty
 years acro of course before
 my time thece was a
 great excitement in a certain
 locality in Pennsylvania where coal
 mines were said to exist
 Some gen tlemen went up
 and made an examination in
 sev cral places and found
 aplenty of coal They tried
 it at the blacksmith s
 they had it analyzed and
 ascertained that it contained a
 proper quantity of oil and
 the man sold his land
 for a fabulous price I
 but afterwards it turned out
 that the man had been
 engaged for three weeks in
 carting coal to the lo
 cality and that there were
 no coal mincs there Well
 sir Mr Morel the gentleman
 who de nounced this property
 it seems took t he
 geologist tö the very spot
 where the coal was to
 be found helped him get
 out some of it and
 put it into a I
 barrel and upon that statement
 we are asked to believe
 that there is an inexhaustible
 quantity in that region I
 Mr I desire to say
 a single word in justice
 to Dr Evans whose character
 the gentle Inan from Pennsylvania
 calls in question Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania Oh no sir
 not at all His character
 is as good as any
 geologist s Laughter his representative
 shall so the Governor Mr
 MORSE The coal which Dr
 Evans took of the province
 so that hc himself or
 by a com was blasted
 from thc rock He saw
 it done Mr STEVENS ofPennsylvania
 Ifthere be mission appointed for
 the purpose may in com
 coal there rest assured that
 it will be mined and
 pan y with Mr Thompson
 or his representative prepared for
 sale whenever it is profitable
 to do proceed to inspect
 the work and judge whether
 I so and when it
 can be procured at rates
 lower or not the conditions
 of the contract have been
 ful than thc present oncs
 in that region I have
 no filicd by the grantee
 and in the affirmative casc
 to declarc hirn in full
 exercise of t he rights
 and doubt wc can purchasc
 it as well as all
 others without any necessity for
 the payment of he sum
 prerooatives acquired under this privi
 oec of 3002000 Now sir
 there has never been such
 a com mission It is
 not pretended or sot for
 h in any And Mr
 Morel has conferred another våluabtc
 of these documents that the
 Governor has in grant to
 this company and that is
 the construc tion ofa canal
 over the interveninT mountains if
 any way ccrtified that he
 has examined the work over
 any such thing can possibly
 be accomplished There are certain
 certificates that the road has
 been opened to a certain
 extent and these certifi But
 supposc the title of the
 company were good cates come
 from very respectable persons They
 i and there was a
 perfect utility in it Mr
 IRVINE Do the reports show
 any obli say that the
 road has been opened to
 a certain extent so as
 to be crossed even by
 beasts of bur gation on
 the part of the Govcrnmcnt
 of Now that is repeated
 three times in these certifi
 Granada or Costa Rica or
 of the Chiriqui com cates
 Onc certificatc is from a
 Yankee by tho puny to
 mine the coal to supply
 our Government name of James
 Agnew to whom some time
 ago at the coal stations
 mentioned in Thompson s con
 the grant was made but
 not having the right tract
 with the Secretary of the
 Navy upon any name exactly
 to give certificates likely to
 be avail terms i able
 for southern grants such as
 that his name Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania There is that
 is the grant they propose
 to convey to us MI
 Chairman I am now supposing
 this grant to has been
 metamorphosed into Sefior Santiago no
 obligation on the part of
 anybody to mine it be
 valid with Mr Thompson But
 sir it is ad Agnew
 Much laughter In other words
 it is i If they
 mine it I believe l
 ve are to pay the
 coxn mitted that no road
 has ever been approved over
 E now St James Agnew
 This is one of the
 per pan y ten per
 cent in addition to their
 expenses that route it is
 admitted that no railroad has
 been sons whose certificate is
 depended on to establish Suppose
 the title is perfect let
 us see whether the case
 sought to be made out
 before this House ii we
 can possibly buy it You
 will observe that begun that
 therc has not been done
 the first work But sir
 the whole thing is as
 bold a thing as was
 Mr Thompson enters into a
 long preamble in his in
 reference to it Now I
 ask what is the pres
 ent value of thc privilege
 which this contract i over
 gotten up by honest men
 Great laughter contract with the
 Secretary of the Navy Is
 not Trants us to cross
 the Isthmus at that point
 Re B lt sir even
 with the certificate of my
 Yankec this the saine man
 Thompson who was engaged member
 i am now speaking of
 the transit What i friend
 who by the way did
 not certify that there in
 the live oak contracts under
 this same Secretary is the
 value to the United States
 at this time of is
 a passable road for wheeled
 vehicles there is of the
 Navy Mr rrhompson grants to
 us full 732 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 4 privilege of
 navigating and using all ports
 and harbors in that neighborhood
 Who believes that he has
 any control over them Nobody
 can be lieve that he
 can confer any such privileges
 No doubt Mr Thompson has
 been induced to make this
 offer by the example of
 the ancient speculator who from
 the top of a high
 mountain offered the kingdoms of
 the earth which he did
 not own an inch of
 Laughter But he has granted
 something more He has granted
 the right to transport troops
 and muni tions ot war
 across this read Does not
 the grant from New Granada
 provide that troops and mu
 nitions of war belonging to
 a foreign Government shall not
 pass over that road unless
 with its con sent Certainly
 it does But my friend
 says why to be sure
 we had better pay this
 and then get permission from
 the Government of New Géa
 nada My idea is that
 we had better get permis
 Sion first and when we
 have obtained it in my
 opinion wc are in a
 condition to know exactly what
 we are getting for our
 money When we buy from
 Mr Thompson or this company
 we get no privilege By
 the language of his grant
 any infraction of its provisions
 it is stated shall be
 its revocation That is not
 all Mr Thomp son is
 fully authorized to transfer his
 privileges to any person or
 persons company or companies with
 the sole condition that that
 road shall be improved but
 in no case can he
 transfer any of them to
 any foreign Government After that
 will anybody tell me what
 we are after Laugh ter
 Will anybody tell rne what
 it is we are to
 get I admit that Costa
 Rica which lies north and
 adjoining New Granada has granted
 to Mr Thompson since the
 contract was first drawn out
 the right to make a
 railroad and put it into
 operation from the gulf of
 Golfito to thc Pacific ocean
 about one hundred miles In
 the first place has hc
 any title By the terms
 of the grant he was
 to build that road and
 put it into opera tion
 before he got a title
 Not only that I Ie
 was at the expiration of
 six months from the time
 his contract was approved to
 deposit in the treasury of
 Costa Rica Six months have
 ex pired and 100 000
 remains yet undeposited The honorable
 gentleman from New York said
 that the grant had pot
 been approved by the Congress
 of Costa Rica and that
 therefore the six months yet
 remained If that be so
 then why are we asked
 to buy the grant as
 good if it has not
 yet been approved It has
 never been before the Con
 gress of Costa Rica and
 we do not know that
 it will be approved We
 arc asked sir to pay
 the before it is pretended
 the grant has any validity
 Not only that By the
 very terms of the grant
 we havc no right to
 it YVhy do I say
 that In the grant of
 Costa Rica page 60 of
 the report there arc a
 few essential clauses I will
 read ART 14 I hc
 grantees shall not at any
 tixne bc to discn l
 bark or trans port nor
 consent tn the transportation or
 disctn barkation at any t
 hne whatsoever across the rail
 arni In unitibns of war
 l Clongü1 to any road
 of troöps föroign Govcnnncnt or
 to individuals or privatc sÖe
 ictic3 companies The Republic of
 Costa Rica only shall pos
 sess this right That excludes
 the United States Government as
 well as fillibuster expeditions from
 acquiring the rights under the
 grant to M r Thompson
 wii read further The infraction
 ot this articlc by the
 grantees theft agents or those
 charged with the direction and
 adxninis tration of the enterprise
 Shakl forthwith work as a
 coauplete nullity and forfeiture ofthe
 present contract in all and
 every onc of its parts
 aud the confiscation not only
 of such arans and tnunitions
 of war but also of
 the railroad and all its
 works and fixtures Mr Thompson
 has consented that we shall
 dis embark troops there that
 we shall disembark munitions of
 war and by the clause
 L have just read it
 will be seen by so
 consontihg hc has forfeited all
 rights and privileges under the
 grant himself That is not
 all I will read again
 18 The grantees at no
 tune sbal be at liberty
 under penalty of forfeit all
 thc privileges of t_his eontraet
 to transfer or to cede
 to any fbreign Govennncnt the
 grant of concessions and privileges
 Iliade to thein by virtue
 of the present contract months
 after the approval thereof by
 Congress the sum of 100
 000 in cash which amount
 shall be returned to thein
 in tbe same form and
 without interest on the completion
 of the railroad The time
 fixed has expired and yet
 not one dollar of that
 sum has yet been deposited
 I do not think it
 ever will be What do
 we get by the If
 we pass this purchase then
 Nothing at all appropriation then
 we will pay out the
 public money without getting anything
 for it But suppose he
 had the right to grant
 the privi lege to Congress
 is there a railroad there
 Not at all Has the
 first spadeful ofearth been thrown
 up Has it been located
 Not at all What are
 we buying We are buying
 the privilege of trans porting
 our troops and munitions of
 war over a railroad which
 we are prohibited from doing
 by the contract itself The
 railroad has never been begun
 never been located and there
 is no guar antee that
 it ever will be located
 or laid out and finished
 But whether that be so
 or not it is enough
 for us I think to
 propose buying the privilege when
 it is worth buyine I
 do not know that I
 know anything about rail roads
 myself although it has been
 my fortune to be president
 of one for about six
 or seven years I do
 knowr that some of these
 litde Republics of Central America
 know more about railroads upon
 paper than anywherc else Anybody
 who knows anything about railroads
 however knows from the report
 of this enTineer that it
 is the emanation of a
 man who is deceived or
 of an ionorant man He
 states that the average of
 the grades between the two
 oceans is five hundred and
 eighty feet but that it
 can be reduced to two
 hundred and ninety feet by
 doubling tl katis by running
 twenty miles this way then
 twenty miles that and so
 on Does anyl 0dy believe
 a railroad can ever be
 put into operation upon such
 grades Why sn you cannot
 erect a railroad with any
 advantage with curves of a
 radius less than five hundred
 fret and then only w
 hcrl the grade does not
 oxcecd forty fcct to tbc
 mile So say all the
 authorities upon the subject An
 attempt to make a railroad
 with two hundred and ninety
 feet grade by doublinff or
 cutting it off by tunneling
 to reduce it to that
 grade is a matter of
 the imagination You might as
 well attempt to make a
 railroad to a place where
 I hope to go but
 which I never knew worked
 to advantage but by one
 individual who had both fiery
 steeds and an iron chariot
 as to attempt to scale
 such mountains by any power
 which man possesses But we
 are told by the gentleman
 from New York Mr SICKLES
 that now is the accepted
 lime and now is the
 day of salvation that if
 we Iosc this opportunity we
 shall never again get such
 an offer that there are
 moneyed men in New York
 willing to give four or
 five times as much for
 this privilege that England will
 get it that France will
 gel it and hat wc
 must get it now or
 never if gentlemen will look
 at it they will see
 that Mr Thompson docs not
 grant to the Ullilcd States
 an exclusive right and that
 if we were to buy
 this privilege for 300 000
 the same privilege may sold
 to morrow to these shrewd
 men in New York and
 the same privilege could be
 sold to England or to
 France because the right they
 _n opose to sell us
 is not an exclusive one
 Al d t ere will
 be room enough over those
 mount ains for all of
 us This cry about other
 Govern uents is the same
 cry that annexed Texas and
 may yet seize Cuba It
 is one of those fallacies
 which ought not to operate
 upon a sensible Con ffress
 The gentleman from Maine with
 great and hill labfe zeal
 is for an extended commerce
 and he has painted to
 you in glowing colors the
 advantages of commerce Why sir
 Eve was to make a
 great deal of eating by
 partaking of for bidden fruit
 and we are to make
 a great deal by stealing
 a grant which we have
 no right to buy and
 a privilege which theu can
 never be enjoyed I Who
 believes that the connuerce from
 ocean to i ocean will
 cross att this point while
 the Isthmus has twenty places
 narrower than this gain nothing
 but the right to use
 a road w hich is
 not in existence and which
 never will be in existence
 1 submit to the House
 whether the statements I have
 made are not founded upon
 the testimony in this report
 and whether if there be
 one disin terested man here
 and 1 know they are
 alt dis interested he can
 cast his vote for this
 monstrous measure Mr HARRIS of
 Maryland Mr Chairman it has
 been my purpose since this
 matter has been under debate
 to take some part in
 the discussion before the House
 and had hoped to do
 so when I should have
 the opportunity to occupy a
 whole hour and I am
 especially sorry that iL falls
 to my lot to have
 only the last half hour
 allowed to this d iscussion
 because following the gen tleman
 from Pennsylvania Mr STEVENS who
 has just taken his seat
 I feel that a little
 more ought to be de
 voted to the subject I
 am young man and one
 of my great duties as
 such in a deliberative assembly
 is to learn and I
 föel that I ought to
 express in alf humility my
 gratitude to the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania for the specimen which
 he has afforded to me
 of an able and pertinent
 debate upon a question of
 large commercial importance I have
 known va rious processes by
 which subjects ill this House
 have been killed I have
 scen them struck down by
 the strong hand of argument
 I have seen them overcome
 by bursts of eloquence but
 I have never before seen
 a subject so attempted to
 be stung to death by
 small ridicule as this has
 been by my dis tinguishod
 friend from Pennsylvania Now sir
 I owe it to myself
 as one of the Committee
 on Naval Affairs who assented
 to the report of this
 bill as one of the
 members of this House Niho
 at the last session took
 part in the debate and
 ad vocated this measure and
 owe it to my self
 re spcct after the attack
 of the gentleman from Penn
 sylvania to bring to the
 attention of this House the
 real points of this case
 which for son e pur
 pose or other hc has
 not presented except to place
 them in an absurd liffht
 and for the purpose of
 attacking them with ridicule Why
 one would suppose there was
 really nothing in this question
 that there was nothing of
 merit to commend it to
 the judgment of mem bcrs
 and that there was too
 little of honesty in it
 to allow conscientious members to
 vote for it This measure
 has passed the other branch
 of Congress by thirty eight
 against eight negative votes It
 has received in the Senate
 the consent of ne very
 best men in that body
 thc oldcst the gravest and
 most reputable Senators of the
 United States It has received
 both as to its title
 and as to its com
 mercial importance upon which it
 appeals to us the sanction
 of this nearly unanimous vote
 It has received the sanction
 of the Navy Depart ment
 Its title papers have been
 submitted to the examination of
 the Attorney General of the
 Uni ted States and the
 Attorney Gencral has pro nonnced
 them to be in all
 respects competent and valid The
 whole question by the direction
 of Congress at the last
 session has been subjected to
 examination by a ernnrnissicm appointed
 for that purpose upon which
 Congress has expended 10 000
 l hat commission has returned
 and its made by scientific
 gentlemen and compe report tent
 gentlemen who have not been
 assailed upon this floor gives
 entire indorsement to every claim
 which this matter made to
 Congress at its last sess
 on T berc is not
 a single point of objection
 made upon this floor at
 the last session of Congress
 acrainst this Chiriqui grant which
 has not been entirely met
 and conclusively met by the
 report of this commission And
 yet when the Attorney General
 has certified to the validitv
 of the title when the
 Government of the United States
 has deliberately contracted with the
 parties upon the faith and
 validity of that title after
 a cornmission of the United
 States Governrnent has gone out
 and Inade an examination into
 the practical value of the
 matter after that commission has
 returned fully certifying each and
 every point referred to believes
 that anybody in the interest
 of the Chiri I qui
 cmnpany grant will lay out
 a dollar of the sum
 I them and aftei the
 Scnate has by an almost
 unan wc propose to give
 to them rl he gentleman
 from i imous vote indorsed
 the scheme gentlemen get Can
 a nu nnbr r in
 Congress having tho public I
 i money in charge vote
 to purchase that Let the
 II Maine said we would
 go on and improve it
 The up here and between
 a sneer and a laugh
 whistle gentleman shakes his bead
 That is right because it
 down the wind and honorable
 gentlemen it yeas and nays
 show such members to the
 coun there is no power
 given to the United States
 If does seem to me
 are almost afraid under the
 in try I read again
 Thompson and St James Agnew
 do not make fluence of
 the sneer and because of
 the laughter ART 20 The
 grantees as a guarantee for
 the fulfiH I this road
 there will be no improvement
 of it be to bring
 themselves up to the question
 in the fair ment of
 the obligalions incurred by the
 present contract cause the United
 States has no such power
 We II light of the
 facts and the law which
 relates to it shall deposit
 in the national treasury of
 the Republic six 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 733 and take
 the responsibility of voting for
 it Now sir I belong
 to no such class I
 approve of this amendment which
 has been passed by t
 he Senate I approved of
 it as a member of
 the Naval Com mittee last
 year upon a examination of
 the facts I approve of
 it now upon reéxamination of
 the old und the new
 facts combined What are the
 objections urged to it My
 friend from Pennsylvania Mr STEVENS
 starts out the first place
 with the sweeping assertion that
 so far as the Granadian
 grant is concerned there is
 nothing in it and that
 these parties derive no title
 under it Why Mr Chairman
 that is an assertion ofamostextravagantcharacter
 Therecord shows conclusiyely that the
 Granadian Government de liberately made
 this grant thatthc Granadian min
 ister has certified to the
 right of the Provincial Legislature
 of Chiriqui to make it
 and that it was made
 in absolute conformity with the
 laws of New Granada That
 is on record and it
 settles that question But the
 gentleman from Pennsyl vania insists
 moreover that even if that
 grant be good it was
 a grant conditioned on the
 prior opening of a certain
 road which is described in
 it and that that road
 has never been opened ex
 cept for the passage of
 mules Now Mr Chair man
 the record before the gentleman
 which he certainly must have
 read if he examined the
 papers at all shows him
 by the affdavits of the
 very parties most competent to
 make these affda vits in
 New Granada and Chiriqui that
 so far as the requirement
 of the grant is concerned
 be tween New Granada and
 these parties that road is
 suffciently open to make the
 grant attach to this company
 But Mr Chairman I will
 not go into further discussion
 of that now because it
 so happens that since the
 last session of Congress these
 parties havc received a grant
 from the province of Costa
 Rica and that grant obviates
 the necessity of in quiring
 how far t he Newr
 Granadian grant covers the right
 to build a railroad because
 the Costa Rica grant gives
 the right specifically to construct
 a railroad But says the
 gentleman even if the right
 has attached it would be
 impossible to build a road
 iVell sir I know gentlemen
 will differ when they corne
 to estimate the difliculties to
 be overcome on railroad routes
 Why in his argument the
 gen tleman from Pennsylvania has
 found out that it is
 j ust as easy to
 state elevations at forty thou
 sand feet as at four
 thousand feet M hen gentle
 rncn speculate loosely and vaguely
 about the facts in a
 casc it is very natural
 that they should come to
 the conclusion that it is
 ilnpossiblc to run a railroad
 track over imaginary and impossible
 routes But Mr Chairman vve
 have a right as sensi
 ble Inen legislatincr upon an
 important question to recur with
 some sort of reliance to
 the inform ation furnished us
 by our own Government offl
 cers Now I do not
 k navv who Mr St
 Clair Morton may be except
 that he is a topograph
 ical engineer in the service
 of the United States I
 know also that he is
 weil thought of by the
 Depart ment for ability as
 an ewineer because he has
 recently been promoted to be
 the engineer of the water
 works in this District arid
 the Government of the United
 States placed him in charge
 of this most important work
 in Chiriqui during the vaca
 tion I thercforc think it
 is fair to esteem him
 to be a competent enffineer
 and after havino sur very
 much afraid that they have
 not done so for stand
 At all events let the
 communications come it docs seem
 to that no littlc ignorance
 has been exhibited as to
 the facts in this case
 in the discus Sion which
 has already occurred upon this
 floor Now his encrineersays on
 page26 of his report To
 stnn up the above renmrks
 on the Pacific slope itmay
 be safely assuuned that it
 is pctflec tly practicable to
 connect the pass with the
 tertninus at Golfito by an
 ordinary track which will admit
 of being worked with advantage
 by en gines and rolling
 stock generally of such patterns
 us ate at present in
 use And then as for
 the track upon the other
 side he says should therefore
 consider it within the limits
 of prac tieability to ascend
 from the Culebra forks to
 the stunmit by the ordinary
 railroad system but for many
 reasons would prefer to make
 use of one which would
 adapt itself with more pliancy
 to the peculiarities of that
 region I desire to call
 the attention of the committee
 to the fact that the
 estimates in this report are
 all surface estimates that they
 are susceptible of being diminished
 from ten to fifty per
 cent and are only estimates
 with reference to telnporary and
 conditional transit in anticipation of
 the mak ing of tunnels
 there Gentlemen who have hap
 pened to pass over the
 Baltimore and Ohio railroad before
 the excavation of the present
 tunnels one of the greatest
 triumphs of engineering art in
 the country and witnessed the
 system there availed to overcome
 elevations must have been struck
 with the startling assertions of
 the gentlernan from Pennsylvania Everything
 is possible to modern encrineering
 and I am content to
 take the testi mony of
 these two gentlemen who are
 experts in preference to the
 assertions of my fellow mezu
 bers upol i this floor
 Mr SHERMAN Before rnyfriendfi oml
 vlary land leaves that part
 of the casc desire to
 in form him that I
 shall read in reply a
 letter from one of the
 assistant en ineers pronouncirp it
 utterly impracticable to construct that
 railroad Mr SICKLES Lot state
 in reference to that suggestion
 that that letter proceeds from
 an officer who deserted Lis
 duty who failed to com
 ply with the instructions given
 to him and who was
 dismissed from the service And
 in answer to that letter
 shall read a letter from
 the com Inander of the
 expedition commenting upon his conduct
 Mr SHERMAN 1 do not
 know the witness All I
 desired vas to give notice
 to gentlemen so as not
 to take them by surprise
 that have a let ter
 from one of the who
 made the sur vey who
 reports the route to be
 utterly imprac together IVII SHERMAN
 very well Mr HARRIS 0fMaryland
 Now Mr Chair man that
 levelops one of the peculiar
 features of attack on this
 project before the House Since
 I have been in Congress
 I have never known a
 project that has had so
 many side bar attacks made
 upon it as this particular
 Chiriqui amend ment MT here
 it comes from I do
 not know But it seems
 to me that the force
 of the assault made upon
 it is outside of the
 record vthich is before the
 House Well I say on
 the testimony of these offcers
 of the Government that the
 railroad is practicable But the
 gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr STE
 YENS insists that even if
 it were practicable these parties
 could not carry out the
 conditions and rights which they
 propose to give to the
 United States in connection with
 it In the first place
 he says that if practicable
 it will never be built
 Now that does not seem
 to me to bean argument
 of force Another gentleman the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr SHERMAN
 says that if we give
 these parties the 300 000
 non constat that they would
 not put the Inoney in
 their pockets and never do
 anything towards the construction of
 the road I do not
 suppose that it ever entered
 into the im acFination of
 any one that 300 000
 is going to do anything
 towards the building of this
 railroad That will take millions
 But does it not occur
 to gentlemen in the first
 place that it was not
 to be assumed that this
 Government was a Government of
 fools dealing with absolute knaves
 in a trans action of
 this sort Did it not
 occur to him more over
 that the amendment submitted by
 the gentle man from Maine
 Mr MORSE is an amendment
 which provides that these knaves
 so assumed to be are
 not to receive the first
 dollar of this till the
 Government of the United States
 IS assured that they are
 able to carry out all
 the provisions and conditions of
 their contract That Government will
 be headed by Mr Lincoln
 His administration will be made
 up of gentlemen in the
 confidence of that wing of
 the House And I put
 it to gentlemen now whether
 as not a sin gle
 dollar is to be paid
 to these parties even if
 they are disposed to be
 rascally till the Govern ment
 is satisfied that they can
 in every particular perform their
 obligations and promises to the
 IJnited States they are running
 such a terrible More than
 that Mr Chairman Thegcntleman ticablc
 and the facts hc gives
 show that it is so
 argues that even if this
 railroad were built these Mr
 SICKLES it would appear that
 that parties could not authorize
 the Government of the cn
 yincer did not make the
 survey United States to carry
 troops and munitions of war
 I understand I across it
 Well of course they cannot
 but they i MY HARRIS
 of Maryland can authorize the
 United States to do two
 other that the letter to
 which the gentleman Ohio refers
 is from Mr Wilson T
 hc only informa valuable things
 which suppose would be alone
 ti0i1 1 have in reference
 to him is what I
 derive froun a suffcient consideration
 for the purchase money this
 report in lvhich the chief
 engineer charged One of these
 is the transmission of mails
 free of will this work
 reports Wilson as having been
 charge That they can do
 because the existing treaty between
 New Granada and the United
 negligent and incompetent in the
 dischargc of his duties that
 Wilson was sent out to
 make an ex States grants
 to the Government of the
 United ploration lost himself in
 some extinct volcano in States
 that the right of transit
 across the Isthmus of Panama
 on any roads of communication
 then the mountains and returned
 to tbc point of depart
 II i ure and remaincd
 there for six weeks doing
 noth existino or that miffht
 thereafter be constructed ing instead
 of attending to the practical
 business shall be forever free
 to the Government of the
 Uni f of the expedition
 Now if that be the
 gentlc f ted States and
 the citizens thereof The treaty
 then goes on to specify
 what things may pass over
 man s witness I shall
 read as ao ainst his
 testi noon y the testimony
 of the on Fineer in
 charge and and mails arnong
 them his second assistant cngincer
 who show that the Now
 it is true that the
 fourteenth section of the veyed
 this route he comes back
 and reports to road is
 entirety practicable and I think
 my two acrreement between Costa
 Rica and these grantees this
 Government that that country is
 perfectly practicable for a railroad
 a report which is in
 every particular aoainst the sweeping
 assertions of the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania In that opinion the
 chief engineer is sustained by
 the testimony of the second
 assistant engineer under Iiiru v
 ho I understand is a
 gentlernan of hi h attainments
 in his profession These two
 gentlexnen concur in saying in
 this report that that country
 is sus ceptible of havinT
 railroad cross it with success
 well now sir I do
 not think that gentlemen with
 tion before them can throw
 aside the testirnony accumulated for
 them by their own Government
 and the testimony of cc
 mpetent professional men and allow
 themselves to be swayed and
 controlled by the assertions of
 individual members N lr Chairman
 I have not tillie to
 go into an ex amination
 and analysis of what these
 enoineers say I have a
 right to assume that gentlemen
 witnesses will override the gentleman
 s witness says that they
 shall not transport arms and
 mu if thc gentleman vgants
 to read that letter I
 will nitions of war across
 the road I he Government
 listen to it now of
 Costa Rica retains that powcr
 to itself Did Mr SHERMAN
 I will send it to
 tille Clerk s gentlemen who
 are legislating here themselves as
 desk II Mr SICKLES suggest
 that the gentleman wait till
 I send for the other
 letter frotn the encri neer
 who complcted the survey which
 this one Mr SHERMAN 1
 will further that I i
 the character and capacity of
 the engineer is cer any
 justice to themselves or to
 a matter of legisla i
 tified to by a geritleman
 of the highest character in
 Pennsylvania Mr SICKLES well wait
 till get the Cial reply
 of the person who Inade
 the survey I ich this
 naan p to nrtlce Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland If my
 friend from Ohio 1M r
 SHERMAN has to back up
 the re sponsibility of his
 correspondent I preför not to
 coördinate branch of this great
 Governrnent suppose that Republic of
 Costa Rica was going to
 bargain away to a mere
 railroad company a right that
 is inherent to her sovereignty
 which involves her position and
 her responsibilities as a neutral
 Power She would not concede
 it to this company but
 under the law of nations
 the Uni ted States would
 have a right to transport
 arms and munitions ofwar that
 road unless they were transporting
 them in aid of some
 Government with which Costa Rica
 was at war Then they
 and as contraband would become
 contraband only they are prohibited
 by the fourteenth section of
 the contract N lr Chairman
 I cannot dwell on this
 The entertain it because the
 Government of the United attention
 of the committee was called
 to the matter upon this
 floor have read this report
 but I urn States sustains
 the witnesses whom I put
 on the W of coal
 at the last session of
 Congress when it 734 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 4 It
 was then objected was up
 before the House that there
 was no coal there that
 it was all idle nonsense
 and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
 Mr STEVENS in order to
 maintain that theory now goes
 so far in the face
 of the proof as to
 im pute to Mr Morell
 or Mr Agnew the carting
 to a particular piace of
 certain loads of coal and
 depositing them in order to
 carry out this gross deception
 Sir it is hardly possible
 to look at the testimony
 in the paces of this
 executive docu ment and not
 see that not only is
 coal there but that it
 is there in almest exhaustless
 quantities It is there on
 the very borders of the
 bay so that it crops
 out And it is stated
 by the geologist and shown
 by the analysis of Dr
 Jackson to be of the
 best possible quality for the
 use of the Navy Certainly
 that testimony out to outweigh
 thc mcrc assertions of gentlemen
 But I observe that my
 friend from New York Mr
 POTTLE oujectcd the other day
 that iftherc was coal there
 it was six miles from
 any point where it could
 be yot out by the
 vessels In con nection with
 that want to make two
 remarks One is Mr POTTLE
 Will the from Maryland allow
 me to set I iim
 right What I did say
 was that the coal lands
 were six miles fron i
 the land proposed to be
 convcycd to the Govern ment
 under this contract Mr HARRIS
 of Maryland well in point
 of fact I think my
 friend is mistaken because this
 testimony shows that while there
 is coal at Changuinola river
 six miles from the point
 where we get this land
 and while that river is
 navicra ble and the coal
 therefore accessible there are in
 the very lands to bc
 conveyed to the United States
 places where the coal crops
 out on the very cdgc
 of the bay and fron
 k which it can be
 absolutely put on board ships
 lyinc right under the bluff
 Mr Chainnqn the pao es
 of this report dernon strate
 that there is an immense
 quantity of coal I he
 coal has becn brought home
 not in caro oes for
 use but in samples for
 analysis An analysis has been
 made and the good quality
 of the coal has been
 fully and succcssfuily estab lished
 But gen t lcnoen seem
 to overlook another thing which
 the Governrncnt of the United
 States gets by this transfer
 We showcd in our report
 to thc House last session
 that by this arran e
 mcl t tho Government would
 save in the cost of
 as compared with its present
 expenditure a year desire further
 to call the attention of
 the com mittee to the
 fact that instead of this
 300 000 bc in an
 cnornxous outlay the whole amot_lnt
 would be saved by the
 Government in two years and
 less on the single item
 of coal Indeed almost the
 whole amount would be saved
 in the course of the
 first year l two in
 the cost of the store
 ships and supply ships which
 tho Government now has I
 y incr at I anzuua
 and Aspinwall I desire the
 com rnit into consideration this
 fact that the United States
 not only gets thc coal
 it Inay l l sc
 under this contract at a
 cheaper rate bat it also
 gets naval stations right upo
 i tho shore of these
 bays upon the Atlantic and
 Pacific side Captain Engle testifies
 that these bays are the
 rnost Imagnificcnt on the continent
 that the waters arc fathoms
 deep right up to thc
 very lai d The report
 as to tbc timber states
 that upon this tract of
 land ceded to the United
 States the timber is nnost
 abundant and of the best
 kind for ship build ing
 Now Mr Chairman the Government
 of New Granada had the
 right to cede to these
 parties thcse teri thousand acres
 of land These parties had
 the right to cede these
 lands to the Government of
 I the United States They
 propose to do so in
 express accordance as gentlemen will
 find with one of the
 provisions of the Newr Granadian
 con stitution fl hcy will
 find upon page 13 that
 the New Granadian Senate declares
 it is desir Now Mr
 Chairman I discover that I
 havc but or three minutes
 of my time left and
 I dcsirc the attention of
 the committcc to some points
 that I shall recapitulate I
 say that this executive doc
 ument substantiates the positions taken
 by the Committee on Naval
 Affairs in their report sub
 mitted the last session repeat
 that the Legis lature of
 Chiriqui in accordance With its
 con stitution and laws had
 the right to cede to
 these parties or to any
 other parties all the lands
 and privileges contained in that
 particular grant say that the
 grant is verified in thc
 certificate of the New Granadian
 Government itself in the per
 son of its minister behind
 which that Govern I say
 these title papers were ment
 cannot go submitted for the
 investigation of thc law offcer
 of this Govern tnent and
 that the Attorney Gon eral
 of the United States has
 indorsed the abso I say
 that the lute validity of
 this convcyancc Government of Costa
 Rica has covcrcd up doubt
 that might exist under the
 New Granadian grant as to
 lhe right or ability of
 these parties to the transit
 from ocean to ocean by
 railroad say that that Costa
 Rican grant has not been
 impeached as to its validity
 I say further that even
 if there should bc a
 doubt in the mind of
 any gentleman as to tl
 0 practicability of building this
 railroad they have the right
 rely with some degree of
 assurance upon the testimony of
 these officers of the United
 States But admit ting for
 the sake of argument that
 there is no practicable route
 for a railroad nevertheless without
 t le railroad the Government
 of the Uni ted States
 will receive back the 300
 000 in less than two
 years in the coal advautages
 ceded to it in the
 contract in the advantacye s
 of naval sta tions in
 the advantages of ship timber
 and in being al lc
 to dispense with store ships
 and sup ply ships at
 Aspinwall and Pananoa But I
 say further that while tho
 repoi t of your own
 officers Yivos us a strong
 right to assume that these
 par ties can construct a
 railroad from ocean to ocean
 because it is iöasiblc it
 is for their advantacre so
 inasmuch as they are required
 to pay the to do
 Government of Costa Rica 100
 000 to remain as a
 deposit until the road is
 built und because their whole
 enterprise in which they have
 becn labor incr for rnorc
 than ten years lies in
 the construc tion of that
 railroad Now Mr Chairman I
 think it behooves us as
 legislators to consider that thc
 gist of this ques tion
 so far as x vc
 arc concerned lies in thc
 fact that the transit proposed
 is a transit this country
 to possess that it is
 a road to otn own
 im mense resources on tho
 Pacific another openinff to that
 great oriental trade which it
 has been the ambition of
 the cm nrnercial cn terprise
 of all acres to grasp
 and which has built up
 into greatness and wealth and
 political dominancy every nation It
 was this trade that that
 has ever attained it made
 Spain rich and powerful that
 elevated Por tugal into coin
 significance that developed I Ioltand
 into a controlling Power and
 that has done more than
 anything else to solidify the
 It has made nations greatness
 of Great Britain and they
 have great as they havc
 grasped it japscd into comparative
 insiRnificance as they It may
 be grasped by us by
 the have lost it adoption
 of an enlarged and statesmanlike
 policy and I think our
 duty impels as to reach
 forward to its attainment by
 all possible means the ham
 met fell l he CHAIRMAN
 question is on the amendrnent
 of the gentleman from Now
 York Mr POTTLE I Mr
 HARRIS of Maryland I am
 sorry I have not had
 time to finish what I
 desired to say in reply
 to the attacks gentlemen have
 made upon this nrasurc Cries
 of Go on I Mr
 SHERMAN 1 think debate had
 better be closed upon this
 subject I call for a
 vote upon the pending amendment
 Mr HOLMAN hold in my
 amend able that the United
 States and other Govern ments
 should come and locate them
 and that they ment which
 I desire to have read
 for the purpose should have
 the rights which citizens under
 that Governmcnt enjoy The United
 States say therefbre will not
 only derive an ultimate benefit
 frtnn this appropriation of 300
 000 but they will save
 in a singlc year in
 the single itCIYi of coal
 Thev will savc largely in
 establishing have it read for
 the information of the committee
 naval stations and in obtaining
 timber for ship buildino And
 naval stations alone will reduce
 tho expense of keeping st
 01 fi supply ships at
 i other points 200 000
 per annum of asking thegentleman
 from New York if he
 will not accept it The
 CHAIRMAN No farther amendment is
 in order at this time
 Mr HOLMAN I ask unanimous
 consent to Mr SICKLES 1
 object The question being on
 the amendment offered by Mr
 POTTLE to t hp arnendmentof
 Mr MORSE to the amcndnlent
 of the Senate Mr BRIGGS
 called for tellers Tellers were
 ordered and Messrs BRIGGS and
 I IOLMAN were appointed l
 he committee divided and the
 tellers rcportcd ayes 76 noes
 44 So the amendment was
 agreed to Mr SEDGWICK Is
 an amendment to the amendment
 now in order The CHAIRMAN
 It is Mr SEDGWICK 1
 move to amend by add
 ing as follows Provided also
 That the same be consistent
 with the con tract made
 by the Secretary of the
 Navy Mr Chairman as one
 of the Committee on Naval
 Affairs last year I devoted
 much timo to the examination
 of this question and when
 this appropriation was up in
 the House I stated the
 reasons which induced me to
 vote against it other words
 I thought as the case
 then stood we were bound
 from defects in the title
 and defects in the evidence
 to annul the grant and
 to disap prove the contract
 of the Secretary Instead however
 of meeting this question and
 setting aside this contract as
 we might leaving it open
 for any futurc Secretary to
 renew it if from addi
 tionat evidence it should seem
 feasible we chose to take
 another course We provided for
 send in Y out a
 commission and appropriated money for
 the payment of that commission
 which was to proceed to
 the point in controversy examine
 the character of the harbors
 the situation and value of
 the coal mines the practicability
 of a railway and generally
 the value of the property
 At that time 1 suggested
 to the members of the
 committee of conference who reported
 this mnend ment that if
 thc Government put itself in
 this condition if their acyents
 appointed in pursuance of our
 appropriations and direction found that
 the condition of things was
 as represented by the contractors
 that coal mines were there
 in acces Sible localities that
 a railroad could be con
 structcd and that the harbors
 were fit and proper for
 our vessels there was an
 implied undertaking on our part
 to perform the conditions of
 the con tract so far
 as the Governtnent was concerned
 for the reason that we
 delayed this contractor that we
 pat hikn to expense in
 establishing his titles that we
 put him to various inconveniences
 If it turned out which
 we had no riffht to
 do upon our examination as
 represented wc had no right
 as honest men to say
 we wilt not comply with
 this contract I have examined
 the reports and I find
 upon the subject of coal
 they are very satisfactory They
 show that there are mines
 there practicable working mines that
 the coal is of good
 quality and that that part
 of the contract is fully
 met by the contractor It
 shows ulso that the harbors
 are good harbors and despite
 the criticisms which have been
 passed u pon it in
 this House I say that
 t he report proves that
 there is a practicable line
 of railway which we have
 a right to use under
 the contract of last year
 and the subsequent addition to
 it this sir but I
 llavc not timc to argue
 it now be cause there
 is no connection between two
 points that is dcsirable for
 commerce no such place on
 this globe of the lencrth
 lyeÄveen these two har bors
 which cannot be united under
 thc skill of modern cnffineering
 by a successful railway Thcro
 are no national obstacles which
 cannot be overcome and when
 sir we have seen the
 great tubular bridge swung across
 the straits of Menai by
 modern science it should not
 be said at this and
 in this presence that a
 railway between these points is
 a th ing that cannot
 be accomplished I low then
 stands the case I fit
 were a ques tion of
 a contract between two individuals
 one of w 110111 had
 selected his own agent to
 proceed I i to the
 spot and examinc as to
 the value of the I
 privilege that hc bought I
 say there is no court
 of equity under heaven before
 which you could not bring
 that man and compel him
 to a specific performance of
 a contract entered into under
 cir cuno stances like these
 because it would be a
 gross injustice it would be
 a gross fraud to say
 We have examined your property
 we find it what you
 represented it ve have put
 you to the ex pense
 of 100 000 in perfecting
 a title to a rail
 way which was the doubtful
 point with us last year
 but now we have no
 unoney to perform our than
 a sharne It is no
 less sir entracycmen ts loss
 repüdiation on the part t
 Congress Here the hannner fell
 Mr HOWARD ofMichigan Mr Chairman
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 735
 I am opposed to the
 amendment This matter if I
 understand it was submitted to
 us last year a conditional
 contract to be approved or
 dis approved by us We
 did neither the one nor
 the other but we sent
 out our agents for the
 express purpose of proving or
 disproving the facts which had
 been spread before us deny
 that we thero by gave
 any assurances or put ourselves
 under any obligations to approve
 this any more than we
 were under before We sent
 our agents there for the
 purpose of learning how we
 should vote here in this
 House at this time and
 because wc chose to acquaint
 ourselves with regard to the
 facts it is now claimed
 that we are excluded from
 voting The proposition of the
 gentleman from New York Mr
 SEDGWICK is monstrous W c
 scnt a com mission there
 as I have stated for
 the express purpose of satisfying
 ourselves here whether we ought
 to accept or reject this
 contract We paid the expenses
 of this commission and we
 did nothing to imply that
 we were Ünder an obliga
 tion to accept this contract
 W c did do it
 then and have not done
 it since and we areas
 free to vote to day
 as when this humbug first
 showed itself in Congress I
 he question was then taken
 on Mr SEDG WICK s
 amendment and it was rcjcctcd
 Mr IIOLMAN Without occupying the
 time of the House with
 any discussion of this subject
 I move the followin2 amendment
 to the amend ment of
 tho gentleman from Maine Mr
 Monsn The Clerk read as
 follows Add Proz ided further
 That said sum of rnoney
 shall not be paid until
 the Republic ot Costa Rica
 Shall have eontinned to the
 United States the rights of
 property and franchises which the
 said Alnbrose W hmnpson and
 the Chiriqui Improvetnent C0Jnpany have
 by their contract with the
 Secretary ot the Navy conditionally
 transferred and pro posed to
 secure to the United States
 Mr SICKLES I suggest to
 the gentleman from Indiana that
 Costa Rica has entered into
 no convention with the United
 States and I think that
 his arnendnlent is conceived in
 quite an erroneous view of
 the contract between Costa Rica
 and Mr Meagher Mr HOLMAN
 1 believe Mr Chairman that
 I do not misapprehend the
 state of this con tract
 Whatever contract may have hitherto
 been entered into between the
 various persons under whom Mr
 Thcnnpson and this Chiriqui Corn
 pan y clairn and the
 Republic of New Granada whatever
 may be the nature of
 these gravits of property and
 franchiso which are now proposed
 to be conferred upon the
 United States I deem my
 amendment important so that if
 Costa Rica within whose limits
 these franchises exist con firms
 them then there will be
 some foundation for the claim
 which these parties propose to
 transfer The amend ment to
 the an iendment was agreed
 to The question was then
 taken on Mr MORSE s
 amendment as amended and it
 was rejected The Senate amendrnent
 was then non n curved
 in Fourth amendment of the
 Senate It enable the Superintendent
 of the Public Printing to
 carrv into effect the provisions
 of the joint resolution in
 relation to the Public Printing

 ask for a division on
 that It is for the
 purchase of Wendell s amendment
 printincr establishment Mr SHERMAN 1
 will say few words in
 By a law of the
 explanation of the amendment last
 session the Secretary of the
 Interior I be licve with
 the Superint endent of l
 he Pu l lic Print
 incr was authorized to buy
 a printing office at a
 price not to exceed 150
 000 The contract when made
 was to be submitted to
 the Joint Commit tee on
 Printing of the Senate and
 the House of Representatives By
 thc law the contract when
 made and approvcd by the
 Joint Committee on Printing was
 perfect and As a rnatler
 of course the Committee of
 Ways and Means had no
 control of the question we
 had offcial in formation that
 tho contract had been made
 for the purchase of what
 is known as Wendell s
 printing office and that it
 had been approved not only
 by the Joint Committee on
 Printing but by the Sec
 retary of the Interior the
 Attorney General and the President
 of the United States We
 wei e in formed that
 it had been apnroved by
 a unanimous vote of thc
 Joint Commitcee on Printincr There
 fore sir all we could
 do under the law was
 sim ply to provide the
 money to carry it into
 effect do not know whether
 this contract is right or
 I do not know whether
 the amount is too great
 or too little Under the
 law of Ilme last ses
 sion the contract was perfected
 when the Joint Conunittee on
 Printing of the two Houses
 ap proved it The Committee
 of MT ays and Means
 would have been derelict to
 their duty if they had
 not provided means for carrying
 the contract into effect That
 is all I have to
 say on thc subject Mr
 MAYNARD Is the contract an
 executed contract Mr SHERMAN It
 is There were no con
 ditions in the law except
 that the contract made by
 the Superintendent of Public Printing
 should be approved by the
 Joint Committee on Printino of
 both Houses The oflicial information
 is that it was approved
 by that committee that it
 was approved by every member
 of the committee of the
 Senate and of this House
 and besides that it was
 approved by thc Attorney General
 arid the Secretary of the
 Interior To obviate all trouble
 about it we have put
 in a proviso that the
 rnoney shall not be paid
 until the Attorney General shall
 pass judgment upon the title
 of tho property NIr GURLEY
 Mr olution passed at the

 Superintendent of the Public Printing

 OP Pum rc PRINTING January
 22 1861 SIR In reply
 to your verbal inquiry have
 to state that in the
 execution of t hc duties
 nnposed upon by the joint
 resolution of June 23 1860
 in relation to the public
 print iug I conferred unotficially
 with thc Secretary of thc
 In tcrior and had tbc
 benefit ot his kindly advice
 and assist ance throughout Ile
 examinc l personally the print
 inø establishinent of Mr Rives
 and that formcrly mvned by
 Mr Wendell with a view
 to their eligibility for Govern
 Ile conferred with Mt Clark
 at present ment purposes the
 eonsulting architect of the Int
 erior Department under whose superintendence
 Wendell s office was built
 as to its Inaterials and
 construction and he had one
 of his clerks a practical
 printer for portions of several
 days cxamininø the prin ting
 rnatcrials and Inachinery eoin paring
 them with the schedule and
 estirnating their value in accordance
 with the list of prices
 And the result of the
 Secretary s exani ination and
 information was a full concurrence
 in the pro priety of
 purchasing Wendell s establishment at
 the price aareed upon I
 have the honor to be
 very respectfully JOHN 11 Superintendent
 Hon JOHN A GURLEY Chairman
 Committee on Printing Ilouse of
 Representatives I hold in my
 hand the report of the
 Superin tendcnt of the Pu
 IJkic Prin ting in which
 it is shown that this
 office for which we now
 agree to pay 135 000
 cost some five years aco
 Here in the report is
 a full schedule of the
 arti cles purchased There is
 no concealmellt upon It is
 open to the eye of
 every one the subject Any
 gentleman can take this schedule
 walk into the printing office
 and with his own eyes
 verify the statements made here
 Mr MAYNARD 1 would say
 that the rea son why
 I put the question to
 the gentleman s colleague was
 that I had heard it
 stated I know not how
 correctly that the property had
 fre quent y been offered
 to private parties for 80
 000 Mr GURLEY 1 am
 very glad to be able
 to answer tl iC gentleman
 upon that point I inquired
 I specifically of those who
 hold a controlling in terest
 in this establishment and they
 denied tho statement and said
 the report was untrue The
 printing presses l umber twenty
 six and cost 48 000
 They are purchased for 36
 000 Mr McCLERNAND to ask
 the gen tlcman a question
 just at this point He
 says the printing presses in
 the establishment number twenty six
 I wish to know of
 him whether all of those
 printing presses are in a
 condition to be used at
 this tune Mr GURLEY 1
 believe they are Mr McCLERNAND
 Are you informed upon that
 point Mr GURLEY Ihave so
 understood Mr McCLERNAND From whom
 I Mr GURLEY 1 have
 myself examined the office in
 connection with the Superintendent and
 other parties in the officc
 and I have always un
 derstood that the presses were
 in good working or I
 der if they were not
 a very few days work
 would put them in order
 There is a machine shop
 con nected with the concern
 for the repair of any
 machinery Mr McCLERNAND am informed
 that number of the presses
 are broken and out of
 order Mr GURLEY The type
 and furniture cost 26 000
 we agree to pay 13
 000 That that a reasonable
 rate any gentleman will bc
 satis fied who will examine
 the work done upon the
 type Mr McCLERNAND Is not
 considerable portion of the type
 damaged from use Mr GURLEY
 Of course the type is
 not as good as new
 but we pay only one
 half price for it You
 will see that it makes
 very good work by reference
 to the printed reports and
 bills before you The printing
 of this House is now
 done in that offce Mr
 McCLERNAND If the type are
 out they are worth only
 the value of the metal
 Mr GURLEY They are not
 worn out Mr McCLERNAND 1
 want more inf orrnation than
 is contained in that report
 Mr GURLEY I now desire
 to read in con nection
 with this subject an extract
 from a speech made by
 Mr CAMERON in the Senate
 the other day in which
 he uses the followinü language
 Every Senator present I suppose
 knows that K have always
 been opposed to the establishrnent
 of a Government printing office
 I think it wrong and
 i believe titne w NI
 prove it hut have paid
 some attention to tbissubject and
 I an I satisfied that
 the wisest thing that could
 have been done under the
 circmnstanees was to buy this
 omce This printing oflicc of
 Wendell is most perli ct
 printing office not only in
 the United States but in
 the world Inuch larger sum
 than the Government has agreed
 to pay Or it and
 you have saved a great
 Inany jobs by making this
 purebasc I am satisfied that
 from seventy five to one
 hun dred thousand dollars have
 bcen saved by making this
 ar rangmnent and God only
 knows how much more you
 save Croni what would be
 expended if you were to
 go on and erect a
 new building I think that
 everybody who is in thvor
 or thc interesÉ of the
 Government and who is in
 favor of stopping Elle constant
 plunder in the shape of
 public printing ought at once
 to vote Ibr the appropriation
 to buy this office I
 fully believe that statement of
 Mr CAMERON I believe the
 Government could not now erect
 that building and furnish it
 with all the necessary ma
 terials we find there for
 235 000 in the way
 the Government usually do their
 business law had gone into
 operation last session and we
 had had his same printing
 offce you would have saved
 thcentire costofit by this time
 Our printing and bii ding
 last session amounted to about
 four hundred thousand dollars Thirty
 three ccn t upon that
 would be within a fraction
 of one hun dred and
 thirty five thousand dollars That
 amount you would have saved
 if the offce had gone
 into operation at the commencement
 of the last session Again
 as the printing is now
 done you have to wait
 four six and eight months
 for your doc umen ts
 That was the case with
 the rnechanical part of the
 Patent Offce report The Superin
 tendent says only give him
 the offee and the means
 to carry it 01 and
 he will give you the
 agricultural report in thirty days
 I do not wish to
 prolong this discussion Every gentleman
 can examine the report for
 himself Here is a sched
 ule of every article purchased
 and I end by re
 peatingthat while theestablishmentcost 185 000
 we am ee to give
 only 135 000 for it
 The mem bers of the
 committee on the part of
 both the Sen ate and
 House looked over the papers
 looked into the whole subject
 and four of them visited
 the printing office went all
 over the estimates and then
 unanimously concurred in the report
 Mr SICKLES I move to
 strike out the last two
 words of the amendment proposed
 by the gene tleman from
 Ohio I arn remmded by
 this discus sion so far
 as it has proceeded of
 a definition which I learned
 at school of the rule
 of permuta tion which was
 as nearly as can recollect
 de I fined to be
 the different number of attitudes
 or positions which a given
 nu lüber of persons may
 occupy For two days we
 have heard our friends upon
 ihe other side of the
 House and especially the distinguished
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means and I
 believe the chairman of the
 Committee on Printing or at
 any rate he will 736
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 4
 do Sö by his vote
 say that the Government of
 the United States should under
 no circumstances get its coal
 where ib might find it
 cheapest that it was wrong
 in principle for the Government
 to enter into any sort
 of business Now the Committee
 of Ways and Means recommends
 that the Gov ernment shall
 enter the printing business that
 it shall buy a printing
 offce that it shall employ
 hands that ib shall buy
 presses and that it shall
 establish a complete printing omce
 in this city to the
 exclusion of all private enterprise
 and compe tition And in
 order to commend that proposi
 tion to the House the
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means tells us
 it has been approved by
 high authority in the Senate
 and cites the names of
 certain distinguished men in the
 Senate and the Finance Committee
 as having favored this kroposition
 and therefore we ought to
 pass it ow I would
 like to hear from the
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means the reasons
 which justify this Government in
 going into the printing business
 and yet prohibits it from
 buy Ing coal where it
 can get it cheapest when
 the latter measure has been
 recommended by the same high
 authority which he quotes in
 favor of the former proposition
 Mr BURNETT Mr BRANCH in
 the chair temporarily I am
 opposed to this amendment I
 have opposed from its incep
 of the Senate tion the
 idea of thc establishment of
 a Govern ment printing offce
 being satisfied for reasons I
 gave at the last session
 of Congress that it was
 wrong and would involve a
 much heavier ex penditure than
 even our present system of
 havincr the printing done That
 question do not now propose
 to discuss But the chairman
 of the Committee on Printing
 tells us that this office
 cost 185 000 and that
 the Superintendent of the Public
 Printing proposes to pay only
 135 000 for it The
 question what was the original
 cost of the building and
 the materials now in it
 is one that is not
 practically presented to us because
 we know that when nn
 establish ment like this has
 bccn in use for a
 ntunber of years a large
 amount of the material in
 it is unfit for the
 use for which it was
 originally purchased I ask the
 gentleman how much type there
 is in this printing establishment
 I believe there is about
 fifteen tons I do not
 remember the precise tunount but
 I undertake to say here
 that you may send any
 practical printer you can find
 in this city to examine
 that office and he will
 tell you that not one
 third of the in it
 is worth one cent for
 practical printing purposes we told
 here and an extract to
 the same purport from a
 speech madc in the Senate
 has been read that this
 is the most perfect printing
 establisluncnt in the country or
 in the world Now it
 is a well known fact
 and it must have been
 known to the mernbcrs of
 t be Comrniltee on Printing
 that a large number of
 the printin prcs scs in
 tl iis cstablishkncrlt are not
 only unfit for use but
 it is problematical whether any
 expend iturc of money upon
 them would render thorn fit
 for use Mr Cl airrnan
 when the gentleman fronn Penn
 sylvania Mr STEVENS was talking
 the other day to his
 Republican friends about economy I
 felt like comrralulating him 1
 he chairman of the Comrnitte
 c on Printing Mr GURLEY
 tells us that if this
 public printing office had gone
 into opera tion last year
 we should by this time
 have sa ved the cntirc
 cost of the establishment The
 gentle man I believe is
 no practical printer he belongs
 t o another profession and
 to n better one t
 han I do I am
 printm but I would like
 to know how he arrives
 at that conclusion Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania call the gentleman
 to order What n ofession
 is bet ter than ours
 the law Laug Mr BURNETT
 That siF of the Gospel
 More laughter i should like
 very tnuch to knov r
 h0 V the gentleman fronl
 Ohio makes his esti mate
 of the economy of this
 public printing offce to exist
 under the present system of
 public print ing will be
 increased fourfold under the new
 sys tem There is another
 point to which I desire
 to re i take it
 for grapted that if my
 friend the fer chairman of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means had a piece of
 property he would understand what
 he paid for it and
 its market value better than
 any one else and so
 I take it for granted
 that the proprietor of this
 printing establishment knows what he
 paid for it and can
 estimate its worth better than
 any one else Well there
 is a law in this
 District which requires parties to
 re gister their property for
 taxation There were two printing
 offces examined by the Superintend
 ent of the Public Printing
 one belonging to John C
 Rives and the other this
 one of Wendell s and
 Wendell himself in valuing his
 own property puts the amount
 largely below what thc Superin
 tendent of Public Printing has
 agroed to pay for it
 That is a matter of
 record Was the chair man
 of the Committee on Printing
 advised of that fact And
 more than that it was
 valued for a less sum
 than the other printing establishment
 svhen the proprietors themselves estimated
 the value of the respective
 establishments But the chairman of
 the Cormnittec of Ways and
 Means says that this is
 an executed contract With all
 due deference to his legal
 ability I beg leave to
 differ from him I say
 it is not an exc
 cuted contract Why Because the
 provisions of the law passed
 at the last session of
 Congress have not been complied
 with and until Congress carries
 out the entire provisions of
 that law it does not
 become an executed contract Now
 sir I have no hope
 in the world that any
 thing any man could say
 here would stop this thing
 The recommendation of the Committee
 of Ways aud Means will
 be adopted I have no
 doubt of that for the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 is omnipotent here and when
 they recommend anything a majority
 of the House will vote
 for it But I want
 to say to gentlemen upon
 thc Republican side of the
 House bay this printing estal
 lishmcnt pay 135 000 to
 Cornelius Wendell Co and these
 men who have shin gled
 it over with rnortgages and
 are endeavorincr to lobby this
 amendmdnt through the House and
 next session you will have
 to make appropria tions for
 new presses and new type
 for the pres ent material
 of the cstablishment is not
 fit for the purposes for
 which we require it Mr
 SICKLES by unanimous consent with
 drew his amendment to the
 amendment Mr STANTON I move
 to amend the amend ment
 by striking out 135 000
 and inserting 100 000 MI
 Chairman ever since I have
 been a mem ber of
 this House there has been
 no scheme con nec ted
 with the plunder of the
 public Treasury and the printing
 upon which the of Cor
 nelius Wendell has not been
 cast I am there fore
 very reluctant to vote for
 an appropriation to ratify any
 contract to which he is
 a party I have no
 great confidence in this contract
 not only on account of
 the party who is to
 scll thc prop crty but
 I havc not the utmost
 confidence in the party that
 is the buyer I know
 that the Com mittee on
 Printing at thc last session
 rave for the binding of
 this Elouse 25 000 rnore
 than it might have been
 done for by another party
 equally well qualified for the
 benefit of political favorites and
 that fäct is proved in
 public documents and by sworn
 testimony For that reason Mr
 Chair I nt to scru
 tinize this con tract very
 closely I want to know
 certainly that the property for
 which it is proposed to
 give 135 000 is worth
 the money and I have
 no such evidence before me
 lugree sir with the gentleman
 from Kentucky Mr BURNETT that
 this whole scheme for the
 establishment of a Government printing
 bureau originated in corruption and
 that it will result in
 increased corruption arid in an
 enlarged expendi ture for the
 public printing The whole thing
 Now will make a prediction
 to gentlemen here ought to
 be abandoned at once and
 some honest and I want
 it to be remernbered I
 predict that mode of doing
 the public printing ought to
 be re when you get
 into operation this mammoth print
 sorted to That is my
 judgrnent But you have ing
 establishment under the control of
 the Gov got a printing
 bureau now and you want
 to buy ernment it will
 be an asylum where broken
 down a printing offce will
 go into the market priiiters
 and politicians and country editors
 and and buy new materials
 frorn the manufacturers at that
 class of mon X vill
 find places under the Gov
 W fair honest market prices
 but I will not bargain
 ernment and druw pay from
 the Treasury of the with
 a gentleman who has been
 enoaged in cor United States
 and not only Will the
 public print ruption about this
 Capitol for ten years for
 an old ing cost more
 but the corruption which charged
 broken down establishment I am
 opposed to this amendment of
 the Senate and I hope
 the House will vote it
 down Mr McCLERNAND 1 desire
 to offer an amendment to
 the amendment now pending CHAIRMAN
 Mr BURNETT in the chair
 There is now an amendment
 to he amend ment pending
 on which the question must
 first It is the amendment
 of the gentleman be taken
 from Ohio Mr STANTON to
 strike out 135 000 and
 insert 100 000 The question
 was taken and the Chair
 an nounced that it was
 decided in the affirmative Mr
 FLORENCE 1 apprehend Mr Chair
 man that a debate in
 opposition to the amend ment
 offered by the gentleman from
 Ohio is in order The
 CHAIRMAN If the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania had risen and expressed
 a desire to oppose it
 the Chair would have heard
 him Mr FLORENCE invited thc
 Chair s at tention by
 a loud vociferation laughter but
 the Chair paid no attention
 to it The CHAIRMAN The
 gentleman did not do so
 till after the Chair had
 propounded the ques tion Mr
 FLORENCE 1 did not care
 very much about getting the
 floor as I conceived the
 chair man of the Committee
 on Printino wrould have taken
 it but I will now
 take the floor in opposi
 tion to the proposition of
 the gentleman from I Ohio
 The CHAIRMAN The Chair will
 state to the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania that the Chair will
 certainly determine in his own
 discretion who is entitled to
 the floor The gentleman from
 Illinois Mr MCCLERNAND is now
 entitled to the floor The
 Chair stated there was an
 amendment to an amendment pending
 and then the Chair propounded
 the question upon it Mr
 FLORENCE Just then at that
 very moment I rose and
 The CHAIRMAN Will the gentleman
 from Pennsylvania permit the Chair
 to proceed Mr FLORENCE Certainly
 sir The CHAIRMAN The vote
 was and the amendment of
 the gentleman from Ohio was
 decided to bc agreed to
 T hc Chair did not
 hear the gentleman from Pennsylvania
 till after tho result was
 announced Mr FLORENCE Mien it
 was not the fault of
 the gen Ilemall frozn Pennsylvania
 that the Chair did not
 hear him The CHAIRMAN The
 Chair not Laughter The gentlcman
 from Illinois is enti tled
 to the floor Mr McCLERNAND
 1 offer the following amendment
 as a proviso to the
 amendment Provided l hat no
 part of said sum shall
 be paid until a colmnittce
 of not less than five
 practical printers to be ap
 pointed by the President shall
 report that thc materials are
 in good order and that
 the establisluncnt is worth the
 said amount Mr Chairman I
 agree With you in opinion
 that nothing you 11 ay
 say I may say or
 any one elSe may say
 would avail anything to defeat
 this apiropriation I take it
 that it is predes tined
 to pass Nevertheless I have
 some objec tions to it
 which I beg leave to
 state in the hear ing
 of the committee We have
 heard from the chairman of
 the Com mittee on Public
 Printing that a joint resolution
 was passed at the iast
 session authorizing the Su perintendent
 of the Public Printincy to
 erect or pur chase a
 printinff establishment and declaring that
 the contract of purchase should
 bec 01ne binding when approved
 by the Joint Committee on
 Print ing of both Houses
 Now I understand that the
 lots on which this printincr
 establishment the one bargained for
 stands are not owned by
 Mr Wendell that he possesses
 no valid title to them
 nor have I heard the
 contrary asserted by any gentleman
 on this floor Indeed the
 gentleman from Ohio the chairmdn
 of the Committee of Waysand
 Means by implication admits the
 fact His amendment suspending tho
 cmupletion of the purchase until
 the Attorney General shall have
 approved the title to the
 property is evidence of such
 ad mission Mr SHERMAN Will
 my friend from Illi nois
 allow me to correct him
 Upon the estimate of the
 Secretary of the Interior we
 put an appro priation of
 135 000 on the regular
 civil appropri ation bill and
 there we inserted a provision
 re quiring the title to
 be approved by the Attorney
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE THE OFFICIAL
 PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED BY
 JOHN C RIVES WASHINGTON D
 C THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D
 SESSION General before the money
 should be paid When that
 bill went to the Senate
 they transferred this section to
 the deficiency bill and in
 that way it comes here
 as an amendment from the
 Senate This identical proposition has
 already passed the House once
 this session by a unanimous
 vote Mr McCLERNAND That does
 notchange the facts I ask
 the chairman of the Committee
 of VVays and Means why
 he inserted the proviso requiring
 the title to be approved
 by the Attorney Genera Mr
 SHERMAN Because we had heard
 that there was some question
 as to the title to
 this property a question about
 mortgages and to avoid all
 controversy we all thought it
 better to guard the Government
 by this provision before any
 monev was to be paid
 out Mr MéCLERNAND That is
 exactly what I was saying
 that the chairman of the
 Commit tee of Ways and
 Means had by his amendment
 furnished us with authority at
 least by implica tion that
 the title to this property
 was deftctive Is it not
 then a mattcr of surprise
 that the Joint Committee on
 Public Printing should have ap
 proved such a contract and
 should have commit ted the
 Government to pay 135 000
 for a defect ive tide
 I charge here upon information
 which 1 believe to be
 relial le that the lots
 on which this establishment is
 erected are not the propert
 y of Mr Wendell but
 of a Mr McGuire or
 at all events that Mr
 McGuire has an incumbrance upon
 them nor can the United
 States as I under stand
 obtain a clear title to
 the lots until the in
 cuznbrance is paid off I
 he Chairman Mr BURNETT has
 also urged anothcr objectxon that
 the establishment is not worth
 the price agreed upon for
 it If I mistakenot that
 gentleman said Mr Wendell himself
 had val ued the property
 for the purpose of assessment
 and tåxation and perhaps under
 solemn oath at a much
 less sum than he has
 asked for it and which
 is promised to be paid
 for it 1 understand that
 he has valued it for
 the purpose of assessment and
 taxation at 78 000 And
 yet the Superin tendent of
 the Public Printing and the
 Joint Com mittee on Public
 Printing have agreed to pay
 him 135 000 for it
 and fora defective title to
 theground on which the oflicc
 stands More than that I
 understand that another cs tablishmcnt
 in this city which was
 valued by its proprietor for
 the purposes of assessment and
 taxation at 102 000 was
 offered to the Superin tendent
 for the sun establishment unincumbcred
 by mortgages to which there
 was a clear title an
 establishment complcte in all of
 its appointrnenls I understand that
 such an office was offered
 for the surn of 100
 000 and yet another appearing
 to bc inferior was boutrht
 for a higher price Why
 so impute no bad motive
 only a bad bargain We
 are told that there are
 some twenty six printing presses
 in Mr Wendell s offce
 but we are not informed
 that all of them are
 in good order or are
 capable of being used On
 the con trary I am
 informed that a number of
 them are broken and unfit
 for use I am also
 further in formed that a
 considerable portion of the type
 thc office is unsuited for
 thc printing of the House
 and that other type will
 have to be purchased l

 at the ques tion as
 practical legislators ought to have
 looked at it A MEMBER
 Practical printers or as practical
 printers either Laughter T hc
 gen tleman from Ohio Mr
 STANTON reförred to the fact
 that Mr Wendell s name
 bad been associated with jobs
 for the last ten or
 twelve years and he said
 that he alt vayg suspected
 anything that had WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY
 6 1861 in tendent of
 the Pu blic Printing and
 the Joint Com mittee on
 Printing of both Houses with
 the ap probation and consent
 unofficially of the Secre lary
 of the Interior Well now
 I am willinø to believe
 and I have no hesitation
 in declaring it that I
 repose confidence in the integrity
 of those gentlemen I do
 not believe they would dcsire
 to fasten upon the Government
 an improper pur chase Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE the gentleman yield
 to me for a moment
 Mr FLORENCE 1 have no
 objection to yielding to the
 gentleman I only desire the
 truth I wish however to
 finish what I have to
 say upon the subject Mr
 COCHRANE Before the gentle man
 finishes what he has to
 say I wish he would
 enlighten us upon this point
 If the gentleman with his
 lcnowledge upon the subject were
 about to purchase a printinT
 establishment for his own private
 use taking the present value
 of real estate in the
 locality what would he be
 willing to give for the
 establishment as it stands Mr
 FLORENCE That depends very much
 upon the ability to purchase
 and as I have not
 the ability to purchase I
 am not competent to make
 an offer fbr it I
 will say however that if
 I could be the Printer
 of Congress for a couple
 of NEW SERIES NO 47
 plaint Xxvas made at the
 prices which were paid for
 the execution of the public
 printing It was al leged
 that the Printers for the
 Senate and the House of
 Representatives made enormous profits out
 of their contracts under the
 prices established by the acts
 of 1852and 1854 The proposition
 was then brought forward that
 the Government shoÜld establish its
 own printing office to do
 not only the printing ordexed
 by the Senate and by
 the House but also thä
 ordered by the executive depart
 ments of the Government I
 was then as I am
 now oppoéed to that proposition
 which was brought forward by
 the Committee on Printing But
 sir the first section of
 the joint resolution adopted at
 the last session seems to
 have determ ined and settled
 the whole matter That section
 is as follows That the
 Superintendent of Public Printing be
 and is hereby authorized and
 directed to have executed the
 print ing aud binding authorized
 by the Senate and House
 of Rcpresentatives the cxccutive and
 judiCial departments and the Court
 of Claims And to enable
 him to carry out the
 provisions of this act he
 is authorized and directed to
 contract for the erection or
 purchase of the necessary build
 i in ys Inachinery and
 nuaterials for that purpose said
 con traet to he snbject
 to the approval of the
 Joint Committee on Printing of
 the two Houses of Congress
 Provided I hät thc sum
 so contracted to be paid
 shali not exceed 150 000
 TN hen the bill was
 under consideration in the Senate
 the attempt was made to
 modify this sec years at
 thc rate they havo been
 paying I could tion so
 as to require the approval
 also of the Sec afford
 to rnako a pretty large
 advance upon the retary of
 the Interior before the purchase
 of a price the Government
 pays for this establishment out
 of the profits of the
 job judgingby the profits made
 by those who have enjoyed
 that lucrative position I MYThen
 interrupted by the gentleman from
 New I York I was
 going to say that 1
 had confidence in the integrity
 of those gentlemen who had
 made tl is thorough investigation
 and agreed to purchase this
 establishment Now sir the gentleman
 from Illinois remarked that he
 had reliable information that the
 assess ment of this real
 estate was only 78 000
 and that it was Riven
 under the sanction of an
 oath Mr McCLERNAND 1 said
 1 supposed it was Mr
 FLORENCE well the gentleman sup
 posed it Now sir every
 one knows that assess rnents
 are made very much below
 tl le real value of
 property I know se ch
 is the fact in the
 city of Philadelphia Indeed I
 know 1nany instances where it
 is not assessed at half
 its value Mr McCLERNAND When
 the assessment is nnade under
 oath Mr FLORENCE It was
 not made under oath on
 tl C part of the
 owner Mr McCLERNAND Docs the
 gentleman assert that the assessment
 is not made under oath
 Mr FLORENCE 1 believe it
 is not The assessors may
 be sworn but the valuation
 is not made by the
 owner under oath Every onc
 knows that the assessment of
 property is made at the
 lowest possible figure printing establishment
 should be consummated but the
 amendment was either not adopted
 in that body or if
 adopted there was not concurred
 in by the House The
 Superintendent in the exe cuti01
 i of this law made
 a contract for the estab
 lishment known as the Wendell
 printing offce I am informed
 that before the contract was
 made while negotiations were going
 on he consulted the Secretary
 of the Interior aud informcd
 him that he would make
 no conditional contract for the
 purchase except with his approval
 The Secre tary of the
 Interior did examine the establishment
 and inform himself thoroughly of
 its value and in pursuance
 of his ad vicc and
 approval the Superin tendent of
 the Public Printing made a
 conditional contract to purchase the
 builÜing with all the fix
 tures of the printing oflice
 for thesum of 135 000
 i That contract was as
 I am informed in pursuance
 of this law submute d
 to the approval of the
 Joint Cmnmittee on Printing and
 received the unani i mous
 approval of that committee all
 the members being present except
 one gentleman on the House
 committee It received the confirmation
 there fore of the three
 members of the Senate commit
 I tee and of two
 of the members of the
 House committee In this state
 of facts the question was
 presented I to us Here
 is thc law which requires
 the Super intendent of the
 Public Printing to contract pro
 vided the sum paid shall
 not exceed 150 000 ThiS
 contract is to be conditional
 It is to be sub
 mitted to the Joint Committee
 on Printing If not But
 the gentleman says the types
 arc worn out approved by
 them it is null but
 if approved by Why sir
 gentlemen who have had any
 sort of them it then
 becomes valid and binding upon
 us experience at all can
 observe the difference be Considering
 these facts I could do
 no otherway tsveen the public
 printing under the new and
 under than recommend the appropriation
 which was the old arran
 remcnts Here arc thc types
 daily proposed to be made
 As to the propriety of
 the used in the printing
 of our bills and public
 docu purchase that was not
 a Inatter within the prov
 ments and they arc ample
 as every gentlenuan ince of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means to in will see
 for all the purposes for
 which they are vestigate That
 was the province of the
 Commit intended tee on Printing
 and they discharged that duty
 If gentlemen will read the
 estimates of the com Hero
 the hammer fell mittee upon
 which the purchase has been
 made II Mr GURLEY Mr
 Chairman it has been and
 take into consideration the fact
 that it was suggested by
 n y colleague that this
 printing omce assessed at only
 onc half its original cost
 they was owned by Mr
 Wendell and that therefore will
 see the fairness of the
 transaction it should not be
 purchased by the Government Here
 the hammer fell Sir the
 committee never asked the question
 in Mr PHELPS I move
 to amend by striking their
 preliminary examination who owned the
 out halfa dozen lines anything
 to one or oihce What
 they wished to know and
 the point Wendell s name
 in it Now Ido not
 propose to turo remarks in
 order to which they first
 directed their inquiries was Mr
 Chairman as a member of
 tho Committee is it a
 office for the purposes of
 the Gov be M r
 MT endo l s but
 I must say to gen
 tlemen that if they will
 take occasion to ox am
 of Ways and ea I
 gave WI y assent to
 the roc ernment Is it
 reasonable in price Is it
 fair is ine this report
 they will find on the
 face of it that ommendation
 of that committee that the
 House it just is it
 equitable As to ownership that
 was Mr has not a
 farthing of interest in it
 concur in this muc ndtnent
 of the Senate and I
 of no consequence to us
 Who cares whether that the
 property is owned by Mr
 Joseph T desire to state
 to the House briefly the
 reasons l Mr N Vcndell
 or anybody else owns it
 if we can Crowell and
 that it has been purchased
 from Mr purchase it at
 a fair price which brought
 me to that conclusion Crowell
 under the authority given to
 the Super At the last
 Congress we found that much
 com II Now sir I
 undertake to say that Mr
 Wen 738 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 4 dell has not
 one cent interest in the
 eoncern or iåthei he will
 not receive a cent of
 the purchase money I say
 it on the authority of
 those who hold the controlling
 interest in the building But
 suppose he did own it
 what was that to us
 We were looking simply to
 the interests of the Gov
 ernment I care not who
 owns the offce I un
 dertake to say that it
 is the best printing offce
 in the United States and
 if gentlemen wish to verify
 that fact let them jump
 into a carriage when they
 leave the House and visit
 it with this report of
 the Superintendent of the Public
 Printing in their hands Ilhe
 measurer of the Capitol extension
 examined the building and estimated
 its present value and the
 result was as follows He
 says the building would now
 cost 54 000 to erect
 to day What did the
 Superintendent pay for it F
 oi ty thousand dollars a
 saving upon this esti mate
 of 14 000 upon the
 building alone One gentleman has
 referrcd to the binding 1
 shall be glad indeed when
 this binding shall be transferred
 to this Government establishment but
 when he remarks that 25
 000 could have been I
 saved if other parties had
 received thc binding It is
 not true I an I
 aware that a certain deny
 it gentleman of his acquaintance
 put in an offer to
 do the work at a
 lower rate after the work
 was given out an irresponsible
 man a bankrupt as I
 am informed pecuniarily not a
 binder and therefore not a
 proper person to do the
 work Ifthe binding had been
 given to him I have
 no doubt it would hit
 ve been done in some
 sort of u way at
 some sort ofa price Mr
 KUNKEL I will say now
 what I en deavored to
 say a short time since
 in reply to the gentleman
 from Ohio Mr STANTON and
 that IS that the House
 Committee on Printing made a
 contract for the binding at
 the rate of foi ty
 cents per volume quarto while
 the Senate made a con
 tract for its binding at
 seventy five cents per vol
 ume quarto It is proper
 therefore in connection with the
 remarks of the gentleman from
 01 io that the Corn
 miltee on Printing of this
 House I should bc vindicated
 from the charge made against
 it in reference to this
 specific contract for printing Under
 that contract the House pays
 much less for the same
 work t han is paid
 by the Senate Mr GURLEY
 The Senate gave out the
 bind ing at seventy five
 cents and twelve and a
 half cents while the committee
 of the House gave it
 out at forty cents and
 twelve cents or nearly one
 hundred per cent less taking
 the two works than the
 Senate I he members of
 this House will bear testimony
 that ours is the best
 binding that has ever been
 done in this city It
 is so cer tified to
 by all connected with the
 Superintendent s Office and others
 Now a word in reference
 to the printing ofhce I
 am assured by the that
 has been purchased Superintendent that
 every press in that office
 is in good working order
 to day and us to
 the type we need not
 dispute about it here for
 each mem bcr has before
 hirn the bills reports and
 other docurnen ts which have
 been ordered to be printed
 upon it fi om time
 to time Tl ey wili
 decide for then isckves whether
 thc type is good or
 not For myself I say
 that the type is excellent
 and that no printing need
 be better than that now
 done for this House I
 arn aware Mr Chairman that
 there is com I am
 aware that there is petition
 in this matter another printing
 office the owner of which
 would be glad to sell
 it to the Government l
 he Super intendent and the
 Secretary of the Interior I
 be lieve looked carefully into
 that ofhce and found insuperable
 objections to it Mr PHELPS
 by unanimous consent then withdrew
 his amendment Mr BRANCH Mr
 Chairman at the last session
 of Congress in consequence of
 the fact that we had
 heard for several years as
 was re marked by the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr STAN
 TON the name of Cornelius
 Wendell and others connected with
 allegations of great impropriety in
 respect of our public printing
 Congress passed a bill to
 establish a Government printing offce
 I voted for that bill
 and I have not as
 yet had any reason to
 doubt the propriety of the
 vote I then gave Under
 tho law we authorized the
 Superin tendent of the Public
 Printing either to purchase materials
 for an establishment or to
 purchase an establishment already erected
 and to make a con
 tract for it subicct to
 the approval of the Joint
 Committee on Printing of the
 two Houses It has been
 offcially réported to us that
 the Superin tenden t of
 the Public Printing has in
 pursuance of law entered intö
 a contract which has received
 the sanction nov only of
 the Joint Committee on Printing
 but also of the Secretary
 of the Interior The question
 now presented to us sir
 is not whether the law
 was a good one which
 the last Congress passed or
 whether this contract is favor
 able to the Government but
 whether wye shall abide by
 a contract and carry it
 out which was made under
 a law passed by ourselves
 Gentlemen say that the contract
 is an injudi If that
 be so the Committee on
 pub Clous one lic Printing
 and the Superintendent of the
 Public Printing are responsible to
 Congress for what they If
 there was any corruption in
 the have done purchase investigate
 it and ascertain the fact
 If It can be shown
 that there has been corruption
 then I will go as
 far as the furthest in
 the pun ishment of all
 those connected with such corrup
 tion But no allegation of
 that sort is made No
 proof is brought forward even
 to excite a suspi cion
 that there has bcen corruption
 on the part of anybody
 in this transaction The Superintendent
 of the Public Printing has
 done what we author ized
 him by law to do
 He has made a contract
 which is a subsisting and
 binding contract on the Government
 Congress according to my view
 of it is in honor
 bound to carry out that
 contract and pay the money
 under its provisions If gentlemen
 think there has been anything
 improper about it let them
 institute an investigation and we
 can suspend this appropriation long
 enough to ascer tain whether
 the party ownil g ihis
 office has been If he
 has been guilty and guilty
 of corruption it can be
 shown then we may annul
 this contract Until such charges
 are made I hold that
 it is the duly of
 Congress to make this appropriation
 to pay for the office
 that has been purchased and
 in every way to carry
 out this contract which ap
 pears to have been made
 in strict conformity to the
 authority which ve ourselves conferred
 It appears to mc under
 thc present circumstanccs witflout some
 further allegations than those made
 here in this debate we
 are consuming time unne cessapily
 in disc ussing whether it
 was a judicious contract or
 not because under the law
 wre are bound to carry
 it out I vh STANTON
 Mr Chairman l regret very
 much that my colleague has
 seen fit to endeavor in
 this debate as he has
 done heretofore to cast an
 imputation or aspersion upon the
 character of the gentleman who
 made the bid to which
 he refers i know that
 gentleman well and if poverty
 be a crime in the
 estimation of my colleague perhaps
 the people who sent him
 here would like to know
 I know as have said
 the gentleman he re it
 fers to well and without
 meaning any disparage ment to
 my colleague m vill say
 to him that he ought
 to be proud to be
 regarded as socially and intellectually
 his equal In reference to
 the contract to which he
 refers I have something to
 say which I know and
 which is established by sworn
 proof I do not know
 It may be worse what
 the Senate contract is than
 the House contract But I
 know that the House committee
 was offered by a responsible
 party a bid abundantly guarantied
 to do the bind ing
 for the House at forty
 cents per volume quar to
 and ten cents per volume
 octavo I know that that
 bid was made at three
 o clock the day after
 the Committee on Printino was
 appointed 1 I know that
 John C Rives offered know
 more to do the House
 binding at eight cents and
 seven mills per volume octavo
 and thirty five cents know
 that those bids were pcr
 volume quarto refused and that
 the contract was awarded to
 a po litical editor residing
 at Columbus the capital of
 my colleague s own State
 and the organ of a
 dis tinguishod politician of that
 State and awarded at a
 price amounting in the aggregate
 to 25 000 more than
 it was bid for by
 a competent and re sponsible
 party That I know and
 there is no controversy about
 it I know more I
 know that at the last
 session of Congress the gentleman
 from Maine offered a resolution
 in this House in structing
 the Committee on Printing to
 inquire into the expediency of
 letting the contract for binding
 out to the lowest bidder
 It was sent to the
 Committee on Printing of which
 my colleague is chairman but
 it has never yet been
 reported back The reason why
 I do not know Mr
 BRA NCH by unanimous consent
 with drew his amendment Mr
 SHERMAN 1 hope we will
 now have a vote on
 the amendment Mr FOUKE i
 move to amend by increasing
 the appropriation five dollars Mr
 GURLEY 1 wish to say
 a word The CHAIRMAN The
 gentleman musthave an amendment Mr
 GURLEY I move to increase
 the appro I want to
 sa y a word irn
 eply priation one dollar to
 my colleague We had given
 out the binding before the
 proposition to which my colleague
 ludes came in The author
 of the proposal first bid
 at a higher rate than
 we gave the binding out
 at but finding that the
 contract was given to an
 other afterwards sent in a
 lower bid from pure malice
 as subsequent development showed Mr
 FOUKE I have not yielded
 the floor The CHAIRMAN The
 Chair understood the gentleman to
 yield Mr FOUKE only for
 an explanation Mr GURLEY 1
 not occupy the floor long
 The Senate gave out the
 binding at a much higher
 rate than we did The
 gentleman who did the binding
 for the session previous to
 the last complained that he
 lost money on his contract
 and he came to the
 Senate with an extra claim
 for losses sustained in doing
 the binding Yet he received
 more than is now allowed
 to the binders for this
 House To cut the matter
 short I say you can
 get the binding donc in
 this towrn for almost any
 price At least men will
 agree to do the binding
 at any price but sir
 before they get through they
 will come to Congress and
 ask for extra pay with
 a good prospect of receiving
 it We gave out the
 binding at fair and honest
 rate as every man knows
 who is in that business
 and as was demonstrated beföre
 the Senate committee last year
 Mr McCLERNAND 1 desire to
 ques tion right there Was
 it because other contractors asked
 an advance upon their contract
 prices that the committee offered
 to contract at a higher
 price than was bid by
 others Mr GURLEY The Senate
 for extra pay although they
 received a higher price than
 ve gave the binder of
 the House They undertook to
 show and did show before
 a com mittee of the
 Senate that they lost money
 If you would have good
 binding you must pay a
 fair price Many of your
 books which have been heretofore
 bound come to pieces by
 very slight handling and in
 passing through the mails We
 can get such binding done
 at almost any price Irresponsible
 men are wikling to take
 work of the Government below
 cost do it badly and
 come in for extra pay
 The very man who made
 the bid for binding referred
 to by my colleague came
 to my own house last
 winter and demanded the bind
 ing for partisan services at
 old prices seventy five cents
 and twelve and a half
 cents almost a hundred per
 cent more than we now
 pay for it and threatened
 that if we did not
 give it to him he
 would send in a bid
 for it below cost and
 then call for an investigating
 committee and expose he whole
 thing An investigation of this
 subject was made before the
 Senate King committee last ses
 sion and his doings were
 exposed to his own damage
 instead of ours as any
 one can see by the
 report of that committee Mr
 FOUKE know nothing about the
 mat ters which have been
 discussed upon this floor in
 reference to the expenditures of
 the two branches I wish
 merely to state that at
 the of Congress first session
 of the present Congress I
 opposed and voted against the
 proposition that this Gov ernment
 should go into the business
 of public printing and establish
 a public printing offce for
 the printing of the two
 branches of Congress But as
 that proposition has been carried
 and a bill is now
 before us making an appropriation
 for the purpose of establishing
 a printing offce for the
 Government and the purchasing of
 this particu lar property for
 that end am in favor
 of the ap propriation and
 in favor of purchasing the
 iden I am in tical
 office which is named this
 bill favor of it for
 the reason that if we
 x verc to go to
 work to establish a new
 office for thisGovernment by erecting
 buildings and entering into contracts
 with employés we would find
 in the end that the
 expenditure would amount to more
 than the 135 000 which
 it is proposed now to
 appropriate I will admit and
 I have no doubt of
 it that the amount proposed
 to be appropriated is more
 than the property is worth
 but this building 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 09 which is
 one of the most complete
 printing omces in the United
 States was got up by
 private en terprise for the
 purpose of accommodating the two
 Houses of Congress and for
 the purpose of doing the
 printing for the different Departments
 of the Government and were
 we to go into the
 oper ation of purchasing new
 grounds and erectino new buildings
 in place of tlie one
 we propose now to purchase
 we would destroy that private
 en terprise entirely and therefore
 I think there is a
 moral obligation resting upon us
 to purchase this instead of
 purchasing new grounds and property
 The dimension of this building
 is two hundred and sixty
 four by one hundred and
 seventy five feet No new
 building of that size could
 now be erected by the
 Government by giving it out
 by contract in the manner
 in which such contracts are
 usually made by the Government
 except by an expenditure far
 beyond 135 000 We know
 the favoritism which has been
 exercised by this House and
 by the committee in giving
 out con tracts and the
 purchase of presses and type
 in New York and Philadelphia
 the two great points where
 these articles are manufactured and
 the erection of a building
 to say nothing about the
 cost of the ground would
 greatly exceed the sum now
 to be appropriated And then
 we should do injustice to
 a private enterprise which was
 in vited into the printing
 business by the action of
 the two Houses of Congress
 Therefore I am in favor
 of purchasing this property under
 this bill although I was
 opposed last session to the
 establishment ofa public print ing
 office bv the Government Mr
 GUftLEY by unanimous consent with
 drew his amendment The question
 was taken on Mr MCCLERNAND

 The gentleman from Iowa can
 not accomplish his purpose until

 the yeas and nays will
 have to be taken on
 one or two of those
 amendments I think therefore we
 had better adjourn Mr STANTON

 as follows Joint resolution for

 Mr BOCOCK 1 desire to
 say to the man from
 Iowa and to those gentlemen
 who agree with him that
 there seems to me to
 be no sortof necessity for
 keeping us here this evening

 Pacific rail road bill be
 made the special order after
 the prop ositions of the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr COR
 WIN the chairman of the
 committee of thirty three shall

 prop tleman from Ohio whether
 ho proposes to bring ositions
 cannot possibly be disposed of

 call shall be Mr SHERMAN

 SPEAKER The Chair has decided
 it to be out of
 order at present and the
 motion before the House is
 to adjourn Mr SICKLES What
 became of the motion of
 the gentleman from Iowa It
 was made before the motion
 to adjourn The SPEAKER It
 not received by the Chair
 Mr SICKLES But it vvas

 morning hour and the gentleman
 from Ohio Mr SHERMAN a

 the previous question pending which
 cuts of the motion to
 suspend the rifles Mr SICKLES
 hope the gentleman from Ohio
 will withdraw the demand for
 the previous certainly take up
 a good partof Friday That
 will leave only one day
 Saturday which we usu ally
 devote to private business I
 appeal then to the gentleman
 from Iowa to let this
 thing go over He will
 only lose one day and
 next Mön day he will
 have another chance to bring
 up his bill Why under
 these circumstances should we stay
 here now to vote on
 these amendments to the deficiency
 bill Mr SICKLES If the
 statement of the gen tleman
 from Virginia be correct what
 objection can there be to
 the resolution of thc gen
 tleman from Iowa inasmuch as
 it will not give the
 Pacific railroad bill precedence Mr
 SHERMAN I suggest to my
 friend from Iowa that he
 can have no difficulty in
 getting up his bill whenever
 a majority of the House
 desire to take it up
 He has only to wait
 until the ex piration of
 the morning hour and then
 a majority of the House
 can postpone the special order

 That thc appointed by the

 be admitted to the floor
 of the Senate during the

 Mr FESSENDEN called for the

 the Senate not pass this

 that if we thus begin
 to break down our rules
 there will be no end
 to it Senators know very
 well the great inconvenience we
 have experienced from having so
 many people on the floor
 here at differ ent times
 There is ample room in

 We have adhered to our

 purposely minute and particular our
 experience the old Hall having
 shown the necessity for it
 Allhough I should be as
 glau as anybody to meet
 many of these gentlemen on
 the floor of the Senate

 con sideration for oar own

 ought to lead us to

 LOAN DILL The VICE PRESIDENT
 The hour of half past
 twelve o clock having arrived
 it is the duty of
 the Chair to call up
 the special order which is
 the loan bill The Senate
 accordingly as in Committcc ofthc
 Whole proceeded to consider the
 bill H R No It
 proposes to authorize 972 to
 authorize a loan the President
 of the United States at
 any time before the 1st
 day of July next to

 the United Siatcs a sum
 not exceeding 25 000 000
 or so much thereof as

 rcncies of the public service
 may require to be used

 demands upon the Treasury and

 notes now outstanding and to
 replace in the Treasury any
 amount of notes which shall
 have been paid and received
 for public dues Stock is
 to be Issued for the
 amount borrowed bearing interest not
 exceeding six per centum per
 annum and to be reimbursed
 within a period not beyond
 twenty years and not less
 than ten years and the
 Secretary of the Treasury is

 the consent of the President
 to cause certificates of stock

 last year we authorized Treasury
 It is but proper that

 of 21 000 000 to

 enable the Treasury to get

 receive any money during the
 continuance not bc effected upon

 this Administration and this Administration
 act requircd that the money
 should be loancd at will
 go out in disgrace and
 the next come in with2
 It has been found impossible
 not less than par out
 a dollar to carry on
 the Government It tbcrcfore has
 become to borrow money at
 par I apprehend sir that
 some Senators are of the
 absolutely necessary that some other
 bill should opinion that the
 amount of this loan is
 too large be introduced either
 by way of remedying the
 ob I think I have
 shown that it is not
 so Iam very jection to
 that bill which makes it
 impossible to well satisfied that
 it is not the desire
 of any mem procure money
 under it or authorizi ng
 a new loan ber of
 the Committee on Finance or
 of the Sec In the
 mean time it appears that
 movc money will retary of
 the Treasury or of the
 President that be required for
 the support of the Government
 any part of this loan
 should be appropriated to before
 the 30th day o June
 next than the balance purposes
 of coercion I do not
 see indeed what which has
 not yet been negotiated under
 the act portion of it
 could be so used sinc
 e the amount of Junc
 22 1860 The Secretary of
 the Treasury to be retained
 in the Treasury if these
 cstimatcs on tho 18th day
 of last month addressed a
 letter to are altogether accurate
 would be less than the
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means of the I louse
 of neprcsentatives from which letter
 have ob amount which it
 has been usually considered taincd
 the following information I find
 that the proper to have
 at the command of the
 Govern amount which will be
 required at the Treasury to
 the 30th day of June
 for the support of the
 Gov ernment and the paytncnt
 of Treasury notes will be
 44 077 524 The receipts
 to the sarne time are
 estimated far below thc usual
 average In October last it
 vas supposed that the revenue
 from cus toms would give
 about fiftecn million dollars foc
 that quarter Instead of that
 it yielded but about I
 eight million dollars Six million
 dollars of goods importcd into
 thc port of New York
 were into warehouses and bonded
 and of course do not
 enter into consumption or add
 the revenue of the quarter
 To that extent the anticipated
 rev ri his furnishes us
 a means enuc was diminished
 In thesc times of of
 calculation as to the future
 monetary deranoement and what is
 still worse of political convulsion
 it is impossible to make
 an accurate calculation or an
 estimate approaching to what the
 reality rnay prove to be
 or at least to make
 one which can bc relied
 upon with anything like confidence
 The Secretary however with all
 the lights beforc him savs
 he has estimated that it
 is not at all probable
 that we can derive from
 the rcvcnuc from customs from
 the 1st of loan the
 Secretary of the Treasury is
 to cause January to the
 30th of June 1861 more
 than six the city of
 Washington and in one or
 morc pub may not amount
 even to that much but
 that is the to be
 inserted in two of the
 public newspapers of I teen
 million dollars The duties from
 customs largest arnount which he
 thinks it safe to expect
 of the loan itself Aftcz
 the statement made by lic
 newspapers in oihet cities of
 the United States the chairman
 of the Committce on Finance
 ovcry Tl hen the revenne
 from public lands is very
 much public notice that spalcd
 proposals for such loan ment
 to meet unforeseen demands At
 all events it is a
 very small excess above what
 will be abso lutely required
 in all human probability certainly
 not such an amountas wou
 d justify the suspicion that
 it was intended to carry
 on war tyrainst the am
 very free to say that
 if I seceding States believed
 so I should not have
 assented to the bill I
 have no idea that this
 Union can be maint a
 ined or restored by force
 Nor do believe in tbe
 value of a Union wvhich
 can only be kept together
 by dint of military force
 I have not therefore given
 consent to this bill except
 as I believe thatit is
 necessary for the ordinary expenses
 of the Gov without reference
 to unusual military operations If
 any explanations are necessary which
 I have not given and
 which I can give I
 will do so with plcasurc
 Mr FESSENDEN Mr President 1
 sup pose tho immediate question
 is on the amendment proposing
 an additional section The VICE
 PRE IDENT That is the
 ques tion Mr FESSENDEN Of
 that Senator has not spoken
 I presume there is no
 very conside erable difference of
 opinion between the two sidcs
 of the Chamber with reference
 to the propriety will be
 received until a certain day
 not less than ten days
 from its first insertion io
 a Washington the amount of
 the loan at what periods
 paper the money shall be
 paid if by installments and
 at what places The sealed
 proposals arc to be opened
 on the day appointed in
 tho I 10ticc in thc
 presence of such persons as
 may choose to attend and
 the proposals decided by the
 Secretary of the Treasury who
 is to accept the most
 favorable offered by responsible bidders
 for the stock and the
 Secretary is to report to
 Congress at the com mencetnent
 of the next session the
 amount of money borrowed under
 this act and of whom
 and on what terms it
 shall have been obtained with
 an abstract or brief statement
 of all the pro posals
 submitted for the same distinguishing
 be tween t hoso accepted
 and those rejected with a
 detailed statement of the expense
 of making the loans The
 faith of the United States
 is pkédged by this enactment
 for the due payment of
 the interest and the redemption
 of the principal of the
 stock The first amendment of
 the Committee on Fi in
 section nance was to insert
 the word loan three line
 six after the word such
 so as to less than
 was anticipated It was supposed
 six body mu st understand
 that the aniount of money
 months ago that thc revenue
 public lands asked for is
 necessary to the ordinary working
 of would amount to somc
 two and a half million
 per the Government The actual
 appropriations will annum Instead of
 that tho revenue forthc last
 fis E take about twenty
 two million dollars as stated
 cal quarter was but 250
 000 and the Secretary think
 very prud ntly estimates that
 ue cannot realize more at
 the most than one million
 dollars from that source prior
 to the 30th of June
 next From miscellaneous sources he
 estimates that i 400 000
 may be expected The very
 largest amount then of revenue
 from all sources upon which
 we can calculate up to
 the 30th of June next
 is about seventeen mil lion
 four hundred thou sand dollars
 and even this may be
 reduced Now I the demands
 npon the Treasury up to
 that time are estimated at
 44 077 000 The demand
 for this sum will be
 occasioned not merely by the
 and 3 000 000 is
 nota very large margin for
 un expected caus that may
 be made and always are
 made upon the Treasury especially
 in the present state of
 the revenues of the country
 Therefore so far as the
 are concerned i suppose no
 one can doubt the propriety
 of passing a bill to
 borrow that amount of money
 The question arises the only
 question that there was in
 the committee and which arose
 in fact after the committee
 had agreed to report whether
 it is expedient to repeal
 the previous bill the act
 of last June authorizing a
 loan loan bill of to
 leave that as it stands
 YVith reference to that the
 explanation is very simple ordinary
 and current expenditures of the
 Govern mcnt but by the
 necessity of providing for over
 l The expenditure of any
 rnoncy Lhat may be ob
 tained under that bill is
 limited to one specific ob
 nine million dollars of Trcasury
 notes under the act of
 1857 which are now outstanding
 On the ject which is
 the retirement of the 20
 000 000 of l vcasury
 notes Clien outstandinæ It can
 be appro 1st January there
 werc between eleven and twcivc
 priated to nothing else As
 we all know we failcd
 million dollars outstanding and liable
 to be pre sented Of
 these 2 500 000 were
 redeemed be to get the
 money under that bill for
 reasons which tween the 1st
 and 14th of January Nine
 mil are very weil understood
 byæ il Consequently 742 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 5 in
 December last we Were obliged
 to pass another I bill
 authorizing an issue of 10
 000 000 more of Treasurynotes
 to meet demands upon the
 Treas ury principally occasioned in
 fact altogether occaéjoned by the
 failure to get the money
 under the previous loan bill
 When that bill was passed
 in December it provided that
 the money which might be
 obtained under the loan bill
 of June last should be
 appropriated as well to the
 retirement of those notes the
 we then authorized as the
 others That was provided for
 distinctly The question now arises
 as the 25 000 000
 whiåh we now propose to
 bOrrow will take up all
 the outstanding Treasury notes now
 due or which may become
 due within a very short
 period about nine million dollars
 of them and is de
 signed to cover that amount
 whether we should repeal the
 bill of last June or
 leave that to operate inorder
 to meet the which will
 become due next December That
 is the simplequestion The answ
 er to that will depend
 simply upon whether we believe
 in the present condition of
 things in the country and
 as the country will un
 questionably remain for a very
 considerable por lion of the
 year in an unsettled state
 so far as our revenues
 from importations are concerned it
 is probable that the present
 tariff if it stands or
 any new one that we
 may pass will be likely
 to prodüce revenue enough not
 only to meet the current
 expenses of the Government next
 year but algo to pay
 this debt of the present
 Adminis tration which is left
 open of 10 000 000
 The House of Representatives thought
 it was best to leave
 this in order if the
 credit of the country im
 proves to pay the 10
 000 000 to have something
 provided to meet them when
 they come due to save
 the necessity of future legislauon
 and they ac cordingly left
 that bill as it is
 The atnendment is to repeal
 Ihat bill and to leavc
 these 10 000 000 of
 Treasury notes to take their
 chance on thc Treasury hereafter
 next December when they I
 think it would be very
 unwise to become due do
 it there ig no necessitv
 for doing it on thc
 contrary the necessity is rather
 for letting it re I
 am thercfore opposed to the
 main as it is amendment
 Mr PEARCE As for the
 Treasury notes which were issued
 in December last and in
 Tan uary of the present
 year it will be recollected
 that they bear a very
 extraordinary rate of interest twelve
 per cent I think most
 of them though It is
 not to be supposed gome
 are at a loss rate
 that these Treasury notes will
 come upon the Treasury for
 redemption at the close of
 the pres ent year They
 will be redeemed when the
 Gov ernment shall have funds
 to redeem them and the
 Treasury shall advertise that it
 is ready to do so
 No one that holds a
 Treasury note of the United
 States Government bearing eleven or
 twelve per cent interest will
 think of presenting it until
 te quired to do so
 The other Ilrcasury notes those
 issued under the act of
 1857 now in mar ket
 and outstanding amounting to over
 nine mil lion dollars nre
 provided fbr in the 25
 000 000 loan bill which
 now before the Senate not
 think any loan at all
 is necessary at this time
 to provide for the Treasury
 notes issued last De cember
 and January since it must
 be obvious to every one
 that they will remain out
 The act of June 22
 1860 was required only for
 the purpose of paying off
 the Treasury notes which had
 been issued under former acts
 and I havc shown that
 they have all been redeemed
 al ready except these 9
 000 000 and provision is
 made for them by this
 loan of 25 000 000
 Then sit if the service
 of the Government beyond the
 30th of June next be
 taken into consideration it I
 must be remembered that there
 is another bill pending in
 which there is provision for
 another large loan a bill
 reported the Senator from Rhode
 Island Mr SIMMONS The act
 of June 22 1860 besides
 is impracticable in the present
 condition of the country or
 in any condition in which
 it is likely to be
 for some months it cannot
 be of any avail It
 seems therefore to be unnecessary
 to let it remain on
 the statute book If peace
 bé restored to the country
 if our po litical relations
 resume their former condition prosperity
 will return too and under
 any tariff either that which
 now exists or even the
 one pro posed by the
 Senator frorrrRhode Island I take
 it there probably bc enough
 revenue for the cur rentsupport
 oftheGovernment and I do not
 think it is ad visable
 for Congress to be making
 provisions for loans beyond the
 evident necessity and uses of
 the Government I think therefore
 that while this bill is
 intended as a substitute in
 part for the bill of
 June 22 1860 we should
 repeal the act of June
 22d as useless and as
 indicating condition of things not
 actually existing We substitute for
 it what is much better
 because it is efficient because
 we can probably realize the
 money at some rate under
 it unless the blindness of
 pollt ical hostility shall still
 further impair the credit of
 Government I take it for
 granted that before the end
 of this session if it
 be necessary though I can
 hardly anticipate that it will
 be competent for Congress to
 provide additional loans and those
 who have the power in
 both branches of Congress will
 be able to effect it
 at any time they may
 desire I think therefore it
 is better to pass this
 amendment Mr HUNTER 1 have
 no objection to this loan
 bill provided the amendment of
 the Senator from Marvland be
 adopted although it be notgiven
 precisely in the shape in
 which the Secretary of the
 Treasury asked for it He
 asked that Congress should make
 the authority that now exists
 for bor rowing the 13
 000 000 not yet negotiated
 of the loan last year
 available and to provide for
 the residue of this fiscal
 year in another bill The
 House of Representatives did not
 choose t o give it
 to him in that form
 but sent up a loan
 bill for 25 000 000
 still leaving this authority existing
 on the statute book Inasmuch
 as this 25 000 000
 is more than he asked
 for because what he did
 ask for was between twenty
 one and twenty two million
 which he said would be
 enough till the 1st of
 July it seems to me
 that this is enough to
 give him and I think
 we ought to repeal the
 ex ISting authority which is
 upon the statute book At
 this time it cannot be
 used It requires that five
 per cont stock shall be
 put out at par which
 cannot be done In that
 shape it cannot be avail
 able to redeem the Treasury
 notes as the Senator from
 Maryland has said because every
 man would rather hold on
 to a I reasury note
 at twelve pcr cent interest
 than take stock at five
 per cent m exchange for
 it which would not probably
 sell for morc ihan eighty
 three or eighty four therefore
 of no use in that
 regard but wc leave an
 authority upon the statutc book
 which is of no use
 in time of financial difficulty
 and which if it ever
 becomes of use will be
 at a time when things
 are rest ored and then
 there will be this authority
 to the Secretary when perhaps
 he ought not to have
 it It is better therefore
 I think to repeal it
 I believe we ought to
 givc him what he asks
 for and nothing more lam
 willing to give him a
 loan of because I do
 not suppose as it will
 be sold to the lowest
 bidder that he will get
 more than 22 000 000
 I suppose he will hardly
 ct morc than ninety or
 ninety one for it which
 I am willing would bring
 the sum he wants therefore
 to agree to the loan
 of 25 000 000 pro
 vided the other is repealed
 Mr SIMMONS obtained the floor
 Mr FESSENDEN Will the Senator
 from Rhode Island allow me
 a moment to make an
 explanation Mr SIMMONS Yes sir
 Mr FESSENDEN Mr President ifit
 is tu ue as the
 Senator from Virginia supposes that
 the act of June last
 as it stands now will
 not raise the money at
 the rate of interest fixed
 it certainly can do no
 harm It cannot become operative
 until the Government shall be
 in better credit or money
 more plenty Mr HUNTER When
 it is in better credit
 the Government does not want
 it Mr FESSENDEN 1 am
 io hopes it will be
 in better credit by that
 time Now sir although it
 is not likely that a
 man would exchange a Treas
 ury note bearing ten or
 twelve per cent interest for
 a bond bearing five I
 suppose the Senator is aware
 that we have the power
 if xxve choose to i
 edeem those notes at the
 end of one year and
 then the interest ceases They
 do not go on in
 definitely as long as a
 person chooses to hold them
 To be sure they are
 issued for a year and
 for that period they bear
 this rate of interest but
 it will be our interest
 to have the money and
 to retire t hose notes
 as early as practicable and
 if we can then exchange
 an instrument bearino five or
 six per cent for one
 bearing ten or twelve I
 suppose It would be a
 good bargain Mr HUNTER Does
 the Senator suppose that we
 would exchange a bond bearing
 five per cent for a
 Treasury note I Ie would
 have to give money for
 it whenever he redeems it
 and he can only get
 money through this loan by
 selling it for money and
 he cannot sell it except
 below par Mr FESSENDEN And
 if we cannot sell except
 at a ruinous rate we
 ought not to sell at
 ail What I contend for
 is the power to raise
 the money in case ib
 should be found necessary and
 practicable to raise it at
 a reasonable rate of in
 tercst that is all Now
 sir I believe or at
 any rate hope yes I
 say I believe the country
 will be in a condition
 before these notes become payable
 in which the money can
 be raised and raised without
 difii culty for the credit
 of this Government will be
 better 1 think in that
 case it would be quite
 as well to provide the
 power to raise the money
 as it would to let
 these notes remain out To
 be sure Congress will meet
 again at that particular time
 but I should greatly prefer
 to have tbc books Let
 the debt of this Adrniuistra
 Lion be privided for by
 this Administration and not take
 this off thc statute books
 and compel the incoming Administration
 to pay a debt that
 you contracted That is the
 simple question about it Mr
 HUNTER Is not a Treasury
 note as much a debt
 as 8 bond Mr FESSENDEN
 Undoubtedly but it will be
 under the law you pass
 for your purposes It does
 not change the nature of
 the debt but the statement
 of the account will be
 more readily and easily made
 and understood and certainly accord
 fing to the Senator s
 own showing it does no
 harm do not suppose with
 reference to that matter it
 to be of very great
 importance for you can pass
 a bill at any period
 There is no difficulty in
 pass ing bills to borrow
 money if anybody willing to
 loan it to pay the
 actual debts pressing upon us
 but one argument made by
 the chairman of the committee
 is that here are 20
 000 000 of a loan
 provided for in the new
 tariff bill that has come
 here Will not the same
 objection be Inade to that
 Does the Senator intend to
 say he means to vote
 for those Mr PEARCE Perhaps
 not Mr FESSENDEN Ordoes the
 Senator from Virginia mean to
 say that he will vote
 for the provided for there
 Not at all we shall
 find them opposing that proposition
 in that bill precisely in
 the same way What I
 want to do If possible
 is to provide for this
 in advance or let it
 stand providöd for if this
 will do it If it
 will not we must find
 some other mode I am
 not certain that it will
 but at any rate it
 can be tried It can
 do no harm If the
 money cannot be raised at
 that rate of course it
 cannot be had and cannot
 be expended and we must
 try some other way If
 it can it is proper
 the incominm Administration should have
 the power to raise it
 to meet these notes at
 the time they become due
 by exchanging money procured at
 the rate of five per
 cent interest for notes for
 which we are pay Ing
 ten or twelve per cent
 That is all there is
 about it Mr MASON Mr
 President The VICE PRESIDENT The
 Senator from Rhode Island yielded
 the floor to the Senator
 from Maine Mr SIMMONS I
 yield to the Senator from
 Virginia Mr MASON I only
 want to say a word
 I wish to understand this
 subject I do under stand
 it the matter presents itself
 thus in June 1860 Congress
 passed a law authorizing the
 loan referred to by the
 chairman of the Committee on
 Finance If that loan had
 been made a large por
 tion of the present loan
 would not be wanted If
 that loan had been made
 they would not have asked
 for the mone_y they now
 ask for or a large
 portion of it Why was
 it not made It was
 not made because it was
 found that the provisions of
 the bill would not invite
 bids for the loan The
 state of the country became
 altered and money could not
 be obtained upon the terms
 which the act of June
 1860 contemplated Therefore as I
 learn from the chairman of
 the committee the present bill
 is reported in truth as
 a substitute pro tanto for
 the laxtv of June 1860
 If that law had done
 the offce expected of it
 a large portion of this
 loan would not have been
 asked for Mr FESSENDEN And
 the 1861 which we have
 been obliged to put out
 since De cember would not
 have been put out Mr
 MASON That may be but
 to theextent of nevv loans
 have supplied the func tions
 of this other law of
 last year But the Sen
 ator from Maine asks that
 we shall not only pro
 vide these 25 000 000
 but that we shall allow
 that law to remain upon
 the statute book until by
 some reviving condition of the
 country it can again be
 called into life Now he
 says as I understand him
 it ought to remain there
 as a memorial of the
 doings of the presen t
 Administration when it shall cease
 to exist Mr FESSENDEN Oh
 no 1 said no such
 thing Mr MASON In substance
 Mr FESSENDEN No not in
 substance Mr MASON A debt
 this Administration had created Mr
 FESSENDEN Exactly Mr MASON Thatitis
 a memorial ofwhatthis Administration did
 Sir it will be a
 memorial that will be illusory
 and mislead those who rely
 upon it because the truth
 will be that becoming dead
 by the altered condition of
 the country we su plied
 its place by living matter
 o w sir I confess
 I do not like the
 plan of providing these large
 sums of money at the
 ruin ous rates at which
 money is now provided The
 condition of the country is
 altered The propor tions of
 the Government have been curtailed
 and very materially and seriously
 curtailed There is a high
 degree of probability that that
 curtailment wili go on and
 that by the 4th of
 Marci this Gov ernment will
 not exhibit the dimensions that
 the Government had on the
 4th of March last The
 consequence is the public mind
 is unsettled as to the
 condition of the Government as
 to its ability its solvency
 The simple fact appears that
 not only is State credit
 far superior to the credit
 of the combined States but
 individual credit is supe rior
 to both Any individual can
 go into the mar ket
 as I understand offering substantial
 private security and obtain money
 upon better terms than any
 of the States or the
 Federal Government In that state
 of things it seems to
 me that the ex penditures
 of the Government provided for
 ought to be most seriously
 guarded in making new loans
 I have the assurance of
 the chairman who reported this
 bill in whom I have
 great confidence that under no
 circumstances will any part of
 the Inoney now asked for
 be used for any new
 measures of the nev r
 Administration ifsuch should be devised
 for the purpose of coercion
 force under the idea of
 executing the laws in the
 States that have se ceded
 I shall therefore as at
 present advised I vote for
 the bill provided the amendment
 prevails which will extinguish the
 existing law authoriz incr an
 additional loan Mr PEARCE 1
 will add one word The
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 743 proposing to
 authorize can be negotiated on
 bet will cease and that
 we Shall pass the bill
 I mod ter terms if
 we repeal the act of
 June 22 1860 ify my
 motion aecörding_ky The VICE PRESIDENT
 If that bethe It will
 startle capitalists to see that
 this Govern ment is obliged
 to borrow everything with which
 eral understanding the consideration of
 the pres to support the
 Government for the next year
 arid ent bill mav be
 proceeded With until half past
 one that it is obliged
 to provide now in advance
 for o clock Agreed expenses
 which will not come upon
 us fora year or two
 I think this will stagger
 the faith of cap italists
 and impair the credit of
 the Government and looking at
 it only in that light
 it seems to me that
 it is eminently proper that
 we should reééal the act
 of June 22 1860 But
 I do not think that
 any such amount of loans
 will be necessary un less
 the interest and passion of
 political strife over comc all
 prudence and patriotism Let Congress
 adjust pending political difficulties and
 the full tide of general
 prosperity will sgon be in
 return ing flow For any
 further loan necessary for the
 ordinary operations of Government I
 Will cheer fully vote hereafter
 Mr SIMMONS 1 should prefer
 not to have this amendment
 put in this bill I
 intended after the passage of
 this bill when the other
 bill which has been alluded
 10 reported from the select
 com mittee of which I
 was a member should come
 up to make provision in
 it for the repeal of
 this very law of last
 June I see now a
 disposition to re peal the
 law that authorizes the issuing
 of bonds for the payment
 of the Treasury notes which
 will bc duc next January
 It is proposed now to
 re peal it when we
 pass a bill for the
 redernption of the notes which
 are due from this time
 to June and at tbc
 same time see a disposition
 not to grant anything to
 pay those which will be
 due at twelve per cent
 Interest iii January next Now
 I should likc the chairman
 of the Commit tee on
 Finance to give his opinion
 whether in case the loan
 portion of the bill reported
 from the select committee should
 not be passed he does
 not believe it wilk be
 indispensable to have money from
 some other source to redeem
 those notes or else let
 them remain at an interest
 of twelve per cent There
 is no possibility by any
 means that the new bill
 or the bill we have
 now on the statute book
 as a revcnue measure can
 bo ex pected to bring
 in enough to support tho
 Govern ment under tho present
 aspect of affairs The VICE
 PRESIDENT Will the Senator from
 Rhode Island pause a moment
 The Chair had forgotten the
 special order which was made
 for one o clock and
 to which he must call
 the attention of the Senate
 Mr SIMMONS I hope that
 will be allowed to remain
 a while until we dispose
 of this bill I shall
 not occupy five Ininutes The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair must
 It is subject to the
 call up the special order
 action of the Senate Mr
 PEARCE 1 hope we shall
 postpone the consideration of that
 subject and proceed Wilh amount
 which remains to be negotiated
 under the the present bill
 I make that motion act
 of June 22 1860 is
 nearly fourteen million II Mr
 JOHNSON of Tennessee How does
 the dollars We l ropose
 in this bill a loan
 of I Senator get the
 floor That is The Senator
 from Rhode Island proposes in
 his bill another loan of
 That makes altogether 60 000
 000 and that too without
 reference to the Treasury notes
 issued since the beginning of
 I this session of Congress
 Does the Senator from Maine
 think that the credit of
 the Government of the United
 States will be improved and
 strength cnedb such an exhibit
 as that Mr I ESSENDEN
 1 will answer the Senator
 In an ordinary time I
 do not in n few
 words think the borrowing of
 100 000 000 or the
 at tempt to borrow it
 by the Government of the
 United States would shake its
 credit at all could go
 into market and get it
 without the slight est difficulty
 in the world and on
 favorable terms At the present
 time under the existing statc
 of things I think it
 makes very little difference We
 c an get what we
 want but I suppose we
 shall have to pay heavily
 for it Mr PEARCE This
 is an extraordinary time The
 Government of the United States
 has had to issue its
 Treasury notes at a rate
 of interest more than double
 that which we paid on
 Treasury notes i in 1837
 and certainly the exhibit of
 so great a defi cicncy
 of means as now requires
 these extraordi I nary supplies
 by loans amounting to 60
 000 000 besides the 10
 000 000 of Treasury notes
 issucd within the last two
 months is 10t calculated at
 all Mr PEARCE it for
 granted the dis cussion of
 this bill cannot consume a
 great deal more time and
 that there will be ample
 opportu nity for the Senator
 from Tennessee to make his
 speech after we shall have
 disposed of it Senator desires
 it I will move that
 we proceed I suppose in
 an with this bill until
 two o clock hour s
 time we can dispose of
 it There cannot be a
 large discussion I understand Mr
 JOHNSON that there was a
 special order for one o
 clock on which I was
 entitled to the floor The
 VICE PRESIDENT That is so
 Mr PEARCE 1 hope the
 Senator will allow me to
 make the motion which I
 have suggested that we be
 allowed until two o clock
 to day to continue the
 discussion of this bill Mr
 JOHNSON 1 would rather go
 on Mr PEARCE I hope
 the Senator will con sider
 that ibis very important that
 this bill should be passed
 speedily The old law requires
 thirty days advertisement Here we
 are on the 5th of
 February and we ought 10
 have this loan adver If
 the tised at once if
 it is to be made
 at all Government is to
 be supported the loan ought
 to be advertised promptly and
 ten days is the very
 least time Mr JOHNSON of
 Tennessee 1 will make I
 will say half past one
 to strcngthen the credit of
 the Government of the a
 compromise United States The very
 loan which we arc now
 II Mr PEARCE I hope
 then the discussion Mr SIMMÖNS
 I was saying that the
 choir man of thc Committee
 on Finance can have no
 hope that by any revenue
 bill we may pass we
 can expect to get enough
 money to meet the ex
 enses of the Government in
 the next ten months ow
 I would ask the chairman
 of the commit tee if
 he would have any objection
 to accepting the pledge that
 I will give him that
 if he will waive this
 amendment for the present will
 agree to insert it in
 the other bill when it
 comes up Mr PEARCE 1
 do not hear the Senator
 Mr SIMMONS L say if
 the Senator from Maryland will
 withdraw this amendment to morrow
 when the other bitl comes
 up I will agree to
 renew it on that and
 to provide in that bill
 that the loan bill of
 last year shall be repealed
 and if I cannot convince
 thatSenator that the loan which
 the bill referred to provides
 for is wanted by facts
 and figures I will agree
 to reduce it to his
 satis faction Mr PEARCE I
 have no authority to with
 draw the amendment It is
 by the direction of the
 If the Sen committee that
 I have submitted it ator
 will allow the vote to
 be taken I suppose we
 shall soon dispose of this
 bill and he can modify
 his bill accordingly I do
 not see that it will
 make much difference Mr SIMMONS
 If this is stricken out
 I agree that this loan
 is not wanted and will
 not proba bly be wanted
 if the bill that I
 reported last week be passed
 Unless it is you leave
 yourselves without any provision committee
 would agree to withdraw this
 amend ment I would consent
 to renew it in that
 bill Several SENATORS He has
 not the power Mr SIMMONS
 Very well let us take
 a vote I wish however
 to make one statement on
 it about the amount of
 this loan which I think
 was omitted to be made
 The Secretary of the Treas
 ury estimated that he would
 want about twenty two million
 dollars Since then we have
 passed appropriations which he did
 not include in the estimates
 one of nearly a million
 dollars for the return of
 captured Africans and othet appropri
 ations of that kind not
 estimated for amounting to about
 three million dollars They were
 not included in his es
 imates of the 18th of
 January and that is the
 reason he asks for 25
 000 000 now to cover
 those appropriations that have been
 made or that are pendmg
 in one House of Congress
 or the other over and
 above what he estimated for
 two weeks ago and this
 loan is calculated to sell
 at par and will sell
 at par in my judgment
 Mr HUNTER Does the that
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 asks for 25 000 000
 Mr SIMMONS 1 say that
 this made 25 000 000
 to cover the appropriations which
 have been made since his
 estimates Mr HUNTER The Secretaryhasonly
 asked for a sum between
 twenty one and twenty two
 million He has never asked
 for 25 000 000 without
 knowing that these appropriations would
 be made Mr FESSENDEN He
 may have asked it in
 a communication to Congress but
 the chair man of the
 Finance Committee knows what the
 wishes of the Secretary are
 on the Bubjcct I think
 he has never asked IVIr
 HUNTER it The Senator is
 mistaken Mr FESSENDEN The Senator
 from Vir ginia had better
 appeal to the chairman before
 he makes these statements Mr
 PEARCE The Secretary of the
 Treasury has never asked it
 that I know by any
 formal communication but in his
 letter of the 18th of
 January he shows the necessity
 of it I think and
 I communicated to him on
 Saturday the fact that a
 loan bill for 25 000
 000 had been introduced and
 I received an answer from
 him in which he makes
 no objection at all on
 the contrary his letter of
 the i8th seems to show
 I think that it is
 necessary Mr SIMMONS I was
 merely going to explain how
 these other 3 000 000
 came to be added It
 was not with any view
 Of making a discount of
 3 000 000 on this
 loan as the Senator from
 Vir giniu suggested for the
 Secretary calculates to get THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 5 the
 loan taken at par or
 above par I will not
 I hope this amendment will
 protract the debate be rejected
 because the balance of the
 former loan will be indispensable
 unless another bill passes and
 if that passes I shall
 put an amendment in it
 to repeal this law The
 PRESIDENT The question is on
 the amendment reported from the
 Committee on Finance Mr HUNTER
 I ask for the yeas
 and nays The yeas and
 nays were ordered and taken
 Mr FITCH when his name
 was cailed Upon this question
 I have paired off with

 so called I suppose in

 fear wili be known as
 the war or belligerent Congress

 name was called paired off

 the bill to be read
 a third time and it
 was read the third time
 and passed DEFICIENCY DILL A

 or PEACE FROM VIRGINIA The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair will
 now call up the special
 order being the mcssagc of
 the President of the United
 Slates communicating the rcsolu tions
 ofthe Legislature of Virginia on
 which the Senator from Tennessee
 is entitled to the floor
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee Mr
 President on the 19th of
 December I made a speech
 in the Senate with reference
 to tlrc present crisis which
 I believed my duty to
 my State and to myself
 required In making that speech
 my intention and I think
 I succeeded in It was
 to place my self upon
 the principles of the Constitution
 and the doctrines Inculcated by
 Washington TcftZ son Madison Monroe
 and Jackson Having examined tho
 positions of those distinguished fathers
 of the Republic and compared
 them with the Constitution I
 came to the conclusion that
 they were right and upon
 them I planted myself and
 rnade the spcech to which
 I have referred in vindication
 of the Union and the
 Constitution and against the doctrine
 of nullification or scces sion
 which I look upon as
 agreut political heresy As far
 back as 1833 when i
 was a young man before
 I made my advent into
 public life when the controversy
 arose between the Federal Gov
 ernment and the State of
 South Carolina and it became
 necessary for Andrew Jackson then
 Pres ident of the United
 States to issue his proclama
 tion exhorting that people to
 obey the law and comply
 with the requirements of the
 Constitu tion I planted myself
 upon the principles then announced
 by him which I advocated
 on the 19th of December
 last I belicvcd that the
 positions taken then by General
 Jackson and those who came
 to his support were the
 true doctrines of the Constitution
 and the only doctrines upon
 which this Government could be
 prcserved I have been uniformly
 from that period to the
 present time opposed to the
 doctrine of secession or of
 nulli fication which is rather
 a hermaphrodite but approximates to
 the doctrirn of secession I
 re peat that I then
 viewed it as a heresy
 and as an element which
 if maintained would result in
 the I maintain the destruction
 of this Government game position
 to day I then opposed
 the doc trine of secession
 as a political heresy which
 if sanctioned and sustained as
 a fundamental prin ciple of
 this Government will result in
 its over throw and destruction
 for as we have seen
 al ready a few of
 the States are crumbling and
 falling off I oppose this
 heresy for another reason not
 only as being destructive of
 the existing Govern ment but
 as being destructive of all
 future con federacies that may
 be established in consequence of
 a disruption of the present
 one and I availed myself
 of the former occasion on
 which I spoke to enter
 my protest against it and
 to do some thing to
 extinguish a political heresy that
 ought never to be incorporated
 upon this or any other
 Government which may be subsequently
 estab lished I look upon
 it as the prolific mother
 of political sin as a
 fundamental error as a heresy
 that is intolerable in contrast
 with the existence of the
 Government itself I look upon
 it as being productive of
 anarchy and anarchy is the
 next step to despotism The
 developments that vyre have recently
 seen in carrying this doctrine
 into practice I think admonish
 us that this will be
 the result But Mr President
 since I made that speech
 ou the 19th of December
 I have been the peculiar
 object of attack I have
 been denounced because I happened
 to be the first man
 south of Mason and Dixon
 s line who entered protest
 or made an argument in
 the Senate against this political
 heresy From what i saw
 here on the evening when
 I concluded my speech although
 some may have thought that
 it intimidated and discour aged
 me I was inspired with
 confidence fölt that I had
 struck treason a blow I
 thought then and I know
 now that rncn who were
 engaged in treason felt the
 blows that dealt out on
 that occasion As I have
 been made the peculiar ob
 ject of attack not only
 in the Senate but out
 of the Senate my object
 on this occasion is to
 meet some of these attacks
 and to say some things
 in addition to what I
 then said against this move
 merit Yesterday the last of
 the Senators who repre sent
 what are ca lcd the
 seceding States retired and a
 drama was enacted The piece
 was well performed the actors
 were perfect in their parts
 It was got up to
 order I will not say
 that the mournin auxiliaries had
 been selected in advancc One
 of the retiring Senators in
 justifying the course that his
 State had taken made a
 very spe cious and plausible
 argument in reference to the
 doctrine of secession I allude
 to the Senator from Louisiana
 Mr BENJAMIN He argued that
 the sovereignty of that State
 had never passed to the
 United States that the Government
 held it in trust that
 no conveyance was made that
 sover eignty could not be
 transfi rred that out of
 the gracious pleasure and good
 vill which the First Consul
 of France entcrtained towards the
 Amer ican people the transfer
 was made of the property
 without consideration and the sovereignty
 was in abeyar ce 01
 trust and therefore his State
 had violated no faith and
 had a right to do
 pre cisely what she has
 done With elal oratc prep
 aratibn and seeminT sincerity with
 sweet tones euphonious utterances mellifluous
 voice andgreat earnestness he called
 our attention to the treaty
 to sustain his assumption But
 when we exam ine the
 subject Mr President how do
 the facts stand I like
 fuimess I will not say
 that the Senator in making
 quotations from the treaty and
 commenting upon them was intentionally
 unfair nor can I say
 that the Senator from Louisiana
 with all his acumen his
 habits of industry and his
 great research had not read
 and understood all the provisions
 of the treaty In doing
 so I should reflect upon
 his character it might be
 con strued as a reflection
 upon his want of research
 for which he has such
 a dislinguished reputation The omission
 to read important portions of
 the treaty I will not
 attribute to any intention to
 mis lead I will simply
 call the attention of the
 Senate and the country to
 his remarks and then to
 the treaty The Senator after
 premising went on to say
 P have said that the
 Government assumed to aet as
 trustee or guardian of the
 people of the ceded province
 and covenanted to transfer to
 them the sovereignty thus held
 in trust for their use
 and benefit as soon as
 they were capa ble of
 exercising it What is the
 express language of Lhe treaty
 Hc then read the third
 article of the treaty of
 cession of Louisiana which provides
 merely for their incorporation into
 the United States their protection
 in the enjoyment of their
 religion and thus he commented
 on it And sir as
 if to mark the true
 nature of the cession in
 a manner too significant to
 admit of misconstruction the treaty
 stipulates no price and tbe
 sole consideration for the conveyance
 as stated on its face
 is thé desire to afford
 a strong proof of the
 friendship of France for the
 United States By the terms
 of a separate convention stip
 ulating thc payment of a
 sum of money the precaution
 is again observed of stating
 that the payment is to
 be made not as a
 consideration or a price or
 a condition precedent o the
 cession but it is carefully
 distinguished as being a consequence
 of the cession Now Mr
 President to make this matter
 more intelligible and better understood
 by the country it seems
 to me it would have
 been better to read the
 first article of the treaty
 which commences I he President
 of the United States of
 America and the First Consul
 of the French Republic in
 the name of the French
 people desiring to remove all
 source of misunder standing relative
 to objects of discussion After
 reciting the othertreaties pending between
 France and the United States
 and Spain they go on
 in the first article as
 follows And whereas in pursuance
 of the treaty and particu
 larly the third article the
 French Rcpubiic has an incon
 testable title to the domain
 and to the posssssion of
 the said territory that is
 of Louisiana the First Consul
 ot the French Republic desiring
 to give to the United
 States a strong proof of
 his friendship doth hereby cede
 to the said United States
 in the name of the
 French Republic forever and in
 full sovereignty the said territory
 witli all its rights and
 appurtenances as fully and in
 the same Inanncr as they
 have been acquired by the
 French Repubfic in virtue of
 the above mentioned treaty concluded
 v ith his Catholic Majesty
 Which was referred to in
 the preceding section Now sir
 is there not a clear
 and distinct and ex plicit
 conveyance of sovereignty of property
 of jurisdiction of everything that
 resided in the First Consul
 of Franc e to the
 people of the Uni ted
 States Clearly and distinctly the
 jurisdiction and control of that
 Government were transmitted absolutely by
 the treaty Why not have
 read that part of the
 treaty first That is the
 first article The second article
 is in these words ART
 2 In the cession made
 by the preceding article are
 included the adjacent islands belonging
 to Louisiana all public lots
 and squares vacant lands and
 all public buildings fortifications barracks
 and other edifices which arc
 not private property The archives
 papers and docu ments relative
 to the domain and sovereignty
 of Louisiana and its dependencies
 will be left in the
 possession of the commissaries of
 the Jilted States and copies
 will be afterwards given in
 due forrn to the magistrates
 and muni cipal officers of
 such of the said papers
 and documents as Enay be
 necessary to them We see
 then in the first article
 that property and sovereignty were
 all conveyed together in clear
 and distinct terms If there
 was a power residing anywhere
 to control the people and
 the property of Louisiana it
 was in the First Consul
 of France who conveyed absolutely
 the sover eignty and right
 of property to the people
 of the United States Then
 we come to the third
 article which the Senator read
 yesterday ART 3 The inhabitants
 of the ceded territory shall
 be incorporated in the Union
 of the United Statcs and
 ad mitted as soon as
 possible according to the principles
 of the Federal Constitution to
 thc enjoyrnent of all the
 rights advantages and imrnunities of
 citizens of the United States
 and in the mean time
 they shall he maintained and
 pro tected in the free
 enjoyment of their liberty property
 and the religion which they
 profess There is some order
 in that one thing fits
 the other There is the
 conveyance of sovereignty and property
 There is a minute enumeration
 in the second article and
 in the third article it
 is provided that as soon
 as éossible according to the
 principles of the Federal Constitution
 they shall be incorporated into
 the Union and protected in
 I the enjoyment of the
 religion which they may profess
 YVe see then how the
 thing stands Havenotall these things
 been complied with But by
 way of exonerating Louisiana from
 censure for her recent act
 of attempted secession it is
 urged that when this trcaty
 was made there was no
 consideration but that out of
 the good will that the
 First Consul had tcÅvards the
 American I people the sovereignty
 was given to us in
 trust that we took the
 property in trust that we
 took everything in trust Sir
 the Federal Government took the
 property and the sovereignty with
 it in 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 745 trust for all
 the States But how does
 the matter stand The retiring
 Senator s speech whether it
 was intended or not I
 do not undertake to say
 iG calculated to make the
 false impression that some time
 afterwards perhaps in some other
 treaty remote from that some
 money was paid I by
 the United States to France
 out of the good will
 that this Government had towards
 them And yet sir on
 ghe same day the 30th
 of April 1803 on which
 the other treaty was made
 and signed the followino convention
 between the United I States
 of America and the French
 Republic was made The President
 of the United States of
 Alnerlca and the First Consul
 of the French Republic in
 the nmne of the French
 people ih consequence of the
 treaty of cession of Louisiana
 which has been signed this
 day wishing to reg ulatc
 definitely everything which has relation
 to the said cession This
 be it observed was made
 on the same day and
 was perhaps written out before
 the other treaty was signed
 And what does the first
 article say It says expressly
 ART l Ilhe Government of
 the United States engages to
 pay to the French Government
 in the manner speéified in
 the f ollowing article the
 sum of sixty million frafics
 independent of the sum which
 shall be fixed by another
 convention for the payment of
 debts due by France to
 the citizens of the United
 States What becomes of tie
 specious plea what be comes
 of the excuse tendered here
 that wo took it simply
 in trust and that no
 consideralion was paid Turn over
 to the American State Papers
 look at Mr Livingston s
 letters upon which these treaties
 were predicated read his correspondence
 with Mr Madison who v
 ras Secretary of State and
 you wilt find that France
 demanded the sum of independent
 of what they owed the
 citizens of the United States
 bit after long nego tiations
 the First Consul of the
 French concluded to take and
 tho first twyo articles of
 the treaty which have read
 are based upon the paid
 by this Government in consid
 eration of the sovereignty and
 territory all of which was
 to be held in trust
 by the United States for
 at the States This was
 given to us out of
 the pure good will that
 Napoleon at that time had
 towards the Uni ted States
 Sir he had great hate
 for Great Brit ain and
 by the promptings of that
 hate he was disposed to
 cede this territory to some
 other Power Hc feared that
 Great Britain whose Navy was
 superior to his own would
 take it He desired to
 obtain money to carry on
 his wars and sustain his
 Government These considerations and not
 love or partiality or friendship
 for the Uni ted States
 led him tomakethecession Then what
 becomes of the Senator s
 special pleading From the Senator
 s remarks it may have
 been concluded that we got
 it as a gratuity But
 after examining the State Papers
 and the correspondence and look
 ino at the tedious and
 laborcd negotiation previous to the
 rnaking of the treaty it
 is clear tl at at
 the timc the first treaty
 was made on the very
 same day the consideration was
 fixed and yet the Sen
 ators tell us that at
 some other time a treaty
 was made not referring to
 any amount ofmoncy agreed to
 be paid at this particular
 time and that there fore
 they are excusable and justifiable
 in going out of the
 Confederacy of these States After
 all these things were enumerated
 an ap eal was made
 It was a very affecting
 scene ouisiana was gone and
 what was the reason Great
 oppression and great wrong Sho
 could not get hm rights
 in the Union and consequently
 she has sought them out
 of it What are the
 wrongs of Lou isiana What
 v ras the cause for
 all the svm pathy expressed
 on the one hand and
 the tbars shed on the
 other Louisiana was substantially presented
 to the country in a
 most pathetic and sympathetic attitude
 Her wrongs were without their
 enormity was almost without esti
 number mate they could scarcely
 be fathomed by human sympathy
 It was not unlike the
 oration of Mark Antony over
 the dead body of Cæsar
 Weeping I friends grouped picturesquely
 in the foreground the bloody
 robe the ghastly wounds v
 rere con jured to the
 imagination and who was there
 that If you did not
 expect to hear the exclamation
 have tears prepare to shed
 them now Laugh ter J
 Sir what are the great
 wrongs that have been inflicted
 upon Louisiana Prior to 1803
 Louis iana was transferred from
 Spain to France and from
 Franco back to Spain both
 property and sovereignty almost with
 the same facility as a
 chattel from one person to
 another On the 30th of
 April 1803 when this treaty
 was made W hat was
 the condibion of Louisiana It
 was then a province of
 the First Consul of France
 subject to be disposed of
 at his discretion The United
 States did what Came forward
 and paid to the First
 Consul of Frande for the
 terri tory The treaty was
 made the territory was transferred
 and in 1806 in express
 domp iance with the treaty
 as soon as practicable according
 to the terms of the
 Federal Constitution Louis iana was
 admitted into the Union as
 a State We bought her
 we paid for her we
 adrnitted her into the Union
 upon terms of equality with
 the other States Was there
 any oppression any great wrong
 any great grievance in that
 In 1815 war having been
 declared in 1812 Louisiana was
 attacked the city of Nev
 Orleans was about to be
 sacked and laid prostrate in
 the dust beauty and booty
 were the watchwords She was
 oppressed then was she not
 Kentucky your own gallant State
 sir and thank God she
 is standing erect now and
 Tennessee which as I honestly
 believe will cver stand by
 her side in this struggle
 for the Constitu lion and
 the Union in conjunction with
 the other States met Pack
 enham and his myrmidons upon
 the plains of New Orleans
 and there dealt out death
 and desolation to her invading
 foe What soil did we
 invade What city did we
 propose to sac k Whose
 prop crty did we propose
 to destroy Was not Lou
 isiana there gallantly nobly bravely
 and patri otically defended by
 the people of the United
 States from the inroads and
 from the sacking of a
 British foe Is that defense
 one of her oppres sions
 Is that one of the
 great wrongs that have been
 inflicted upon Louisiana What more
 has been done by this
 Govern ment How much protection
 has she received upon her
 sugar In order to give
 that protection the poorest man
 throughout the United States is
 taxed for every spoonful that
 he uses to sweeten his
 coffee How many millions under
 the oper ation ofa potection
 upon sugar have been con
 tributed to the wealth and
 prosperity of Louis iana since
 she has been in this
 Confederacy Estimate them Is this
 anothci of her wrongs Is
 this another of her grievances
 Is this another of the
 oppressions that the United States
 have in flicted upon Louisiana
 Sum them all up and
 what are the wrongs what
 the grievances which justify Louisiana
 in taking leave of the
 United States We have de
 fended her soil and her
 citizens we havo paid the
 price asked for her by
 the French Government she has
 been protected in the production
 of her sugar and in
 the enjoyment of every right
 that a sovereign State could
 ask at the hands of
 the Federal Government And how
 has she treated the United
 States What is her position
 Upon her own volition without
 consultation with her sister States
 without even consulting with Ten
 nessee and Kentucky who defended
 her when she was in
 peril she proposes to secede
 from the Union She does
 more in violatiop of tho
 Con stitution of the United
 States in déspite of the
 plighted faith that exists between
 all the States she takes
 our arsenals our forts our
 custom house our mint with
 about a million dollars Gracious
 God to what are we
 coming Is it thus that
 the Constitution of the United
 States is to be violated
 Forts arsenals custom houses and
 property belonging to all the
 people of all the States
 have been ruthlessly seized and
 their undisturbed possession is the
 sum total of the great
 w rongs that have been
 inflicted upon Loui siana by
 the United States Mr President
 when I look at the
 conduct of some of the
 States I am reminded of
 the fable of King Log
 and the frogs They got
 tired of the log that
 lay in their midst upon
 which they could bask in
 the sun or from w
 hich they could dive to
 the depth beneath without interference
 And these seceding States have
 got tired of the Fed
 eral Government which has been
 so profitable to them and
 loathe the blessings which they
 enjoy Seemingly its inability to
 take care of It seems
 itselt created their opposition to
 it the inability of the
 United States to defend and
 take care of its own
 property has been an invita
 tion to them to take
 possession of it nnd like
 thc frogs they seek n
 substitute for their log They
 prayed to Jupiter the supreme
 deity to I send them
 another king and he answered
 their prayer by sending them
 a stork Wbo soon de
 voured his subject frogs There
 are too in the seceding
 States South Carolina has her
 stork king and so has
 Louisiana the heavy appropriations they
 are making tö maintain armies
 and in all their preparations
 for war for which I
 there is no cause they
 will find they have brought
 down storks upon them that
 will devour them What do
 we find Mr President since
 this movement commenced In aboutforty
 six days since the first
 State went out until the
 last one dis appeared the
 26th of January they have
 taken from the United States
 this harmless old ruler one
 thousand and ninety two guns
 any resistance amounting to 6
 513 000 They are very
 much alarmed at the pöwer
 of this Govern ment Thus
 the Government oppresses them thus
 this Government oppresses Louisiana per
 tinaciously persisting in allowing those
 States to take all t
 he guns all the forts
 alf the arsenals a II
 the dock yards all the
 custom houses and all the
 mints Thus they are so
 cruelly oppressed Is Is it
 not the and it not
 a farce the greatest folly
 that was ever consummated since
 man was spoken into existence
 But these are the grievances
 of Louisiana I shall say
 not hing against Louisiana Tennessee
 and Kentucky have given den
 onstrations most noticeable that when
 she needed friends when she
 needed aid they were at
 her bidding But in the
 acquisition of Louisiana there was
 another very importantacquisition We acquired
 the exclusive and entire control
 of the navigation of the
 Mississippi river We find that
 Louisiana in her ordinance of
 secession makes the negative I
 declaration that she has the
 control of the navica tion
 of that great stream by
 stating that the navi gation
 of the river shall be
 free to those States that
 remain on friendly terms with
 her with the proviso thatmoderate
 contributionsareto be levied to defray
 such expenses as they may
 deem expe dient from time
 to time That is the
 substance of it Sir look
 at the facts All the
 States through their Federal Government
 treated for Louisiana The treaty
 was made All the States
 by the Con tribution of
 their money paid for Louisiana
 and the navi ation of
 the Mississippi river Where and
 from what source does Louisiana
 now derive the power or
 the authority to secede from
 this Union and set up
 exclusive control of the naviga
 tion ofthat great stream which
 is owned by all the
 States which was paid for
 by the money of all
 the States and upon whose
 borders the blood of many
 citizens of the States has
 been shed This is one
 of the the oppressed States
 Mr President is it not
 apparent that these grievances and
 oppressions are mere pre tenses
 A large portion of the
 South and that portion of
 it I am willing to
 stand by to the very
 last extremity believe that aggressions
 have been made upon them
 by the other States in
 reference to tbc institution of
 slavery A large portion of
 the South believe that something
 oughtto be done in the
 shape of what has been
 offered by the dis tinguishcd
 Senator from Kentucky or something
 very similar They think and
 fccl that that ought to
 be done But Sir there
 is another portion who do
 not cate for those propositions
 to brilP about reconciliation but
 who on the contrary have
 been afraid and alarmed that
 something would be done to
 reconcile and satisfy the public
 mind be fore this diabolical
 work of secession could be
 consummated Yes sir they have
 been afraid and the occasion
 has been used to justify
 and to carry out a
 doctrine into practice which is
 not only the destruction of
 this Government but I which
 will be thc destruction of
 all other govern ments that
 may be ori inated embracing
 the same principle Why not
 then meet it like T1en
 We know there is a
 portion of the South who
 are I for secession who
 are for breaking up this
 Gov crnment without regard to
 slavery or anything else as
 I shall show before I
 have done The Senator from
 Louisiana Mr BENJAMIN in a
 speech that he made some
 days since took oc casion
 allude to some authority that
 I had iåtro duced from
 General Washinøton the first Presi
 dent who cxccuted the laws
 of the United States acrainst
 armed resistance and it occurred
 to him that by way
 of giving his argument force
 it was necessary to remark
 that I was not a
 lawyer and that therefore I
 had not examined the subject
 with that minuteness and with
 that care and familiarity that
 I should have done and
 hence that I had 746
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 5
 introduced authority which had no
 application to the question under
 consideration The proof that he
 gave to show that I
 had not examined the sub
 ject carefully was contained in
 the very extract that I
 had quoted and which he
 said declared that General Washington
 Iliad been informed by the
 marshal that he could not
 exec ute the laws and
 from the fact of the
 marshal being incapable to execute
 them General Washington was called
 upon to employ the means
 under the Constitution and the
 laws which were necessary to
 their en forcement It may
 have been necessary for the
 distinguished Senator to inform the
 Senate and the country that
 I was not a lawycr
 but it was not necessary
 to inform anybody that read
 his speech and that had
 the slightest information or sagacity
 that he was a lawyer
 and that he was making
 a lawyer s speech upon
 the case bcfore him not
 an argument upon the great
 principles of the Government The
 speech was a complete lawyer
 s speech and the authorities
 were summed up simply to
 make out the case on
 his side and he left
 out all those that would
 disprove his position It required
 no very great acumen or
 sagacity to discover that he
 was a lawyer and on
 that occa Bion l think
 he showed himself to be
 a lawyer in the proper
 sense of the term for
 he made a law yer
 s argument just suiting the
 case Icaving out and not
 noticing all authorities on the
 other side That Senator yesterday
 soemed to be very seri
 ous in regard to the
 practical operation of the doctrine
 of secession felt sorry myself
 some what I am always
 reluctant to part with a
 gen tleman with whom I
 have been associated and nothing
 had transpired to disturb between
 us those courteous relations which
 should always exist be tween
 persons associated on this floor
 I thought thc scene was
 pretty well got up and
 was acted out admirably The
 plot was cxecutcd to thc
 very letter You would have
 thought that his people in
 Louisiana were borne down and
 seri ously oppressed by remaining
 in this Union of States
 Now I have an extract
 before me from a speech
 delivered by that gentleman since
 the election of Abraham Lincoln
 while the distin guished Senator
 was on the western slope
 of the Rocky Mountains at
 the city of San Francisco
 He was calked upon to
 make an address and I
 will read an extract from
 it which I find in
 the N ew York Times
 the editors of which paper
 said they had the speech
 before them and I havecon
 sulted a gentleman here who
 was in California at the
 time and he tells me
 that the report is correct
 In that speech after thc
 Senator hdd spoken some time
 with his accustomed eloquence he
 uttered this language Tbosc who
 prate of and strive to
 dissolve this glorious Confederacy of
 States are likc those silky
 sava es who let fly
 their arrows at the sun
 in the vain hope of
 piercing it And still tl
 le still rolls on unheeding
 in its ctcrnal path way
 shcddlng light and animation upon
 all the world the Senator
 Even after Lincoh was elected
 in the from Louisiana is
 reported to have said State
 of Califbrnia and in the
 city of San Fran Cisco
 that this great Union could
 not be destroyed Those great
 and intolerable oppressions of which
 we have since heard from
 him did not seem to
 be flitting across his vision
 and playing upon his mind
 with that vividness and clearness
 which were displayed herc yesterday
 He said in Cal ifornia
 that this great Union would
 go on in its course
 notwithstanding the puny efforts of
 the siily savages that were
 letting fly their arrows with
 the rospect of piercing it
 What has changed the Senator
 s mii d on coming
 from that side of the
 continent to this What light
 has broken in upon him
 Has he been struck on
 his way like Paul when
 he was journeying from Tarsus
 to Damascus Has some supernatural
 powcr dis closed to him
 that his State and his
 people will be ruined if
 they remain in the Union
 Where do we find the
 distinguished Senator only at the
 last session On the 22d
 of May last when he
 made his celebrated reply to
 the Senator from Illi nois
 Mr DOUGLAS the Senator from
 Louisi ana alluding to the
 contest for the Senate be
 tween I v lr Lincoln
 and Mr DOIjGLAS said In
 that contest the two candidates
 for the Senate of the
 United States in the State
 of Illinois went before their
 I hey agreed to discuss
 the issues they put ques
 tions to cach other for
 answer and I must say
 here for must be just
 to all that I have
 been surprised in the exaltiinati0R
 that I made again within
 the last few days of
 this discussion between Mr Lincoln
 and Mr DOUGLAS than I
 had supposed him to be
 There wag no dodging on
 H ere his part Mr
 DOUGLRs started with his questions
 they are with Mr Lincoln
 s answers The imprcssion evidently
 made on the public mind
 then before the presidential election
 was that Lincoln the rank
 Abolitionist now was more conservative
 than Mr DOUGLAS and he
 said fur ther after reading
 the questions put by Mr
 Lin coln and his answers
 to them it Is impossible
 Mr President however we may
 differ in opinion with the
 man not to admire the
 perfect candor and frankness Witb
 which the answers were given
 no equivocation no evasion Since
 that speech was made since
 the Senator has traversed from
 California to this point the
 grievances the oppressions of Louisiana
 have become so great that
 she is justified in going
 out of the Union taking
 into her possession the cus
 tom house the mint the
 navigation of the Mis sissippi
 river the forts and arsenals
 Where are we Oh consistency
 thou art a jewel much
 to be admired but rarely
 to be found 1 Mr
 Prcsideöt I never do things
 by halves am arrainst this
 doctrine entirely I commenced making
 war upon it a war
 for the Constitution and the
 Union and I intend to
 sink or swim upon it
 Applause in the galleries In
 the remarks that I made
 on the 19th of December
 I discussed at some length
 the alleged right of secession
 I introduced au repudiated thc
 whole doctrine thorities to show
 its unsoundness and made de
 ductions from those authorities which
 have not been answered to
 this day but by innuendo
 arid indirection without reference to
 the person who used the
 authorities attempts have been made
 to answer the speech Let
 those who can answer the
 speech answer the authorities answer
 the conclusions which have been
 deduced from them I was
 more than gratified sh ortly
 afterwards when one of the
 distinguished Senators from Virginia which
 it was apparent to all
 bad been studied closely which
 had been digested thoroughly which
 in the language of another
 had been conned and set
 down in a note book
 and got by note not
 only the sentences const ruc
 ted but the lan guago
 measured In the plan which
 he proposed as one upon
 which the Government can bc
 con tinucd and administered in
 his judgrnent he brought his
 mind seemingly irresistibly to the
 conclusion that this doctrine of
 secession was a heresy What
 does he say in that
 able that methodical that well
 digested speech He gocs over
 the whole ground He has
 been reasonincr on it he
 has been examining the principle
 of seces sion he has
 gone to the conclusion to
 which it leads and he
 is seemingly involuntarily but irre
 sistibly forced to admit that
 it will not do to
 ac knowledge this doctrine of
 secession for he says have
 presented this scheme Mr President
 as one which in opinion
 would adjust the differences between
 the two social systell s
 and which would protect cach
 from the assault of the
 other It this werc done
 so that we were nr
 ide mutually saft I for
 onc would be willing to
 recu late the right of
 sccession which I hold to
 bc a right not givcn
 in tiic Constitution but resulting
 from the nature of the
 cmnpact I would provide that
 bctOre a State seceded it
 shoul l su nmon a
 convention of the States in
 the section to whicll it
 belonged and submit to them
 a statcmcnt of its gricvauees
 and wrongs Should a Inajority
 of the States in Å
 uch a convention decide the
 colnplaint to be well founded
 then thc State ought to
 bc pcrrnitted to seeede in
 peace For whenever majority of
 States in an entire to
 find that on several points
 Mr Lincoln is a far
 more conservative man unless he
 has since changed his opinion
 section shall Ice arc that
 good cause for secession exists
 then who can dispute that
 it ought to take place
 Should they say however that
 uo good cause existed then
 the moral force of such
 a decision on the part
 of confederates of those who
 are bound to the complaining
 State by iden ticak and
 homoreneous interests would prevent it
 from prosecuting the claim any
 further Sir I quoted the
 Old Dominion extensively be I
 took the foundat ion of
 this doctrinc and forc traced
 it along step by step
 and showed that there x
 vas no such notion tolerated
 by the fathers of tbc
 Republic as the right of
 secession Now who comes up
 to my relhef When the
 States are se ceding when
 they are goine off the
 distinguished Senator from Virginia says
 in so many words that
 he admits the error and
 the force of the prin
 ciplc that a State ought
 not to be permitted to
 go out of the Confederacy
 without the consent of the
 remaining members He says h01
 vever that the right to
 secede results from the nature
 of the com pact Sir
 I have read Mr Jefferson
 and I am as much
 inclincd to rely on the
 former distin guished men of
 the State of Virginia as
 I am on In the
 old Articles of Confederat ion
 the latter when the revenue
 required for the support of
 the Federal Government was apportioned
 among the States and each
 State had to raisc its
 portion the great diffculty was
 that there was no means
 by which the States could
 be compelled to contribote their
 amount there was no means
 of forcing the State to
 compliance and yet Mr Jefferson
 in view of that very
 difficulty said in 1786 It
 has been often said that
 the decisions of Congress are
 ilnpotent because the Confederation provides
 no com pulsory power But
 when two or more nations
 enter into compact it is
 not usual for them to
 say what shall be done
 to the party who infringes
 it Decency forbids this and
 it is as unnecessary as
 indecent because the right of
 com pulsion naturally results to
 the party injured by the
 breach When any one State
 in the American Union refuses
 obe dience to the Contöderation
 by which they have bound
 themselves the rest have a
 natural right to compel them
 to obedience The Senator from
 Virginia says a State has
 the right to secede from
 tho Union and that it
 is a right resulting from
 the nature of the compact
 but Mr Jefferson said that
 even under the old Articles
 of Confederation no State had
 a right to refuse obedience
 to the Confederacy and that
 there was a right to
 enforce its compliance Congress wotlld
 probably exercise long patience before
 they would rceur to tin
 cc but if the case
 ultimately re quired it they
 would use that recurrence Should
 this case ever arise they
 will probably coerce by a
 naval force as being more
 easy less dangerons to kibcrty
 and lcss likely to produce
 much Works yol 9 P
 291 When was this I
 have stated that it was
 un der the old Articles
 of Confederation when there was
 no power to compel a
 State even to contrib ute
 her proportion of the revenues
 but in that view of
 the case Mr Jefferson said
 that the in jured party
 had a right to enforce
 compliance with the compact from
 the offending State and that
 this was a right deducible
 from the laws of nature
 The present Constitution was aftervt
 ards formed and to avoid
 this diffculty in raising revenue
 the imposts and excises and
 the Constitution cre aced a
 dircct relation between the citizen
 and the Federal Government in
 that matter and to that
 extent that rclation is just
 as direct and complete between
 the Federal Government and the
 citizen as is the relation
 between the State and the
 citi zen in other matters
 Hence wc find that by
 an amendment to t he
 Constitution of the United States
 the citizen cannot even make
 a State a party to
 a suit and bring her
 into the Federal courts They
 wanted to avoid the difficulty
 of coercing a State and
 the Constitution conferred on the
 Federal Government the power to
 operate directly upon the citizen
 instead of operating on the
 States It being the right
 of the Government to enforce
 obedience from the c itizen
 in those mat ters of
 which it has jurisdiction the
 question comes up as to
 the exercise of this right
 It may It must depend
 upon not al vays be
 expedient discretion as was eloquently
 said by the Senator from
 Kentucky Mr CRITTENDEN on one
 occa sion It is a
 matter of discretion even as
 Mr Jefferson haid it down
 before this provision ex isted
 in the Constitution before the
 Government had power to collect
 its revenue as it now
 has I know that when
 on a former occasion I
 undertook to show as I
 thoughtl did show clearly and
 dis tinctly the difference betwecn
 the existence and the exercise
 ofåhis power words were put
 into my mouth that I
 did not utter and positions
 an swered which I had
 never assumed It was said
 that I took the bold
 ground of coercing a State
 I expressly disclaimed it I
 stated in my speech that
 by the Coostitution we could
 not puta State into court
 but I said there were
 certain relations created by the
 Constitution bctwcen the Federal Government
 and the citizen and that
 we could enforce those laws
 against the citizen I took
 up the fugitive slave law
 I took up the revenue
 law I took up the
 judicial system I took up
 the post omce system and
 I might have taken up
 the power to coin money
 and to punish counterfeiters or
 the power to pass laws
 to punish mail robbers showed
 that under these we had
 power not to punish a
 State but to punish individuals
 vio lators of the law
 Who will deny it who
 can deny it that acknowledges
 the existence of the Government
 This point I think was
 settled in the decision of
 the Supreme Court in the
 case of Ableman vs Booth
 When the decision of the
 Supreme Court is in our
 favor wo are very much
 for it but sometimes we
 are not so well reconciled
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBn 747
 to it when it is
 against us In that case
 the court decided But as
 we have already said questions
 of this kind must always
 depend upon the Constitution and
 laws of the United States
 and not of a State
 The Constitution was not iörmed
 merely to guard the States
 against danger from foreign nations
 but mainly to secure union
 and harmony at home for
 if this object could be
 obtained there would be but
 little danger from abroad and
 to accomplish this pur pose
 it was toll by the
 statesmen who framed the Constitu
 tion and by the people
 who adopted it that it
 was neces sary that many
 of the richts of sovereignty
 which the States then possessed
 should biB ceded to tnc
 General Government and that in
 the sphere of action assigned
 to it it should be
 suprerne and strong enough to
 execute its own laws by
 its own tribunals without interruption
 from a State or from
 State authorities And it was
 evident that anything short of
 this would be inadequate to
 the Inain objects for which
 the Govermnent was established and
 that local interests local passions
 or prejudices incited and iöstered
 by indi viduals for sinister
 purposes would lead to acts
 of aggres Sion and injustice
 by one State upon the
 rights of another which would
 ultimately terminate in violence and
 force unless there was a
 common arbiter between them anned
 with power enough to protect
 and guard the rights of
 by appropriate laws to be
 carried into execution peacefully by
 its judicial tribunalsP Howard s
 Supreme Court Re ports vol
 21 p 516 When the
 fugitive slave law was executed
 in the city of Boston
 by the aid of military
 force was that understood to
 be coercing a State or
 was law upon those who
 it was assumed had violated
 it In this same decision
 the Supremo Court de clare
 that the fugitive slave law
 in all its details is
 constitutional and therefore should be
 enforced Who is prepared to
 say that the decision of
 the court shall not be
 carried out Who is prepared
 to say that the fugitive
 slave law shall not be
 en forced Do you coerce
 a State when you simply
 If one man robs the
 mail and enforce the law
 you seek to arrest him
 and he resists and you
 employ force do you call
 that coercion If aman countcrfcits
 your coin and is arrested
 and con victed and punishment
 is resisted cannot you execute
 the law It is true
 thatsometimes so many may become
 infected with disobedience outrages and
 violations of law may be
 participated in by so many
 that they get beyond the
 control of the ordinary operations
 of law the disaffection may
 swell to such proportions as
 to be loo great for
 the Government to control and
 then it becomes a matter
 of discretion nota matter of
 constitutional In this connection I
 desire to introduce an au
 thority from Virginia for I
 do delight in author ity
 from the Old Dominion and
 from the indica tions that
 are now visible although it
 is possible that before the
 setting of the sun I
 may receive news that will
 convert my present hopes and
 my present exhilarated feelings into
 despair she is going to
 make a stand for the
 Union and the Con stitution
 I delight in calling upon
 her for author icy In
 1814 the doctrine that I
 am trying to inculcate here
 to day was inculcated from
 Vir ginia and I ask
 my friend from California to
 read an extract which I
 have from the Richmond En
 quire of the 1st of
 November 1814 Mr LATHAM read
 as follows TILE TRCE QrnsT10N
 The Unionisin danger Turn to
 the convention of Hartford and
 learn to tremble at the
 madness of its authors How
 far will those madmen ad
 vancc Though they may conceal
 from you the project of
 disunion though a fey v
 of them may have even
 concealed it from t hemselves
 yet who will pretend to
 set bounds to tile rage
 of disaffection One false step
 after another may lead them
 to resistance to the laws
 to a treasonable neu trality
 to a war a ainst
 the Government of the United
 In truth the first act
 of resistance to the law
 is States treason to the
 IJnited States Are you ready
 for this state of things
 Will you support the men
 who would plunge you into
 this ruin No Inan no
 association of men no State
 or setof States has a
 right to withdraw it se
 f from this Union of
 its own accord The same
 power which knit us together
 can only I he same
 formality which forged the linkS
 of the unknit Union is
 ncccssary to dissolve it The
 majorityof States which form the
 Union must consent to the
 withdrawal of any one branc
 l of it Until that
 consent has been obtained any
 attempt to dissolve the Union
 or obstruct the efficacy of
 its constitutional laws is treason
 treason to all intents and
 purposes Any other doctrine such
 as that which has been
 lately held forth by the
 Federal Rcpubtican that any one
 Stat e mav withdraw itse
 f from thc Union is
 an abominable heresy which strips
 its author of every possible
 preten Sion to the name
 or character ofa Federalist wc
 call therefore upon the Government
 of tbe t inion and
 to exert its energies when
 the season silall deinand it
 seize the first traitor who
 shall spring out ot the
 hotbed of the convention of
 Hartford This illustrious Union which
 has been cemented by the
 blood of our forefathers the
 pride of America and the
 wonder of the world must
 not bc tamely sacrificed to
 the heated brains or the
 aspirin hearts of a few
 malcontents The Union must be
 saved when any one shall
 dare to assail it Countrymen
 of the East we call
 upon you to keep a
 vigilant eye upon those wretched
 men who would plunge us
 into civil war and irretrievable
 disgrace Whatever be the telnporary
 calamiLies which may assail us
 let us swear upon the
 altar of our country to
 SAVE THE UN10N Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee Mr Presi I
 dent I subscribe most heartily
 to the sentiment presented by
 the Richmond Enquirer of Novem
 ber l 1814 Then it
 was declared by that high
 authority that the Union was
 to be saved that those
 persons who were putting themselves
 in op position to the
 law were traitors and that
 their treason should be punished
 as such Now sir what
 is treason fl he Constitution
 of the United States defines
 it and narrows it down
 to a very small compass
 The Constitution declares that treason
 acrainst the United States shall
 consist only in levying war
 against them or in adhering
 to their enemies Oiving them
 aid and comfort Who are
 levying war upon the United
 States Who are adhering to
 the enemies of the U
 l ited States giving thern
 aid and comfort Does it
 re quire a man to
 take the lantern of Diogenes
 and make a diligent search
 to find those who have
 been encraged in levying war
 acainst the United States Will
 it require any very great
 research or obser vation to
 discover those who have been
 adherinc to those who were
 making war against the Uni
 ted States and giving them
 aid and comfort If there
 are any such in the
 United Statcs they ought to
 be punished according to law
 and the Consti tution Applause
 in the galleries which was
 suppressed by the Presiding Offcer
 Mr Frrcll in the chair
 Mr Ritchie speaking for the
 Old Dorninion used language that
 was unmistakable that treason should
 be punished springing out of
 the hotbed of thc I
 lartford convention It was all
 right to talk about treason
 then it x vas all
 right to punish traitors in
 that direction For mykelf I
 care not whether treason be
 committed north or south he
 that is guilty of treason
 is entitled to a traitor
 s fate But I v
 lr President when we come
 to examine the views of
 some of those who have
 been engaged in this work
 we find that the foundation
 of their desire to break
 up this Government dates beyond
 and goes very far back
 of any recent zwitation of
 the slavery question I herc
 are some mcn who want
 to break up this Government
 anyhow who want a separation
 of the IJnion Thore are
 some who have got tired
 of a government of the
 people rake the State of
 South They fear the people
 Carolina Although she has had
 Senators on this floor who
 have acted a portion of
 the time with the Democratic
 party and sornctimes with no
 party there is in that
 State an ancient anda fixed
 opposition to a government by
 the people They have an
 early prejudice acruinst this thing
 called dernocracy a government of
 the people They entertained the
 idea of secession at a
 very early day it is
 no new thing with them
 it has notarisen out of
 the slavery question and its
 recent agitation Even to this
 good day the people the
 freemen of South Carolina have
 never been permitted to vote
 for President and Vice President
 of the Uni ted States
 They have never enjoyed that
 great luxury of freemen of
 having a voice in the
 selec tion of their Chief
 Magistrate I have before mc
 an old volume In the
 front ispicce I find a
 picture of William Moultrie Esq
 late Governor of South Carolina
 and major 491 and 432
 of This is to bé
 fbund on Moultrie s Memoirs
 Ont é attor page he
 says When the question was
 carried for giving up the
 town upon a neutrality I
 will not say who was
 I hr the question but
 this I well remember that
 Mr John Edwards one of
 the Privy Council a worthy
 citizen and a very reSpectable
 merchant of Charlestown was so
 affected as to weep and
 said What are we to
 give up the town at
 last He says that he
 endeavored to get a message
 carried from the Governor and
 Council to General Provost Those
 to whom he applied begged
 to be excused but finally
 he pressed them into a
 compliance The message was To
 propose a neutrality during the
 war between Great Britain and
 America and the question whether
 the State shall belong to
 Great Britain or remain one
 of the United States be
 determined by the treaty of
 peace between those two Powers
 The Governor who was a
 major general pro posed a
 neutrality and proposed to withdraw
 from the Confederacy to desist
 from resistance to Great Britain
 and leave it to the
 two Powers in making a
 treaty to say whether they
 should remain a cölony of
 Great Britain or be one
 of the United States At
 this early day South Carolina
 was willing to go back
 and be subjected to the
 Crown of Great Britain under
 King George Ill Mr WIGFALL
 I ask the Senator merely
 to permit me to correct
 him as to a fact
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee Ido
 not yield the floor Mr

 you will not fall into
 so many errors 1781 is
 the time I know it
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee I
 will just refer to the
 document Mr WIGFALL While the

 that I made the correction
 out of kindness t o
 hirm Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee

 correct ideas and selecting my
 own sources of information Laughter
 Mr WIGFALL The year 1781
 was the time the Articles
 of Confederation w ere ratified
 You were simply mistaken that
 is all Mr JOHNSON of
 Tennessee I do not accept
 the correction nor have I
 very much respect for the
 motive that prompted it Let
 that be as it may
 however it does not change
 the great historical fact that
 at that day instead of
 holding out with the other
 colonies who were members of
 the Con federacy and engaged
 in the war South Carölina
 was willing to enter into
 an agreement of neu trality
 and go back under the
 protection of King f George

 I cannot possibly agree to

 if you I will send

 General PROVOST mitted to the
 character and condition of British

 tendering to your Excellenéies our
 warmest congratulations on the restoration
 of this capital and province
 to their political connection with
 the Crown and Government of
 Great Britain an event which
 will add luster to yoar
 Excellencies characters and we trust
 en title you to the
 xnost distinguishing mark of thc
 royal favor Although t he
 right of taxing America in
 Parliament excited considerable ferment in
 the minds of the people
 of his province yet it
 may with areligious adherence to
 truth be 748 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 5 amqmed that
 they did noc entertain the
 most distant thought Of dissolving
 the union that so happny
 subsisted between them and theirparent
 coUntry and when in the
 progress of that fatal controversy
 the doctrine of independency which
 originated in the more northern
 colonies made its appear ance
 among us our nature revolted
 at the idea and we
 look back with the most
 pain ful regret on those
 convulsions that gave existence to
 a power of subverting a
 constitution for which we always
 had and ever shall retain
 the most pro found veneration
 and substituting in its stead
 a rank de moemey which
 however carefully digeStd in theory
 on beihg reduced into practice
 has exhibited a system of
 ty ranhic domination only to
 be found among the uncivilized
 part of mankind or in
 the history of the dark
 and barbarous ages of antiquity
 We sincerely lament that after
 the repeal of those stat
 utes which gave rise to
 the troubles in America the
 over tureS made by hiS
 Majesty s Commissioners from time
 to tinie were not regarded
 by our late rulers To
 tbis fatal inattention are to
 be attributed those calamities which
 have inyolved our country in
 a state of misery and
 ruin from Which however we
 trust it will soon ennerge
 by the wisdom and clemency
 of his Majesty s auspicious
 Govern ment and the influences
 of prudential laws adapted to
 the n ature of the
 evils wc labor under aud
 that the people will be
 restored to those privileges in
 the enjoynent whereof Anirnated with
 these hopes we entreat your
 Excellen cics interposition in assuring
 his Majesty that we shall

 It will be seen from
 these two documents what the
 early notions of the people
 Of South Carolina were There
 never was and I doubt
 very much whether with a
 large portion of them there
 ever will be any ideas
 of the people governing themselves
 I hcy hadi a great
 aversion at that day to
 the idea of a government
 of the people It was
 repudiated and in the document
 which has just been read
 signed by two h undred
 and tcn citizens of Chnrlcs
 ton they proposed to pass
 back under the British Government
 This carries out the previous
 prop osition to remain with
 Great Britain by treaty stipulation
 and not go through the
 revolutionary struggle with the colonies
 with vhorn they had förrnéd
 a confederation Again in 1833
 under the pretense of resist
 ance to the operation ot
 our revenue system and to
 a protective tariff thcy wanted
 to break up the Government
 They werc overrulcd then Their
 pride was wounded by that
 failure and their dc I
 termination was increascd whenever it
 was in their power to
 break up this Union or
 go out of the Governrncnt
 This I have no doubt
 has existed there from that
 period to the prescnt time
 When we turn to the
 debates which re céntly took
 placc in the South Carolina
 conven tion v re fincLthat
 Mr Maxcy Gregg Mr Rhett
 and others said that their
 reason for goincr out of
 the Union now dates as
 far back as forty years
 some of them said thirty
 years and some twenty Mr
 Gregg said in the South
 Carolina conven Lion on the
 21st of December last If
 wc undertake to set thrth
 t he cnuges dn we
 not dishonor thc Incrnory of
 all the statesn ell of
 South Caro ina now departed
 who conunenced rorty years amo
 a war a ainst the
 tariff arid aryains t internal
 itnprovcmcnts saying nothing of the
 United States Bank and other
 ineasurcs wbich may now bc
 regarded as obsolete Mr Rhett
 on the 24th of December
 said The secession of South
 Carolina is not an event
 of a tion or by
 tbc non cxccution of the
 fugitive slave law has been
 a matter which has been
 gathering head for thirty Hence
 we see that there IS
 a design with some to
 break up this Government without
 reiörence to the slaverv question
 and the slavery question is
 by them rn ade a
 pretense for destroying this Union
 They have at length passed
 their ordinance of secession they
 assume to be out of
 the Union they declare that
 they are no longer a
 member of the Confederacy Now
 what are the other States
 called upon to do At
 e the other States called
 upon to make South Carolina
 an exemplar Are those slave
 States who believe that freemen
 should govern and that freemen
 can take care of slave
 propetty to be precipitated into
 a revolution i by following
 the example of South Carolina
 Wili they do it Whal
 protection what security i will
 Tennessee will Kentucky will Virginia
 will Maryland or any other
 Statc reccivc from South Carolina
 by following her example What
 pro I tection can she
 give then On t he
 contrary she indulges in a
 threat towards them a t
 in eat that if they
 do not imitate her example
 and come into a new
 confederacy upon her terms they
 are to be put under
 the ban and their slave
 property to be subjected to
 restraint and restriction What pro
 tection ean South Carolihagive Tennessee
 Any None upon the face
 of the earth Some of
 the men who are engaged
 in the work of disruption
 and dissolution want Tennessee and
 Kentuckv and Virginia to furnish
 them wit h men and
 money in the event of
 their becoming engaged in a
 war for the conquest of
 Mexico The Tennesseeans and Kentuckians
 and Virgin ians are very
 desirable when their men and
 their money are wanted but
 what protection does South Carolina
 give Tennessee Jf negro prop
 erty is endangered in Tennessee
 we have to de fend
 it and pay for it
 not South Carolina that has
 been an apple of discord
 in this Confederacy from my
 earliest recollection down to the
 present time complaining of everything
 satisfied with nothing I do
 not intend to be invidious
 but I have sometimes thought
 that it would be a
 com fort if Massach usetts
 and South Carolina could be
 chained together as the Siamese
 twins separated from the continent
 and taken out to some
 remotc and secluded part of
 the ocean and there fast
 anchored to be washed by
 the waves and to be
 cooled by the winds and
 after thcv had bccn kept
 there a sufficient length of
 tillie the people of the
 United States might entertain the
 proposi tion of taking them
 back Laughter They seem to
 have been the source of
 dissatisfaction pretty much ever since
 they were in the Confed
 cracy and some experiment of
 this sort I think would
 operate beneficially upon them but
 as they are here we
 must try to do the
 best we can with them
 So much Mr President for
 South Carolina and Louisiana in
 this struggle I do not
 think they are setting examples
 very worthy of imitation But
 sir the speech that I
 made on the 19th of
 Decem ber seems to have
 produced some little stir and
 among other distinguished Senators the
 Senator from Oregon Mr LANE
 felt it his duty late
 in thc evei in to
 make reply to me Ido
 not see why it w
 as called for from the
 Senator from Ore I did
 not know that I had
 said anythino gon tl lat
 was offensive to him it
 was not my inten tion
 to do so it was
 an inadvertence if I did
 felt that I had just
 come out of a campaign
 in which I had labored
 hard and in which I
 had ex pended my money
 and my time in vindicating
 to that portion of the
 people of this country and
 I will say to that
 honorable gentleman that while they
 struggle for the constitutional rights
 of the other States of
 the Union as they have
 always done and as they
 vvik continue to do there
 is one thing that they
 will not do they Will
 not march under his banner
 to strike down a gallant
 chivalrous and generous people contending
 for rights that have been
 re fused them by the
 other States of this Union
 They will not march with
 hiill under his bloody banner
 or Mr Lin coln s
 to invade the soil of
 the gallant State of South
 Car olina when may withdraw
 fi mn a Confederacy that
 has refused her that equality
 to which she is entitled
 as a mem berof the
 Union under the Constitution On
 the contrary when he or
 any other gentleman raises that
 banner and at tempts to
 subjugate that gallant people instead
 of march ing with him
 we will meet hilli there
 ready to repel him and
 his forces He shall not
 bring with him the northern
 Democracy to strike down a
 people contending for rights that
 have been ret used them
 in a Union that ought
 to rec ownize the equaiiLY
 of every member of the
 ContOderacy I do not know
 that I used any argument
 that should have caused a
 reply like that Did any
 body hear me talk about
 a bloody battle Did anybody
 hear me talk about going
 down upon South Carolina Did
 anybody hear me speak about
 cocrcing a State No Mr
 LANE Will the Senator allow
 me a word Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee 1 would rather
 go on sir Why then
 answcr positions I did not
 assume or attribute to me
 language that I did not
 use Was itin the speech
 No Why then use language
 and assi yn a position
 to me which if not
 intended was calculated to make
 afalsc im pression What called
 it forth What reason was
 there for it I saw
 the consternation which was created
 J looked at some of
 their faces 1 knew that
 had stirred up animosity and
 it was important that somebody
 from another quarter should make
 the attack If the attack
 had been upon what I
 said or upon the position
 I had as I sumed
 i should have no cause
 to compEain and I do
 not complain now Sir us
 young as I am I
 have lived down some men
 I have survived many misrepresentations
 I feel that I havc
 a conscience and a heart
 that will lead me to
 do it again But when
 I had said nothing when
 I had done nothing to
 be struck by him whom
 I have vindicated I might
 well have exclaimed That was
 the unkindest cut of all
 the Senator said If it
 should come unfortunately upon this
 country in augurated by a
 tyrant who would like to
 conquer and hold A Inerican
 citizens as vassals then I
 will say to that coward
 him and the present Vice
 President who was a who
 would do it You will
 walk over your hmnble ser
 candidate for the Presidency from
 the charge of favoring secession
 and disunion Through the dust
 and heat through the mud
 and rain trav ersed my
 State meeting the charge of
 the Opposi tion that secession
 was at the bottom of
 this move mcnt that there
 was a fixcd design and
 plan to break up this
 Govcrnment that it started at
 Charleston and was consummated at
 Baltimore and thc charge was
 made that my worthy friend
 if I may be permitted
 to cali him such I
 thought I was his friend
 then was the embodiment of
 disunion and secession I met
 the charge 1 denied it
 I repudiated it I tried
 to convince the people and
 I think I did succccd
 in convincing some of them
 that the charge was untrue
 and that leuc and M
 1 Breckinridge were the two
 best Union in the country
 I did not see what
 tk kct e was in
 my speech that should extort
 reply rom him who resided
 away North come iri conflict
 with anything that ho had
 said or done When he
 was striking thesc blows at
 rne without cause I thought
 it was at least unkind
 I may not have defended
 him to his entire satis
 faction It so turned out
 that we were unfortu nate
 we wcrc dcftated butl was
 willing to stand like a
 man to stand upon the
 Constitution and tho Union and
 if I must fall fall
 decently Af tor I had
 gone through the canvass after
 I had defendcd the Senator
 and sustained him with my
 voice and my vote I
 thought it was strange that
 he should attack me in
 the manner he didj I
 felt likc replying to him
 on the spur of thc
 occasion but it was late
 in the evening and by
 the time he had concluded
 the Senate was tired out
 and I declined going on
 I preferred to let it
 pass and submit to all
 the wrong and injury inflicted
 upon In his speech upon
 that occasion the Sena me
 tor from Oregon madc use
 of the following lan guage
 vanes body first 1 shall
 never coöperate with any portion
 of this country North or
 South that would strike down
 a people contending for their
 rights I Inarch down upon
 South Carolina Did I propose
 any such thing No War
 is not the natural element
 in my mind and as
 i stated in that speech
 my thoughts were turned on
 peace and not on war
 I want no strife I
 want no war In the
 language ofa denomination that is
 numer ous in thecountry l
 may say I hate war
 and love peace I belong
 to the peace party I
 though t when I was
 making that speech that I
 was hold in out the
 okive branch of peace I
 wanted to give quiet and
 reconciliation to a distracted and
 excited country That was the
 object I had in view
 War I repeat is not
 the natural clement of my
 mind L would rather wear
 upon my gar ments the
 tinge of the shop and
 the dust of the field
 as badges of the pursuits
 of peace than the gaudy
 epaulet upon my shoulder or
 a sword dangling by my
 side wil h its glittering
 scabbard the insicynia of strife
 of war of blood of
 carnage i sometimes of honorable
 and glorious war But sir
 I would rather see the
 people of the United States
 at war with cvcry other
 Power upon the habitable globe
 than to be at war
 with each other blood must
 be shed let it not
 be shed by the people
 of these States the one
 contending against the other But
 the Senator went on still
 further In that dis cussion
 Why it was necessary to
 follow up his attack upon
 me I cannot tell Alluding
 to the Senator from Tennessee
 he said He took occasion
 to give an account of
 the action of the Senate
 upon certain resolutions introduced here
 settingr forth the prfncipies that
 werc made the issue in
 the late contest and that
 vvere overridden and trodden down
 called the attention of the
 Senate to a proposition intro
 dneed by the honorable Senator
 from Mississippi Mr BROWN to
 declare that now is the
 time for action that a
 law ought to be passed
 at this time protecting property
 in the He alluding to
 myself hag spoken very handsomely
 Territorics I hougb it was
 Iny opinion then that i
 would of thc gallant conduct
 of that glorious band the
 northern have been well to
 pass such a law yet
 that Senator knew Democracy ot
 the country who though in
 a Iliinority at and so
 did every other one that
 it was impossiblc in this
 home have struggled for thic
 rights of their southern breth
 Congress to pass such a
 law might have passed such
 ren tör the equality and
 rights of all the States
 I belong I a bill
 through this body but it
 could never have paésed the
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 749
 other Then it was our
 duty as it was our
 privilege to set forth the
 principles on which this Government
 re posed and They were
 the principles upon which this
 great battle was fought that
 resulted in the election of
 Mr Lincoln Before I take
 up that proposition in connection
 with what I said before
 I wish to say here
 that had the Senator avowed
 the doctrine prior to the
 last presidential election that he
 avowed here in reply to
 me expressing his secession and
 dis union sentiments I give
 it as my opinion that
 he could not have obtained
 ten thousand votes in the
 State of Tennessee in the
 last election and think I
 know what I say I
 give that however simply But
 to come back to the
 point at which the Sen
 ator speaks of the resolutions
 introduced by the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr DAv1s I had
 referred to those resolutions to
 show that there was no
 occasion for this immediate secession
 with out giving the people
 time to think or understand
 what was to be done
 I thought so then and
 I think so now and
 I want to show what
 the Sen ator s views
 were then and see what
 has brought about such a
 change upon his mind since
 We find that while those
 resolutions were under con sideration
 Mr CLINGMAN offered an amendment
 to come in after the
 fourth resolution to insert the
 following Resoleed That the existing
 condition of the Territories Of
 the United States does not
 require the intervention of Congress
 tar the protection of property
 in slaves On the question
 to agree to the amendment
 proposed by Mr BROWN to
 wit Strike out of the
 amendment the word not t
 was detcrmined in the negative
 yeas 5 navs 43 Now
 by striking out the word
 not it makes the resolution
 read Resolced rl hat the
 existing condition of the Territories
 of the United States does
 require the intcrvcation of Con
 gress for the protection of
 property in slaves Mr Bnowx
 of Mississippi moved to strike
 out the word not thereby
 making it read that the
 condition of the Territories does
 require the protection of Congress
 for slave property and upon
 the yeas and nays being
 taken on that mo tion
 to strike out the word
 not there were yeas 5
 nays 43 On motion of
 Mr CLINGMAN I he ycas

 VVade VViafaiI Wilson Thus forty
 three Senators recorded their vote
 during the last session of
 Congress that it was not
 necessary to pass a law
 to protect slavery in the
 Territories Senator from Oregon in
 connection with other Senators under
 the solemn sanction of an
 oath declared that it vvas
 not ne I cessary to
 pass laws for the protection
 of slavery in the Territories
 What right has South Caro
 lina lost since the last
 session What right has any
 State lost since the last
 session of Congress You declared
 that it was not necessary
 to pass a law to
 protect them in the enjoyment
 of their property in the
 Territories and now forsooth the
 short space of two or
 thrcc moons you turn around
 and tell the country that
 States arc justified in going
 out of the Union because
 Con gress will not pass
 a law to protect them
 in the enjoyment of their
 property in the Territories x
 vhen you said it was
 not necessary That is what
 I call driving the nail
 in Laughter I will remark
 as I go along that
 the eloquent and distinguished Senator
 who made his valedictory hore
 yesterday on retiring from the
 Senate voted for that identical
 resolution This protection was not
 necessary then They said it
 was wholly unnecesary But since
 that they have waked up
 to a sense of its
 necessity and resolved to secede
 if it should not be
 granted To this same prop
 osition Mr ALBERT G BR0WN
 offered an amend ment Mark
 you this is the 25th
 day of May 1860 and
 that is not long ago
 ured about Sometimes a man
 had a great deal ment
 do not afford adequate and
 sumeient protection to better read
 a thing and undefStand it
 before he having refused to
 pass such enactments it has
 become the pitches into it
 I will noi say that
 thåt is the duty of
 Congress to interpose and pass
 such lavvs as will with
 the honorable Senator forl should
 proceed afiörd to slave property
 in the Territories that protection
 upon the idea that he
 Was laboring under th e
 im vvhich is given to
 other kinds of property pression
 that he understood it exactly
 It is hÖt That is
 a pretty clear proposition Upon
 that a very uncommon occurrence
 to be mistaken I Mr
 RnowN made an argument showing
 the num Sometimes the mistake
 results from a Want of
 ex ber of slaves in
 the Territories and the action
 Of incapacity to under the
 Legislatures and concluded that if
 the time stitution and the
 common law unaided by statutory
 enact ever would arrive it
 was then before Congress and
 they should passa law on
 the subject What We find
 after an argument being made
 by Mr BROWN showing that
 the necessity did exist ac
 cording to his ärgument the
 vote upon the prop osition
 stood thus The qucstion being
 taken by yeas and nays
 it was determined in the
 negative yeas 3 nays 42
 Forty two Senators voted that
 you did not need protection
 that slavery was not in
 danger The yeas and nays
 being desired by one fifth
 of the Senators present I
 hose who voted in the
 affrmative are Messrs Brown Johnson
 of Arkansas Mallory There were
 only three Who said it
 was not necessary Who declared
 under the solemn sanc tion
 of an oath that protection
 was not needed I hose
 who voted in the negative
 are Messrs Ben jamin Ah
 Yes BENJAMIN maler Bragg Bright
 Chesnut Clark Clay Clingman Crittenden
 Davis Dixon Doolittle Fitzpatrick Foot
 Foster Green Grimes Gwin I

 of Virginia also Iverson Johnson
 of rrcnnessee Lane A h
 Laughter Yes LANE of Oregon
 voted on the 25th day
 of last May that slavery
 did not need protection in
 the rrerritories Now he wilk
 get up and tell the
 American people and the Sen
 ate that he is for
 a State seceding and for
 break ing up the Government
 because they cannot get what
 he swore they did not
 need Laughter That is what
 I call putting the nail
 through Laughter in the galleries
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FITCH
 in the chair The galleries
 must preserve order Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee Then after voting
 that it was not necessary
 to have a prop osition
 to protect slavery in the
 I erritories the original proposition
 as amended was adopted by
 a vote of 35 yeas
 to 2 nays thus voting
 all the way through even
 to the final action of
 the Senate that no suéh
 protection wag necessary You have
 not got protection your rights
 your equality and you tell
 me t hatl have done
 you injustice by defending you
 against the charge tha9you were
 in favor ofa dis solution
 of the Union Even if
 you approved it it would
 only show that I was
 mis taken You deceived me
 that time that was your
 I fault The next time
 it will bemine I assumed
 on that occasion in reference
 to the act of ratification
 of the Constitution by the
 State of Virginia that so
 far as I was capable
 of examinincr it Virginia had
 made no reservation no condition
 in her rat ifcation of
 the Constitution of the United
 States I had examined the
 question I had looked at
 all the authorities that could
 be found upon the sub
 ject and 1 coald find
 no warrant for the asser
 tion but still the Senator
 from Oregon in his reply
 to me spoke with great
 familiarity of the pro ceedings
 of that convention ratifying the
 Consti tution as though he
 understood it and with great
 confidence said it had made
 a reservation I will read
 what he said Dominion rnade
 a condition upon which she
 adopted Constitution It became a
 portion of the cornpact And
 I not only Virginia but
 New York made the same
 condition I when she adopted
 the Constitution and Rhode Island
 He spoke with great confidence
 in this reply to me
 He then said Now I
 would ask the honorable Senator
 from Tennes see if the
 time has not arrived when
 these States ought to resunnc
 the powers conferred on a
 Federal Governn ent stand the
 subject and various other causes
 So it is that it
 occurs very frequently we labor
 under false impressions We find
 when sve come to examine
 this subject of the ratification
 of the Con stitution by
 Virginia that a committee was
 ap pointed in the convention
 of Virginia arRl that that
 committee reportedasetofresolutions They reported one
 resolution in lieu of the
 preamble That resolution is as
 follows Resolved That previous to
 the ratification of the new
 Constitution of Government recommerided by
 the late Fed eral convention
 a declaration of rights asserting
 and secur ing from encroachment
 the great principles of civil
 and religious liberty and the
 inalienable rights of the people
 t ogether with amendments to
 the most exceptionable parts of
 the said Constitution of Governtnent
 ought to be ret errcd
 by this convention to the
 other States in the American
 Con federacy for their Debates
 on the Federal Constitution vol
 3 p 653 Here was
 a proposition making conditions and
 upon a vote to adopt
 this amendment it was voted
 down ayes 80 nocs 88
 Then what follows The committee
 reported an ordinance adopting the
 Constitution of the United States
 but in their ordinance they
 go on and make a
 kind of pream ble or
 a whereas a declaration as
 to their under standing not
 conditions not reservations but a
 declaration of their understanding What
 do they say VVc thc
 delegates of the people of
 Virginia duly elected in pursuance
 of a recommendation from the
 General As senibly and now
 met in convention having fully
 and freely investigated and discussed
 the proceedings or the Federal
 eonvention and being prepared as
 well as the most mature
 deliberations bath enabled us to
 decide thereon Now mark you
 do in the name and
 in the behalf of the
 people of Vir ginia dcclarc
 and make known that the
 powcrs gi anted under the
 Constitution being derived from the
 people of I the United
 States he resumed by thetn
 whensoever the same shan be
 perverted to their injury or
 oppression Elliot s Debates on
 the Federal Constitution vol 3
 p 656 They declare in
 behalf of Virginia that the
 powers of the Constitution are
 derived from the people of
 the United States to be
 resumed by them whenever they
 shall be converted to their
 injury or oppression Who is
 to resume them The people
 of the United States That
 idea was always inculcated by
 James Madison What more do
 they say This is not
 the ratifying clause They say
 V ith these ilnpressions Not
 these conditions not these reservations
 With these ilnpressions with a
 solemn appeal to the Searcher
 of hearts tor the purity
 of our intentions and under
 the conviction that whatsoever imperi
 ctions may exist in the
 Constitution ought rather to be
 examined in E the mode
 prescribed therein than to bringthe
 Union into danger by delay
 with a hope of obtaining
 amendments pte vious to the
 ratificatiOn Now comes the ordinance
 of adoption and what is
 it We the said delegates
 in the name and behalf
 of the people of Virginia
 do by these presents assent
 to and rat tfy the
 Constitution recommended on the 17th
 day of Sep tmnber 1787
 hy the Federal Convention for
 the govern rnent of the
 United States hereby announcing to
 alfwhom it rnay concern that
 the said constitution is binding
 upon the said people according
 to an authentic copy hereunto
 annexed in the words Debates
 on the Federat Constitution vol
 3 p 656 Is there
 any reservation or condition there
 It seems to me that
 the sight of a man
 would be tolerably keen that
 could see a condition there
 When was this We find
 that Virginia adopted that on
 Tuesday June 26 1788 When
 did South Carolina come into
 the Union Beföre Virginia did
 If Virginia made a condition
 South Caro lina was already
 in I low rnany States
 were in Thc covenant was
 formed and had been ratified
 bv nine States before Virginia
 came into the l Ifnion
 The idoa of Virginia appending
 condi or if it has
 not I should like to
 know when the time can
 come I tions after the
 Government was formed and the
 After declaring under the solemn
 sanction of an i Constitution
 ratified by nine States On
 motion by Mt BROWN to
 amend the resolution by I
 oath that protection was needed
 and nothing But to make
 this thing more clear Mr
 Madi striking out all after
 the world resolved and in
 lieu II else has since
 transpired he wants to know
 when son in New York
 received a letter from i
 the time will cmne if
 it has not come that
 they Mr Hamilton stating that
 he had some doubts I
 wish I had the whole
 continent here to hear will
 be justified in breaking up
 this Confederacy as to the
 ratification of the Constitution by
 New this paragraph I saw
 a good deal of the
 confusion that was liere York
 that they wanted some conditions
 and one that evening the
 books were run around and
 fig II condition was mighthave
 the privilege to That experience
 having already shown that the
 Con 750 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 5 recede within five
 or seven years in the
 eventcer tain amendments were not
 adopted to the Consti tulion
 I should have remarked before
 passing to this that they
 adopted it not wanting delay
 and then went in the
 same committee to report a
 16ng list of amendments to
 be submitted and some of
 them were ratified afterwards by
 the dif ferent States Mr
 Madison writes in reply to
 Mr Hamilton and tells him
 if the Constitution is adopted
 it must be adopted in
 toto without reservation or condition
 I am inclined to think
 Mr Madison had some idea
 of this ordinance I think
 he understood it Here is
 his letter That ordinance was
 adopted in Virginia on June
 26 1778 nd in reply
 to Mr Hamilton in the
 fol lowing July Mr Madison
 said The idea of reserving
 a right to withdraw was
 started at Richmond and considered
 as a conditional ratification which
 was itself abandoned as worse
 than a rejection Does not
 that show that I have
 put the correct interpretation upon
 it Jåmes Madison undcr would
 as stood it as being
 an abandonment goon rely upon
 his construction of the ordinance
 that brought Virginia into the
 Union as I would on
 that of the distinguished Senator
 from Oregon I am inclined
 to think he vas quite
 as familiar with the history
 of that transaction and with
 the whole subject as the
 Senator from Oregon with all
 his familiarity and astuteness on
 the subject So much in
 answer to that portion of
 the Sena tor s ar
 ument We find upon an
 examination as L before remarked
 that nine States had ratified
 the Constitution before Virginia came
 in New York North Carolina
 and Rhode Island came in
 afterwards Mr Madison so understood
 it The fathers of the
 Republic so understood it The
 country so understand it Common
 sense so un derstands it
 Practicability so understands it Everything
 that pertains to thc preservation
 and salvation of the Government
 so understands it as contradistinguished
 from the admission of this
 doctrine of secession But let
 us see howr this matter
 travels along a l he
 Government was förmed the Con
 stitution was ratified and after
 the Constitution was ratified and
 the Government in existence there
 iS provision made for what
 New States may be admitted
 into this Union not upon
 an equality at all but
 new States may be admitted
 into this Union It being
 an express grant to admit
 the exercise of power I
 say the Federal Government can
 exercise incidents that are ne
 ccssary and proper to carry
 the admission of States into
 existence upon such a basis
 as they believe the good
 of the Government demands am
 not so sure but the
 admission of a now State
 is placed upon a different
 ground to what was the
 admission of States comincr in
 originally ratifying the Constitution As
 the Senator seems to be
 so familiar with things of
 this sort 1 will refer
 to the act admitting the
 Stale of Alabama An act
 to enable the people ot
 Alabatna to Corm a constitution
 and State government and ror
 the of State into the
 Uilion on an equal ft
 01ing with the original States
 Approved March 2 1819 Dc
 iL enacted c å hat
 the inhabitants of the Territory
 of Alabama be and they
 are hcrcby authorized to Corn
 themselves a constitution and State
 govern Inent and to as
 sutne such name as they
 rnay Illink proper and that
 the said I erritory when
 fonned into a State shall
 be uhnittcd into the Union
 upon the same footing with
 the original States in all
 respects whatever Here is the
 ordinance of Alabama accepting the
 terms of the above act
 passed 2d August 1819 I
 his convention for and in
 behalf of the people inhab
 iting this State do accept
 the propositiQ1 l s of
 Fercd by the aet of
 Congress under which they are
 assmnblcd and this convention for
 and in behalf of the
 people inhabiting this State do
 ordain agree and declare And
 this ordinance is hereby declared
 irrevocable with out the consent
 of the United States This
 act was declared irrevocable They
 agreed to the conditions offered
 to them in the act
 of Con gress with reference
 to the public lands and
 other subjects and then the
 act of coming into the
 Union was declarcd irrevocable withöut
 the consent of the United
 States Congress then passed an
 act accepting them upon the
 terms they imposed sippi to
 any people The Senator from
 Oregon That was the compact
 What has been done to
 i on that occasion in
 reply to me used the
 follow ing language Then he
 is concerned about the navigation
 of the Mis sissippi river
 He says that the great
 State of Tennessee and he
 himself are concerned about the
 navigation of that river I
 believe it is recognizcd as
 the law of nations as
 the law of all civilized
 nations that a great inland
 sea run ning through several
 Governments shall bc open equally
 to all of thenn and
 besides as the honorable Senator
 from Louisiana said there is
 no man in Louisiana that
 would think for a moment
 of depriving Tennessee of the
 right of navigating that great
 river No sir nor Kentucky
 either nor Indiana nor r
 Ilinois nor any other State
 whose waters now into that
 mighty stream No such thing
 would ever be done That
 was the declaration then that
 nobody would question the right
 of those States to navigate
 that great inland sea He
 seemed to show great familiarity
 with international law I took
 it for granted that he
 had read Grotius and Wheaton
 upon international law and an
 thc other authorities on the
 subject for hc spok e
 about it with great familiarity
 as if he understood it
 well How does the matter
 stand sir Before the printer
 s ink that impressed his
 speech upon the paper is
 dry we find an ordinance
 passed as 1 remarked before
 to day by the State
 of Louis iana declarin negatively
 that she has the right
 to control the navigation of
 that river under her the
 Senator had put himself act
 of secession to the trouble
 as I presume he did
 or ought to have done
 to examine this subject he
 would have found that the
 navigation of the Mississippi river
 has been a subject of
 negotiation for years upon years
 He would have found that
 the navigation of various rivers
 throughout the world has been
 the subject of long angry
 and contested negotia tion White
 upon this point i desire
 to present to the Senate
 an extract from a leading
 authority on this subject I
 read from Wheaton s Elements
 of Internalional Law The territory
 of the State includes the
 lakes seas I he rivers
 and rivers entirely inclosed within
 its litnits which flow the
 territory also a part of
 the donjain frotn their sources
 to thcir nonths or as
 far as they flow within
 tho territ ory including the
 bays or estua ries formed
 by their junction with the
 sea iVhere a navi gable
 river the boundary of cotcr
 ninous States the ntiddle ot
 the channel or thalwcz is
 generally taken as the line
 of separation between the two
 States the presurnption of lawr
 being that the right of
 navigation is cotntnon to both
 but this presumption Ilia v
 be destroyed by actual proof
 of prior occupancy and long
 undi turbed possession ivtn to
 one of the riparian proprietors
 the exclusive title to the
 entire river i llings of
 bich the use is inexhaustible
 such as the sea and
 running water cannot be so
 appropriated as to ex ciude
 others troll using these elen
 ents in any Inanner which
 not occasion a loss or
 inconvenience to the proprietor This
 is what is called an
 in nocent use Thus have
 seen that the jurisdiction possessed
 by onc nation over sounds
 straits aud other anns of
 the sea leading through its
 own territory to that of
 another or to other seas
 connnon to all nations doe
 not exclude others from the
 right of innocent passage through
 these communications The game prin
 ciple is aöpli klble to
 rivers flowing ll orn one
 State through tbc territory of
 another into the sea or
 into thc territory of a
 thir l State rl he
 right of navigating for commercial
 pur poses a river which
 flows throÜgh territories of differ
 ent States is cornmon to
 all the nations inhabiLiug the
 difl ferel it parts oe
 its banks but this right
 of innocent passaae being what
 the text writers call an
 imperfect Tight its ex erciso
 is necessarily modified by the
 safety and convenience of tuc
 State affected by it can
 only bc efü ctually sc
 cured by mutual convention regulating
 the mode of its ex
 ercise It sccms that this
 right draws after it the
 incidental riant of using all
 the means which are necessary
 to the se cure enjoyment
 or the principal right itself
 Thus th c Ro man
 law which considered navigable rivers
 as public or comtnon property
 declared that the right to
 the use of the shores
 was incident to that ot
 the water and that tbc
 right to navigate a river
 invol ved thc right to
 Inoor vessels to its banks
 to lade and unlade cargoes
 I ll public jurists apply
 this principle of the Rotnail
 civn law to tho smne
 case between nations and infer
 the right to use the
 adjacent land tör these purposes
 as means necessary to the
 attain ment of the end
 for which the free navigation
 of the water is permitted
 Wheaton s Elements of International
 Law part 2 chap 4
 pp 252 253 254 Now
 what are we told That
 Louisiana for which we paid
 15 000 000 whose battles
 we fought whose custom houses
 forts arsenals dock yards and
 hospitals we built in the
 exer cise of the plenitude
 other pourcr declures that she
 has control of the Mississippi
 and such States may navigate
 that stream as are on
 friendly rela tions with her
 she being tl le judge
 Is not tkis what the
 dogma of secession leads us
 to We see Alabama What
 great complaint has she Why
 should she leave the Union
 in such hot haste So
 much for that sir In
 the remarlß that I made
 when I last addressed the
 Senate I referred to the
 constitution of the State of
 Tennessee which wasadopted in 1796
 and their bill of rights
 in which they declare that
 they would never sur where
 it carries us we see
 in what it will cnd
 litigation war and bloodshed As
 I remarked before as we
 approach and advance in the
 inves tigation of the subject
 x ve discover its enormities
 more and more I repeat
 it is the prolific mother
 render or give up the
 navigation of the Missis I
 of anarchy which is the
 first step to despotism itself
 The Senator from Oregon seems
 not to be apprehensive at
 all and yet béfore hiy
 voice has done reverberating in
 the Hall we have the
 open declaration that they intend
 to exercisc the con trol
 of the navigation of the
 Mississippi Would it not have
 been better for Louisiana Mr
 LANE I think the Senator
 ought to allow me to
 say a word Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee I do not
 want I certainly mean no
 discour to be interrupted tesv
 at all to the Senator
 Mr LANE I only wish
 to say in the way
 of explanation that the people
 of New Orleans have had
 police regulations by which they
 have collected taxes to improve
 their G vharves ever since
 New Orleans belonged to this
 country It is a very
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee common
 thing in all cities where
 there are wharves either on
 the river or ocean to
 have what is com monly
 called a wharfage tax We
 understand that The navigation of
 the high seas and rivers
 is a different thing from
 paying wharfage and a little
 tax to defray the expense
 of keeping wharves and docks
 up We understand all about
 that That is a very
 differellt affair from placing bat
 teries at this early day
 upon the banks of that
 great stream Mr LANE That
 was against the common cnemy
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee I
 did not know we had
 any enemies in these States
 I thought we were brothers
 and were entitled to free
 trade from one extremity of
 this Confederacy to tho other
 I did not know that
 the people of Indiana and
 Illinois and Kentucky and Tennessec
 going along down that river
 had got to be enemies
 suppose however when we look
 at these things our minds
 change and vary by varying
 circum stances When we are
 candidates for the Presi dency
 we feel more like brothers
 but when we have made
 the experiment and signally failed
 I suppose the enemy s
 line begins just at the
 line where our defeat was
 consummated Laughter and applause in
 the galleries The PRESIDING OFFICER
 called to order of Tennessee
 How long has it been
 since vre were prepared to
 go to war with the
 most fbrmidable Power upon earth
 because she claimed the right
 of search We would not
 concede to Great Britain the
 right of searching our ships
 on the high seas and
 yct what do we now
 see Batteries placed upon the
 banks of the Mississippi to
 enforce the right of search
 Do we not see where
 it will lead Do we
 not all know in what
 it will end Mr HEMPHILL

 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FITCH
 Does the Senator from Tennessee
 yield the floor to the
 Senator from Texas Mr HEMPHILL
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee I
 do for the purpose of
 making a motion to adjourn
 Mr LANE 1 should be
 very glad if the Sen
 ator could finish his speech
 to day The session is
 very short now Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee That is very
 true and I do not
 ask any unreasonable in dulgence
 from the Senate Let us
 adjourn I have spoken and
 occupied as little time in
 the Senate as any other
 member in it The Senator
 from Oregon has been on
 the floor at least four
 times to my once The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator from
 Texas has moved that the

 is not debatable Mr HEMPHILL

 the Senator is fatigued Mr

 application to Congress for the
 call of a convention tar
 proposing amendinents to the Con
 Btitution of the United States
 with a request that should
 immediately place the same before
 that body It affords me
 great satietäction to perlörm this
 duty and I feel quite
 eonfident that Congress will bestow
 upon these resolutions the caretül
 consideration to which they are
 eminently en titled on account
 of the distinguished and patriotic
 source from which they proceed

 importance of the subject which
 they involve JAMES BUCHANAN WASHINGTON

 Within the last few weeks
 we have seen State after
 State leaving this Union formed

 know that that has been
 caused by diffek ences of
 opinion between the inhabitants of
 two portions of this Confederacy
 differences of opinion that have
 grown out of the change
 of sentiment aris ing out
 ofa change in the situation
 of the people ofa portion
 of the States Without speaking
 of those circumstances without speaking
 of the facts that have
 led to the display of
 these differences I it is
 enough for me to say
 that these differences are of
 such a character that the
 people of a large portion
 of the United Slates the
 people ofa num ber of
 the sovereign States have arrived
 at the conclusion that they
 can no longer remain mem

 safety to themselves and to
 their righ ts of property
 unless changes are made in
 the constitutional law of the
 land which will meet the
 changes that have taken place

 objected main in force and
 have the same effect as
 if this ordinance had not
 been passed The undersigned hereby
 certified that the above ordi
 uauon of a portion of
 our people which will meet
 copy of that instrument and
 I now ask permis the
 changes that have taken place
 in the feelings Sion of
 the House that the copy
 which have pro and views
 ofa portion of the States
 and restore cured be read
 and that when read the
 House will the Union to
 the condition in which it
 was when it was framed
 by erecting positive barriers which
 will restrain the action of
 the people and of the
 departments of the Federal Government
 within the boundaries set to
 that action by the public
 sentiment of the country when
 the Government went into operation
 I There are now pending
 before this House a variety
 of propositions reported from a
 committee composed of members of
 all the States of which
 this Union consisted when this
 Congress asscm bled Their passage
 has been urged on this
 House by different individuals under
 the influence un doubtedly of
 the most patriotic motives in
 the expectation that their passage
 would be attended with public
 advantage and would be likely
 to compose the differences that
 now divide us Mr Speaker
 I was a member of
 that committee was one of
 those who dissented from the
 majority that reported these propositions
 to the House In a
 report which I presented as
 the organ of the minority
 I expressed the grounds of
 my dissent i from the
 views of those who supported
 them in the committee and
 now favor their adoption My
 belief to day is W
 hat it was then and
 in my judg ment standing
 in the position which I
 now oc cupy I owe
 it to myself I owe
 it to the people of
 Louisiana I owe it to
 you and to the people
 of 752 the United StateS
 to declare it to bermy
 solemn conviction that if every
 one of those Ineasures were
 to be now adopted by
 the unanimous voice of the
 members of this House and
 of the Senate that fact
 would produce no effect in
 arresting the current that is
 sweeping State after State out
 of this Confederacy Many of
 these measures may be right
 in them selves but they
 propose no radical no effectual
 remedies no removal of the
 causes of diMculty The admission
 jf a portion of the
 existing ter ritory of the
 United States into the Union
 as a State establishes no
 principle rec ocnizes no right
 produces no result in the
 adjustment of this ques tion
 theterritorial question which has been
 the main Cause in bringing
 about the present condition of
 things If it be the
 desire of gentlemen to reach
 theævil to apply a remedy
 to the disease to heal
 these dissensions and restore the
 Union to its old condition
 they must 1 00k forward
 to the adoption of constitutional
 amendments to changes in the
 orøanic law to changes which
 will settle and put forcver
 at rest all pretexts for
 the agitation of this sectional
 question which has sowed the
 seeds of bitterness and hatebetween
 the North and South the
 opposing portions of the Union
 They must look forward to
 the adoption of constitutional amendments
 which will settle every one
 of the questions on the
 firm basis of clear and
 well dc fined provisions in
 the orgånic law and which
 will take away now and
 forever all pretexts for presenting
 to this House or thc
 Senate petitions calculated to stir
 up the seeds of these
 dissensions and diffculties which have
 at last resulted in placing
 us in the attitude which
 we now occupy m the
 eyes of the civilized world
 If gentlemen in view of
 the benefits which result to
 our people and to the
 world from this Union cannot
 raise themselves to the height
 of those great acts then
 and I say it with
 the deepest recret in my
 view the perznancnt dissolution of
 this Union is inevitable It
 is vain for men to
 delude themselves with the expectation
 that the palliatives recommended by
 the Inajority of the committee
 ofthirty th ree are ff0in
 to remove dee p seated
 evils to cure deeply rooted
 diseases and to restore to
 unity this broken Confederation there
 be not virtue enough and
 patriotism enough among the representativesof
 the people here and the
 representatives of the States in
 the other end of the
 Capitol to arrive at that
 determination and to ripen it
 into action by the adoption
 of consti tutional amendments the
 dissolution of the Union is
 inevitable and then we must
 bc prepared and you must
 be ptepared to meet another
 question the question as to
 the position which the two
 sections of this Confederacy are
 to occupy with regard to
 cach other when lhc act
 of dissolution has become complete
 We owe it to ourselves
 we owe It to the
 world if we can no
 longer livc togethcu in peace
 if we can no longer
 dwell together as brethren in
 unity that like the patriarchs
 of old we should separate
 the without contention that if
 one goes north othcr shall
 go south and that we
 should dwell each portiOii of
 our people by themselves and
 in their own tents in
 peace Is that to hc
 the rcsult It is for
 the people of the northern
 States arid for the Representatives
 of the people of the
 northern States to determine that
 question Many say that if
 these Matcs which have now
 declared in the most solemn
 manner ever yet witnessed in
 the civilized world thcirdctermination to
 sever the bonds which have
 heretofore united them to the
 other States and made us
 one peoplc are to be
 permitted to do so this

 ever_y people when their rights
 are in vaded But gentleman
 say the Constitution was in
 tended to be perpetual that
 the Government is to be
 eternal that no State can
 secede without the consent of
 her sister States Mr Speaker
 I have no disposition to
 enter ilJo a discussion upon
 the character of our Government
 or the right of States
 constitutionally to secede But I
 say this that it is
 a principle recognized by all
 the writers upon the public
 law of the world that
 have ever given their thoughts
 to mankind that it is
 a principle recognized by the
 action of this Government in
 all past time as a
 nation that it is a
 principle which has always hitherto
 been recognize l by the
 whole American people that the
 right of rev olution exists
 and is inherent in the
 members of all organized communities

 is but one opinion in
 tho whole world in relation
 to the existence of the
 right of revolution That right
 has been shox vm to
 exist by all recorded history
 It was by the exercise
 of that riffht that we
 came into existence asa nation
 and since our existence as
 a nation it has been
 our settled policy to reconnize
 the existence of that right
 everyw here Any one who
 chooses to look into our
 national records will discover that
 in every instance where a
 people have taken up arms
 for the purpose of vindicating
 their rights against a Governmont
 with which they had been
 con nected it has been
 the settled practice of this
 Government to recoo nizc thc
 rn as an independent Statc
 whencvcr tl 1Cir authority in
 fact extended throughout thcir territorial
 lirnits and that too l
 0twithstanding the Government from which
 they separated still lcnipd their
 independence and con tinued to
 assert their rights over them
 Now Mr Speaker what will
 be the condition ot this
 people if thc remaining portion
 of thesc I Slates in
 violation of that principle under
 which this Government came into
 existence and in vio fation
 of that principle which has
 been recocpnized by all the
 departments of the Federal Govern

 as a nation should choose
 to make use of violence
 and mili their own interests
 not in contributing the fruits
 of their industry to swell
 the commerce of the world
 and to add to the
 comforts and enjoyments of mankind
 but in the work of
 seeing how much mischief they
 can do to each other
 Their sons will go to
 recruit armies to meet in
 hostile com bat and their
 substance will be consumed in
 pay ing the taxes levied
 to keep armies in the
 field and fleets upon thc
 sea until at last after
 years perhaps of calamity and
 suffering and when bowed down
 by the burdens which the
 necessi ties of war will
 impose and when overwhelmed with
 debt they will be compelled
 to make peace from mere
 exhaustion and leave the question

 say that we would be
 allowed to go on in
 waging a war so senseless
 When our Union has ceased
 to exist upon the solid
 founda tions of the affections
 of all portions of the
 Amcri can people we shall
 descend at once from our
 rank among the nations of
 the earth Our voice will
 then be no longer potential
 enough to pro tect America
 from European intervention and it
 Ilia y happen that our
 own affairs if you of
 the North are mad enough
 to war upon your brethren
 because they are no longer
 willing to live with you
 under the same Government may
 be the first to call
 for the interposition of European
 Powers in the common interest
 of mankind And what a
 spectacle shall we then present
 to the world We that
 forbade all European intervention on
 this continent and whose prohibition
 was respected compelled by our
 X veakncss to submit to
 it our selves And now
 let me ask will not
 England and France command the
 peace if you of the
 North determine on war And
 will they not have the
 riffht to do so in
 their own interest and for
 yours Owing to the peculiar
 condition in which we are
 placed owing to the peculiar
 condition of that por tion
 of the United States which
 has seceded from the remainder
 of the States evils of
 such a nature as the
 world never before saw will
 shake your society will shake
 the society of large portion
 of the civilized world to
 their very foundations if such
 a war as that may
 bring on should be con

 year Mr Speaker the maékets
 of the world are sup

 our southern soil To day
 the industry of our northern
 brethren is supplied to the
 extent of millions by the
 raw ma terial which it
 furnishes Mr STANTON YVill the

 for a single moment I

 Louisiana when he asked the
 indulgence of the House desired
 to make some remarks personal
 to himself upon his withdrawal
 from the House and with
 that understanding 1 certainly for
 one refrained to interpose objection
 But I find he is
 going into an elaborate discussion
 the differences arisino out of
 the disturbed condition of the
 country cer tainly calling for
 a reply I desire to
 state further that to a
 genlloman speaking by unanimous con
 sent thc hour rule does
 not apply I hope the

 will not abuse the courtesy
 of be House by going
 into a general discussion of
 these questions Mr BOULIGNY 1
 hope gentlemen will not interfere
 with the right of my

 is making his last speech
 upon this floor betöre withdrawing

 I do not think it
 is very polite to interfere
 with him Mr TAYLOR Those
 gentlemen who remain upon this

 of speak ing in reply
 to anything I may utter
 if anything I may say
 may in their opinion deserve
 a reply The SPEAKER The
 gentleman from Louis iana is
 entitled to the floor Mr
 TAYLOR I was proceeding to
 say that our northern brethren
 consume now in their man
 ufactories some eight hundred thousand
 bales of cotton annually that
 by their industry and the
 employment of their capital they
 give it a value w
 I lich reaches the amount
 yearly of not less than
 120 000 000 Cross the
 ocean and in England there
 are nearly three million bales
 employed in her manufacturing establishments
 to which Eng 1ish capital
 and English labor give such
 a value that the fabrics
 made of it have a
 value in the com merce
 of Great Britain which reaches
 to day to at least
 700 000 000 And upon

 value of the manufactures out

 THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
 PUBLISHED BY JOHN C Rlvns
 WASHING iÖN jD C THIRTY
 SIXTH CONGRESS 2D SESSION same
 product of the southern portion
 of these States is not
 less than 400 000 000
 Now sir this single southern
 staple forms the basis of
 such a portion of the
 products of the industry of
 the whole civilized world that
 their value derived from the
 labor and capital employed in
 their cre ation taken in
 connection with the original cost
 of the raw material reaches
 the amazing sum of upwards
 of twelve hundred million dollars
 The fabrics which are made
 from it enter into the
 consumption of every family upon
 the globe that is within
 the reach of the operations
 Of trade They are essential
 to the comfort of mil
 lions upon millions of the
 inhabitants of this earth And
 I would ask what will
 happen if these two great
 sections go to war Why
 sir a great por tion
 of the labor now given
 to the culuvation of cotton
 would be withdrawn The production
 of cotton in the southern
 States would fall off at
 once to one half perhaps
 one third of what it
 now is And why The
 supplies of various kinds which
 they have heretofore drawn from
 the pastures and fields and
 from the mills and the
 workshops of once friendly States
 then become enemies woul d
 have to be supplied by
 our own labor and thousands
 of strong arms and busy
 hands now engaged in the
 culture of cotton would have
 to be diverted to the
 growth of corn and wheat
 and to the production of
 all the innu rnerable articles
 that enter into the daily
 consump tion ofa people But
 this would not be all
 Another portion still would have
 to be diverted from that
 culture for the production and
 supply of the munitions and
 mate rial of war and
 for the erection of works
 required for the purposes of
 defense at important strategic pointsin
 their territories The sea would
 no longer be covered with
 the ships employed to carry
 food to the spindles and
 the looms of other lands
 And what would be the
 result Sudh a widc spread
 suf fering among those who
 depend upon labor such a
 wide spread suffering among those
 who depend upon the interest
 of capital as the world
 never witnessed since the world
 began It would give a
 shock to the industry of
 the whole world would disturb
 all of the currents of
 trade would overwhelm all civilized
 communities in bankruptcy It would
 subject every class of so
 ciety not only throughout America
 but through out Europe to
 every species of suffering If
 that state of things were
 to continue what would bc
 the condition of the world
 I know it has been
 suggested on the other side
 that there was an easy
 way of obtaining a supply
 of cotton in place of
 that now furnished by the
 southern States I know that
 one gentleman L Mr WASHBURN
 of Wisconsin referred to discov
 eries made as hc said
 upon the continent of Africa
 which would open the way
 to obtaining an aznple supply
 from that quarter of the
 world I have given much
 attention to this subject and
 I will venture to say
 that all the land that
 can be found upon that
 continent adapted to the profita
 ble production of cotton and
 which can be brought into
 cultivation for the next century
 will not sup ply as
 much cotton for the markets
 of the world as is
 yielded to day by the
 labor ofa single county in
 the district represented by my
 friend from Ark ansas Mr
 RUST i know It is
 said by some that the
 world may obtain a supply
 from India but it is
 idle to say so Do
 we not all know that
 for a third of a
 century the Government of Great
 Britain has been engaged in
 unsuccessful attempts to supply herself
 with that great staple from
 her possessions there Persons experienced
 in the culture of cotton
 have been taken there from
 the southern States and large
 amounts of capital have THURSDAY
 FEBRUARY 7 1861 give the
 Powers engaged in that enterprise
 the means of making that
 country an instrument for the
 supply of the deficiency which
 would f0110 r any diminution
 in the crops of America
 But can any one having
 any discourse of reason suppose
 that will be so China
 is a country now filled
 with hundreds of millions of
 people China is a country
 in which that portion of
 the labor of its population
 which can be devoted to
 that purpose to day is
 scarcely suffcient to supply_it with
 the food necessary for the
 sustenance of her people No
 year passes by in which
 famines do not occur in
 different portions of that vast
 Empire A change may be
 made it is true in
 the character of the cot
 ton which is now produced
 there but its quantity cannot
 be materially increased because the
 addi tional labor which x
 vould be necessary for that
 purpose cannot be spared from
 the work of pro viding
 the articles of food constantly
 required for the subsistence of
 the teeming millions of her
 peo ple who are engaged
 in all the other pursuits
 of life But if I
 am mistaken with respect to
 the pros pective capacity of
 Africa or of China to
 ailörd supplies of cotton hereafter
 to take the place of
 that now derived from the
 South what then Why it
 will be years and years
 before the work of providing
 for that supply can be
 accomplished And what is Europe
 to do m the mean
 time if the supply from
 the southern States should be
 cut off Do you gentlemen
 of the northern States who
 believe in the existence of
 imperial powers in the Federal
 Government and who talk so
 compla cently of enforcing the
 Federal laws within the limits
 of the seceding States suppose
 that that supply is to
 be kept up if as
 is proposed in tho bills
 you have reported to this
 House you should blockade the
 ports of the seceding States
 How is it to be
 done Is that measure only
 designed to make the cotton
 bales of the South pass
 over your railroads and thus
 find an egress through your
 cities on their way to
 Europe Are blockades to be
 resorted to to enrich your
 railroad companies and the various
 agents employed in such inland
 trans portation with freights and
 tolls and commissions If that
 be so flatter not yourselvcs
 with any such results If
 you fulfill your menaces and
 blockade southern ports the southern
 States will lay an embargo
 upon all cotton seeking transportation
 through the northern channels open
 to it Not a bale
 will be permitted to be
 moved inland in that direction
 unLil the commerce of their
 ports is freed from your
 impediments And if your people
 could stand this state of
 things how long do you
 suppose that EPIand and France
 would stand by in silence
 and inaction And if the
 two sections are engaged in
 actual war so Ihat the
 cotton is not only arrested
 in our ports but not
 made will they stand idly
 by and see you who
 have heretofore been the partisans
 of the right of self
 government enenged in the despotic
 work of com pelling us
 to submit to be governed
 at your mere will and
 pleasure and that too when
 by this most gross and
 palpåble violation of the funda
 NEW 48 But Mr Speaker
 it was not my purpose
 to go to any length
 in this line of i
 emark It was not my
 desire to do se and
 but for therepeated interruptions I
 might not have doneit I
 desired however to present to
 the Representatives of the American
 _people such considerations as occurred
 to myxnind showing it to
 be not only required by
 patriotism but that it is
 required by the in terest
 of trade and for the
 comfort and the hap piness
 Of the masses of our
 own peopl and of the
 masses of mankind that our
 separation if it is to
 take place and become permanent
 shall be followed by peace
 between the two sec tions
 And it is with that
 view that now call on
 north ern Representatives to pause
 and to we igh well
 what they are about to
 do I would ask them
 if they are not laboring
 under great misconceptions as to
 the nature of the existing
 Federal Govern ment They seem
 to consider if one may
 judge of their views from
 what is constantly thrown out
 by them in disconnected remarks
 that there is a serious
 and fatal defect in that
 plan of Govern ment if
 it does not have the
 power to compel sub mission
 to its will everywhere within
 the Fed eral limits by
 the exercise of physical power
 Why sir to my mind
 the absence of such a
 power is of the very
 essence of the republicanism which
 was professed and practiced by
 our fathers They believa in
 the right of every distinct
 peo ple to govern themselves
 They belonged to sep arate
 States each of which was
 then in the full enjoyment
 of this very right and
 when they formed the Fedet
 al Government they so consti
 tuted it that it would
 become the strongest Gov ernment
 in the world while it
 retained thc affec tions of
 our people and the weakest
 of all when they were
 alienated It was erected all
 pow erful for good in
 everything that concerns the gen
 oral inlerest and absolutely without
 any strehgth for the purposes
 of local or sectional oppression
 The States were left in
 existence and so long as
 their people continue to regard
 the General Gov ernment as
 their Government its powers are
 un controlled and uncontrollablc within
 them all But if on
 the other hand no matter
 from what cause the pcople
 of any State come to
 look upon it as a
 Government no longer theirs butonc
 unfriendly to them then as
 I understand the Const itution
 when that fact is made
 manifest by the filling of
 all the departments of the
 Slate government with men determined
 to act upon that idea
 the Fed eral Government is
 actually without the meanSof doing
 any act within their limits
 in a constitutional or legal
 manner without their consent And
 is this a defect It
 would be indeed a defect
 and a great one in
 a dcspotic Government which ac
 knowledgcs the existence of no
 rights in opposi tion to
 its own will I doubt
 if it will ever be
 con sidered so by those
 who hate oppression and who
 desire that existing rights shall
 never be violated Will you
 not then pause in the
 career upon which you seem
 about to enter and if
 you cannot bring yourselves to
 consent to an adjustment of
 our sec mental principle of
 your own Government you tional
 differences at least determine to
 make the separation now taking
 place between the sections inflict
 on them in cornmon with
 other peaceful an injury which
 will shake the whole social

 there are but six States
 that have tem of Europe
 to its very center I
 for one think they will
 not If thosc cvil times

 they will be compellcd But
 if those gentlemen bc added
 to that number to interpose
 in their our n interest

 that be so then are
 nöt the measures of the
 Government of which he has
 spoken essentially defensive in their
 char acter and rendered inevitable
 imperative upon the people and
 the Government of the United
 States In protection of their
 dignity their rights and thetr
 honor Mr TAYLOR 1 regret
 that the gentleman from New
 York has asked the question
 he has because it will
 only compel me to extend
 further the remarks I rose
 to submit I say to
 him as I would say
 to all in the spirit
 of frankness that when this
 Congress came together and it
 became unmistakably manifest that it
 was the determina tion of
 the southern people of a
 portion of the United States
 under the influence of what
 they conceived to be aggressions
 upon their rights under the
 influence of apprehensions which they
 entertained with respect to their
 future quiet and security to
 have recourse tofthe right of
 revolu tion upon floor and
 in the other end of
 the Capitol declarations were made
 which were equiv alent to
 the assertion of a right
 and of a determ ination
 on the part of a
 majority of the se States
 to hold the southern people
 in subjection to re duce
 them to acondition worse worse
 by far than that under
 which the people of Ireland
 groaned for centuries and under
 which India now groans at
 the footstool of British power
 then sir Mr SICKLES If
 the gentleman will permit me
 I will call his attention
 back to the point I
 mad c Mr TAYLOm 1
 prefer not to yield Mr
 SICKLES I understand the gentleman
 to decline to yield to
 me Mr TAYLOR 1 prefer
 not to yield Under the
 circumstances in which they thcn
 stood if it vvrere their
 scrious purpose to assert tho
 right of revolution and to
 take the attitude of sovereign
 States as an incident to
 the exercise of that right
 it vv as also their
 duty to see that thestc
 fortresses which had been erected
 upon their soil net for
 the purpose of holding them
 in obedience but for the
 purpose of repulsing for eicrn
 invaders from our shores it
 was their duty I say
 to prevent these fortresses and
 armaments frotn being mado use
 of by those men who
 held to so monstrous doctrine
 for the purpose of clit
 cting their subjugation Mr SPINNE1i
 I malco a point of
 order upon the gentlmnan frorn
 Lou l siana Mr SPINNER
 1 the point of I
 want to know whether it
 is and I insist on
 it cornpctent for a member
 sworn to suppo_rt the Constitution
 of the United States to
 stand upon floor of House
 of Represerltatives and boldly avow
 advocate and justify treason to
 the United Slates and to
 defend the stealing of Uni
 ted States forts United States
 arsenals United States hospitals and
 United States ships I make
 the point of order and
 I want it decided Mr
 RUST Let the Chair decide
 the gentle man s point
 of order Mr SPINNER The
 gentleman from Lou isiana avows
 I believe that he is
 no longer a member of
 this House yet he justifies
 in this I louse the
 spoliation of property of this
 Govern Is it competent for
 him to stand here and
 rnent deft nd acts of
 insult and disgrace to this
 Govern ment The SPEAKER The
 House should have considered that
 when consent was given to
 the gentleman from Louisiana to
 submit his remarks Mr SPINNER
 The House yielded to a
 per scnal explanation They had
 no idea he would indulge
 in the remarks he has
 MI RUST I call thc
 gentleman from New York to
 order Mr JOHN COCHRANE Let
 the proceed to take his
 fai ewell from us Mr
 TAYLOR if the United states
 send shits tou blockade our
 ports ånd if the armies
 of the United States invade
 the soil of the seced
 ing States that would be
 war and that when the
 first blow is struck the
 spirit of southern nation ality
 will leap from the hearts
 of the southern like Pallas
 all armed arid that State
 people after State will array
 themSelve é under her guid
 ance until every southern State
 will be banded together to
 maintain that independence which all
 will have declared and to
 vindicate the right of their
 people to exercise for themselves
 all the powers of self
 government When that blow is
 struck gentlemen let me tell
 you whatever you may think
 to the contrary people of
 the State of Maryland in
 which the first act was
 done which led to the
 formation of the existing Government
 will come to the rescue
 The sons of Virginia the
 mother of States and of
 statesmen will como to the
 rescue A nd the children
 of Kentucky the dark and
 bloody ground will come to
 the rescue When that blow
 is struck North Carolina will
 awake and from her mountains
 and her valleys will stream
 that people who have never
 yet failed to heal the
 calls of duty or the
 demands of honor Tennessee will
 send forth her thousands filled
 with the memories of the
 patri otic dead whose remains
 now repose in her soil
 the hero of the last
 war Andrew Jackson And even
 the hardy pioneers of Missouri
 one of the younger of
 the sisters will like their
 own mighty river when at
 the flood rush to the
 assistance of their southern brethren
 and then such a conflict
 as this world has never
 yet witnessed will be upon
 us Fields which are nosv
 filled with men en gaged
 in the employnoents of ordinary
 life will be trenched with
 the march of war and
 every hill side will be
 the sccnc of combat and
 thc streams of every valley
 will run with blood But
 i will not look upon
 tho horrid picture which a
 swift coming future luay but
 too soon perhaps force upon
 the tunwilling gaze For myself
 it is Iny purpose now
 to withdraw from this body
 and to return to rny
 home in Lou I have
 no desire or wish when
 I arrive Ismna there of
 taking anv part ill the
 proceedinzs of the day It
 is my iniention to live
 in quict at 111 y
 own home and pursue the
 ordinary occupations but if that
 day of war comes then
 l as of life one
 of tbc people of Louisiana
 shall feel it to be
 my duty to take up
 arms in her defense and
 I say to you now
 gentlemen though within the lirnits
 of that State there are
 still a portion of her
 people who desire a continuance
 of the Union if that
 be possible upon such a
 basis as would be just
 and right to the South
 that if that dread day
 comes there will not be
 found upon her soil one
 single man who will not
 be ready to meet the
 in vuders of his country
 and to shed his blood
 in her defense Mr Speaker
 and gentlemen o the House
 of Representatives I now bid
 you farewell But I do
 not leave you entirely without
 hope that these unhappy difün
 ences may yet be adjusted
 in such a manner as
 will lead to the reconstruction
 of thc Union on such
 a basis as will make
 it per For one 1
 cannot yet believe that the
 petual American people have so
 far forgotten the great principles
 of true republicanism under whose
 in fluence they arrived at
 such a pitch of greatness
 as not to hc willing
 to do that which is
 right and just in order
 to restore the Federal Government
 to the old condition and
 thus insure its perpetu ation
 to the remotest posterity If
 unhappily however the hope I
 entertain should not be real
 ized because ofthe existence of
 the pride of power because
 ofa perversion of the public
 mind of the North to
 such a degree that it
 will no longer tol crate
 the principles of genuine republicanism
 or permit the exercise of
 the right of self government
 by any other but themselves
 then indccd I can say
 that I have been deceived
 in my judgment of tbe
 American people Under the influence
 of that hope I shall
 bid you farewell in the
 expectation that we may yet
 meet I together in these
 Halls If vv e do
 why then we ll smile
 Bat it that hope is
 disappointed and we are to
 hereafter stand in hostile opposition
 to each other then to
 continue the language which the
 poet has put into the
 mouth of the great Ro
 man on taking leave of
 his friend upon the eve
 of that conflict which was
 to dctcrminc whether the iron
 rule of imperial domination exerted
 through the forms of their
 old repub_lican institu tions I
 can only say This parting
 was well made Mr BOULIGNY
 obtained the floor The SPEAKER
 If is no objection the
 gentleman from Louisiana will roceed
 Mr LOVEJOY object Cries of
 No No P all OVer
 the House Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 If the gentleman will withdraw
 his objection we will grant
 him consentto speak when he
 takes his leave Laugh Mr
 LOVEJOY 1 will withdraw m
 objec tion provided it is
 to be a Union speech
 Laugh Mr BOULIGNY I take
 this occasion to ex press
 my regret that I am
 not able to agree with
 the honorable Senators from my
 State and with my colleague
 who hag just taken his
 seat Mr TAYLOR although I
 entertain the greatest regard for
 their opinions In the outset
 permit me to say I
 that until a few moments
 ago was in the same
 condition with my colleague not
 havincr received offcial information of
 the passage of the ordinance
 of secession by the convention
 of my State Nor have
 I received frorn the Legislature
 of my State now in
 session any information of the
 passage by that body of
 a resolution instructing her Sen
 ators requesting her Representatives to
 with draw from 06ngress For
 one although 1 i e
 1 spect that body I
 shall not obey its request
 was not elected by that
 body and I have nothing
 to do with it or
 it with me In reference
 to the convention will say
 that I respect that body
 as I do the Legislature
 of my State Many of
 Its members are my personal
 and intimate friends but I
 think they have shown discourtesy
 to me when they have
 not even thought proper to
 send me a copy of
 their ordinance of secession certainly
 I shall pay it no
 attention until it is communicated
 to me Laughter Mr Speaker
 there is anot her reason
 which compels me to differ
 with the Senators and Rep
 I am the only member
 rescntativcs of my State of
 Congress from Louisiana who was
 elected as an American Union
 man To those principles I
 shall stand forever Great applause
 in the gal Again when
 I carne here I took
 the oath to sustain the
 Constitution of the United States
 What does that mean Does
 not the Constitu tion of
 the United States mean the
 Union of the United States
 I so understand it and
 to that oath I shall
 adhere firmly to the end
 Whenever I am instructed by
 my immediate constituents and am
 requested by them to withdraw
 from Con gress I shall
 comply with those instructions as
 soon as they are received
 Then and not until the
 n I shall resign and
 after resigning my posi tion
 here I shall yet be
 a Union map and stand
 under the flag of the
 country which gave mc birth
 Great applause in the galleries
 and on the floor DEFICIENCY

 During the roll calf Mr

 this is an appropriation to
 pay this amount under contract
 made in pursuance I therefore

 law which I think imposes
 on us an obligation to
 carry out this contract I
 should vote no Mr IRVINE
 when his name was called
 said IJnderstanding this to be
 an executed contract on the
 part of the Government and
 that it is a mere
 question as to the time
 when the payment shall be
 made I vote ay Mr
 HINDMAN said have been in
 the habit latterly of voting
 with our colored friends for
 all extravagant appropriations in the
 hope of sink ing this
 Govcrnment irretrievably but there is
 a little too much rascality
 about this and I vote
 no The result of the
 vote having been announced as
 above recorded Mr FLORENCE moved
 to reconsider the vote by
 which the amendment was agreed
 to and also moved to

 motion was agreed to The

 COLFAX 1 now call up
 the House bill No 950
 in relation to the postal
 service which was postponed till
 to day INDIAN TRUST FUND
 BONDS Mr CRAIG Will thegentleman
 from Indiana allow me to
 offer a resolution for reference
 merely Mr COLFAX Certainly Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri Let it
 be read by its title
 and if objection be made
 I will withdraw it There
 being no objection a joint
 resolution making provision for the
 recovery of certain bonds belonging
 to the Indian trust fund
 and for other purposes was
 read a first and second
 time and referred to the
 select commit tee of five
 on that subject JOHN ROGERS
 Mr STOK ES asked and
 obtained the unanimous consentof the
 House to discharge the Committee
 of the Whole House from
 the furtherconsideration of House bill
 No 924 granting a pension
 to John Rogers of Tennessee
 POSTAL SERVICE Mr COLFAX now
 call up House bill No
 950 in relation to the
 postal service The bill was
 taken up for consideration Its
 preamble recites that in several
 States of the Union the
 judges district attorneys and marshals
 com missioned by the Government
 of the United States for
 said States having resigned their
 offces and it appears impracticable
 in consequence of revo lutionary
 proceedinæs therein to fill the
 vacancies thus created that the
 Government of the United States
 is thus without any means
 of collecting or enforcing in
 such States the payment of
 the postal revenues from the
 officers collecting the same or
 of punishing violations of the
 postal laws com mitted by
 robberies of the mails or
 otherwise or of enforcing the
 performance of mail contracts It
 therefore enacts that in all
 States which are or may
 hereafter be situated as above
 the Postmaster Gen cral is
 hereby directed to discontinue the
 postal service for such period
 of time as in his
 judgment the public ii terests
 may require and shall report
 his action to Congress Mr
 COLFAX I stated to the
 gentleman from North Carolina the
 other day that before I
 should ask the House to
 vote on this bill I
 would give him the opportunity
 of being heard In compli
 ance with that promise I
 now yield him the floor
 with the understanding that I
 shall have it after he
 gets through Mr BRANCH The
 gentleman from Indiana was kind
 enough on Thursday last when
 this bill came up in
 Its regular order in consequence
 of a representation from me
 that I was engaged on
 the select committee of five
 and could not be present
 to postpone it till to
 day I desire to make
 a few remarks in regard
 to this bill and I
 shall offer an amendment to
 it before I take my
 seat It seems to me
 mostextraordinary Mr Speaker that a
 bill of the character of
 this proposing to deprive the
 people of a large number
 of the States of the
 Union of their mail facilities
 on the ground that the
 laws in relation to the
 mail service in those States
 cannot be executed should be
 passed without Congress being informed
 by the commit tee proposing
 it or by the Post
 Office Depart ment that any
 obstructions exist in these States
 to the execution of those
 laws We are informed that
 the Post Offce laws have
 been up to the present
 time uniformly and faithfully executed
 and obeyed in the State
 of South Carolina The postmasters
 in that State are regularly
 collecting the postage revenues and
 accounting for them to the
 Government We have not been
 informed by the chairman of
 the Post Office Committee that
 any robberies of the inail
 have been committed in that
 State or any other offense
 committed against the Post Office
 laws that have not been
 amply and entirely punished or
 that there are means there
 in existence for punishing When
 ever such cage oceurs and
 when this House 75ß is
 informem that the Post omce
 laws cannot be _ executed
 in the seceding States in
 conse quenqe of the want
 Of offcers of the courts
 itwiil be time enough for
 us to consider whether any
 legislation is necessary by Congress
 to meet the emergency No
 one knows better than the
 chair man of the post
 Offce Committee that whenever any
 obstructions do exist there or
 whenever from any cause the
 Postmaster General finds it to
 be to thepublic interest to
 discontinue the mail service in
 those States he is vested
 with power under existing laws
 to discontinueit at his pleas
 ure He can discontinue the
 mail service in every neighborhood
 in every State in every
 county in which he finds
 that from any cause the
 laws for the protection Of
 the mails cannot or will
 riot be executed We have
 already provided amply for all
 the mischiefs that are likely
 to arise in those States
 and if any unforeseen difficulties
 occur it is not necessary
 for us to pass a
 broad law that shall strike
 all the people of an
 entire section of the Union
 The Postmaster General can adjust
 his remedy to thc diffculty
 that exists He can discontinue
 the mails in those States
 or neighborhoods Where the Post
 Office laws cannot be executed
 But the chairman of the
 Post Offce Committee proposes now
 not to confine the blow
 to those who offend against
 law but also to make
 those Who are inoffensive and
 who are ready to obey
 every behest of the law
 responsiblefor the misdeeds of others
 Mr Speaker we must treat
 these States either as being
 in the Union or out
 of the Union If they
 are in the Union if
 the Post Office Committee acknowledge
 them to be in the
 Union then 1 sub mit
 that it IS a most
 uncrracious act to withdraw from
 them all the beneficent laws
 of the Union and to
 impose upon them only such
 of its laws as inflict
 burdens and injuries on them
 If they are in the
 Union they are entitled to
 equal postal facilities with the
 other portions of the United
 States If however that committee
 are of the opinion that
 these States are out of
 the Union and arc prc
 pared to acknowlcd c them
 as being out of the
 Union then I have not
 a word to say against
 I do not know a
 form in which the inde
 it pendence of those States
 can bc recognized any better
 than by withdrawing from them
 the pöstal If such be
 the ob facilities of the
 Government ject of the Post
 Office Committee in proposing this
 bill I can only say
 that think they are a
 little premature I myself am
 not yet prepared to with
 draw the laws of the
 Union from thosc States however
 much I am opposed to
 attempt to exe cute those
 laws at the point of
 the sword or at the
 cannon s mouth If it
 is intended by this bill
 to recognize the independence of
 those States I will not
 argue it with the chairman
 of the Post Ofiice Cornrnittee
 at all Hc and his
 friends_may take their owri course
 in regard 10 it If
 they will acknowledge the indcpondcnce
 of those States that will
 at least give us security
 against what I regard as
 the greatest ill that cun
 beiåll our racc on this
 continent that is civil war
 13ut sir there is a
 point of view in which
 I may and will enter
 my protest against this bill
 tho gelltleman frorn Indiana aware
 that through all that section
 of country in which these
 seceded States lie there exists
 the most intimate relation ship
 and the largest and Inosl
 intimate intercourse between the people
 of States that have seceded
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 5 be
 anything else Because Mississippi secedes
 from the Union is North
 Carolina to be punished equally
 with Mississippi How long willlit
 be before you bring in
 laws here to make it
 criminal perhaps to make it
 constructive treason for us to
 love the members of our
 households in those States You
 do not propose that we
 shall com municate with them
 A citizen of Virginia can
 not write to his brother
 or his father who is
 in the State of Mississippi
 If you can do that
 why cqn you not also
 as a means of coercing
 and pun ishing these people
 for what you call their
 act of rebellion declare that
 their brothers shall not even
 love them without being guilty
 of constructive treason I assure
 the honorable gentleman from Indiana
 that if his object is
 to bring back into the
 Union the States that have
 seceded his measure is not
 If you only unnecessary but
 it is mischievous pass such
 a law as this and
 execute it and fol low
 it out you may drive
 out of the Union States
 that arc now steadfastly in
 it Mr Speaker I cannot
 but think that this bill
 is ill considered or not
 considered at all 1 know
 it is ill advised You
 have raised a special com
 mittee of five to which
 you have referred the whole
 subject growing out of the
 secession of States That committee
 have reported two bills that
 are now upon your table
 One of them proposes to
 cut off their commerce and
 de stroy their intercourse c
 ommercially with all the world
 except the people of the
 northern States thc other proposes
 to vest in the President
 the power to call out
 the Army and Navy to
 call for volunteers and not
 confining him even within your
 own limits he may hire
 as many Hessians and Swiss
 as he can hire in
 Europe to assist in reducing
 to submission the seceding States
 and in taking possession of
 the public property now in
 their hands These two bills
 if passed into laws must
 certainly satisfy those who are
 most If they become vengeful
 against these States laws and
 you can succeed in executing
 them at the point of
 the bayonet I think every
 one will admit that these
 States will have been sufficiently
 punished for what you call
 their act of rebellion Why
 come in with this bill
 not aimed at citizens of
 these States alone but involving
 in its conse qucnces the
 citizens of other States that
 have not seceded and are
 not expected to secede I
 said it was ill advised
 and unconsidered that the Post
 Office Comrniuee could not have
 looked at this bill in
 all its bearinms or they
 would have inserted some provisions
 to prevent these consequences I
 know the bill was intro
 to which I allude duced
 into the House on one
 day referred to the Committee
 on the Post Office and
 Post Roads and reported back
 to the I louse i
 believe on the and of
 those that I lave not
 In North Carolina and Virginia
 you cannot go into a
 neighborhood that is not bound
 to the pöople of t
 bose seceding States by the
 tenderest of ties You can
 scarcely go into a household
 from which some member has
 not gone and settled in
 some of those seceded States
 Our business relations are also
 of the Inost intimate character
 I know that in the
 State of North Carolina there
 is not a county and
 I scarccly a neighborhood where
 there are not loyal and
 faithful citizens of this Republic
 who have large property in
 the States that have se
 ceded Docs the gentleman from
 Indiana pro pose in order
 to punish those Stales Lo
 inflict punishment also on us
 Shall not my constitu ent
 who is loyal and true
 to the Union bo allowed
 to receive cornmunication In regard
 to his plant ing interests
 in the Stiites of Mississippi
 or Ala hama because those
 States bavc seceded Do you
 propose to involve us in
 the punishment which you inflict
 on our brothers If yon
 do I can only inform
 you that if you _
 regard it as a measure
 you will find it prove
 to very next day The
 committee therefore could not have
 given it very much consideration
 If they had not been
 in such hot haste to
 cut off tho priv ilcges
 of these seceding States if
 they had taken a little
 morc tirne to consider it
 they could perhaps have brought
 forward something that w Ilile
 it inflicted chastisement upon the
 seceding States would have also
 protected thc States that have
 not seceded I can assure
 gentlemen I can assure the
 I louse that if this
 bill passes and you attempt
 to execute its provisions I
 do not believe that bv
 any law you can pass
 or any rne asurcs of
 adjusiment you can adopt you
 can keep thc people bfMaryland
 Virginia North Carolina Tennc ssec
 and Ken If you undertake
 to lucky within your Union
 cut off intercourse and communication
 between them and the seceding
 States if they have one
 particle of kpirit about them
 neither armies nor anything else
 can keep them in the
 Union I can write to
 Ei gland and your Government
 will af ford facilities to
 convey In y letter to
 its destina tion The citizen
 of Massachusettscan write to his
 friend in Canada and your
 laws furnish every ruard against
 any detention of his letter
 and place b every possible
 facility in his possession br
 corn I munic ating with
 that friend can write to
 any part of the world
 and my letter will be
 carried by my own Governrnent
 as far as its jurisdiction
 extends and where its jurisdiction
 ceases it se cures by
 negotiation with foreign Governments still
 further guarantees for the transmission
 of my letter through other
 countries You gentle men do
 not propose to cut of
 F any of these facil
 ities from the commercial people
 of the North but you
 come here Wilh the measure
 which is now under consideration
 and propose to provide that
 the cotton planter of my
 State and the sugar planter
 in the State of Tennessee
 or Kentucky shall be prevented
 from communicating with his own
 prop erty at least on
 as favorable terms as he
 can Oom municate with England
 with Canada or with Russia
 Your bill meets not only
 the emergency that you say
 you have to provide for
 but it goes It riot
 only punishes those who far
 beyond it havc offended you
 butit inflicts more serious pun
 ishment still upon those whom
 you yet favor with your
 gracious protection I tell the
 gentleman from Indiana that if
 he passes this bill into
 a law it cannot and
 never will be executed in
 my opinion on the State
 of North Carolina He can
 take my declaration for svhat
 it is worth that is
 my opinion Before closing I
 desire to offer an amendment
 which I think will appear
 so obviously just that even
 the chairman oftbe Committee on
 the Post Offce and Post
 Roads will not object to
 it I move to add
 the following section SEC 2
 Be it further enacted That
 after the mail ser vice
 has been discontinued in any
 State or States under the
 provisions of the first section
 of this act it shall
 be the duty of the
 Postmaster General when notified that
 the inhabit ants or constituted
 authorities thereof have made arrange
 ments for the transportation of
 mails at their own and
 expense to enter into arrangements
 with then for the ex
 change of mails and the
 reciprocal collection of postages at
 least as favorable to them
 as the existing arrangements with
 Canada for similar purposes are
 to the Government and people
 of that province Mr COLFAX
 I raise thc question of
 order that mötion to recommit
 is pending and of course
 the bill is not susceptible
 of amendment Mr BRANCH I
 understood the gentleman from Indiana
 to yield me the floor
 Mr COLFAX yielded the floor
 to the gen tleman from
 North Carolina for the purpose
 of addressing the House but
 the gentleman from North Carolina
 is too familiar with the
 rules not to be aware
 that no motion to amend
 is in order while the
 motion to recommit is pending
 Mr BRANCH Well sir if
 the motion to recommit is
 voted down an amendment will
 be in order and I
 hope I may have an
 opportunity of submitting this amendment

 met are forwarded They have
 House and that the Speaker
 be authorizéd to been met
 I regret to know But
 sir they would appoint two
 members as tellers The motion
 was agreed to POSTAL SERVICE
 AGAIN Mr SICKLES Mr Speaker
 there legal necessity for the
 passage of a bill Of
 this charac ter There is
 no powrer in any of
 the seceding States to protect
 the mails of the United
 States There is no power
 in any of the seceding
 Siates to punish any criminal
 offense which may be per
 petrated upon the mails As
 there are no courts there
 which would entertain jurisdiction of
 any offense charged to have
 been committed in any of
 the seceding States therefore ec
 necessitate rei the government of
 tho United Yates must either
 subject the mails to the
 hazard Of every possible trespass
 and depredation or else withhold
 them from those seceding States
 Mr HINDMAN Will the gentleman
 yield to me for a
 moment Mr SICKLES With pleasure
 Mé HINDMAN While 1 shall
 for this bill acknowledging as
 it does independence of the
 seceding States yet sir my
 impression is that in the
 seceding States the laws of
 the United States not specially
 declared null and void are
 expressly continued in force Mr
 SICKLES My attention has not
 yet been called to that
 extraordinary inéonsistency I have yet
 to hear of the principle
 upon which a sovereign State
 asserts its independence and still
 allows the laws of a
 foreign jurisdiction to be en
 forcéd within its boundaries and
 I trust that no State
 holding the dignified attitude which
 these States claim either us
 members heretofore of this Union
 or as independent States will
 occupy such a position Mr
 HINDMAN 1 have no desire
 to inter rupt the gentleman
 unnecessarily I do not un
 t derstand it is the
 intention of the seceding States
 that thc Unitcd States shall
 enforce its laws within their
 limits but those laws having
 been enacted and they having
 previously submitted to their enforcement
 within their limits they of
 their own act and by
 their own authority provide for
 their future enforcement until sucl
 n time as they In
 that 1 shall deem fit
 to declare their repeal see
 nothing derogatory to their assumption
 of authority Mr SICKLES The
 gentleman from Arkansas is a
 good lawyer and I am
 quite confident if he were
 intrusted with the defcnsc of
 a person ac cused of
 a crime upon the mails
 of the United not be
 safe I maintain under existing
 legiSlation and in the present
 condition of relations between the
 United States and the seceding
 States that it would be
 most hazardous to forward remittances
 between the seceding States and
 the remaining States of the
 Union Now Mr Speaker as
 I have already remarked I
 would not vote for this
 as a measure o coercion
 but just so far as
 you can suspend the operation
 of your laws upon the
 seceding States you ob viate
 the necessity of coercive measures
 affrm a tively pressed by
 the Government of the United
 States Pending these disastrous events
 I woUId confine the Government
 of the United States strict
 ly as far as it
 is possible to do it
 consistent with the acts of
 the seceding States themselves to
 a defensive line of policy
 over thc public property over
 the public vessels which are
 indisputably ours and especially over
 those places where jurisdiction has
 been ceded to us by
 the south ern States themselves
 there I would maintain a
 strictly defensive attitude and I
 would defend I it firmly
 I would defend it adequately
 I would defend it without
 yielding to menaces or to
 at tempts at coercion from
 any quarter whether it proceeded
 from the seceding States themselves
 or from the allies they
 may seek elsewhere Ap plauso
 But with reference to affirmativc
 measures of coercion to be
 adopted on the part of
 the Govern ment of the
 United States there I would
 draw a broad and clear
 line of distinction and especially
 in respect of laws tbc
 enforcement of which can only
 be accomplished through the aid
 of the magis tracy Of
 these sir the postal laws
 form a dis tinct class
 With respect to the reveriue
 laws they are not administered
 bv internal machinery at least
 to any considerabie cxtcnt They

 purposes of insurreetion and therefore

 TOOM BS arid I regrötthat
 the Mayor Of Nbxi r
 Yotk was so unmindful Of
 What was due to my
 city and to ox v
 n position to have sent
 the craven answer to which
 he ap pended his name
 But to resume the current
 of my argument at the
 point where I yielded to
 t l ié interruption of
 my friend from Arkansas Levus
 hot at a crisis like
 this confound ideas Let usnot
 confuse our proceedings by afailui
 e to discriminatc carefully between
 what we may rightfully do
 in the dis charge of
 our duty and what would
 be cruel and unwise to
 do in yielding to passioqs
 Tolådmin ister this Government to
 protect its proper ty to
 guard its mails to hold
 the scales 0fjustiée eien and
 true as between those who
 are and those who are
 not in harmony can never
 bé coercion but it is
 the simple and honest dischäi
 ge Of our sworn duty
 To that extent I would
 go no fui ther The
 President of the United States
 lias solemnly announced to the
 people of this Country that
 he will not adopt tbc
 policy ofcoercion It has not
 been adopted The Congress of
 the United States in the
 presence of event s which
 all concede to be revolution
 has abstained from any and
 every measure of coercion Yet
 we have seen no re
 sponse to this policy which
 only escapes the charge of
 being pusillanimous because it is
 con ceived in forbearance in
 fraternal affection in the hope
 that peace may be restored
 for if we were to
 accept a declaration that there
 shall be no appeal except
 to the sword then sir
 none of us would like
 to be held responSible for
 tolerating series of events which
 håve reduced this Govern ment
 if it were powerless indeed
 to prevent be enforced as
 General Jackson proposed to en
 them or escape their consequences
 to a condition force them
 by a ship of war
 lying off the harbor among
 the nations of t he
 earth as contemptible and not
 encroaching upon the territorial jurisdic

 occupied has been tion of
 a seceding State But the
 postal service lofty cannot be
 so enforced The postal service
 cannot be enforced and adequate
 protection given to the Now
 sir there has been no
 coercion attempted mails without placing
 within the territorial juris i
 On thc contrary every pledge

 has exposed the Government to

 by this Govern the head

 has not yet been recognized

 acts disrespectful of its authority

 heart of every patriot in

 Mr SICKLES I have yet
 to learn that the lead

 that good ceded that it
 is a question in abeyance

 the only one arms to
 which the gentlema n alludes
 belong to would come out

 claimant has appeared and I
 Now sir with reference to
 the suggestion of consistent with
 principle Certainly it cannot be
 the distinguished gentleman from North
 Caröiina objected to as a
 coercive proposition Far from am
 glad to know it Mr
 T00MBs I am reminded It
 simply sent a telegraphic dispatch
 of an extraordinary deprecating the
 application of such a measure
 as it As such i
 could not vote for it
 character to the Mayor of
 New York to which this
 upon his State his loyal
 his noble his gal amounts
 to this that you propose
 to suspend the operation of
 laws the enforcement of which
 is he sent a reply
 equallycxtraordinary Laughter II lant State
 or to the State of
 Maryland or any impossible We
 propose to withdraw from the
 If I had been the
 Mayor of NC v York
 I would other State which
 yet remains within the Union
 jurisdiction of a seceding State
 our property have sent a
 different answer to the message
 of 4 where we have
 courts where we have ma
 gistracy where we have the
 means of enforcing wherein it
 is impossible to protect it
 So far as Mr Toombs
 and especially in view of
 the men this is a
 question to bc considered with
 reference acc which was at
 the end of it for
 he told the the laws
 legitimately and regularly why sir
 i to individual and private
 inconvenience the mer Mayor of
 New York that it was
 important for venture t chants
 of New York will suffer
 in a pecuniary New York
 that he should know whether
 the act be guilty of
 the offense and the insult
 tothe k Y alty of
 those States of thinking of
 such a propo poinl of
 view one hundred fold more
 than the was justified The
 loyalty of New York to
 south In its application it
 can only be extended sition
 ern citizens should have been
 exempt from that in merchants
 of the South The seceding
 States are in the nature
 of things to States which
 have by indebted millions upon
 millions to the city of
 New sult If I had
 been Mayor of New York
 I would in the namc
 Of New York have repelled
 it and their own solemn
 act repudiated o årjurisdidtion York
 A large portion of this
 indebtedness is The authorities of
 New and deprived us of
 all possible means of protecting

 seceding States which matured in

 or not those our property
 except by force of arms
 January and February not twenty
 per cent has arms were
 to be used in an
 insurrection of the Mr BRANCH
 I must have been singularly
 been paid The balance of
 trade is entirely against W
 character which Tohn Brown initiated
 or of the unfortunate if
 the gentleman from New York
 un derstood mc as saying
 that I apprehended this the
 seceding States as we all
 know and this is character
 which t hc State of
 Georgia initiated 758 THE CONGRßSSIONAL
 GLOBE February 5 law would
 be executed in North Carolina
 by dis continuing the mail
 service What I said was
 this and the position which
 I took and the one
 to which the gentleman from
 New York must address hi
 mself if he desires to
 reply to me was that
 when this law has been
 executed in the State of
 Mississippi for instance a citizen
 of N0Tth Carolina who has
 property in Mississippi or who
 has family connections in MissisSippi
 j or who from any
 other cause has occasion to
 have com municanon by letter
 with the State of Mississippi
 cannot have his letter transmitted
 to its destina tion because
 when it comes to the
 border of Mis sissippi this
 Government refuses to carry it
 any further itself and will
 make no arrangement with Mississippi
 for carrying on such letter
 as the merchant of New
 York has arrangements made for
 him to carry his letters
 into the interior of Canada
 Mr SICKLES 1 am obliged
 to the gentle man from
 North Carolina for calling my
 atten tion to the distinction
 which he has made It
 es caped my notice though
 I gave his remarks that
 attention which I always pay
 to whatever falls from his
 lips The argument then of
 the gen tleman from North
 Carolina is one of mere
 per sonal inconvenience but that
 does not operate upon North
 Carolina in any degree approaching
 the inconvenience which would operate
 upon my own constituents We
 send thousands of lettcrs to
 Louisiana Georgia and Mississippi where
 North Carolina sends one deprecate
 thal in convenience I regret
 it and could wish it
 were otherwise but it is
 unavoidable By and by should
 there be no reconciliation should
 the peo plc of the
 different sections agree to separate
 hav Ing found it impossible
 to get along together un
 doubtedly when that state of
 things ariscs postal arrangements will
 be entered into like the
 postal conventions with foreign nations
 like the postal convention which
 exists in the Zollverein or
 like the postal arrangement which
 exists between this country and
 Canada and to which the
 gentleman refers At the proper
 time when the real char
 ucter of our relations with
 thesc States becomes an cstablished
 fact it would be folly
 to refuse to enter into
 convenient stipulations of the ordinary
 char aeter which enters into
 the conventions between independent and
 distinct people But that is
 not the question now This
 Con gress is in no
 position to recot nize anything
 but the normal condition of
 these States the Presi dent
 is in no condition to
 recognize any new rela tions
 It must be derived from
 some new grant of authority
 and in the mean time
 what will you do Will
 you make a failure of
 your Govern ment Will you
 prcserve and enforce the respect
 due to its flag and
 ffive the protection which rightfully
 belongs to Its property or
 not That is the simple
 question Certainly sir I am
 sure that the chivalrous men
 who are leading this move
 nient in the southern States
 will scorn to receivc thc
 benefits of our postal laws
 while they repudi ate our
 revenue laws and insult our
 flag must mean one thing
 or another They cannot intend
 to remain like Moham med
 s coff n betwee n
 Ileaven and earth neither in
 or out of the Union
 cretting all the benefits that
 they can secure and ubjecting
 us to all its burdens
 What do they say They
 say they are willing to
 accept the postal servxce we
 paying for it but they
 will not allow us to
 collect the revenue which would
 go towards defraying the expenses
 Mr BRANCH I would ask
 the gentleman from Néw York
 to specify in what State
 they have refused to allow
 the collection of the revenue
 from posta es Mr SICkLES
 Oh from postages Ido not
 know Mr COLFAX With the
 gentleman s per mission I
 will state that some of
 thc postmasters in Alabama when
 drafts have been drawn upon
 them by the Sixth Auditor
 ofthc Treasury for the Post
 Ohicc Department have answered that
 they would wait until they
 could ascertain the action of
 their State before paying the
 drafts Mr BRANCH Those are
 cases of individual postmasters but
 I x vould ask the
 gentleman from Indiana if he
 has any information that in
 any instance in the States
 that have attempted to se
 cede the public authorities have
 interfered with the collection of
 the revenue from postages I
 would ask him this additional
 question while I am up
 whether the Postmaster General has
 not under existing laws full
 power to discontinue the service
 in all such cases as
 he has alluded to by
 abolishing the offces or even
 discontinuing the mail service entirely
 Mr COLFAX 1 will answer
 the gentkeman that there is
 evidence in the Pos t
 Offce Depart ment that the
 mails are tampered with in
 the States that claim to
 have seceded and there is
 no authority by which you
 can protect the letters against
 being tampered with A man
 may take letters that do
 not belong to him from
 the mail in the public
 streets and open them and
 there is no tribunal before
 which he can be brought
 for that I will add
 that it is well known
 that the offense correspondence between
 this Government and Major Anderson
 at Fort Sumter was stopped
 by the authority of the
 Governor of South Carolina until
 the Governor saw fit to
 allow it to continue and
 it is now continued only
 by his toleration Mr SICKLES
 I suppose sir that gentlemen
 holding public stations as postmasters
 in those States pay over
 what thev receive to the
 b Treas uries in their
 vicinitv ana then sir as
 we have seen in Louisiana
 the Sate authorities after it
 has been collected in one
 mass appropriate it to the
 local In that way all
 the revenues from government the
 postal service and all the
 deposits belonging to the United
 States in those sub Treasuries
 are secured to the insurgent
 States Now frequently sir in
 the sub Treasuriesand mints in
 those States there are large
 amounts of money and bullion
 be longing to private individuals
 which are placed there upon
 deposit orfor coinage or to
 be askayed or to be
 stamped for exportation We have
 no means of protecting private
 or public property in any
 of those States and for
 the same reason that I
 would have suspended the mint
 at New Orleans a month
 ago if a proposition had
 been brought forward for that
 purpose because I could not
 anticipate the security of the
 public and private property there
 for that very identical reason
 I will now in view
 of these acts of spoliation
 with draw the mails from
 a jurisdiction where they are
 not safe Mr Speaker we
 must not close our eyes
 to the new phases which
 events have successively put It
 originated sir upon the secession
 movement as a peaceful remedy
 for grievances As such it
 had thousands and tens of
 thousands of friends at the
 North who were disposed to
 meet it on mid way
 ground and say If you
 cannot abide with us bitter
 as the lesson may be
 we will yield to your
 appeals for a separation That
 was the December phase of
 the secession movement In January
 it assumed a new attitude
 No longer peaceable no longer
 disposed to await the consent
 or even the deliberations of
 the Government forci ble possession
 was taken of our forts
 and arsenals and arms and
 we were menaced in advance
 with all the terrors of
 civil war our flag was
 insulted and the authority of
 the Governmcnt contemned When this
 new phase of the secession
 movement was presented those partisans
 of the southern cause who
 up to December defended it
 manfully became only the apologists
 of the erring acts of
 In February it assumes yet
 a new their friends phase
 I can only characterize it
 as the Mexican method of
 revolution When Robles and Mira
 mon and Santa Anna are
 engaged in revolutionary movements and
 a Government conducta of specie
 comes within their reach it
 is seized upon and they
 say we will count every
 dollar of the coin and
 when we settle our quarrel
 with you why then the
 money will all be safe
 and we will pay it
 over Mr WINSLOW I would
 ask the gentleman if he
 has any information that any
 money what ever belonging to
 the Government of the United
 States has been seized by
 the governments of the se
 ceding States Mr SICKLES Yes
 sir 1 have it from
 the Treasury Department Mr WINSLOW
 I speak now with reference
 to the sub treasuries Mr
 SICKLES 1 speak of the
 bullion be longing to the
 United States about nine tons
 of silver seized the other
 day in New Orleans Mr
 WINSLOW Does the gentleman rely
 upon newspaper reports Mr SICKLES
 No upon offcialinformation Mr WINSLOW
 The as that publ shed
 in the newspapers Mr SICKLES
 Substantially the same but worse
 I am sorry to say
 There has been an other
 mint seized in Georgia which
 is to be held for
 our benefit at some future
 day in the generaf settlement
 Now that may be very
 proper bub I am not
 disposed to put the mails
 in the same pcocess of
 liquidation because the receivable dfäfts
 and warrants on the sub
 treasuries and war nts on
 the postmasters in the seceding
 States and all the machinery
 of the Government which elates
 to the public funds would
 not be in a good
 condition of administration under such
 circumstances But sir to resume
 at the point where I
 yielded to my esteemed friend
 from North Carolina and to
 bnng these remarks to a
 close I want to call
 the attention of gentlemen again
 to these nex v phases
 which this movement in the
 progress of events yielding entirely
 to the passions of the
 hour and repudi4ting reason has
 assumed In November it was
 peaceable secession We com h
 In January it was I
 am for it agree to
 that forcible secession and then
 sn your friends in the
 North were transformed into timid
 apologists In February it is
 spoliation and war And I
 say in the presence of
 this new and last phase
 of the secession rnovement that
 it can have no friends
 in the North it can
 have no apologists in the
 North and there will soon
 be no exception to the
 general denunciation which it must
 en counter from the loyal
 and patriotic citizens of this
 country STATE OF UNION The
 SPEAKER stated that the morning
 hour had expired and that
 the House would now pro
 ceed to the consideration of
 the special order being the
 report of the special committee
 of thirty three on the
 disturbed condition ofthe country on
 which the gentleman from Maryland
 Mr HUGHES was entitled to

 FROM THE PRESIDENT A messao

 from the President of the
 United States by Mr GLoss
 BRENNER his Private Secretary LOAN
 BILL Mr HOLMAN As it
 wants but a few min
 utes of the hour when
 the House will take a
 re cess and as it
 not be pleasant for the
 gen tleman from Illinois to
 be interrupted in his speech
 at that time I move
 that the House do now
 take a recess till seven
 o clock Several MEMBERS That
 motion is not in order
 Mr SHERMAN The gentleman s
 object can be accomplished by
 allowing me to call up
 the loan bill with the
 Senate amendments so that it
 can be disposed o in
 the morning I will not
 ask for a vote on
 it to night There being
 no objection House bill No
 792 authorizing a loan was
 taken up and the Senate
 amendments read Mr SHERMAN The
 Committee of ways and Means
 recommend non concurrence with the
 If they are non concurred
 Senate amendments in then they
 can go to a committee
 of conference I would ask
 the vote to be taken
 upon them now but that
 I am informed that the
 gentleman from Missouri Mr PHELPS
 desires to make some relnarks
 upon them The SPEAKER Then
 the understanding is that this
 bill shall be taken up
 in the morning THE M
 CORMICK PATENT Mr LOGAN 1
 ask to have put upon
 its pas sage a bill
 to which I am satisfied
 there will be no objection
 Mr STANTON If the gentleman
 from Illi nois will permit
 me r have a matter
 here in which It is
 a joint reso he has
 as much interest as I
 lution ektending the timc for
 taking testimony on the application
 of Cyrus H McCormick for
 an 1 wish to have
 it put extension of his
 patent upon its passve The
 joint resolution was read a
 first and second time It
 allows the ftu ther time
 of ninety days to parties
 interested in resisting the extension
 of the patent of Cyrus
 H McCormick for his tent
 reaper or his improvements or
 modifications of the same to
 enable them to take testirnony
 ill opposition to said extension
 to be used bcfore the
 Commissiqner of Patents on the
 hearing of 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 759 the application of
 said McCormick for the exten
 Sion of said patent The
 joint resolution was ordered to
 be en and read a
 third time and being en
 grossed it was accordingly read
 the third time and passed
 Mr STANTON moved to reconsider
 the vote by which the
 joint resolution was passed and
 also moved to lay the
 motion to reconsider on the
 table Ti he latter motion
 was agreed to SALINE LANDS
 IN ILLINOIS Mr LOGAN l
 hcre is a bill on
 the Calendar which I wish
 to ask the House to
 have put upon I will
 make a brief statement in
 re its passacye gard to
 it The ordinance admitting Illinois
 into the Union provided that
 the saline lands in the
 pose of being leased In
 1847 Congress passed a law
 authorizing the Legislature of the
 Slate of Illinois to pass
 a law to seli these
 labds to pur chasers The
 Lcgislature passed such a law
 appointinø a commission to dispose
 of the lands The lands
 were sold in pursuance of
 this aut hor ity and
 the purchasers received their decds
 from the commissioners But on
 examination of the records the
 land department I find that
 there is no record there
 of the reserved lands The
 Commissioner of the General Land
 Office sug gested to me
 that the best plan was
 to get a bill assed
 recognizing the title of these
 purchasers r he description of
 the land is set out
 in the bill with the
 names of the purchasers and
 the bill only recognizes their
 purchases as valid for the
 purposc or making their claim
 of title complete The bill
 is recommended by the Commissioner
 of the General Land Offce
 Mr BINGHAM 1 hope that
 bill be let lie over
 till have an opportunity of
 examining it I do not
 Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois think
 there can be any objection
 to it IVIt BINGHAM 1
 have no desire to delay
 its passage but want to
 examine it Nic WASHBURNE of
 Illinois Then 1 pose that
 the bill bc considered as
 being before the have no
 doubt that House and let
 it lie over it is
 entirely right Mr LOGAN I
 have no objection to thatcourse
 It wili be found that
 my state being pursued ment
 is entirely correct and I
 have a letter in my
 possession from tho Commissioner of
 thc General Land Office which
 I am willing to have
 read COAST SURVEY REPORT Mr
 GURLEY 1 offer the following

 EVENING SESSION The House resumed
 its session at seven o
 clock p m Mr HOWARD
 of Michigan in the chair
 as Speaker pro teonporc and
 continued the dis cussion of
 the report of the select
 committee of thirty three Mr
 LOGAN addressed the House for
 an hour His speech will
 be published in the Appendix
 Mr TI APPAN Mr Speaker
 as one of t e
 members of the committee of
 thirty three ljo ed with
 the gentleman from Wisconsin Mr
 WASH BURN in submittincy a
 minority report recommending the following
 resolution or the consideration of
 thie House Resolved I llat
 the provisions of the Constitution
 are of all the material
 interests of the country that
 it needs to be obeyed
 rather than amended and that
 extrication from present difficulties should
 be looked for in efiOrts
 to preserve and protect the
 public property and in the
 enforcement interests or compronnises and
 concessions to unreasonable demands And
 I desire now very briefly
 to submit my reasons why
 1 could not concur in
 the report of the majority
 and in support of my
 belief that the assaae of
 Chis resolution is all the
 action the Sir I was
 one of the very few
 members d this body who
 voted against the raising of
 this com I did so
 not because I did mittee
 at the outset not fully
 understand and appreciate the perilous
 condition of the country not
 because at the proper time
 I would be unwilling to
 make any reasona ble concessions
 not involving the sacrifice of
 prin ciple to any portion
 of my countrymen who might
 present grievances to be redressed
 but because In the first
 place I believed that the
 appointment of such a committee
 would be the initiative step
 towards some sort of a
 compromise when any comprorn ise
 under the pecuhar circumstances that
 surrounded us would be degrading
 and hu miliating to the
 North and secondly such was
 the madness that ruled the
 hour irf the south ern
 portion of the country I
 did not believe that any
 measures we should be able
 to pass would be productive
 of any good and the
 attempt to make to the
 flame And as events havc
 rolled on every ican flag
 and withjeerS at the Governmentwhieh
 has protected them so long
 hä e declared them t
 selves out of the Union
 Now sir under these circumstances
 I believed and I still
 believe that the first question
 to be ås certained is
 whether we have a Government
 or not And I am
 for postponing all other questions
 and all other compromises until
 this great and vital fact
 is ascertained And I put
 it to the can dor
 of gentlemen on the other
 sidc l ask the gen
 tleman from Illinois Mr LOGAN
 who has just taken his
 seat whether in case they
 had sub ceeded in electing
 their candidate upon the plat
 form of slavery protection in
 the Territories and Massachusetts and
 New Hampshire dissat isfied with
 the result had committed the
 same acts which South Carolina
 and Georgia have com mitted
 they would have made haste
 to get on to their
 knees with an apology or
 if they would not rather
 in the first place have
 taken measures to ascertain whether
 the Government of the eoun
 hour Ilia only confirmed me
 in the correctness of I
 try had any binding force
 If a decent self re
 my convictions then I believed
 then as I believe now
 that the furor the South
 had takeB the form of
 an epidemic and like a
 raging fcvcr m the hu
 man system it must have
 itg run In such cases
 if the constitution of the
 patient is strong enough to
 grapple with tho disease he
 will live and if not
 in spite of all the
 nostrums that may bc ad
 ministered by quacks around the
 bedside wili die And so
 with this epidemic in the
 national system If the Constitution
 of the country has not
 I strength enough to carry
 the nation through this crisis
 no prescriptions that this Congress
 can apply will be likely
 to effect a curc But
 sir I have faith in
 the patriotism of the creat
 nna ss of the 15eople
 I have fait h in
 the Con It is apparently
 weak now and the stitution
 demon of a treacherous disease
 seems to be run ning
 riot throughout its whole frame
 work But it is strong
 nevertheless and in the end
 will put forth its power
 and the country vvill rise
 from its spect would have
 prevented them from doing this
 I nay be pardoned for
 declining to do the same
 thing Mr Speaker if this
 Government isa mere cob web
 with no power for its
 own preservation it is utterly
 useless to try to tinker
 and patch it up If
 the Union is so utterly
 by compromises weak and helpless
 that thc first breath of
 treason is sufficient to destroy
 its vitality it will be
 good I fot nothing aft
 er ibis saved and thc
 time spent in trying to
 save it wili be worse
 than thrown away So believing
 Mr Speaker I was for
 nar rowing the issue as
 soon as possible to the
 ques Lion of Union or
 no Union Government or no
 Government and ascertaining who was
 for the Government and who
 against It And I solemn
 y believe if the entire
 mass of the Republican party
 in Congress and out had
 from the start boldly maintained
 this position instead of fritteri1V
 away the time in feeblc
 attempts at compro prostration hcaithicr
 and more vigorous than cvcr
 misincr what cannot be compromised
 in half apolooiziog for having
 had the temerity to elect
 before Mr Speaker if I
 urn mistaken in thc result
 that is now to fi
 llow from the prcecnt condition
 of I public affairs I
 am sure that I cannot
 be mistaken that such would
 have been the result if
 a square bold and manly
 issue had been rnade up
 at the outset for the
 Union and the preservation of
 t hc Government That portion
 of the American pco ple
 who had just succceded in
 electing their Pres dcnt in
 the mode and forms recognized
 by the Constitution had done
 nothing that required apol ogy
 nothing that they ought to
 take back fi i one
 did not go into that
 election to havc the principles
 for which f contended given
 up and abandoned at the
 first howl of those who
 were disappointed at the result
 r Phe Republicans nom inated
 a moderate conservative and honest
 rnan and placed him upon
 a moderate conservative and patriotic
 platfhrm of principles principles that
 embraced every portion of the
 Uniön and protected every material
 interestofthis great Con tuleracy and
 which in no wise conflicted
 with the fundamental law of
 the land It vill scarcely
 be contended even by the
 opponents of the Republican party
 that there was no necessity
 for a change of administration
 Every avenue of the Government
 reeked with fraud peculation and
 corruption prevailed in every department
 until it culminated at last
 in one of the most
 stupendous ofiicial robberies that ever
 astonished the American people all
 going Lo show that the
 change did not con l
 b arnoruent too soon Other
 parties went into the election
 as well as the Republicans
 i vith their rctspective declarations
 of principles and it was
 tile duty of every good
 citizen of whatever party to
 abide peacefully by the result
 If the Republicans had been
 beaten their President we s
 lould have stood stronger to
 day the crisis would before
 now havc been passed aud
 the revolution stayed We would
 by that course have presented
 an issue around which the
 moderate patriotic men in tho
 border slave States who know
 that tho charges against the
 Republicans of designing to interfere
 with any of their constitutional
 rights are false could have
 rallied and standing with us
 on the common platiörrn of
 the Constitution and the Union
 the flood of secession which
 now threatens to over whelm
 them would have bcen rolled
 back The eloquent and patriotic
 speeches of the gentleman from
 Texas Mr HAMILTON and of
 the gen theman from Tennessee
 Mr TOKES buta day or
 two since and other speeches
 of like tone II from
 gentlemen of the border States
 unmistak ingly indicate that such
 would have been the case
 1 hope if the right
 stand had been taken at
 first it is not too
 late now Firmness on the
 part of the Executive and
 firmness and courtlffe on the
 part of the people of
 the free States are in
 my judgment the best antidote
 for the insanity that prevails
 at the South and the
 best remedy to f avert
 the horrors of a civil
 war Every time the people
 of the free States have
 wavered every time her Representatives
 have evinced a disposi tion
 10 filli back onc step
 from their position the secessionists
 with fiercer yells have ad
 vanc ed two And so
 it will be to the
 end we corn promise to
 day we will be required
 to nu te to morrow
 and when the North is
 sufficiently I humiliated there will
 be no diflie ulty I
 appre i bend in reconstructin
 r the Governinent so as
 to place it in the
 hands of the slave power
 forever I Sir I an
 I for making a stand
 so incwhere and I preför
 to make it before I
 start to pun at all
 they would cheerfully have done
 so for they are i
 Mr Speaker as much as
 i detest the lreuson Union
 loving naw abidingcitizens But no
 sooner of South Carolina is
 an audacity mode o doing
 thin2s that almost compels my

 Lincoln definitely ascer taiped than
 the fires of revolution broke

 not attempt to disguise her

 deep seated hatred to the

 Shé flings defiance understanding could
 not be brought ahout with

 indecent haste the disunionists of

 who had authority to speak
 who by théir oven confessions

 for the last thirty years
 have for the Union that
 South Carolina does against it
 But it is said that
 some sorb of a compromise

 regard to the present crisis
 seized the public property taken

 border slave depositories of the

 from joining in the secession
 movement Sir if the security
 and prosperity these States now

 Union if the exposed position
 they would occupy should it
 be dissolved and the utter
 ruin and disaster which such
 an event would bring 0
 0 them whatever might be
 its effects in other of
 the country if the patriotic
 memories of the past and
 the love of the Constitution
 and 6 Union ax it
 i which most of these
 States have been supposed particularly
 to cherish if a better
 knowledge of the people of
 the free States than prevails
 further so_uth and of the
 falsiw of the them if
 all this is not sufficient
 to cause them to pause
 before they take the fatal
 step which shall sever their
 connection with a Government that
 has cov ered them with
 blessings it will be in
 vain to think of placating
 them with any half measures
 that we can adopt What
 guarantee have we Mr Speaker
 that the border States will
 be satisfied with the prop
 ositions reported by the majority
 of the commit tee of
 thirty three What assurances have
 we that any terms of
 settlement short of the recocr
 nition and protection by the
 Gencral Government of slavery in
 the territory that we now
 possess or may hereafter acquire
 south of 360 30 will
 be acceptable to them The
 honorable gentleman from Tl ennessee
 Mr NELSON whose opinions i
 greatly respect and whose character
 and pa triotism command my
 admiration while disposed to kook
 favorably upon the proposition to
 amend the Constitution prohibiting the
 interference with slavery in the
 States is opposed to admitting
 New Mexico as aState and
 gives many and cogent rea
 sons why it would not
 be accepted by his State
 and showing also that it
 would probably be pro ductive
 of more harm than good
 But Speaker suppose that the
 measures proposed by the committee
 or some others short of
 thc ultimatum laid down by
 the cotton States of slavery
 protection in all future acquisitions
 would be received by the
 border States or most of
 them as a final settlement
 of the slavery ques tion
 what then The question still
 remains what is to bc
 lonc with the seceding States
 The ques lion still rematns
 whether we have a Government
 or not capable of naintaining
 the integrity of the Union
 The question would still press
 itself upon us whether a
 single State or half a
 dozen States combined could by
 their rebellious action de stroy
 the unity and nationality of
 the Govern mer t And
 these vital questions as I
 have said f am for
 meeting in limine Not by
 raising armies and marching them
 to the South as the
 gentleman from Illinois Mr LOGAN
 seems to suppose to lay
 the country waste by fire
 and sword in order them
 into the Union but by
 firmly to cocrcc to the
 Constitution of thc country and
 enforcing obedience to the laws
 by all the power of
 the Government And before I
 consent to con cessions cvon
 for the conciliation of the
 border States I desire to
 know where they wilt found
 on this great question of
 maintaining the laws of the
 Union Sir this country presents
 a most melancholy and humiliating
 spectacle before the nations of
 the earth A great nation
 of thirty million peo ple
 ranked as one of the
 first class Powers of the
 world at the first dawn
 of treason in its borders
 retires ingloriously before it and
 to day is seen crumblimy
 to pieces without an effort
 being made to maintain its
 integrity or a finger raised
 to de fend the honor
 of its flag In all
 the tide of time the
 world never witnessed so cowardly
 an exhi bition Now sir
 I desire to inquire what
 would be the effect of
 such a policy as I
 have indicated I would defend
 this capital at all hazard
 and pro tect the public
 property I would collect the
 rev onue in the ports
 of every seceding State cither
 on the land or on
 the sea or I would
 repeal the laws making them
 ports of entry Does It
 follow that this would result
 in general civil war Not
 at all The Government would
 be clearly in th right
 and every arm raised against
 it would be clearly in
 tbc wrong Every act of
 the Govern ment would be
 strictly on the defensive while
 every blow struck against it
 would be the act of
 an aggressor upon its rights
 The Governtnent would be defending
 the priceless inheritance of liberty
 which our fathers bequeathed to
 us at the expense of
 so much blood and treasure
 while its enemies would be
 fighting for its overthrow be
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 5 cause
 they have been deprived of
 political power by the constitutional
 fiavt of the people The
 sym pathies of every Government
 on the earth would be
 on the side of the
 constituted authorities of the United
 States and the prayers of
 every friend of constitutional liberty
 whether in the Old World
 or the New would ascend
 to the throne of Jeho
 vah that this Government founded
 in the prin ciples of
 human freedom and the rights
 of man might not be
 destroyed by the enemies of
 both But under such a
 policy who are the rebels
 to fight If they had
 ships and could man them
 they might attack the vessels
 blockading their harbors But the
 conteSt wiil be unequal Will
 they raise armies to invade
 the loyal States This is
 an entertainment to which they
 would hardly invite themselves Sir
 1 will indulge in no
 threats of what would be
 the result in such an
 event I will make no
 boasts of the prowess of
 any particular section of the
 country I dcsire to say
 no word that can exasperate
 or inflame but simply to
 plane myself on the side
 of my country and the
 integrity of its Government whose
 Constitution I have sworn to
 suppore I deprecate a war
 in which brother shall be
 arrayed agalnst brother and kindred
 against kindred and I pray
 that God may avert such
 a calamity from this land
 Nevertlreless wisely but firmly I
 would have the Government make
 a trial at least for
 its own protection that it
 might not be a scoff
 and by word among the
 nations And then if it
 shall be found to be
 the weak and impotent thing
 which its enemies ima gine
 it to be then it
 will be time enough to
 talk about compromises and a
 division of the coun try
 into two confederacies For one
 I do not care to
 live under a Government Which
 is so feeble as to
 excite only the ccmtempt of
 mankind and which exists merely
 at the sufferance of those
 who may at any moment
 conspire for its overthrow in
 spite of all the concessions
 we may now make And
 I repeat that I desire
 first to know whether we
 have a Government or not
 whether we have a country
 to love and support Mr
 Speaker I know the anxiety
 that is felt by every
 true friend of his country
 such a fear ful crisis
 as the present I knov
 x the freling that is
 uppermost in many a patriotic
 heart to try and do
 something to avert th e
 great calamity wh ich seems
 impending But what can we
 do There are some things
 that the North might do
 without dishonor And although I
 cannot support the measures recommended
 by the committee be cause
 I think they involve a
 surrender of princi pie yet
 if the South should tender
 the restora tion of the
 Missouri compromise simply as it
 was before ruthless hands wrenched
 it from its place where
 it had given peace to
 the country for over thirty
 years and the reckless repeal
 of which has been one
 greatc ause of all our
 woes the North I think
 would be bound to take
 it fairly into con sideration
 Much stress is laid on
 the personal liberty laws and
 they are blazoned to the
 world as the pretended cause
 of all our diffculties and
 the President himself in his
 annual Inessage treated them as
 the great act of wrong
 on the part of the
 North justifying i not repealed
 u dissolution of tho Union
 And yet when in the
 committee of thirty three we
 first set ourselves to the
 task of correct ing this
 grievance as far as possible
 we were told by southern
 gentlemen that it was useless
 to spend time on such
 trifling matters and that it
 did not reach the seat
 of the disease No Mr
 Speaker it does not reach
 the seat of the disease
 The seat of the disease
 is the lost prestige of
 political power it is the
 lust of dominion on the
 part of those who have
 administered the Government so long
 that they thin k they
 have an indefeasible right to
 control its destinies forever A
 nd because the free States
 in consequence of the thrift
 enterprise and progress which free
 labor institutions impart to a
 community have acquired the nu
 merical majority in the councils
 ofthe nation and decline to
 use it to extend protect
 fostec and nationalize the system
 of slavery the Union is
 to be destroyed and the
 Constitution trampled under foot Nor
 sir is the settlementof this
 ques tion so far as
 our present territory is concerned
 of any particular consequence to
 those who have precipitated this
 rcvolution Days were spent in
 committee endeavoring to contrive some
 way to settle the status
 of slavery in territory which
 we do not now possess
 And the proposition for adjustment
 which has been talked of
 most and which it is
 said would probably be acceptable
 to most of the southern
 States that of the distinguished
 Senator from Kentucky Mr CRITTENDEN
 I provides for the recognition
 and protection Qf slavery in
 all ter ritory hereafter acquired
 south of 360 30 Sir
 this a premium offered to
 fiilibustering and ag gressive inroads
 upon friendly Powers for the
 purpose of making room for
 the spread of sia very
 It is the adoption into
 the Constitution of the creed
 of the Nitra portion of
 the Democratic party who broke
 up the Charleston convention because
 the dogma of protection to
 slavery was not inserted in
 the Democratic platform It is
 the arrogant demand of the
 revolutionists of the country who
 if the conservative Union sen
 timent of that section could
 find expression are in a
 meager minority even in the
 southern States not only to
 all those who voted for
 Lincoln but to those who
 voted for Douglas and most
 of those who voted for
 Bell to surrender their convictions
 and principles on pain of
 breaking up the Con federåcy
 Sir this will never be
 done and the free States
 will never concede these terms
 of set tlement let the
 consequences be what they may
 And I appeal to the
 honest masses of the Demo
 cratic party in my own
 State who voted for Mr
 Douglas if they are willing
 because their oppo nents rise
 in treason against the Government
 to adopt the doctrine of
 constitutional and legislative protection to
 slavery in all the Territories
 which may be hereafter acquired
 Sir the proposition known as
 the border States compromise which
 is similar to that of
 the gen tleman from Illinois
 Mr KELLOGG if I under
 stand it is scarcely less
 objectionable It provides that the
 Constitution shall bo so amended
 that in all the territory
 south of 360 30 neither
 Congress nor the people of
 the Territory shall ever inter
 fere with or prohibit slavery
 What sort of a proposition
 is this to those who
 hold that the peo ple
 shall be left perfectly free
 to form and reg ulate
 their own domestic institutions in
 their own way Sir by
 this measure although nine tenths
 of the peoplc might be
 opposed to the introduction of
 slavery the other tenth could
 force it into the Territory
 and compel it to come
 into the Union as a
 slavc State This is as
 effectually protec tion to slavery
 as though it were provided
 for in express terms It
 is only another way of
 reaching the same result Sir
 the Union is dear to
 the people of the north
 ern States they would sacrifice
 much to preserve it as
 it is but a Union
 founded on the protection of
 slavery as its chief corner
 stone is not the Union
 for which our fathers fought
 and is not the precious
 boon which they supposed they
 had transmitted to their posterity
 If the only terms upon
 which the Union can be
 preserved are that the General
 Government by constitutional pro vision
 and congressional enactment shall through
 all time wherever the adventurous
 spirit of our people shall
 plant the American banner be
 pledged to the protection of
 an institution condemned by the
 whole civilized world outside of
 the slave States an institution
 which Mr HUNTER in his
 speech at Charlottesville in August
 last said that southern mcn
 themselves with but few excep
 tions admitted to be a
 moral evil not twenty years
 ago then indeed will thc
 North begin to calculate the
 value of such a Union
 Mr Speaker I will consider
 briefly the par ticular probositions
 reported by the majority of
 the committee In addition to
 the reasons already given I
 am opposed to the proposed
 amendment to the Con stitutibn
 providing against future amendments to
 that ins rument touching slavery
 in the States not becat
 I have any wish myself
 or because I know a
 single Republican anywhere who wishes
 or believes he has any
 right to interfere with slavery
 in the States but because
 there is no need of
 such an amendment I am
 opposed to any alteration of
 the Constitution unless upon the
 most Urgent necessity and then
 never at the demand of
 those or to placate those
 who are in actual rebellion
 against it The Republican party
 in their platform of principles
 are solemnly pledged against any
 such interference or the be
 lief in any rirrht to
 interfere with slavery in the
 States But fi am further
 opposed to the amend ment
 because as has been so
 well shown by the honorable
 chairman of the committee it
 is morally 186f impossible that
 slavery in the States should
 ever be interfered with by
 any amendment to the Consti
 tution With no more slave
 States than exist to day
 there must beforty fwe free
 States before any such amendment
 can receive the sanction of
 three fourths of ail the
 States And lastly I am
 opposed to it because it
 gives to slavery new and
 additional guarantees which the illustrious
 framers of the Constitution did
 not think necessary to insert
 in that instrument They were
 careful to exclude from the
 Constitution the very word slave
 and they regarded slavery as
 an institution which was inconsistent
 with the great ideas upon
 which the Government was based
 and which at a period
 not very remote would gradually
 be done away I am
 therefore unwilling to go further
 than they went in givine
 it constitutional sanction espe cially
 as the workings of the
 system do not par ticularly
 commend it to the enligh
 tened civilization and Christianity of
 the age What the Constitu
 tion gives it I will
 give no more no less
 Nor can I admit the
 force of the appeal that
 because the people of the
 South have been made to
 believe the falsehoods circulated there
 against the Republican party we
 must make concessions that otherwise
 would be improper in order
 to appease their fury Because
 the leaders of the Breckinridge
 Democracy have made the people
 of the South believe that
 Mr Hamlin is a mulatto
 that Lincoln is in favor
 of having the white peo
 ple intermarry with the negroes
 and that the Re publicans
 are to invade their States
 with armies of wide awakes
 and set their slaves all
 free I shall not consent
 to change the fundamental law
 of the land and thereby
 virtually admit the charges to
 be true Many of the
 southern people are evidently in
 that condition of mind where
 they see men as trees
 walking They would not now
 believe it even if every
 Republican should vote in favor
 of this proposition I prefer
 to wait till t he
 madness passes away and then
 see if we cannot reason
 together If that time never
 comes it will not be
 my fault nor the fault
 of the Republican party Sir
 I cannot sympathize with the
 argument of those who attempt
 to draw a parallel between
 the present condition of affairs
 in some of the southern
 States and the revolt of
 the colonies a ainst the
 Government ofGrcat Britain I would
 not dignify the causeless rebellion
 which now exists among a
 portion of the slaveholding people
 of the country so as
 to elevate it alongside of
 the great American Revolution which
 will forever stand forth as
 one of the most sublime
 epochs in the history of
 the If every time a
 discontented minority world after having
 participated in an election shali
 re fuse to acquiesce in
 the constitutional result and threaten
 to pull down the pillars
 of the Govern ment we
 treat them in the samc
 way that Burke advised towards
 the American colonies how long
 will it be before the
 great fundamental principle on which
 this Government rests to wit
 that the majority shan rule
 would be trampked under foot
 and the Government destroyed I
 do not propose Mr Speaker
 to go into a detailed
 statement of all the reasons
 which oper ate on my
 mind against the admission of
 New Mexico as a State
 These are fully set forth
 in the report which I
 signed in conjunction with the
 gentleman fröm Wisconsin Mr W
 nsHBURN It would be a
 sumcient reason for voting against
 it that as a measure
 of peace to those for
 whom it is intended it
 will fail to be satisfactory
 If it fails to be
 acceptable to the gentleman from
 Ilen nessee moderate and conservative
 as he is I do
 not think it will commend
 itself to the people of
 his State 01 those of
 the other border States But
 my chief obiection to it
 is that it virtually surrenders
 although covered up under specious
 disguises the entire position of
 the Republican party in reference
 to the extension of slavery
 into free territory When New
 Mexico was acquired it was
 free territory Since then through
 influ ences from this capital
 and at tho instigation of
 prominent southern men slavery has
 been estab lished there by
 the enactment ofa barbarous bode
 disgraceful to the civilization of
 the age Mr OTERO Thegentlemanfi
 omNewHamp CONGRESSIONAL GLOBØö Mr OTERO
 The entire eastern portion of
 the Territory of New Mexico
 was under the laws of
 Texas which recognized slavery and
 this Gov ernment recoo nized
 the authority of Texas when
 paying Texas 10 000 000
 fbr the eastern portion and
 there slavery existed Mr TAPPAN
 I do not understand it
 to be as the gentleman
 states I understand that the
 Terri tory of New Mexico
 when we acquired it was
 free territory and I have
 yet to learn that it
 was ever slave territory till
 by the enactment of the
 slave code there it was
 so declared By the organic
 act of the Territory Congress
 has the reserved right to
 annul these laws and at
 the last session a bill
 to that effect passed this
 House but failed in the
 Senate By now admitting her
 into the Union on an
 equal footing with the other
 States we in effect approve
 this barbarous legislation sanction the
 proceedings which forced slavery into
 the Territory and bring her
 into the Union as a
 slave State But it is
 said by some of those
 who advocate this measure that
 it will be a free
 State If this is so
 then it is no concession
 to tlie slaveholdino States and
 it is absurd to suppose
 that secession is to be
 prevented by the admission of
 another free State No if
 it comes ill at all
 it comes as a slave
 State carved out of territory
 that is froe or which
 it is the duty of
 Congress to make free The
 same influences that established slavery
 there will also cause it
 to remain It is truc
 there never may bc many
 slaves but still to all
 intents and purposes it will
 be a slave State To
 this I can not consent
 and I only reiterate thc
 languac re of Mr Clay
 in one of the last
 speeches he over made when
 I declare that no earthly
 power can compel me to
 vote for the extei sion
 of slavery over territory that
 is now free There are
 other and all sufficient reasons
 out side of the slavery
 question why New Mexico ought
 not to bc admitted as
 a State Her system of
 peonage or white slavery the
 paucity of her white inhabitants
 the mongrel character of the
 mass of her people and
 their entire unfitness to be
 incorporated Into the Union having
 equal weight at the other
 end of the Capitol and
 upon equal footing in all
 respects with the old States
 are enough of themselves to
 deter me from voting for
 this measure Added to this
 is the fact that the
 people of New Mexico do
 not ask to be ad
 mitted mto the Union as
 a State but arc under
 stood to be opposed to
 it Her people have never
 paid any taxes and it
 is said cannot be made
 to do so for any
 purpose whatever So that if
 she is admitted into the
 Union we shall be compelled
 to make appropriations to defray
 the expenses of her State
 government out of the national
 Treas ury thus forcing a
 slave State int o the
 Union aoainst her will and
 footing her bills after we
 get Mr OTERO The gentleman
 says that the people of
 New Mexico pay no taxes
 Now as Delegate from that
 Territory I venture to say
 that the people of the
 State of New Hampshirc do
 not pay to day larger
 taxes than the people of
 New Mexico do New Mexico
 does not owe a dollar
 of debt She pays to
 thc ministers of the religion
 there the Catholic religion tithes
 amounting to more than the
 taxation of the people of
 New Hampshire Not a single
 county in the Terri tory
 is in debt The Territory
 is notin debt We have
 got no direct taxation but
 ve have indirect taxation Mr
 TAPPAN I do not undertake
 to know what theparticular mode
 of taxation in New Mex
 ico is but the evidence
 before the committee from intelligent
 gentlemen long residents in thc
 Ter ritory was that the
 people were averse to being
 taxed for anv purpose and
 were opposed to a State
 go vernment because they would
 not bc taxed to support
 it And now sir I
 have said ail that I
 propose If this Union is
 to be to say on
 these questioffs broken up it
 will have been done by
 the fanati cism of slavery
 propagandism and the vaulting i
 an lbition of political leaders
 who to do its bid
 ding in 1854 by the
 breaking down of a time
 honored compromisc Ict loose upon
 the land the shire says
 that the Territory of New
 Mexico was fearful agitation which
 has rocked it as with
 a free when it was
 acquired by the Government of
 tempest from that hour to
 this But if such is
 to future glory If that
 time shall speedily Come then
 I say let us press
 The golden cluster on our
 brave old flag In closer
 union and if numberingless Brighter
 shall shine the stars that
 still rcmåin But Mr Speaker
 I will not look beyond
 the present Union to see
 what is behind the vail
 that divides us from the
 future I have no desire
 to do so The ate
 I have the honor in
 part to repre sent on
 this floor is small in
 area but she yields to
 none in patriotic attachment to
 the Union and the Constitution
 and I believe the united
 voice of herpeople irrespective of
 party is for the Union
 as it is and the
 Constitution as our fathers made
 it While lier péople will
 faithfully respect all the righ
 tsguarafitiéd by that Constitution to
 the people of the South
 they will not consent to
 the forma tion of a
 new Constitution giving to slavery
 new and additional guarantees which
 those who ori ginaily framed
 it refused to grant it
 is a mistake to suppose
 that New Hampshire has any
 laws upon her statute book
 which are in conflict with
 the Constitution touching the rendi
 tion of fugitive slaves But
 when her personal liberty bill
 was in force if any
 State feeling ag grieved by
 such legislation had come to
 her in the spirit of
 kindness and conciliation there never
 has been a time when
 she would not have been
 metin a like spirit and
 every grievance complained of would
 have been cheerfully redressed But
 she understands what is due
 to her own dignity and
 will yield nothing to menaces
 or threats of a dis
 solution of the Union I
 have said Mr Speaker that
 the people of New Hampshire
 are attached to this Union
 Her patriot sires did much
 to achieve its glorious blessings
 and their sons not less
 patriotic will peril their lives
 in its defense New Hampshire
 was the ninth State the
 låst one required to complete
 the formation of the Union
 and she will be the
 last Her people un to
 desert it in itShour of
 peril derstand their own duties
 and relations to the General
 Government and they understand too
 the duties and relations of
 the people of her sister
 States to that same Government
 State Legisla tures and conventions
 may rcsolve themselves out of
 the Union but the Union
 nevertheless stands And even if
 the Union is nothing more
 than a compact between the
 Statcs thc people of no
 State can be absolved from
 their allegiance to the United
 States until the bond of
 union be tween them shall
 be dissolved by the consent
 of all the States who
 were ori2inally parties to the
 compact i do not then
 misstate the sentiments of her
 people when i proclaim that
 as one of the loyal
 and patriotic States of the
 Confederacy whencvcr tho people of
 any other State shall from
 whatever cause trample down and
 violate the laws of the
 Union the motto of New
 Hampshire will be Thc Constitution
 the Union and the If
 the maintenance of enforcement of
 the laws this doctrine shall
 result in strife and bloodshed
 the responsibility must rest with
 those who pro volccd the
 conflict There can be no
 Union unless the laws of
 the Union are enforced There
 can be no Government unless
 that Government puts forth efforts
 to have its own authority
 respected And when the hour
 of trial comes and patriotic
 hearts arc necessary to maintain
 and the integrity of the
 Union the people of my
 gallant State will respond prornptly
 to the call of patriot
 ism and whethm from foes
 without or foes within will
 defend to the last her
 country s flag They will
 as one man adopt the
 recent language of one of
 her most gifted poets By
 the many hopes the living
 cherish By our faiti k
 in freedom s sacred trust
 By the patriot names that
 cannot perish By the soil
 Inade dear by Langdon s
 dust By the deeds of
 Stark enshrined in story By
 the voices speaking from the
 past By our priceless heritage
 of glory defcnd the Union
 to last But I do
 not apprehend any serious collision
 I R not believe that
 this land is to be
 drenched in the blood of
 fratricidal strife Unless some mad
 attempt should be made upon
 this capital which will never
 be yielded to the enemies
 of the pres ent Government
 let t he cost to
 save or retake it be
 ever so great I believe
 in the final peaceful I
 solution of all our diMculties
 be our fate the Government
 of the United States i
 deny that of America will
 still exist with a territory
 and I will be accomplished
 however by any unmanly the
 United States Mr TAPPAN 1
 prefer not to yield the
 floor The gentleman can reply
 to me if he desires
 to people teeming with all
 the elements of greatness yielding
 or any humiliating concessions on
 either and of freedom of
 unsurpassed progress and of side
 but from the returning reason
 and sense of do so

 mass of the people in
 the south dyn States now
 misguided and led astray by
 the fa sehoods and machinations
 of political leaders who have
 fomented this rebellion to subserve
 their own selfish and ambitious
 ends Let the administration of
 Mr Lincoln once come fairly
 into power let it have
 an opportunity to develop its
 policy as every other Administration
 has done let it maintain
 a wise but firm and
 cided course in the enforcement
 of the revenue laws and
 the protection of the public
 property and it will not
 be long before the eyes
 of the people of the
 seceding States will be opened
 not merely as to the
 real aims and position of
 the Republican party but also
 to the ruinous policy which
 they have been made to
 pursue Then will come the
 time when the conservative patriotic
 men of those States who
 are now submerged by this
 revolu tiönary tide can and
 will bc heard And then
 when the olive branch shall
 be tendered by the people
 of the North When the
 mutual misunder standings are done
 away the people of the

 accordance with the order of
 Postmaster General A V Brown
 of October 23 1858 after
 deducting whatever has been received
 thereon on proof bc ing
 furnished that the service has
 been performed Mr KING Is
 there a report in that
 case so as to let
 us something about it Mr
 WIGFALL There was no written
 re port Thc joint resolution
 passed the House of Representati
 ves and was referred to
 the Committee on the Post
 Office and Post Roads of
 the Senate and was reported
 back unanimously with amend ments
 The report was a verbal
 one The VICE PRESIDENT There
 report Mr WIGFALL There is
 a report from the House
 committee suppose The VICE PRESIDENT
 Docs the Senator from Newyork
 desire that report to be
 read Mr KING Yes sir
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Secretary
 will read it The Secretary
 proceeded to read the report
 made in the House of
 Representatives which is in writing
 Mr HALE It is impossible
 to hear a sylla want
 to hear it but there
 is ble of that report
 such an infernal noise that
 I cannot The VICE PRESIDENT
 It is idle to road
 a report when the noise
 is SD great that it
 cannot be heard The Chair
 will havc to arrest all
 fur ther proceedings until the
 Senate is in a condition
 to hear the report The
 Senate will be good enough
 to come to order The
 Secretary continued to read the
 report Mr GRIMES I move
 that the paper be laid
 on the table and ordered
 to be printed I should
 like to be able to
 understand a little more defi
 nitely what is embraced in
 it and in the propo
 sition that we are to
 voto upon than I can
 learn from the reading by
 the clerk The VICE PRESIDENT
 It is moved to dis
 pense with the further reading
 of the report and that
 it be laid on the
 table and be printed Mr
 HEMPHILL It is a claim
 fot compensation fort services ren
 dered immediately on the introduction
 of Mr Holt into the
 offce of Postmaster General This
 ser vice was rendered at
 the instance of every mili
 tary post on that route
 and of evei y town
 and every settlement They almost
 forced the cone tractor to
 render the service which was
 performed The mails were regularly
 delivered by thevcon tractor and
 all he asks now is
 payment for the service that
 was actually performed That is
 the sum and substance of
 the whole case Mr GRIMES
 I am expressing no doubt
 as to the justice or
 equity of the claim I
 only want to understand for
 myself what it is that
 I am called upon to
 vote on I cannot learn
 from the reading of that
 report by the clerk Mr
 ANTHONY 1 will inquire how
 much money the bill appropriates
 The VICE PRESIDENT The Chair
 cannot answer Mr HALE I
 think the friends of this
 meas ure will consent to
 the motion of the Senator
 from Iowa to let it
 lie on the table and
 be printed We shall have
 the report in a day
 or two and then we
 can undcrstand it Mr WIGFALL
 1 consent so far as
 1 concerned The motion to
 print the report was agreed
 to The VICE PRESII ENT
 The bill is still before
 the Scnate but evidently it
 is the intention of the
 Senate that it shall lic
 over and the Chair will
 so consider it Agreed TERRITORY
 OF COLORADO Mr DOUGLAS I
 move to take up the
 motion to reconsider the vote
 passing the bill to organize
 the Territory of Colorado I
 understand the chairman of the
 committee wishes to have it
 dis posed of this morning
 The motion was agreed to
 and the Senate pro ceeded
 to consider the motion to
 reconsider the vote passing the
 bill S No 366 to
 provide for a temporary government
 for the Territory of Col
 orado Mr WADE I hopc
 that vote will not be
 re considered That bill settling
 so far as this body
 is concerned a very disputable
 matter has already passed and
 gone to the House of
 Representatives and I hope we
 shall not have it up
 again licve the bill as
 it was passed is satisfactory
 to most of the Senators
 and I hopc therefore that
 it will not be reconsidered
 Perhaps we had as well
 have the test on the
 reconsideration as on any other
 question and on that motion
 I ask for the yeas
 and nays The eas and
 nays were ordered Mr BOUGLAS
 I regret that the Senator
 from Ohio has interposed his
 objection to a reconsider 1
 think ation under the peculiar
 circumstances it is an act
 of discourtesy that ought not
 to be sanctioned in this
 body It was well known
 to the Senate that when
 this bill was pending last
 week I laid upon the
 table a substitute for the
 bill and had it printed
 and on that I was
 entitled to the floor and
 I was in the act
 of Offering that substitute when
 we adjourned one day last
 week The other day when
 was called out for a
 very few minutes it was
 taken up and passed pre
 sume inadvertently I was entitled
 to the floor when it
 should be taken up the
 substitute was tying on the
 table and printed All ask
 novy is that the Senate
 will reconsider and allow the
 vote to be taken then
 I am content But I
 do think that under that
 state of facts it was
 unusual and if the attention
 of the Senate had been
 called to it they would
 not have deprived me of
 my right under the circumstances
 Mr GREEN 1 hope there
 will be no sideration The
 Senator can record his vote
 on the motion to reconsider
 _iust as well as he
 could on the direct question
 upon the amendment NO I
 body desired to take any
 advantage of the Sena tor
 nor do 1 think that
 there is any necessity for
 a reconsideration The bill is
 plain and simple E in
 its provisions containing nothingthathfringes upon
 the peculiar viev rs of
 anybody and for that reason
 1 hope the bill will
 be permitted to stand as
 the judgrnent of the Senate
 and that the peo ple
 of Pike s Peak numbering
 sixty thousand may have a
 government and protection accord ing
 to law Mr DOUGLAS I
 can see now very clearly
 that the motion to reconsider
 is not to prevail THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 6 and
 Iam to be dep iveå
 of that courtesy which I
 have never known to be
 denied to a Senator in
 this body before I never
 yet was capableoftaking up a
 fill in the abence of
 a person who had a
 substitute pending without the slightest
 notice to him and thus
 deprive him of an opportunity
 of voting Be it so
 I will give a few
 reasons why I think it
 ought to be reconsidered and
 then the Senate can take
 the vote and there will
 be an end of it
 Mr WADE When I resisted
 this motion to reconsider the
 fact did not occur to
 me that the Senator was
 absent when the bill was
 passed I did know to
 be sure that he had
 offered a sub stitute for
 the bill but as the
 bill was taken up and
 passed and no objection was
 made to it I supposed
 he had waivéd it I
 knew nothing to the contrary
 but if there is any
 particular reason why it was
 not urged then and he
 puts the motion on the
 point of courtesy I should
 not like to be guilty
 of any impropriety in that
 respect and therefore I would
 as lief the question would
 be taken on agreeing to
 the substitute as on the
 re consideration it is immaterial
 eto me I do not
 mean to say that the
 bill satisfies me but it
 was a matter of compromise
 among us did not like
 it very well but it
 was necessary that provision should
 be made fbr the people
 of that Territory and therefore
 we agreed upon the bill
 such as it was as
 a compromise but as the
 Senator plaees the present motion
 on the question of courtesy
 if I am permitted I
 will withdraw the call for
 the yeas and nays Mr
 DOUGLAS Ihavesaid all that 1
 intended to say on the
 point of Courte sy find
 I am will ing that
 the question shall be decided
 on its mer its if
 the Senate choose so to
 decide it was not aware
 of what the Senator from
 Ohio has just stated that
 the bill in its present
 form vas the result of
 a compromise Not having been
 con sultcd in regard to
 the compromise not havilw been
 informed that these conflicting opinions
 had been compromised I certainly
 had no riffht to suppose
 it was so and I
 presumed I coulä sub mit
 my amendment with a füir
 chance of having it considered
 on its merits If however
 it be true fthat the
 two sides of the Chamber
 have com promised on the
 question and that this bill
 is the result of that
 compromise I have no desire
 to disturb it any further
 than to express my reason
 for votint y acrainst it
 In the First place I
 object to the boundary named
 in the bill This boundary
 cuts off a large por
 tion of New Mexico and
 annexes it to the new
 Territory of Colorado The portion
 thus cut off is New
 Mexican territory and formerly belonged
 to the Republic of Mexicp
 The land titles are derived
 from that Government the inhabitants
 are mostly Mexicans they are
 governed by Mex ican laws
 and usages entirely incompatible with
 the laws that we are
 in the habit of making
 for our own people and
 I see no reason why
 they should thus bc separated
 Besides that there are strong
 reasons why it should not
 be done By the laws
 of New Mexico that is
 slave territory Slavery exists there
 by law to day This
 is de but I have
 a further objection to that
 clause At first it struck
 me as harmless but I
 have a fur ther objection
 That clause declaring that the
 Territorial Legislature shall pass no
 law destruc tive of the
 rights Of private property deprives
 the Territorial Legislature of the
 power of laying out a
 road a county road a
 territorial road a rail road
 or any description of highway
 They must have the right
 to condemn private property for
 public purposes in order to
 be able to make means
 of communication It seems that
 in your zeal to deprive
 the Territorial Legislature of the
 power of excluding slavery you
 go so far as to
 deprive them of the power
 of making roads öf ahy
 kind in that Territory Is
 this your purpoée I simply
 point it out and you
 may lob it stand as
 you please Then Iwaive any
 objection on the ground of
 courtesy arid leave the Senate
 to dispose of the question
 as they see pro er
 Mr GREEN Mr President 1
 think that the Senator from
 Illinois is a little unkind
 when he says that he
 is not capable of calling
 up a bill and passing
 it under the circumstances under
 which this passed I suppose
 that he moved his amend
 ment for the purpose of
 having it thrown berore the
 country He is very fond
 of courting popu lar attention
 rather than attending to the
 legisla tion of the country
 If I am mistaken I
 ask his pardon When the
 bill was called up and
 no person proposed his amendment
 as a matter of course
 we vvent through with it
 and passed it and I
 do not think he ought
 to insinuate that there has
 been any corrupt bargain Or
 arrange you have inserted a
 clause that there Shail be
 no Jnent or agreement between
 the different sides of discrimination
 in the rate of taxation
 between dif l this Chaz
 fiber Hoiorablo gentlemen have con
 ferent kinds of property By
 that provision you have declared
 that this Territory shall never
 ex empt a homestead from
 taxation shall never exempt school
 property from taxation shall never
 exempt the property of agricultural
 societies from taxation shall make
 no discrimination whatever in favor
 of the poor a discrimination
 made by every legislative body
 in Christendom so far as
 my information extends If that
 is the object be it
 so I see that it
 has been compromised away For
 one sir I desire to
 leave the Territorial Le gislature
 full power over their domestic
 concerns to regulate them as
 they please subject only to
 the limitations of the Constitution
 of the United States with
 the judiciary to ascertain when
 they violate the Constitution That
 is what I desire to
 do but that is just
 what that Territorial Legis lature
 is prohibited from doing by
 this bill Again sir I
 have had for several years
 to en counter much opposition
 to the Kansas Nebraska bill
 on the ground that we
 would not allow the people
 of the Territories to elect
 their own local officers I
 want to give gentlemen on
 the other side of the
 House an opportunity to vote
 forsuch I bring in a
 proposition that the people may
 elect their own officers There
 was a reason why when
 the Kansas Nebraska bill was
 intro duced that provision should
 not be in the bill
 Then it was thc policy
 to make the Governor of
 a Territory the superintendent of
 Indian affairs Being superintendent of
 Indian affairs he was a
 Federal ofiicer and must be
 responsible to the Federal Government
 The secretary of the Ter
 ritory was a disbursing agent
 a Federal omcer the judges
 of the Territory were Federal
 offcers so far as their
 Federal jurisdiction was concerned and
 they had such territorial jurisdiction
 only as the Legislature might
 confer on them Since then
 the policy has become general
 on having a sepa rate
 superintendent so that the Governor
 need not be a Federal
 omcer The VICE PRESIDENT Will
 the Senator from Illinois pause
 It becomes the duty of
 the Chair to call the
 attention of the Senate to
 the special order Mr DOUGLAS
 I shall leave the subject
 in a few minutes taching
 that portion of slave territory
 a piecc of Mr GREEN
 I move that the special
 order country occupied by men
 of Mexican birth and I
 be passed over until we
 get through with this ques
 habits entirely identified with New
 Mexico and not with the
 new Territory of Colorado and
 at tachingitto the new Territory
 of Colorado What is to
 be the condition of that
 Territory by being incorporated into
 Colorado Is the effect of
 this bill to abolish slavery
 in part of the territory
 thus cut off from New
 Mexico and to make it
 free territory Is that the
 compromise that has been made
 If so so far as
 the question of slavery is
 concerned I do not feel
 disposed to interfere but I
 find after it is thus
 cut off a peculiar provision
 is inserted that the Territorial
 Legislature shall pass no law
 destroying the rights of private
 prop erty MT bat is
 the meaning of that Does
 it mean that the Territorial
 Legislature shall pass no law
 whereby the right to hold
 slaves according to the laws
 of New Mexico shall be
 abolished Is that the object
 Certainly there is some object
 in in serting that provision
 The Senator from Mis souri
 had some object in putting
 that provision in If it
 has been the result of
 a compro tion I make
 that motion Oh no we
 can soon get through Mr
 JOHNSON of Tennessee If it
 will take but a short
 time I shall not object
 Mr GREEN 1 think it
 will take but a short
 time Mr DOUGLAS I want
 but a moment more The
 VICE PRESIDENT By general con
 sent the Senator from Illinois
 may proceed Mr DOUGLAS Since
 these ofiicers are no longer
 Federal my idea is to
 carry out the prin ciplc
 which I then advocated to
 allow the people of the
 Territories to elect those of
 their offcers that are territorial
 and not Federal and have
 the President and Senate appoint
 only such as are Federal
 and not territorial in their
 duties The substitute which I
 have prepared makes that pro
 vision First it makes the
 territorial boundary conform to the
 existing boundary It is not
 liable to the objection of
 raising the slavery question it
 is not liable to the
 objection that they cannot mise
 by which the Republican side
 agreed that II exempt a
 homestead an d other property
 It is this slave territory
 shall be incorporated into the
 not liable to the objection
 that it deprives them of
 the power to condemn private
 property for roads ture shall
 never exclude slavery from it
 if that is and other
 public purposes The present bill
 is their agreement I do
 not wish to interfere with
 it liable to all these
 ob ections Having stated this
 ferred together and they have
 concocted a bill which is
 unexceptionable in all reSpects and
 if honorable gentlemen cannot do
 that then I do not
 know what legislators are sent
 here for better to meet
 together outside of the Senate
 in the committee rooms and
 agree upon the common features
 of a bill than to
 come in here and con
 sume time in debating it
 I do not blame him
 for moving his amendment because
 I take it for granted
 it meets his approbation It
 does not meet mine I
 shall therefore vote against it
 brings up what if he
 had not moved it I
 would denominate the merest humbug
 that ever disgraced the annals
 of Congress but as he
 moved it I will not
 thus denominate it Sir this
 bill is plain and simple
 in all its fea tures
 It brings up no exciting
 subject of dispute it stirs
 the passion of no section
 of the Union it simply
 gives organization organism to a
 people entitled to it On
 the subject of the proposed
 southern boundary of this Territory
 cutting off a portion of
 New Mexico I must be
 permitted to make this remark
 that I thought it ought
 not to be cut off
 but at the same time
 I was compelled to say
 that I thought so simply
 from my desire to please
 the Delegate of that Territory
 and that the proper division
 of the Territery required it
 to cut off It does
 not cut off five inhabitants
 ac cording to my opinion
 and not a single nig
 ger Laughter The idea therefore
 of throw ing slave property
 into a new where is
 all in my eye There
 is not a word of
 truth in it There is
 not a slave in it
 I am told by the
 Senator from New York there
 are only twen ty föur
 in the whole of New
 Mexico Up there around Fort
 Massachusetts north of 370 there
 is not one single slave
 Mr COLLAMER Twenty four is
 the num ber that appears
 by the census returns Mr
 GREEN understand Now Mr Pres
 ident here are Union loving
 and Union saving people petitioning
 and begging for 360 30
 to be the line between
 the slave and non slaveholding
 territory The line of this
 Territory is 370 If we
 are all so keen for
 360 30 when I agree
 to 370 I surely am
 not doing very wrong But
 one word beyond that This
 bill does not prohibit slavery
 anywhere and it does not
 establish slavery any where it
 is a perfect carte blanche
 It is without expression on
 the subject either way The
 Sena tor says that there
 is a very peculiar provision
 put in there that no
 law shall be passed im
 pairing the rights of private
 property If there is not
 such a provision in every
 constitution in the thirty four
 States of this Unzon I
 am deceived and If the
 Senator the other day did
 not say he took no
 exception to that I am
 deceived again but to day
 he brings it up as
 a reason for a recon
 sideration When he comes to
 the other point the discrimination
 in the different kinds of
 prop erty for taxation I
 proved before and repeat a
 ain I copied it from
 his Washington territorial bill and
 from his Oregon territorial bill
 Can it be so exceptional
 can it be so objectionable
 in the Colorado bill when
 he himself put the same
 pro vision in the Washington
 territorial bill and in the
 Oregon territorial bill The truth
 is it is a labored
 effort to find something to
 complain about when the thing
 is right true just and
 proper in itself Now as
 to the other point about
 electing terri torial offcers by
 the people I must make
 this remark lopposeditalways when we
 had a Dem ocratic Administration
 and the appoint 1861 ments
 were to be_ made by
 Democratic Presidents I oppose it
 now although I know Mr
 Lincoln is to make the
 appointments will treat him just
 exactly as I would wish
 to be treated if I
 were in his place and
 precisely as I would wish
 Mr Buch anan to be
 treated when he occupies his
 position as the chief executive
 offcer of this Government I
 make no distinction Let the
 offcers go and if they
 violate the law if they
 neglect their duty if they
 violate the Constitution I will
 hold them to a strict
 accountability arraign thém in the
 Senate impeach them but to
 care for the patron age
 or the selection of friends
 I will not The President
 whoever he may bc has
 a right to have the
 patronace and he ought to
 have it and this attempt
 to dodge that right of
 appointment by say ing the
 people may elect these offcers
 making an independent State which
 is not a member of
 the Union I will never
 consent to Mr DOUGLAS I
 have only a few words
 to say in reply to
 the Senator from Missouri The
 Senator thinks I was unkind
 in referring to the unfairness
 of taking this bill up
 in my absence I should
 not have made the reference
 at all but for the
 objection that was made to
 the reconsid eration in my
 presence afterwards But I will
 off set that unkindness against
 his very great polite ness
 in assuming that I had
 offered an amendment not for
 a practical purposes not to
 be voted upon by the
 Senate but for efli ct
 in the country If he
 thinks there is argument or
 courtesy or de cency in
 such allusions hc is entitled
 to them He will find
 that I offered it in
 good faith and In regard
 to his cry of I
 wanted vote upon it humbug
 against the proposition that the
 peo ple ofa Territory shall
 elect those officers which are
 territorial and not Federal in
 their duties I can only
 say that it applies to
 his allies over there as
 vvell as to mc and
 that in the substitute I
 have proposed I followed the
 model of the first terri
 torial bill ever passed by
 the Congress of the Con
 federation Now sir I have
 only another word to say
 on this question Those boundaries
 in my opinion are wrong
 because they divide New Mexico
 Whether any of thc negro
 slaves returned by the census
 are in that part of
 the Territory or not I
 do not know nor does
 he hence he cannot assert
 with any more knowledge of
 the truth that they are
 not within that part of
 the Territory than I I
 do not know nor does
 he can that they are
 It is slave territory by
 law and then there is
 a provision in this territorial
 bill that they shall not
 destroy private property Now sir
 if the provision was not
 intended to apply to the
 slavery question what is it
 put thcrc for The Senator
 is mistaken in supposing that
 there is the same provision
 in the State constitutions T
 hc provis ron of the
 State constitutions is tl lat
 private prop erty shall not
 be taken for public uses
 without full If he wili
 put in that clause he
 compensation will bring it within
 some known principle oflegis But
 here is a provision that
 private prop lation ertv shall
 not be taken for any
 purpose with or wiihout compensation
 What is it put there
 for The Senator from Ohio
 says compromise Here permit me
 to remark that the Senator
 from Missouri was a little
 unjust in saying that 1
 had insinuated there had been
 a corrupt bargain and compromise
 between the two sides of
 the Cham I made no
 such insinuation The Senator ber
 from Ohio said the provision
 in the bill was the
 commented on his state ment
 and declared that I had
 no knowledge of it I
 did not say that the
 compromise was before corrupt that
 it was dishonorable that it
 was un I did not
 characterize it He charac patriotic
 It does not strike me
 that a terized it as
 corrupt compromise in legislation is
 a corrupt understand ing at
 all but it is very
 proper and very just that
 cohflicting opinio s should be
 compromised in a I will
 mode honorable alike to all
 the parties enter into a
 compromise on any of those
 matters with men of opposite
 parties for the public good
 I and with the v
 mew to harmony in legislation
 might have hestitatcd if I
 had known it was the
 result ofa compromise in procurinff
 a motion to reconsider to
 be made and only referred
 to it in that light
 But I do not wish
 to occupy time My reasons
 for opposing the bill are
 now before the Senate and
 I leave the question to
 be decided by them Mr
 WADE Ido not wish to
 prolong this I said that
 this bill was debate a
 moment sir CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 705
 the result of a compromise
 I undoubtedly stated that fact
 rather stronger than it really
 was I sup posc it
 is well known to the
 Senate and the coun try
 that the two sides of
 this Chamber differ on It
 hap the provisions of these
 territorial bills pened that neither
 of us could organize the
 Ter ritory upon the principles
 we hold and yet it
 was very essential as it
 was proved to us that
 there should be a territorial
 government for the people of
 Pike s Peak There are
 some thirty four thou sand
 people there who have no
 law no organized government The
 different sidcs of this Chamber
 could not agree in carrying
 out the principles that they
 contend for The one side
 intended to make the Territory
 slave territory and the other
 con tended that there should
 be a prohibition of sla
 very in the territorial bill
 Finally we agreed informally there
 was nothing like a compromise
 there was no formality about
 it but we talked the
 subject over and both sides
 feeling the necessity of having
 a territorial organization there agreed
 that there should be nothing
 said about slavery in the
 territorial oroanization one way or
 the other and the bill
 was framed with that view
 It conformed to the usual
 course of legislation upon this
 subject So far as I
 know the bill is precisely
 like all other territorial bills
 with this exception that it
 says nothing about the institution
 of sla very agreed on
 both sides that we would
 report it and permit it
 to be passed by the
 Senate in that shape We
 have passed it without contro
 versy was very glad that
 one thing had passed here
 without any violent debate on
 this subject The bill has
 gonc to the House of
 Representatives and I hope they
 wili concur in it But
 the Senator is now troubled
 with his old I am
 complaint He is a great
 compromiser not much of a
 compromiser but neverthless as this
 measure seemed so equitable there
 being so little to be
 sacrificed on either side we
 thought we might do it
 peaceably without detriment to anybody
 or any section The Senate
 have agreed to it and
 now the Senator says it
 is all wrong because we
 leave the officers of the
 Teu itory to be appointed
 by the President and the
 Senate He has all nt
 once discovered that the people
 ought to elect all their
 offcers Sir that isa ncsv
 I can remember when he
 was very conversion much opposed
 to that principle When we
 or ganized the Territory of
 Kansas he will find that
 his votes were every time
 acyainst the principle that the
 people should elect their judges
 their I agree Governor and
 the rest of their officers
 that I voted then under
 the circumstances to frivc the
 people that power for the
 reason that I had no
 confidence in your Executive not
 a particle Under like circumstances
 I would do so again
 Federal and those only shall
 be appointed by the Executive
 whose Federal and not territorial
 I am not Willinc Thus
 much upon that point to
 acknowledge that lact upon the
 principle i never have and
 never will that I will
 give pa tronage to an
 Administration with whom I agree
 in politics and withhold it
 from one of an oppo
 site party I am surprised
 to find after all that
 has been said on that
 side of the Chamber abOut
 their attachment to principle on
 theSe territörial bills that it
 was only because they were
 out of power and those
 principles are to be abandoned
 the moment they are in
 power We are now told
 that their principles were good
 only while they were in
 the minority and that when
 they have the majority they
 can yield to the executive
 power of this Government to
 produce that resul which it
 was necessary to have done
 by law under an op
 posite Administration Sir desire to
 deprive this Government of the
 power of havingsa ny Fed
 eral policy in regard to
 the politics of the Terri
 tories I gave notice before
 the presidential elec tion that
 I would conform my territorial
 action to In the Senate
 at the last session this
 principle and m my addresses
 before the people I gave
 notice that inasmuch as the
 Federäl duties were taken from
 these officers I would propose
 to make them elective by
 the people I arn an
 advocate of this principle irrespective
 of the success of any
 party at the election Now
 we are told that one
 principle is to prevail under
 a Republican Admin Istration and
 a different one under a
 Democratic Administration Mr WILSON 1
 think sir the Senatorfrom Illinois
 is unjust towards us on
 this side of the Chamber
 in the remarks that he
 has just made I think
 he has no foundation upon
 Which to rest the charge
 that we intend to change
 our policy now that we
 are into power Mr DOUGLAS
 I thought the word of
 the Senator from Ohio was
 good foundation for what I
 said He avowed it Mr
 WADE I ask what that
 word of mine was Mr
 DOUGLAS That you were In
 favor of having them c
 ccted by the people and
 opposed to executive appointments when
 there was a Democratic Administration
 in which you had no
 confidence but that you were
 in favor of appoint ing
 them by the President under
 the Administra tion of your
 own party in which you
 had confi dence Mr WADE
 I snid no such thing
 I said my former vote
 was founded upon a want
 of confi dence in that
 Executive I did not say
 anything about his politics There
 might be Democratic But having
 confidence now in the appointing
 Presidents that I would have
 confidence in but I should
 scrutinize them pretty closely first
 power in this rerritory I
 am willing that you should
 follow the old rule according
 to the prece Laughter Mr
 DOÜGLAS That is a substantial
 avowal dents of the country
 at all times If the
 Senator because the politics of
 the appointing power are that
 the Senator would allow an
 Administration in which he had
 confidence meaning one in changed
 has changed his principle I
 havc no complaint to make
 and if he puts it
 upon that whose policy he
 had confidence to appoint the
 ground have not one word
 to say för I act
 officers but when his own
 party went out of power
 and an Administration that he
 had not con upon that
 and I avow it Now
 sir I do not wish
 to prolong this debate fidence
 in came in then he
 would deprive them As the
 Senator has waived his point
 of courtesy of the power
 of appointing the officers I
 think therefore the Senator from
 Massachusetts will I do not
 suppose hc wishes me to
 withdraw the call for the
 yeas and nays on the
 motion to recon withdraw the
 charge that I have been
 unkind to that side of
 the Chamber sidcr and the
 onposition I rnake now Mr
 DOUGLÅS willing to take the
 yeas Mr WILSON Mr President
 do not think I can
 withdraw the charge alt ogether
 although and na s on
 that as a test question
 Mr WADE very well If
 hc had not waived it
 is somewhat inodified Laughter But
 sir I wish to say
 for myself that I have
 been and I the point
 of courtesy I should have
 f lt bound to withdraw
 the call for the yeas
 and nays and now am
 in favor of allowing the
 people of the permit the
 question to be taken on
 the amend Territories to elect
 their own ofhccrs and I
 will vote for such a
 bill whenever it is introduced
 into I have no more
 to say ment he offered
 Mr DOUGLAS i have but
 a word to say this

 emocratic be sir in reply
 to the innuendo that I
 arn governed by it one
 in which have no confidence
 or bc it Rc party
 feeling in the provision that
 officers rnight publican in which
 I have confidence I wilk
 vote be elected by the
 people instead of appointed by
 to diminish the patronage of
 the President of the the
 Executive 1 repel the insinuation
 The rec United States whenever
 I can properly do it
 I do not see the
 necessity of bringino up this
 ord will prove clearly that
 I was not At the
 I his bill for the
 time to which the Senator
 refers the reason f as
 issuc here upon this measure
 signed for not IYlaking the
 ofhccrs then elective organization of
 the Territory of Colorado had
 a provision in it to
 which the Senator from Illinois
 was that they Federal duties
 that the bill called our
 attention I moved to strike
 it out It as drawn
 by myself made all the
 officers elective I thought then
 it ought to whose duties
 were exclusively territorial and not
 was not stricken out Federal
 Since then the systern has
 been chångcd be out of
 the bill I think so
 now After the dig so
 as to take from those
 officers their Federal du cussion
 then the bill went over
 and it v ras called
 ties and I propose nowr
 by amendment to up the
 other day and oassed during
 the absence this bill that
 those omcers shall be cleeted
 by the i of the
 Senator from Illinois I had
 paid no atten 1 am
 not aware that I tion
 to his amendment people whose
 duties in the Territories are
 not 766 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 6 knew he had
 one We acted upon the
 bill with out regard to
 his amendment and passed it
 and now a reconsideration is
 moved For myself I am
 willing to reconsider it and
 am wiiling to act upon
 the question now or to
 put it off for reflec
 tion and examination I see
 no necessity for ar raigning
 parties here on this subject
 do not know of any
 compromise upon this measure I
 heard from all sides of
 the Chamber that there was
 nothing in the bill that
 could be construed in any
 way in relation to slavery
 and therefore it was understood
 all around that nothing should
 be proposed upon this side
 of the Chamber to be
 put on that subject I
 suppose the bill was drawn
 in that way in good
 faith If so I will
 stand by it but if
 not in good faith I
 repudiate it alto gether and
 wash my hands of it
 Mr I I JGLAS One
 word more and I am
 willing that the vote shall
 be taken The Senator from
 Massachusetts says he is willing
 to vote for a bill
 allowing the people of the
 Territories to elect their ofiicers
 whenever it is introduced Herc
 1 have introduced it in
 accordance with that willingness but
 he sees no necessity for
 its beinø introduced Very great
 willingness is that He is
 willing to favor a thing
 when it is introduced and
 yet he will not introduce
 it himself and com plains
 when others do He votes
 for the bill however on
 the ground that there is
 no word in it on
 the subject of slavery am
 rejoiced to find that the
 two sides of the House
 representing the two sides of
 the irrepressible conflict find it
 impossible when they get into
 poweg to practi cally carry
 on the Government without comincr
 to non intervention and saying
 nothing upon the subject of
 slavery Althoughhhey may not vote
 for my proposition the fact
 thal they have to avow
 that the upon which they
 have fbught nje for years
 is the only one upon
 which they can possibly agree
 is conclusive evidence that I
 have bee right in that
 principle and that they have
 been wrong in fighting me
 upon it My cotn plaint
 is not that they I
 lave coinprornised on Lhat pt
 inqiple but that hen they
 suppose they they put in
 a clause incor sisLent with
 it and I want that
 clause out of the bill
 no more l he VICE
 PRESIDEN T The question is
 wiil the Senate reconsider the
 vote by which this bill
 was passed Upon this question
 thc yeas and nays have
 been ordered Mr ANTHONY Do
 1 understand that the Senator
 from Illinois desires t his
 to bea test vote and
 that waives the question of

 entirely willing that it shall
 be a test vote As
 ib is a compromise I
 do not want to disturb
 it Mr G WIN I
 will vole to reconsider because
 I have been cheated out
 of the name The Terri

 bnsineis of yesterday takes prece

 Tennessee is entitled to the
 floor Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 Mr Presi dent Mr CAMERON
 Will the Senator me to
 ask a question I desire
 to know what will be
 the condition of the bill
 just announced by the Chair
 after the Senator has made
 his remarks Mr BIGLER 1
 will state to my colleague
 that it will be at
 the disposition of the body
 The VICE PRESIDENT If the
 unfinished business of yesterday shall
 be disposed of the Chair
 will then call up this
 special order Mr JOHNSON of
 Tennessee Mr Presi dent yesterday
 I proceeded in the discussion
 in answer to some of
 the attacks that had been
 made on me to consider
 the question of the free
 navi gation of the Mississippi
 river and I shall leave
 my remarks on that sukject
 at that point and shall
 take up another sentence of
 the Senator from Oregon I
 have no disposition to do
 the Senator from Oregon or
 any other Senator injustice In
 this connection I will say
 as I have intimated before
 that I thought his attack
 upon unkind and uncalled for
 Let that be as It
 may it is not my
 disposition or Iny intention on
 this occasion to do him
 injustice I intend to do
 him full jus tice In
 thc reply that hc made
 to me to which I
 yesterday referred he gave the
 contradiction direct to what I
 stated in the presidential canvass
 in answer to the charge
 that had been made that
 you Mr President and the
 Senator from Ore gon were
 disunionists were in favor of
 secession and that you were
 used by V hat was
 called the seceding or disunion
 party fbr the purpose of
 dis rupting and breaking up
 the Government I met those
 charges because I believed they
 were un true that they
 were not founded in fact
 In various places before large
 assemblies and I thought successfully
 at least to my own
 mind exonerated you and the
 candidate for the Vice Presidency
 from the charge I confess
 it was somewhat mor tifying
 to me after the reply
 which the Senator made to
 have to say to the
 people and the coun try
 generally that I vindicated Ilirn
 wrainst a charge which was
 true for when we take
 up his speech here in
 reply to the rernarks that
 I madc on that occasion
 none of which had the
 slightest reference to him involving
 neither his position before the
 country nor his consistency as
 a legis lator we find
 that he took bold ground
 advocat ing and justifying secession
 arguing in fact that it
 was constitutional 1 felt after
 that speech that I was
 involved in inconsistency before my
 people an inconsistency in which
 I ought not to have
 been involved But in that
 same speech in which the
 honora bie Senator involved me
 in these contradictions he goes
 on to state and I
 will do him just ice
 by reading his speech for
 I do not want to
 misquåte But sir understand me
 I am not a disunionist
 am for thc right and
 I would have it in
 the Union and if jt
 cannot be obtained there I
 wouid go out of the
 Union and have that out
 of the Union that f
 could not obtain in it
 though was entitled to it
 Mr President I have called
 the attention of the Senate
 to the paragraph of the
 Senator s speech which I
 have just read in which
 he disavows dis union sentiments
 but when you take the
 preced ing part of his
 speech you find that he
 advocates the doctrine ofdrsunion and
 secession almost from the beginning
 up to the sentence that
 I have read It seems
 to me it is paradoxical
 but that may be my
 misfortune not his He may
 be capable of reconciling the
 conflict the seeming inconsistency of
 first advocating the doctrine of
 dissolution se cession and disunion
 and then at the same
 time exclaiming that he is
 no disunionist I do not
 know how a Senator can
 be for Lhe Union and
 at the same timc concedc
 the right that a State
 has the authority to secede
 und the Constitution that it
 is justified in seceding and
 ought to secede that when
 it demands rights in the
 Union that it cannot get
 it should go out of
 the Union to ob tain
 that which could not be
 obtained in it But let
 all that pass 1 wish
 to do him no injustice
 and therefore I desired to
 cail attention in the remarks
 that I aryl making to
 his disclaimer of being a
 disunionist and a secessionist Mr
 President the Senator in the
 sentence I have quoted assumes
 that South Carolina for instance
 had the right to secede
 and he assumes also that
 South Carolina can obtain that
 out of the Union which
 she has failed to obtain
 in it 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBD 767 Let us raise
 the inquiry here what is
 it since she entered in
 to this Confederacy of States
 that South Carolina has desired
 or asked at the hands
 of the Federal Government or
 demanded upon consti tutional grounds
 that she has not obtained
 What great wrong what great
 injury has been inflicted upon
 South Carolina by her continuance
 in this Union of States
 I know it is very
 easy and even Senators have
 fallen into the habit of
 it to repeat some phrases
 almost as a chorus to
 a song such as if
 we cannot ffet our rights
 in the Union we wili
 go out of the Union
 and obtain those rights that
 we are for the equality
 of tl le States in
 tho Union and if x
 vc cannot get it we
 will go out of the
 Unions I suppose to bring
 about that equality What is
 the point of controversy in
 the public mind at this
 time Let us look at
 the question as it is
 We know that the issue
 which has been before the
 country to a very great
 ex tent and which in
 fact has recently occupied the
 consideration of thc public is
 the territorial ques tion It
 is said that South Carolina
 has been re fused her
 rights in the Union with
 referencc to that torritorial question
 aud therefore she is going
 out of the Union to
 obtain that which she cannot
 get in it Now Mr
 President when we come to
 exam ine this subject how
 does the matter stand I
 showed yesterday in reference to
 the protection of slave property
 in the Territories of this
 Con federacy that South Carolina
 in connection v ith the
 distinguished Senatq from Oregon had
 voted expressly that no slavery
 code was needed that no
 further protection was needed so
 far as Con gress was
 concerned They decided it herc
 in this hody South Carolina
 by her own vote on
 the 25th day of May
 last decided that she needed
 no protection in the Territories
 of the United States so
 far as Congress was concerned
 The Senator from Oregon voted
 with her That vote s
 eenlcd to be connected with
 and predicated upon the great
 fact that the Suprcmc Court
 of the United States had
 decided this question that they
 had de the Missouri compromise
 in other words the Ituv
 excluding slavery north of 360
 30 and making it permissive
 south of 360 30 unconsti
 tutional and void and according
 to our forms of Government
 it was in fact stricken
 from the stat ute hook
 by the decision of the
 court They thereby said to
 the country the supreme arbiter
 of the land so made
 by the Constitution of the
 Unit t d States has
 decided that the pcoplc have
 a right without regard to
 the character or descrip tion
 of their property to carry
 it into all the por
 ritories of the United States
 and that under the Constitution
 of the United States it
 is protected thereo It was
 said the court having decided
 that they had a right
 to go there with this
 institution of slavery and the
 Constitution findin r it there
 it was rccoffnized and protected
 by the Constitu tion of
 the United States this connection
 permit nne to go outside
 of the Senate Chamber and
 state what occurred in my
 oxvn State There those w
 bo were the best friends
 of the distinguished Senal or
 from Oregon and xvho arc
 ultra upon this subject before
 thou sands of the people
 of that State took the
 bold cn ound that they
 wanted no further protection from
 Congress that the Constitution of
 the Uni ted States and
 the opinion pf the Supreme
 Court that the were all
 the slavery code they desired
 question was settled that the
 power was com pletc and
 that protection was ample In
 this connection sir we must
 recollect the decision made by
 the Senate upon the resolutions
 introduced by the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr on the 25th
 day of May last On
 that day under tho solemn
 sanction of an oath and
 ail the formalities of legislation
 spread upon the Journals the
 yeas and nays being taken
 we dc clared after an
 argument on the subject that
 no further protection was needed
 at that time Tho Senate
 went on and stated in
 the fifth resolution I the
 substance i do not pretend
 to repeat the words that
 if hereafter it should become
 neccs sary to have protection
 of this kind then Congress
 should give it but thev
 said it was unnecessary If
 Soutfi Carolina and the Senator
 at that time from Oregon
 took this position then what
 has transpired since that period
 of time that now jus
 tifies a State in withdrawincr
 or seceding from this Union
 5 on account of Congress
 not doing that which t
 hcy declared was not necessary
 to be done BLit let
 us take the fact as
 it is South Caro lina
 it is said wanted protection
 in the Territories I have
 shown that she said herself
 that further protection was not
 needed but if it should
 be needed then Congress should
 give it But South Carolina
 the Kingdom of South Carolina
 in the plenitude of her
 power and upon her own
 volition without consultation with the
 otherStates of this Confederacy has
 gone out of the Union
 or assumed to go out
 The next inquiry is what
 docs South Carolina nox V
 get in the language of
 tho distinguished Senator from Oregon
 out of the Union that
 she did not get in
 the Union Is there aman
 in South Carolina to day
 that wants to carry a
 single slave into any Territory
 we have got in the
 United States that is now
 unoccupied by slave property am
 almost ready to hazard the
 as If he had not
 the sertion that there is
 not one power and the
 right to carry his slave
 property Into a Territory while
 in the Union has he
 ob tained that right now
 by going out of the
 Union Has anything been obtained
 by violating the Constitution of
 the United States by withdraw
 ing from the sisterhood of
 States that could not have
 been obtained in it Can
 South Carolina now any morc
 conveniently and practically carry slavery
 Into the Territories than she
 could before sile went out
 of the Union Then what
 has sh obtained What lias
 she got even upon the
 d trinc laid down the
 distinguished Senator om Oregon it
 is argued striding over the
 Constitution and violating that comity
 and faith which should exist
 amongst tho States composing this
 Confed eracy that she had
 right to secede she had
 a right to carry slaves
 into the Territories and therefore
 she will secede and go
 out of the Union This
 reasoning on the part of
 South Carolina is about as
 sound as that of the
 madman who as sumed that
 he had dominion over the
 beasts of the forest and
 therefore that he had a
 right to shear a wolf
 His friends remonstrated with him
 and admitting his right to
 do so inquired of him
 if he had considered the
 danger and the difficulty of
 the I have not attempt
 No said the madman considered
 that that is no part
 of my considera tion man
 has the dominion over the
 boasts of the forest and
 therefore he has a right
 to shear a wolf and
 as I havc right to
 do so I will exer
 His friends still renronstrulcd and
 cx cise it postulated and
 asked him not only Have
 you considered thc danger the
 difficulty and the con sequences
 resultin r from such an
 attempt but what will the
 sheaving be worth he replied
 l have the right and
 therefore I will shear a
 wolf South Carolina has the
 right according to the doctrine
 of the seceders and dis
 unionists of this country to
 go out of the Union
 and therefore she will go
 out of the Union And
 what Mr President has south
 Carolina gained by goiw r
 out It has been just
 about as profitable an operation
 as the shearing of thc
 wolf by the mad mail
 Can she now carry slaves
 into the i crritorics Does
 she even get any division
 of the Territories None she
 has lost all that Docs
 she establish a right No
 but by the exer cise
 of this abstract right as
 contended for by secessionists what
 has she got Oppression tax
 ation a reign of terror
 over her people as the
 result of their rashness in
 the exercise of this as
 sumed right In what condition
 is her people now They
 have gone out of the
 Union to obtain their rights
 to maintain their liberty to
 get that out of the
 Union which they could not
 get in it NvVhilc they
 were in the Union they
 were not taxed a milli01
 i and some six or
 seven or eight hundred thousand
 dollars in addition to their
 usual cx I penditurcs to
 sustain standing armies and to
 meet other expenditures which are
 incurred by sepa ration But
 still shc has the right
 to tax her peo p
 e she has the right
 to institute a reign of
 terror she has the ria
 ht to exclude her people
 from the pears that our
 admirable system of civil liberty
 is crumbling to pieces that
 the témple öf liberty is
 upheaved that its columns are
 falling and that nothing will
 remain but a general full
 and in their consternation too
 many stand back and take
 no posit idli for the
 relief of their coun ry
 in the pending crisis But
 sir the relayions_ thåt we
 bear to thc people of
 the United States behoöye every
 man whether Senator or Representative
 or even private citizen to
 come forward as a patriot
 and lover of his country
 and look at the condition
 of the country as ibis
 Without regard to thecon sequences
 upon myself I have determined
 to meet this quc ion
 and to present my views
 to the country in such
 form as I believe to
 be right and proper Sir
 let us loolc at the
 contest through which we are
 passing and consider what South
 Caro lina and the other
 States who have undertaken to
 from the Confederacy have gained
 What is the great diffculty
 which has existed in the
 public mind We know that
 practically the territorial question is
 settled Then what is the
 cause for breaking up this
 great Union of States Has
 the Union or the Constitution
 encroached upon the rights of
 South Carolina or any other
 State Has this glorious Union
 that was inaugu rated by
 the adoption of the Constitution
 which was framed by the
 patriots and sages of the
 Revo lution harmed South Carolina
 or any other Staté No
 it has offended none it
 has protected all What is
 thc difficulty We have some
 bad men in the South
 the truth I will speak
 and we have some bad
 men in the North who
 want to dis solve this
 Union in order to gratify
 their unhal lowed ambition And
 what do we find here
 upon this floor and upon
 the floor of the other
 House of Congress Words of
 crimination and recrim ination are
 heard Bad mcn North say
 provoking things in reference to
 the institutions of the South
 and bad men and bad
 tempered men of the South
 say provoking and insulting things
 ill return and so goes
 on a warof crimination and
 recrimination in reference to the
 two sections of the country
 and the institutions peculiar to
 each They be come enraged
 and illsulted and then they
 are de nunciatory of cach
 other and vvhat is the
 result The Abolitionists and those
 who entertain their sentiments abuse
 men of the South and
 inen of the South abuse
 them in return They do
 not fight each other but
 they both become offended and
 enraged One is dissatisfied with
 the other one is insulted
 by the other and then
 to seek re venge to
 gratify themselves they both agree
 to make war upon the
 Union that never offended or
 Is this right What has
 this injured either I U
 nion done Why should these
 contendil g par ties rnake
 war upon it because they
 have insulted and aggrieved each
 other This glorious Union that
 was spoken into existence bv
 the fhthers of the country
 must be made war upon
 to gratify these animosities Shall
 we because we have said
 bitter things of each other
 which have been offens ive
 turn upon the Government and
 seek its de struction and
 entail all the disastrous conse
 quences upon commerce upon agriculture
 upon the industrial pursuits of
 the country that must result
 from the breaking up of
 a great Govern roent like
 this What is to be
 gained out of the Union
 that we cannot get in
 it Anything I have been
 zealously contending for and intend
 to continue to contend for
 every right even to the
 I ninth part ofa hair
 that I feel the State
 which i have the honor
 in part to represent is
 entitled to I do notintcnd
 to demand anything bat that
 which I is right and
 I will remark in this
 connection that there is a
 spirit in the country which
 if it docs not exist
 to a very great extent
 in this I lall does
 exist in the great mass
 of the people North I
 and South to do what
 is right and if the
 ques tion could be taken
 away from politicians if it
 ballot box and sho has
 exercised the right could be
 taken away from the Congress
 of the these are the
 consequences qe has got her
 rights United States and referred
 to the great n ass
 of She has gono out
 of the Union to bc

 voting population of the United
 introduced a galling system of

 sir how are we Situated
 There are pol itici ns
 here mand throughout the land
 some of iwhöm want to
 break up the Union to
 promote their own personal aggrandizement
 some on the other hand
 desire the Union destroyed that
 sla very may be extinguished
 Then let me appeal to
 every patriot in the land
 in view of this state
 of things to come forward
 and take the Govern ment
 out Of the hands of
 the Goths and Vandals wrest
 it from the Philistines save
 the country and hand it
 down to our children as
 it has beeh handed dowri
 to us r have already
 asked what is to be
 gained by t he breaking
 up of this Confederacy An
 appeal is made to the
 border slaveholding States to unite
 in what is commonly styled
 the Gulf confederacy If there
 is to be a division
 of this Rep_ublic I would
 mther see the line run
 anywhere than between the slaveholding
 and the non slaveholding States
 and the division made on
 account of a hostility on
 the one hand to the
 institution Of slavery and a
 preference for it on the
 other for whenever thal line
 is drawn it is the
 linc of civil war it
 is the line at which
 the ov crthrow of slavery
 begins the line fi om
 which it commences to recede
 Let me ask the border
 States if that state of
 things should occur who is
 to protect tllem in the
 enjoy ment of their slave
 property Will South Car that
 has gone madly out protect
 them Will Mississippi and Alabama
 and Louisiana still furt her
 down towards the Gulf Will
 thcy comc to our rescue
 and protect us Shall we
 partake of their phrenzy adopt
 thc mistaken policy inlo Which
 they have fallen and begin
 thc work of tho destruction
 the inst itution in which
 we are equally interested with
 them I have already said
 that I believe the dissolution
 of this Union will be
 the commencement of the overthrow
 and destruction of the institution
 of slavery In a northern
 confedei åcy or in a
 southern confeder acy or in
 amiddle confederacy the border slave
 holding States will have LO
 talce cåt e of that
 par spccies of pfoperty by
 their own strength and by
 whatever influcnce they may exert
 in Ilie organozation in which
 they Ilia y be placed
 The Guif Steles cannot they
 will not protect us We
 Shail have to protect ourselves
 and perchance to protect horn
 As I remarked ycstcrday ny
 own opi l ion is
 that the great Ip sire
 to c the border States
 as they are called in
 this partic ular and Q
 xclusivc southern confederacy which it
 is proposed to get up
 is not that they wat
 t us there out of
 pure will but they want
 us there as a of
 interest so that if they
 arc involved in making acquisitions
 of territory still war further
 south or war o rowino
 out of any other cause
 they Inay have u corps

 I have a power behind
 that can furnish t hcrn
 men and money men that
 llave the hearts and souls
 to fight and meet an
 enemy come frorn what quarter
 he may What have we
 to gain by that The
 fact that two taken from
 four leaves but two remainil
 g is not clearer to
 In y iiiil d that
 it is that the d
 issoEu tion of the Union
 is the beginning of the
 destruc tion of slavery and
 that if a division be
 accorn pli sbcd as some
 desire directly between the slaveholding
 and the non slaveholding States
 tho work wrikl be commenced
 most effectually Upon this point
 i propose to read a
 short extract from South Carolina
 herself Mr Boyce latc a
 mem ber of the other
 House a distinguished man a
 inan of talent and I
 believe a good man and
 who have no doubt in
 his heart this day regpets
 most deeply and sincerely the
 course which South Cår olina
 has taken said in 1851
 when the same issue was
 presented Secession separate nationality with
 all its burdens is no
 retuedy It is no redress
 ibr_ the past it is
 no security Or the future
 It is only a magnificent
 sacrifice to the pres CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBfi February 6 ent without
 in any wise gaining in
 the filture Forrttte vatiouS teasöns
 l ha e Stated I
 object in as strong terms
 as can to the secession
 of South Car olina Such
 is the intensity of my
 conviction on this sub jeOt
 that if secession should take
 place of which I have
 no idea för cannot believe
 in the existence of such
 astu pendous madness I shall
 eönsider the institution of slavery
 as döomed and that the
 great God in our blindness
 has made us the instruments
 of its destruction He said
 then that if South Carolina
 in her madness but he
 did not believe she could
 should determine upon secession he
 would look upQn it that
 the great God had doomed
 the institution of slavery This
 is the opinion of one
 of the most distinguished and
 I conscientiously believe best men
 of South Carolina But sir
 I pass on from the
 paragraph of the speech of
 the honorable Senator from Oregon
 to which I havexeferred and
 as there seems to have
 been a sort of arrangement
 at least it appears so
 to my mind to make
 and keep up an attack
 on me becausc I agreed
 with Mr Boyce of South
 Carolina in this respect because
 I agreed with many distinguished
 men and because 1 advanced
 the doctrines of the fathers
 who formed the Re public
 I shall take up these
 Senators in the order In
 which I was attacked Without
 being egotist ical wit hout
 being vain when I feel
 that I have got truth
 on my side when I
 feel that I am stand
 mg on principle when I
 know that I have got
 factÅ h l arguments that
 cannot be answered I never
 Inquire as to the difference
 of ability or ex perience
 betwcen myself and those with
 whom I have to contend
 The next Senator in order
 that niade an attack upon
 me on account of my
 previous speech was the distinguished
 Senator from Mississippi Mr DAv1s
 who took occasion to dQ
 so in making Alis valedictory
 address to the Senate after
 his State had passed her
 ordinance of secession been the
 case not only with that
 Senator but with others Lhntan
 attem pthas been made by
 innuendo by indirection by some
 Sidc remark to convey the
 impression that a certain man
 has a tendency or bearing
 towards Black Republicanism or Ab
 olitionism Sometimes o entlemen who
 cannot establish such a charge
 are yct willing to make
 it not directly but by
 innuendo to create a false
 impression on the public mind
 Willing to wound but yet
 afraid to strike If the
 charge can be successfully made
 why not make it directly
 instead of conveying it by
 innu endo The Senator from
 Mississippi did not at tempt
 to reply to my speech
 did not answer my awuments
 did not meet rny authorities
 did not controvert my facts
 but after reaching a certain
 point in his own arcrument
 he disposes of all that
 I had said in those
 very ft w words I
 am here confronted with a
 question which will not argue
 the position which I have
 taken necessarily brings me to
 its consideration Without argning It
 I wilt rnerely It is
 the right of a State
 to witildraw from the rnention
 it linion The President says
 it is not a constitutional
 right l he Senator i
 otn Ohio Mr i VADi
 ahd his ally the Sen
 ator Progn l euncsscc argued
 it as no right at
 all Is that the way
 for a Senator a distinguished
 Senator an Ajax of his
 peculiar sect för when we
 cotne to examine this doctrine
 of secession it is only
 broad enough to fqund a
 sect upon it is not
 comprehensive enough it has not
 scope enough to found great
 national party on to notice
 the arguments of others The
 Senator from Mississil pi would
 not argue the right of
 seces I say that if
 any government bc organized sion
 hereafter in which this principle
 of secession is rccool izéd
 it will result in its
 destruction and overthrow But the
 Senator says that the Sen
 ator from Ohio Mr WADE
 and his ally from Tennessee
 regard secession as no right
 at all and by that
 statement the whole argument is
 an swered What is the
 idea here Let us talk
 lainly though courteously and respectfully
 What was the idea which
 this remark was calcu lated
 if not intend A to
 convey I am free to
 say that I think it
 was intended as weH as
 calcu lated to convey the
 impression that the Senator from
 Tennessee was an ally of
 Mr WADE of Ohio who
 wasa and the whole speech
 01 the Senator from Tennessee
 the authorities the facts and
 the arc all upturned by
 that single allusion Thank God
 there is too much good
 sense and intelligence in this
 country to put down any
 man by an innuendo or
 side re mark like that
 But sir so far as
 the people whom I have
 the honor in part to
 represent are concerned I stand
 above innuendoes of that kind
 They have known me from
 my boyhood up They understand
 my doctrines and my principles
 in private and in public
 life They have tried me
 in every posiiion in which
 it was in their power
 to place a public servant
 and they to day not
 say that ANDREW JOHNSON ever
 deceived or betrayed them In
 a public life of twenty
 five years they have never
 deserted or betrayed me and
 God willing I will never
 desert or betray them The
 great mass of the people
 of Tennessee know that I
 am for them they know
 that I have advo cated
 those great principles and doctrines
 upon which the perpetuity of
 this Government depends they know
 that I have periled my
 all pecuniarily and physically in
 vindication of their rights and
 their interests Little innuendoes thrown
 off in snarling moods fall
 harmless at my feet It
 was said that I was
 the ally of the Senator
 from Ohio I turn to
 the doings of the committee
 of thirteen to show who
 were allies there not inquire
 what a man s antecedents
 have been when there is
 a great struggle to preserve
 the ex istence of the
 Government but my first inquiry
 is are you for preserving
 this Government are you for
 maintaining the Constitution upon which
 If Senator WADE or Senator
 anybody It rests else is
 willing to come up to
 this great work either by
 amending thc Constitution of the
 Uni ted States or passing
 laws that will preserve and
 perpetuate this great Union I
 am his ally and he
 is mine and I say
 to every Senator to every
 member of the House onepresentatives
 to every man that loves
 his country throughout the length
 and breadth of this great
 Confedéracy if you are for
 preserving this Union on its
 great and funda mental principles
 I am your ally without
 refer ence to your antecedents
 or to what may take
 place hereafter I say to
 ail such men come for
 ward and like gallant knights
 let us lock our shields
 and make common cause for
 this glorious people If I
 wore to indulge in a
 similar kind of Innuendo by
 way of repartee where would
 the Senator from Mississippi find
 himself In the committee of
 thineon a resolution was introduced
 by tbe distinguished Senator from
 New York Mr I must
 say since this ques tion
 has sprung up has civen
 every indication of a desire
 for reconciliation and for cornpromise
 and ofa disposition to preserve
 thc Government that a man
 occupying his position could do
 to this effect Resolved That
 the following article be aud
 the same is hercby proposed
 and submitted as an to
 the Constitution ot the United
 States to be valid to
 all intents and purposes as
 a part of said Constitution
 when ratified by the Legislatures
 of three fourths of the
 States l No amendment shall
 be made to the Constitution
 which will authorize or give
 to Congres the power to
 abol ish or intertore withiil
 any State witli the domestic
 insti tutions thereof including that
 of persons held to labor
 or service by the laws
 of säid State That was
 a proposition which was calculatcd
 to a very great extent
 to allay the apprehensions and
 the fears that have been
 entertained in the South in
 reference to the institution of
 slavery Why do I say
 so We know what the
 argument has been before the
 southern mind It has been
 first that the northern anti
 siavery party wanted to abolish
 slavery in the District of
 Columbia as an entering wedge
 next to exclude il from
 the Territories following up the
 attack upon slavery bat these
 points were looked upon as
 of minor importance they were
 looked upon as outposts as
 the prelude to an interference
 with the institu tion within
 the States which has been
 supposed to be the great
 end and the great consideration
 Do you not know this
 to be the arcrument that
 they were merely taking these
 positions as enter irv wedges
 to an interference with the
 institution of slavery in the
 States Such is the real
 ques tion and such it
 will remain the territorial ques
 tion being stibstantially settled What
 does Mr SEWARD who has
 acquired so much notoriety by
 his irrepressible conflict say He
 comes here and proposes an
 amendment to the Constitution which
 puts an estoppel upon his
 irrepressible conflict doctrine He is
 willing to make it per
 petual so that the institution
 cannot be interfered with in
 the States by any future
 amendment of the Constitution That
 is Mr SEWARD s measure
 Upon the adoption of that
 resolution I believe every member
 of the committee voted for
 it save two The Senator
 from Mississippi Mr DAVIS voted
 for it Mr SEWARD voted
 for it and Mr WADE
 of Ohio voted for it
 Whose ally is he THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF
 CONGRESS PUBLISHED BY JOHN C
 RIVES WASHINGTON D C TIIIRTY
 SIXTH CONGRESS 20 SESSION Here
 we find WADE and SEWARD
 and Dnvrs and t be
 whole committee with the exception
 of two in favor of
 amending the Constitution so that
 the institution of slavery cannot
 be interfered with in the
 States making that provision irrepealablc
 by any number of Statcs
 that may come into the
 Confederacy Who were allies then
 But Mr President recurring to
 what I said yesterday there
 are two parties in this
 country that want to break
 up the Government Who are
 they The nullifiers proper of
 the South the secessionists or
 disunionists for I use them
 all as synonymous terms There
 is a portion of them
 who per se desire the
 disruption of the Govern ment
 for purposes of their own
 aggrandizement i do not charge
 upon them that they svant
 to break up the Governmentfor
 the purpose of affect ing
 slavery yet I charge that
 the breaking up of the
 Government would have that effect
 the result svould be the
 same Who else is for
 breakin Y up this Government
 I refer to some bad
 men in the North There
 is a set of men
 there who arc called Abolitionists
 and they want to break
 up the Government They are
 disunionists they are secessionists they
 are nullifiers Sir the Ab
 olitionists and the distinguished Senator
 from Mississippi and his partv
 both stand in the satne
 attitude to attain the samc
 end a dissolution of this
 Union tbe one party believing
 that it will result in
 their os vn aggrandizement South
 and the other believing that
 it will result in the
 overthrow of the institution of
 slavery Who are t he
 dis uniomsts of the North
 Who are the allies 5
 of the distinguished Senator from
 Mississippi We find that a
 resolution was adopted at the
 anniver sary of the N
 lassachusetts Anti Slavery Society con
 vened in Boston in these
 words Resolved That t hc
 one great issue betöre the
 country is the dissolut ion
 of the Union in comparison
 with which ail other issues
 with the slave power are
 as dust in the bal
 ance theretore we give ourselves
 to the work of annulling
 this covenant with death as
 essential to our own inno
 celicy and the speedy and
 everlasting overthrow of the slave
 system This resolution was passed
 by the Abolition anti slavery
 society of Massachusetts They think
 a dissolution of the Union
 would result in the destruction
 of slavery and absolve them
 from this covenant with death
 and attest their innocency as
 far as the Govern rnent
 is concerned on that we
 find that Mr Wendell Phillips
 made the following remarks entirely
 accord with the sentiments of
 that last reso I think
 all tve have to do
 is to prepare the public
 Inind by the daily and
 hourly presentation of the doctrine
 disunion Events wilieh fortunately för
 us the Govern ment it
 self and otiu r parties
 are producing with unexalll pied
 rapidity are otn best aid
 Again in reply to a
 remark made by Mr Gid
 dings respecting the dissolution of
 the Union the Boston Liberator
 says Mr Giddings says truly
 that the dissolution ot the
 Union has long been held
 up as a scare crow
 by the South but xvben
 he adds that the friends
 of liberty never demanded it
 his staternent is untrue unless
 he means to confinc it
 to his political associates who
 are but compromisers at VVe
 dcnnand nothing short of a
 dissolution absolute and i nrncdiat
 c l hc Union which
 was founded by our fathers
 was cernented by the blood
 ofthe slave and cfiOcted tklrougll
 his illilnolation And still further
 William Lloyd Garrison at Fourth
 of July celebration at Framingham
 Massachusetts declared Lct us then
 to day rejecting as wild
 and chimera all suzgestions propositions
 and contrivances for restrainina its
 present liniits while extending constitu
 slaverv in 1 ionai proteeti

 of the States register our
 pledgc anew he hre I
 leaven and the world that
 we Vill do what in
 us lies to cfi ect
 the eternal overthrow of this
 blood stained Union that thus
 our enslaved countrynen Inay sure
 dciiverance and we may no
 loncrcr be answer find a
 able their blood The Union
 is to be overthrown by
 way of get ting e
 par of the o rcat
 sin of slavery J B
 Swasscy on the satne occasion
 said In the oi len
 times I w as what
 was called an anti but
 Mr President it has come
 to my mind s averv
 Whig like a conviction that
 it is utterly in vain
 to hope that we can
 live under such a Governrnent
 as this with onr protes
 and with our pretended love
 o freedom and right i
 here cannot in the nature
 V tlkC thinz is itnpossible
 of things be any union
 between the principles of liberty
 49 FRIDAY FEBRUARY 8 1861
 and slavery There never has
 been any union except by
 the subjugation of the principles
 of liberty to those ot
 des potism For one sir
 believe that the duty of
 every true man is to
 take tbc ground of secession
 Again Wendell Phillips in a
 speech at Boston on the
 20th of January argued that
 disunion was desirable because it
 would abolish slavery He also
 argued that the North would
 gain by dis union and
 used the following language Sacrifice
 everything for the Union God
 forbid Sac rifice everything to
 keep South Carolina in it
 Rather build a bridge ot
 gold and pay hcr toil
 over it Let her march
 off witli banners and trunupets
 and we will speed the
 parting guests Lct her not
 stand upon the order of
 her going but go at
 once Give her the torts
 and arsenal and sub treasuries
 and lend her jewcis or
 silver and gold and Egypt
 will rejoice that she has
 departed He looks upon disunion
 as the beginning of the
 and overthrow of the institution
 of slavery Then when we
 come to talk about al
 whose allies are these gentlemen
 Whose allies arc the Abolitionists
 of the North if they
 are not the allies of
 the secessionists and disun ionists
 of the South Are they
 not all laborincr and toiling
 to accmnplish the same great
 end the overthrow of this
 great nation of ours Their
 object is the samc They
 are both employing to some
 extent the same means Here
 IS Wen here is the
 anti dell Philips here is
 Garrison slavery society of Massachusetts
 and all in the very
 same point of view thc
 allies of the distin guished
 Senator from Mississippi and his
 coad in favor of disrupting
 and breaking jutors all down
 this Union with the view
 of destroying the institution of
 slavery itself Allies laboring to
 destroy the Government Who else
 are labor ing to destroy
 it but the disunionists and
 seces sionists of the South
 and Garrison and Phillips and
 the long list that micrht
 be enumerated at the North
 Here they stand presenting an
 unbroken front to destroy this
 glorious Union which was made
 by our fathers Mr President
 I have alluded to this
 subject of allies in order
 to show who is engnged
 this unholy and nefarious work
 of breaking up this Union
 We find first the run
 mud Abolitionists of tbc North
 They are secessionists they are
 for disunion they are for
 dissolution When we turn to
 the South we see the
 red hot disunionisls 1 and
 secessionists engaged in the same
 work think it comes with
 a very bad grac e
 from them of others who
 arc try to talk about
 the ing to save the
 Union and preserve the Constitu
 tion I went back yesterday
 and showed that South Carolina
 had held this doctrine of
 secession at a very early
 day a very short time
 after she entered into the
 Articles of Confederation and after
 she had entered the Union
 by which and through which
 the independence of the country
 I vas achieved What else
 do we find at a
 very early day Go to
 Massachusctt s during the war
 of 1812 and the Hartford
 convention and there you will
 find men engaged in this
 treasonable and unhallowed work Even
 in 1845 Massachusetts in mani
 festing her great opposition to
 the annexation of Texas to
 the United States passed a
 resolution resolving herself out of
 the Union She sccedcd she
 werit off by her own
 act because Texas was admitted
 into the Union Thus find
 South Carolina and Massachusetts taking
 the lead in this secession
 movernent We find the Abolitionists
 proper of the North shakine
 the right hand of fellowship
 with the disunionigts of the
 South in breaking up the
 Union avid yet we this
 work of hear intimations here
 that Senators who arc not
 secessionists from the South arc
 Black Republican If I were
 compelled to choose cither I
 would not wish to bc
 compelled to make a choice
 but if I were compelled
 to bc eithcr having the
 privilege of choosing I would
 It Ether be a black
 f think the one is
 Republican than a red one
 rnuch rnore tolerable than the
 other R If red repub
 licavusm is ever to make
 its way into this courr
 try it is making its
 way in this disunion and
 se cession naovernent that is
 now going on for we
 see that right along with
 the sentiment of seces Everything
 is Sion the reign of
 terror prevails NEW SERIES NO

 while the conservative men of
 the country are waiting for
 the excited tempest to pass
 Itis nowsweepingoverthe country Every thing

 of terror follows along in
 its wake I am charged
 with being G an ally
 of the Sen ator from
 Ohio I my earliest infancy
 or from the time I
 first cornprehended principle dox vn
 to tbc prescnt time havo
 always stood bat tling for
 the same great principles that
 I contend for now My
 people know me they have
 tried me and your little
 innuendoes and your little in
 directions will not scare them
 even if your infu riatcd
 seceding southern men dare to
 intimate that I am an
 ally of Mr WADE The
 Senator charges me with being
 an ally while he and
 the lead crs of Abolitionism
 are unitinø all their energies
 to breakup this glorious Union
 Ian ally Thank God I
 am not in alliance with
 Giddings with Phillips with Garrison
 and the long list of
 those who are engaged in
 tho work of destruction and
 in violating the Constitution of
 the United States So much
 Mr President in regard to
 the argu ment about allies
 I am every man s
 ally when he acts upon
 principle I have laid down
 as the cardinal point in
 my political creed that in
 all questions that involve n
 inciple especially where t herc
 was doubt I wou d
 pursue prmciple and in the
 pursuit of a great principle
 I never could reach If
 in the pursuit of princi
 a wronc conclusion ple in
 trying to reach a correct
 conclusion I find myself by
 the side of another man
 who is pursu ing the
 same principle or acting upon
 the same line of policy
 I extend to him my
 assistance and I ask his
 in return But the Senator
 from Mississippi in his reply
 to me also said I
 was reading a short time
 ago an extract which re
 ferred to the time vhen
 we J suppose it means
 Tennes see would take the
 position which it was said
 to be an absurdity iOr
 South Carolina to hold and
 rrennessee still vvas put in
 the same speech in the
 attitude of a great ob
 jector against the cxercise of
 the right of secession there
 anything in her history which
 places her Ten nessee born
 of secession rockcd in the
 cradle of revolu tion taking
 her position before she was
 matured and claim ing to
 he a State because she
 had violenlly severed her con
 neetion with North Carolina and
 through an act of seces
 Sion and revolution claimed then
 to be a State I
 suppose it was thought that
 this would be a that
 it would be conclusive and
 as Ten poser ncssee was
 born of secession rocked in
 the I was cstopped that
 my cradle of revolution lips
 were hermetically sealed so far
 as related to anything 1
 could give utterance to in
 opposition to this heresy When
 we come to examine thc
 history of that subject we
 find the Senator has fallen
 into just about as great
 a blunder and as great
 an error as ho did
 in his édlusi01 i to
 allies Tennessee had her birth
 not in secession very far
 from it The State of
 Frankland had itsorigin in that
 way l hey attempted to
 separate them selves from the
 State of North Carolina When
 was that In 1784 Peace
 was made in 1783 but
 in 1784 1 read from
 Wheeler s History of North
 Carolina In 1784 the General
 Assembly in April at Killsboro
 alliong other acts for the
 relief of the General Government
 ceded her western land6 and
 authorized her delegation in Congrcss
 to execute a deed provided
 Congress would accept this offer
 within two years l his
 act patriotic and self sacrificing
 vas worthy of the State
 and although not then accepted
 by Congress was real source
 of the civil comrnotion which
 we are about to record
 What was that civil commotion
 The pioneers of that country
 had suffered great hardships and
 they viewed with suspicion this
 act of 1784 On thc
 24th of August of that
 year they held a con
 vcntion at Jonesboro and resolved
 to send a per son
 to Congress to urge tho
 acceptance of the offer of
 North Carolina But I will

 general oblivion and pardon were
 extended to all concerned in

 went back to Greenc county

 removed It was removed and
 he went back to the

 we see the odious weight
 that was heaped upon him
 by this nefarious doc trine
 of secession Then what President
 When we turn to the
 act and follow it along
 we find that North Carolina
 then made her cession act
 com pleted it in 1790
 and ceded the territory to
 the Uni ted States A
 territorial government was estab lished
 General Washington himself appoin ted
 the first omcers in the
 Territory which was then styled
 the Territory southl vest of

 the Council or Legislature of
 that Territory elected James White

 west of the river Ohio
 not Frank land or Franklin
 for that is numbered with
 the things that were but
 are not Even with the

 of Dr Franklin it was
 con signed to oblivion and
 now sleeps with the things
 that were In 1794 the
 delegate to represent the Territory
 made his appearance here and
 took his Ifi 1796 tbc

 then it was that Tennessee
 began her ekistcnce The peace
 was made in 1783 and

 admission into this Union Then
 it was that Ten nessce
 was spoken into existence She
 did not pass through this
 ordeal of secession this proba
 lion of disunion She germinated
 upon proper principles The Territory
 was first organized by Congress
 after the death of the
 organization called Frankland and in
 1796 the people of Tennessee
 formed their constitution and were

 the inhabitants of said district
 would take due notice thereof
 and govern them selves accordingly
 Johl Sevier was brave and
 patriotic a man loved by
 the people but hc had
 fallen into this error of
 sccession or separation from the
 State of North Carolina that
 I have called your attention
 to here in the history
 of North Carolina we find
 thut this doctrine of secession
 could not be bornc by
 h iin with his great
 popularity and with the attachment
 the people had for him
 Instead of I cnnessee having
 her ori yin or Ijcr
 birth in secession tl ie
 precise reverse is true The
 State of I Frankland had
 its birth in an attempt
 at disunion and was rocked
 to deal ll in tbe
 cradle of secession State Andrew
 Jackson It may have been
 that his early ki lowledge
 of the country it may
 have been that his early
 information upon the subject made
 him understand and appreciatc ever
 after wards the value of
 the Union When Tennessee was
 ushered into this fanfily of
 States as an equal member
 of the Confederacy General Jackson
 took his seat as her
 Representative The Senator from Mississippi
 said that Tennessee was born
 in secession rocked in the
 cradle of revolution Sir she
 has fond recollections of tho
 Revo lu tion bu t
 with all her re volu
 t ionary character her people
 have never attempted secession General
 Jackson first represented her in
 Congress when she camc into
 the Union she brought him
 to the notice of the
 people of the United StatcSas
 a public man In 1833
 when an attempt somewhat sim
 ilar to the present was
 made he was President of
 the United States and it
 is unnecessary for me to
 relate what his views of
 secession were then It is
 not necessary for to refer
 to the acts of General
 Jackson in 1833 And now
 sir not in tendil lg
 to disparage others but to
 give utterance to my conscientious
 belief I must say that
 if such a man as
 Andrew Jackson were President of
 the United States at the
 present time before this mo
 rnent steps would have been
 taken which would have preserved
 us a united people without
 the shedding of blood without
 making war I believe that
 if Andrew Jackson were President
 of the United States this
 glorious Union of ours would
 and its greatdefendcrand founder at
 that time not still be
 intact Perhaps it might be
 jarred a little withstanding his
 great popularity and the attach
 in some places but not
 suffciently to disturb the ment
 the people had for him
 was lodged in irons I
 larmony and general concord of
 the vthole That That is
 where secession carried Ililh with
 all his f i is
 my opinion I do not
 say it to disparage oth
 popularity with all his patriotism
 with all Ille at ers
 but I believe that this
 would have been the tachment
 the people bad hirn Yes
 sir this case if he
 had been President pursuing the
 policy nefarious this blighting this
 withering doctrine which I feel
 certain he would have pursued
 in of secession ended by
 placing that distinguished such an
 emergency man in irons I
 ennessee c ame into the
 Union in 1796 She What
 next occurred North Carolina passed
 was the third State that
 entered the Confederacy a law
 for general pardon and oblivion
 for all those after the
 old thirteen ratified the Constitution
 that had been engaged in
 this movement with the I
 She was in this U
 l ion before Alabama before
 exception of this great man
 John Sevier His Mississippi before
 Louisiana before Florida had name

 then and she country where
 I live but with all
 his talents and was in

 it ever since and she
 popularity this infamous this nefarious
 this dia has continued to
 contribute her money her men
 bolical this hell born and
 hell bound doctrine of f
 and her blood to the
 defense of the flag of
 the secession carried him into
 chains The State of Union
 and though these other States
 may go out Frankland had
 expired rocked to death in
 the I trust in God
 that she wili still remain
 in thc po 1861 CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 771 sition she occupied
 before they were spoken into
 the language of Mr BOYCE
 as an index of their
 existence We have been told
 that the Union is feeling
 I have no more doubt
 than I have of my
 broken up that it is
 already dissolved Why existence that
 if this reign of terror
 subsides and sir according to
 the Constitution nine States the
 hearts of the people of
 South Carolina can be formed
 the Government and provision was
 made gotten at it will
 be found that a majority
 of them for taking in
 new States Taking in a
 State or I disapprove and
 repudiate what has been done
 taking out a State does
 not disturb the Union It
 there What do we find
 in the State of Georgia
 was a Union before the
 State came in it is
 a Union There the proposition
 was moved to submit the
 after it goes out We
 got along very well before
 I ordinance to the people
 and were the people con
 these States came in and
 where is the great injury
 now to result to Tennessee
 because they propose to go
 out I took occasion in
 my former remarks to call
 the attention of the Senate
 and of my constituents to
 the extent that I have
 the honor to represent them
 to the kind of government
 that was likely to be
 formed by the seceding States
 and the coun try they
 rnight acquire after they did
 secede In reiation to this
 the Senator from Mississippi said
 But the Senator found somewhere
 I believe in Georgia a
 newspaper article which suggested the
 advantages of a constitutional monarchy
 Does the Senator believe there
 is any considerable nmnber of
 people in any ot the
 States who favor the establishment
 ot a constitutional monarchy The
 Senator from Georgia Mr IVERSON
 felt called upon to say
 something in the same con
 nection He said As allusion
 has been madc by the
 Senator from Missis sippi to
 an article which appeared in
 a paper in my own
 town and about which a
 good deal of noise has
 been made and which was
 referred to by the Senator
 from Tennessee in his celebrated
 speech the other day as
 evidenec that there was a
 party in the South in
 favor of a constitutional monarchy
 He went on to state
 that thatidea was suggested in
 some paper he could not
 exactly tell how but it
 was not by the editor
 and it did not amount
 to much I did notrefcr
 to a single paper but
 I made various extracts from
 newspapers and speeches I simply
 as surface indications as sympt01
 1s of what lay below
 and what was intended to
 be the I referred to
 the Charieston Mercury I result
 referred to other papers I
 referred to the speeches of
 distinguished nien some of them
 leaders in this Is it
 not apparent now that unless
 movement the public rnind is
 aroused unless the people are
 I put on the alert
 there is a design to
 establish a government upon the
 principles of a close cor
 poration Can any one that
 has the least sagacity be
 so unobservant as not to
 see what is going on
 in the South It i
 apparent to all They seem
 to unite in setting out
 with Che proposition that the
 new confederacy shall exclude every
 State which is not slaveholding
 for the reason that t
 hose States which arc interested
 in slaves should have the
 exclusive control and manaøement of
 them Here is a great
 family of States some free
 and some slave occupying in
 one sense the same relation
 to each other that individuals
 in the com munity do
 to one another The proposition
 is started to form a
 government of Slates exclu sively
 interested in slaves That excludes
 all the free States Is
 the argumcnt good Has not
 slavery been secure heretofore in
 the Union with non s
 aveholding States and will not
 our geo graphical and physical
 position be just the sanqe
 after the present Union is
 dissolved Where does the argument
 carry us We must havea
 confed eracy now composed of
 slave States exclusively When we
 have excluded the free States
 and we come to make
 a new government does not
 the same argument apply that
 we must have a gov
 ernment to be controlled and
 administered by that description of
 persons among us who are
 exclu sively interested in slaves
 If you cannot trust a
 free State in the confederacy
 can you trust a non
 slaveholder in a slaveholding State
 to control the question of
 slavery Where does your argu
 ment carry you We see
 where they are drift ing
 and as a faithful sentinel
 upon the watch tower try
 to notify the people and
 sound the tocsin of alarm
 If this idea be not
 carried out it will be
 because the public feeling the
 public opinion is aroused against
 it I alluded yesterday to
 the fact that the freemen
 of the State of South
 Carolina have not been per
 rnitted to vote for a
 President since it was a
 State sulted The vote was
 138 to 160 I thmk
 It shows a great division
 Did they submit it to
 the people I know something
 of the people of the
 State of Georgia and I
 believe this day if that
 seceding ordinance could be submitted
 to the voting population of
 Georgia and the question be
 fully canvassed and fairly understood
 they would repudiate and put
 it down Go to Florida
 were the people consulted there
 Not at all Look to
 Alabama look to the arouments
 made there in the convention
 It was said our power
 is ample we must consummate
 this thing and not let
 the people pass upon it
 Louisiana refused to refer the
 matter to the people The
 people have not been consulted
 A reign of terror has
 been insti tuted States have
 been called upon to make
 large appropriations of money to
 buy arms and muni tions
 of war for what end
 The idea has been we
 can almost with the speed
 of lightning run States out
 of the Union without consulting
 the people and then if
 they dare resist we have
 got an army we have
 00t the money to awe
 them mto submission These gentlémen
 are very fear ful of
 coercion exceedingly alarmed at the
 word coerce but when you
 attempt to interpose and stop
 their career they do not
 know of any other term
 but coerce Look at the
 dispatch which Governor Pickens sent
 to Mississippi CHARLESTON January 19
 1861 Judge Magratli and myself
 have sent fönr telegraphs to
 you Please urge Missi sippi
 to send delegates to the
 Mont gcnnery Illeeting of States
 at as early a day
 as possible say 4th of
 February to form inuncdiately a
 strong provis ionat gotcrnment t
 is the only thing to
 prevent war and let that
 convention elect imnzediatcly a connnandet

 To Hon A BURT JACKSON
 South Carolina has a tnilitavy
 establishment l vith officers appointed
 and the taxes necessary to
 support thern now are grinding
 her people to the dust
 but she expects in a
 very short time to transfer
 that military establislnnel t with
 her off cers to tho
 southern confederacy that is to
 be cs tablished and I
 su prose the great object
 in getting the leader appointed
 at once is that they
 Inay be able by military
 force to awe tl ie
 people in sub mission Have
 we not seen that nine
 regiments have been authorized to
 be raised in Mississippi and
 a distinguished Senator who occupied
 a seat on this floor
 a short time since made
 the major genera No doubt
 X vhcn the scheme is
 consum mated and carried out
 when the IY1ilitary organi zation
 is complete if the people
 offer to resist they will
 be subdued and awed or
 driven into submission at the
 point of the bayonet Some
 of these gentry are very
 much afraid of the people
 Why sir a proposition was
 even started in my own
 State to raise fifteen regiments
 for what With whom are
 we at war Is anybody
 attack ine us No Do
 we want to coerce anybody
 No W bat do we
 want V ith fifteen reginents
 And it was proposed to
 appropriate 250 000 to sustain
 them l hore is a
 wonderful alarn i at the
 idea of coercin r the
 seceding States crreat dread in
 reference to the power of
 this Federal Govern ment to
 secure obedience to its laws
 and espe cialiy in reference
 to making war upon one
 of the I States but
 the pul lic property can
 be taken your flag can
 be fired upon your ships
 driven out of port your
 gallant officer with a few
 men penned up in a
 little fort to subsist as
 best they may So far
 as the offcer to whom
 I havc just alluded is
 I concerned I will give
 utterance to the feelings of
 I my heart when I
 express profound approba tion of
 his conduct He was put
 there to defend metto banner
 substituted because he obeying the
 impulses of a gallant and
 brave heart took choice of
 another position acting upon principles
 of hu mariity not injuring
 others but seeking to pro
 tect his own command from
 being sacrificed and destroyed he
 is condemned and repudiated and
 his action is sought to
 be converted into a menace
 of war Has it come
 to this that the Government
 of the United States cannot
 even takc care of its
 own property that your vessels
 must bc fired upon that
 your flag must be struck
 and still you are alarmed
 at coercion and because a
 gallant off cer has taken
 possession of a fort where
 he cannot very well be
 coerced a terrible cry is
 raised and war is to
 be made I was speaking
 of the proposition to raise
 fifteen regiments in my own
 Slate which has been brought
 forward Sir as far back
 as the battle of King
 s mountain and in every
 war in which the rights
 of the people have been
 invaded Tennessee God bless her
 has stood by that glorious
 flag which was carried by
 Washington and followed by the
 gallant patriots and soldiers of
 the Revolution even as the
 blood trickled from their feet
 as they passed over the
 ice and snow and under
 that flag not only at
 home but abroad her sons
 have ac quited honor and
 distinction in connection with citizens
 of the other States of
 the Union She is not
 yet prepared to band with
 outlaws and make war upon
 that flag under which she
 has won laurels Whom are
 we going to fight Who
 is invading Tennessee Conventions are
 got up a reign of
 terror is inaneurated and if
 by the in flucnce of
 a subsidized and mend tcious
 press an ordinance taking the
 State out of the Confederacy
 can be extorted those who
 make such proposi lions expect
 to h4ve our army ready
 to have their bands equipped
 to have their pretorian di
 visions then they will tell
 the people that they must
 carry the ordinance into effect
 and join a southern confederacy
 whether they will or not
 they shall be lashed on
 to the car of South
 Car olina who entertains no
 respect for them but threatens
 their institution of slavery unless
 they comply with her terms
 Will Tennessee take such a
 position as that I cannot
 believe it I never will
 believe it and if an
 ordinance of seces Sion should
 be passed by that State
 under these circumstances and an
 attempt should be made to
 force the people out ofthc
 Union as has been done
 in some other States I
 tell the Senate and the
 American people that there are
 many in Tennes see whose
 dead bodies will hav e
 to be trampled over before
 it can be consummated Applause
 in the galleries The Senator
 from Mississippi refrrred to the
 of his country and I
 will read what he said
 so that I may not
 be accused of mis representing
 him It may be pardoned
 to me sir who in
 my very boy hood was
 given to the military service
 and who have fol lowed
 that flag under tropical suns
 and over northern snows if
 I here express the deep
 sorrow which always overwhelms Ine
 I think of turning from
 the flag I have tbllowed
 so long for which I
 have suffered in ways It
 does not become me to
 speak or feeling that hencetörth
 it is not to be
 tbc banner will bail with
 the rising sun and the
 banner which by day and
 greet as the sun goes
 down by night I arn
 ready to follow But God
 who knows the hearts of
 men will judge between you
 and us at whose door
 lies the responsibility o this
 There is no one in
 the United States who is
 more willing to do justice
 to the distinguished Senator from
 Mississippi than myself and when
 consider his early education when
 I look at his gallant
 services findins him first in
 the military school of the
 United States educated by his
 Gov ernment taught the science
 of war at the expense
 of his countFy taught to
 love the principles of the
 Constitution afterwards entering its service
 fwhting beneath the stars and
 stripes to which he has
 so handsomely alluded winning laurels
 that are green and imperishable
 and bearing upon his person
 scars thatarc honorable sonic of
 which have been won at
 home others of which have
 been won in a foreign
 clime and upon other fields
 I would be the last
 man to pluck a feather
 from the flag of his
 country He was there not
 as an his cap or
 a single gem from the
 chaplet that en I Ie
 was there in possession of
 the prop circles his illustrious
 brow But when I consider
 intruder There is a great
 terror and dread of the
 capacity erty owned by the
 United States not to menace
 his early associations when i
 remember that he of the
 people to govern themselves In
 South not to insult not
 to violate rights but simply
 to was nurtured by this
 Government that he fought defend
 the flag and honor of
 his country and take I
 for this Goverhment that he
 won honors under Carolina when
 the ordinance was passed to
 with II the flag of
 this Government I cannot understand
 care of the public property
 and because he re draw
 from the Union did the
 con vention trust the how
 he can be to hail
 anothcr banner and tired fronl
 a position where he could
 have been judgment upon it
 MT ere people to pass
 their they consulted Did ihcy
 indorse it Have they captured
 where the American flag could
 have bccn desert the one
 of his country under which
 hé passed their judgment upon
 it to this day Taking
 struck and made to trail
 in the dust and the
 Pal won laurels and received
 honors This isa m atter
 772 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 6 of 2taste however but
 it seems to me that
 if I could not unsheath
 my sword in vindication of
 the flag of my country
 its glorious stars and stripes
 I would return the sword
 to its scabbard I would
 never sheathe it in the
 bosom of my mother never
 never Sir my own feelings
 in reference to that flag
 are such as must have
 filled tbc heart Of that
 noble son of South Carolina
 Joel R Poin sett when
 nearly thirty years ago in
 an address to the people
 of Charleston he declared Wherever
 I have been I have
 been proud of being a
 citizen of this Republic and
 to the remotest corners of
 the earth have walked erect
 and secure under that banner
 whieh our opponents would tear
 down and tråmple under was
 in Mexico when the town
 was taken by as foot
 sault The house of the
 American embassador was then as
 it ought to be the
 refuge oftbe distressed and persecuted
 it was pointed out to
 the infuriated soldiery asa place
 filled with their enemies They
 refused to attack My only
 dc the instant that hundreds
 of muskets were leveled at
 us Mr Mason a braver
 man never stood by his
 fricnd in the hour of
 danger and myself placed ourselves
 beneath its waving folds an
 i the attack was suspended
 wc did not blanch for
 we rut strong in the
 protecting arm of this mighty
 Republic We told them that
 the flag that waved over
 us was the banner of
 that nation to whose é
 xmnpie they owed their liberties
 and to whose protection they
 were indebted for their safety
 The scene changed as by
 enchantment those men who were
 on the point of attack
 ing and massacreing the inhabitants
 cheered the flag of our
 country and placed sentinels to
 protect it from outrage Fellow
 citizens in such a noment
 as that would it have
 been any protection to me
 and mine to have pro
 claimed myself a Carolinian Should
 I have been here to
 tell you this tale it
 I had hung out the
 pairnetto and single star Be
 assured that to be respected
 abroad we must maintain our
 place in the Union Sir
 I intend to stand by
 that flag and by the
 Union of which it is
 the emblem I agree with
 that this Gov Mr A
 H Stephens of Georgia ernment
 of our fathers with all
 its defects comes nearer the
 objects of all good governments
 than an V other on
 the face of the earth
 I have made allusions to
 the various Senators who have
 attacked me in vindication of
 myself 1 have been attacked
 on all hands by some
 five or six and may
 be attacked again All I
 ask is that in making
 these attacks they nicet my
 po sitions answer my argutnents
 refutc my facts I care
 not for the number that
 may have attacked me I
 care not how tnany may
 come hereafter Feeling that I
 am in the right that
 argument that fact that truth
 are on my side I
 place them all at defiance
 Come one come all for
 I feel in the words
 of the great dramatic poet
 Thrice is he armed that
 hath his quarrel just And
 he but naked though locked
 up in steel Whose conscience
 with secession corrupted I have
 been told and I have
 heard it repeated It has
 been said in this that
 this Union isgone Chamber that
 it is in the cold
 sweat of death in fact
 it is really dead and
 merely lying in state waiting
 for the funeral obsequies to
 be If this be so
 and the war that has
 peribrmed been madc upon mc
 in consequence of advocat inq
 the Constitution and t he
 Union is to result in
 my overtlil ow and in
 my destruction and that flagr
 that glorious flag the emblem
 of the Union which wus
 borne by Washington througli a
 seven years struggle shall be
 struck from the Capitol and
 trailed in the dust when
 this Union is in terred
 I want no more honorable
 winding sheet than that brave
 old flag and no more
 glorious rave thau to be
 interred in tho tomb of
 the Union Applausc in the
 galleries For it I have
 stood for it will continue
 to stand I care not
 whence the blows come and
 some will find beforc this
 thing is over that while
 there arc blows to be
 given there will be blows
 to receive and that while
 others can thrust there are
 some who cau parry They
 will find that it is
 a game that two can
 play at God preserve my
 country frotn the desolatton that
 is threatening her from treason
 and traitors Is there not
 some chosen curse Sonje hidden
 thunder in the stores of
 heaven Red with uncomrnon wrath
 to blast the Inan Who
 owes his greatness to his
 country s ruin Applause in
 the galleries In conclusion Mr
 President I make an appeal
 Will you sit with stoic
 indifference and see those who
 are willing to stand by
 the Constitution and uphold the
 pillars of the Government driven
 away by the raÉing surges
 that are now sweeping over
 some portions of the country
 As conservative men as patriots
 as men who desire the
 preser vation of this great
 this good this unparalleled Government
 I ask you to save
 the country or let the
 propositions be submitted to the
 people that the heart of
 the nation may respond to
 them I have an abiding
 confidence in the intelligence the
 patriotism and the integrity of
 the great mass of the
 people and I feel in
 my own heart that if
 this subject could begot before
 them they would settle the
 question and the Union of
 these States would be preserved
 Applause in the galleries Mr
 WILSON I rise for thc
 purpose of mov ing that
 the further consideration of this
 question be postponed until Monday
 next at one o clock
 Mr LANE I hope the
 Senator will not do that
 Mr G WIN That is
 too far off Say to
 mor Mr LANE It would
 be very unfair to gen
 tlemen who Mr WIGFALL 1
 will say to the Senate
 that I desire to make
 some remarks on this sub
 ject There has been a
 very wide latitude and 1
 desire to speak this evening
 or to morrow morn I
 am indifferent which in hr
 WILSON I suppose I shall
 have to yield the floor
 for that purpose It seems
 to me though that we
 have the tariff and several
 other import ant measures to
 take up the residue of
 this week and I v
 ish to get the question
 over until Monday However I
 will withdraw the motion for
 the purpose of allowing the
 Senator to go on Mr
 WIGFALL Mr President Mr GREEN
 Will the Senator yield to
 me I desire an executive
 session this evening on very
 important business and the Senator
 from Texas can spcak tomorrow
 at one o clock and
 with no inconvenience to anybody
 I therefore sub mit that
 motion which is a privileged
 motion Mr WADE Mr President
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr POLK
 in I understood the Senator
 fronfTexas the chair to have
 thc floor now by the
 courtesy of the Sen ator
 from Massachusetts Does the Senator
 from Texas give way to
 the Senator from Missouri to
 submit the motion which he
 has just now made Mr
 WIGFALL 1 do Mr SIMMONS
 1 ask the Senator from
 Mis souri to let mc
 assign a bill that was
 the special ordcu for to
 day at one o clock
 but by some omis Sion
 of the President wus not
 called up No objection Mr
 CAMERON I rise to a
 question of order I havo
 been trying to be heard
 The PRESIDING OFFICER It is
 due that I should stay
 to the Senator from Rhode
 Island that I am informed
 by the Clerk that the
 special order was called up
 by the Chair but the
 unfin ishcd business of yesterday
 took precedence of it of
 course Mr CAMICRON I rise
 to a question of order
 Mr President It is that
 the tariff bill is now
 in It was postponed by
 common consent to allow the
 Senator from Tennessee to conclude
 the gpeeeh which he began
 yesterday and as a Inat
 ter of course that bill
 nowr comes up i want
 to throw myself on the
 generosity of the Senator from
 Missouri and the Senator from
 Texas to let us proceed
 with that bill and get
 through m vith it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Will the Sen
 ator state his question of
 order Mr CAMERON The question
 of order is that the
 tariff bill is now the
 business before the Se n
 ate The PRESIDING OFFICER 1
 will state to the Senator
 that the motion now is
 that the Sen ate go
 into executive session Mr GREEN
 That has priority over every
 Mr WADE I wish to
 appeal to the Senate to
 take up a joint resolution
 that has just passed Mr
 BIGLER We cannot do that
 now Mr WADE The Commissuoner
 of Patents is about to
 decide the case without full
 testimony Mr WADE 1 presume
 not Mr GREEN It can
 be done to morrow morn
 ing Mr HUNTER 1 am
 told that the resolution in
 regard to McCormick s reaper
 ought to he re ferred
 It will give some special
 advantage in the way of
 testimony to persons who want
 to take away a patent
 It is only to extend
 Mr WADE Not at all
 the time for taking testimony
 Mr HUNTER It ought to
 be examined Mr GREEN 1
 do not yield the floor
 The question is on my
 motion for an executive session
 Mr WIGFALL 1 will suggest
 that 1 only gave the
 floor to the Senator from
 Missouri to make a specific
 motion and everybody else has
 had it ever ince I
 yielded the floor to him
 for that purpose Mr FESSENDEN
 1 ask the Senator to
 yield to me for the
 purpose of giving him a
 notice Mr WIGFALL Certainly Mr
 FESSENDEN There several import ant
 biEls requiring the action of
 the Senate would not call
 the attention of the Senate
 to them now if the
 chairman of the Committee on
 Finance was here but he
 is not and I know
 what his in tention is
 Those bills must be takcn
 up at some time and
 if this debate is to
 go on and take pre
 cedence of everything else from
 day to day we shall
 go through this session without
 passing any of them Now
 I want simply to give
 notice to gentlemen so that
 they may not consider us
 dis courteous when we oppose
 the further proceed ing of
 this debate until some of
 those bills are disposed of
 that such is our intention
 and I shall do it
 to morrow when the time
 comes Mr G WIN I
 wish to say that the
 chairman of the Committee on
 Finance is now out on
 a com mittee of conference
 and will be in in
 a few mo ments Mr
 FESSENDEN 1 have given the
 notice We do not want
 any of our bills taken
 up to day There are
 none ready to day To
 morrow we shall insist on
 it Mr SIMMONS Mr Pr
 ident The PRESIDING OFFICER Does
 the Sen ator from I
 exas yield to the Senator
 from Rhode Island Mr WIGFALL
 I will give way to
 him too I cannot hear
 him if I can hear
 what he says Mr SIMMONS
 1 will speak loud enough
 When the hour came for
 the special order to day
 there was a debate on
 the privileged question about reconsidering
 the vote on the passage
 of the terri torial bill
 The special order was passed
 over informally in order that
 that debate might be con
 tinued for half an hour
 When that was through before
 anybody had a chance to
 call the attention of the
 Presiding Offcer to the order
 of business the Senator from
 Tennessee who was left unfin
 ished yesterday in his remarks
 went on and it was
 considered to be waived until
 he got through and I
 believe that is naturally the
 order now At any rate
 if the Senator from Missouri
 will give way for me
 to move to make it
 the special order for to
 morrow at one o clock
 Mr WIGFALL I have the
 floor not the Senator from
 Missouri Mr SIMMONS But you
 yielded to him to make
 this motion What I want
 to do is to get
 the bill assigned for to
 morrow I consider it my
 duty to insist on some
 order in this business was
 assigned on Friday lastTor to
 day and all I ask
 is that the bill may
 have a fair chance The
 revenues of the Government depend
 on it and I want
 it to be considered because
 it has to go back
 to the House of Representatives
 that tho amend ments may
 be concurred in I wish
 to make it the special
 order for to morrow with
 the understand to tbe conservative
 men of all parties You
 sec the posture of public
 affairs you see the condition
 the House bf Representatives There
 is great of the country
 you see along thc line
 ot battle the necessity for
 its ill mediate passaoe various
 points of conflict you see
 the struggle Mr GREEN Do
 that to morrow morning Which
 the Union Inen havc to
 maintain iu many Mr WADE
 It is a resolution that
 ought to Of the Sgttgs
 You ought to know and
 feel what bo passed promptly
 It is on the subject
 of the is necessary to
 sustain those who in their
 hearts McCormick reaper We want
 to extend the time I
 for taking testimony in that
 matter desire the prefieryation of
 this Union of States The
 PRESIDING OFFICER I vill state
 to the Senator that there
 is already a motion before
 the Senate Mr SIMMONS That
 has given way for me
 to make this statement Mr
 GREEN 1 gave way to
 enable the Sen ator to
 make a statement not a

 If the gentleman from Ohio
 will listen to me for
 a moment I think he
 will yield to me I
 desire to offer a joint
 resolution for the consideration of
 the House in regard to
 the con dition of the
 people of Kansas A groat
 public calamity now hangs over
 the people of that new
 State and I think it
 is a matter which calls
 for consideration by Congress I
 ask that the reso lution
 which I propose may be
 considered by the House Mr
 PHELPS I object Let us
 proceed with the regular order
 of business LOAN BILL Tho
 SPEAKER The regular order of
 busi ness is the consideration
 of the Senate am end
 ments to thc act H
 R 972 authorizing a loan
 First amendment of the Senate
 After the word such insert
 the word loan so that
 it wilk rcad that sealed
 proposals for such loan ec
 Mr PHELPS 1 suppose there
 is no objec tion to
 that amendment Let the question
 be taken I desire to
 say something on the second
 upon it amendment I he
 question was taken and the
 first amend mcnt was concurred
 in Second amendment of the
 Senate At the cod of
 t he bill add the
 following new section SEC 5
 Hnd be it further enacted
 That the aet of June
 22 1860 entitled An act
 authorizing a loan and prov
 ding för the redemption of
 notes bc and the same
 is hereby rcpcalcd Mr PHELPS
 I hopc the House vy
 ill concur in this amendment
 of the Senate When this
 bill was under consideration in
 the House last week I
 contended that it was the
 true policy of the Government
 to exhaust the rcsidue of
 the loan authorized by the
 act of 22d June last
 before we authorized a new
 loan to be made I
 desired to have the third
 section of that law so
 modified that the Secretary of
 the Treasury might accept the
 best proposals that should be
 made by capitalists of the
 country for so much moncy
 as might be needed to
 defray the current expenses of
 the Gov ernment The House
 did not however agree in
 the views which I entertained
 and instead of exhausting the
 old loan which authorizes the
 Secretary of the Treasury to
 obtain nearly four teen milfion
 dollars the House orders anew
 loan of 25 000 000
 to bc negotiated The condition
 of the t rreasury and
 the condition of the public
 credit of the country should
 admonish us that we sllou
 d proceed with caution in
 authorizinm a debt to be
 contracted At this moment the
 out money market admonish me
 to authorize no I larger
 loan than is absolutely necessary
 to defray standing debt of
 the United States is 69
 373 000 comprising the loans
 authorized by the acts of
 the current expenses of the
 Government Tl 1Fu CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 1842 1846 1847 1848 1858
 and 1860 the Texas Mr
 SHERMAN I hope the amendment
 of February 69 indemnity loan
 of 1850 together with the
 out standing Treasury notes authorized
 by several acts Here is
 a tabular statement showing the
 debt of the Government 00
 o GO 00 cg m
 6 o c oo oc
 o ee cru cn cc
 Then the existing debt of
 the United States is nearly
 seventy million dollars The 10
 000 000 Treasuu y notes
 recently issucd were negotiated a
 portion at twelve per cent
 and a portion at bc
 tween ten and eleven Your
 ten per cent Treas ury
 notes are sold in the
 rnarket of York below par
 and if you authorize new
 loans that are not absolutely
 necessary you cannot neoo i
 have made tiate them except
 at ruinous rates a computation
 of the actual debt created

 created by this Congress The
 bal ance of tho loan
 authorized under act of 22d
 June 1860 is 13 978
 000 the amendment of the
 Senate be concurred in that
 loan cannot be netyo I
 am in favor of that
 amendment tiated tariff bill which
 will probably become a law
 authorizes thc loan of The
 Pacific railroad bill as it
 i nssed the Illousc authorized
 an indebtedness of and the
 Senate has put on an
 additionai 25 000 000 In
 other words the proposed indebtedness
 of the country is 167
 000 000 making with the
 present public debt and the
 loan already authorized an aggregate
 of 250 351 649 With
 such indebtedness hdw can you
 expect to raise a loan
 on favorable terms I hope
 this amendment of the Senate
 will be con curred in
 The Government will then be
 enabled to raise the loan
 of 25 000 000 authorized
 in this bill and authorized
 in the tariff act i
 The Secretary of the Treasury
 has told you that he
 will need 25 000 000
 between the date of his
 communication and the 1st of
 July next in addi the
 Senate will not be concurred
 in and if I can
 have the attention of the
 House for two minutes I
 think I can crivc ample
 reasons why it should not
 be concurred in The gentleman
 from Missouri seems to be
 in very much the condition
 of his party for this
 seems to be on his
 part to some extent a
 party measure Let us look
 at the result of the
 course hc asks this House
 to take He seems to
 be will ing to throw
 upon the incoming Administration all
 the indebtedness incurred bv this
 if possible Now all I
 ask IS that this Administration
 shall pay off its own
 debts or provide for the
 payment of them and not
 throw thém over upon the
 in I do believe that
 under coming Administration the tariff
 act now pending in the
 other branch of I Congress
 if it shall become a
 law the revenues of this
 Government will be suffcient to
 meet the expenses of the
 Government under the incoming I
 believe that it is the
 duty of Administration that Administration
 to reduce the expenses of
 the Government to the standard
 of the rcvenucs of the
 Government Now what is the
 condition of the Treasury at
 this time The Secretary of
 the Treasury says he shall
 need a loan of 25
 000 000 to meet the
 expenses of the Government up
 to the 1st of Jul
 v next This bill provides
 a loan to that amount
 to pay off the debts
 of the prcscnt Admin istration
 up to that time Then
 in addition to that there
 is another debt to pay
 This Admin istration in December
 last issued 10 000 000
 of Treasury notes at twelve
 pcr cent Those notes are
 due next December For the
 redemption of those Treasury notes
 the remaining portion of the
 loan of June last was
 specifically pledged Yet the gentleman
 from Missouri now proposes to
 re peal that loan of
 June last in express violation
 of the law of Doce2übcr
 last and in pursuance of
 which the fåith of the
 Government was directly pledged to
 apply that loan to the
 redemption of Treasury notes Icavino
 no means for the retire
 ment of the Treasury notes
 of last December Now that
 is Illc condition in which
 the matter If the tu
 nendkncnt of the Senate be
 con stands Decernber next when
 the currcd h flh casury
 notes become due there wili
 be no means provided whatever
 for the retire ment of
 those Treasury notes They will
 go on bearing interest at
 the rate of twelve per
 cent thus disgracing the Government
 No Govern ment and indeed
 no individual can afford to
 pay twelve per cent interest
 for any length of time
 The effect of the course
 the gentleman from Mis souri
 asks us to pursue is
 to throw the burden of
 providing the means for the
 payment of these ih easury
 notes when they become due
 on the incoming Administration You
 Icavc the incom ing Administration
 not only with the responsibil
 Now Mr Speaker I do
 hope gentlelnen on both sides
 of the House will permit
 us to make provision for
 paying the debts of the
 present Administration and not saddle
 those debts upon the incoming
 Administration I repeat that the
 25 000 000 loan provided
 for in this bill is
 re quired to pay the
 debts of the Government up
 to July next and that
 if this amendment of thc
 Sen ate is concurred in
 there will still remain the
 sum of 10 000 000
 of outstanding Treasury not cs
 for which no provision will
 havc been made We ask
 for nothing more than that
 this Administration should make provision
 for the settlement of its
 own accounts and it seems
 to me that nothing less
 than that should be granted
 Mr PHELPS The gentleman from
 Ohio marks that I am
 unwilling to provide the means
 for the payment of the
 debts of the present Ad
 ministration In this he is
 mistaken The gentle man states
 correctly that this loan of
 will be suffcient to defray
 the expenses of the Government
 until thc 30th day of
 June next The 21 000
 000 loan bill attached to
 the tariff bill now pending
 in the Senate will then
 be sufficient not only to
 redeem the 10 000 000
 of outstanding Treasury notes but
 to meet any of the
 ordinary wants of the Government
 in addition Under the existing
 law all outstanding Treasury notes
 arc redeemable out of any
 of the moncy in the
 Treas ury not otherwise appropriated
 The loan bill attached to
 the tariff bill will therefore
 bc appli cable to the
 redemption of any outstanding Treas
 ury notes or for the
 payment of any debts of
 the present Administration which may
 remairl un paid The Housc
 will therefore understand that the
 incoming Administration instead of havin
 the debts of the present
 Administration to make provision for
 will have from five to
 fifteen million dollars provided for
 the payment of their own
 ex penses after the commencement
 of the next fiscal year
 Why sir I again call
 the attention of the House
 to the enormous sum thc
 chairman of the Committee of
 Ways and Means wants to
 throw upon the credit of
 the Government He wants 25
 000 000 to meet the
 expenses of the public service
 up to July next He
 wants 21 000 000 to
 be raised after the cornmencement
 of the next fiscal year
 making a sum of 46
 000 000 He then wants
 the remainder of the loan
 of Juno last amounting to
 14 000 000 to be
 rendered avail able making an
 aggregate sum of 60 000
 000 of indebtedness which the
 present and incoming Ad ministration
 will be authorized to incur
 to diminish that amount by
 14 000 000 still leav
 in F morc than enough
 to disembarrass tho incom ino
 Administration from any debts of
 the present one and it
 is for this reason that
 advocate thc adoption of the
 amendment of the Scnatc Now
 sir I take the gentleman
 from Ohio on that the
 present pending his own declaration
 tariff bill will provide revenue
 from the customs suffteiont to
 meet all the wants of
 tho Government ity of providing
 the rneans of paying its
 current for its current expenses
 There will then re expenses
 but with the payment of
 10 000 000 of main
 for the incommg Administration a
 loan of 21 000 000
 available after the 30th day
 of Junc tho debts of
 the present Administration next against
 the of outstanding Treas But
 sir the gentleman refers to
 the Pacific rail road bill
 Ido not know whether that
 bill will pass I ury
 not es redeemable in December
 next or not but the
 gentleman knows very wcll that
 if it does pass no
 money will have to be
 paid under it probably for
 years to come No money
 can bc paid or liabilities
 incurred until fifty miles of
 the road shall have been
 completed T hc gentleman also
 talks about the tariff bill
 Wcll sir if the tariff
 bill passes I believe revenue
 enough will be raised under
 it to defray the ordi
 nary expenses of the Government
 The loan bill attached to
 that bill is only intended
 to provide tion to the
 current revenues of the country
 But for some unforeseen emergency
 a contingency I hope that
 no future Ad if the
 political troubles of the country
 shall be that may not
 happen adjusted before the close
 of this session of Con
 I ministration will be found
 coming here session gress and
 if the operation of the
 new tariff bill after session
 asking for a loan to
 mcct the ordi nary expenses
 of the Government I hope
 the in will increase the
 revenue by 8 000 000
 as pre dicted by its
 friends then we will not
 want to coming Administration will
 conform its expenses authorize so

 that there was a desire

 no Administration will allow the

 informed that the gentle Senate
 men on the other side
 of the House would have

 recital of the indebtedness of
 the Government These considerations and
 the condition of the II
 to the standard of the
 revenues collected i say then
 when we are going into
 the money market which is
 now strin yent and when
 apprc hensions are entertained on
 the part of capitalists that
 the existing political disturbances may
 not be adjusted we ought
 to call for the smallest
 sum If bidders propose to
 take this loan at possible
 ninety cents we are compelled
 to award it to them
 and if they bid only
 eighty cents on the dollar
 we arc still compelled to
 award it to them or
 let the creditors of the
 Government suffer I think that
 the better way would have
 been to issue was willing
 how additional Treasury notes cvcr
 that the 14 000 000
 loan should stand upon the
 statutc book and notauthorize the
 25 000 000 loan and
 then thc Secretary of the
 Treasury would have negotiated it
 upon the best terms which
 he could obtain If an
 adjustment of our troubles shall
 be made during this session
 of Congress the money market
 will be relieved from the
 existing stringency and a loan
 might be secured at six
 or seven per cent with
 ten or twenty years to

 art Stout Stratton Tappan Thayer
 Tompkins Train the Government upon
 the shortestallowanc e neces sary
 to carry it on with
 honor and credit My opposition
 now is not because of
 thc incoming of a ncw
 Administration of different politics from
 mine but because of the
 condition of the Treas ury
 at this time Our finances
 admonish us sir to pursue
 the course of caution and
 economy At all events the
 conviction of my judgment has
 prompted me to the course
 I have pursued It is
 my pleasure to acknowledge that
 the gentleman from Ohio Mr
 SHERMAN has been a colaborer
 of mine in the Committee
 of Ways and Mcans as
 well as he has generally
 been in this House for
 the reduction of the expenditures
 of the Gov crnment and
 the defeat of all extravagant
 and unnecessary appropriations 1 have
 made these remarks because tho
 gentle man from Ohio unintentionally
 I have no doubt represented
 me as unwilling to provide
 for pav ing the indebtedness
 of the present Administra tion
 For that indebtedness I think
 that have fully shown ample
 provision has already been 1
 lefcr to the 21 000
 000 loan provided made for
 in the tariff bilk which
 bill xvill undoubtedly pass during
 this session Mr SHERMAN The
 gentleman from Mis souri refers
 to the lariff bill as
 containing a loan The first
 reply to that is a
 reference to the language of
 the law itself By the
 very terms of that tariff
 bill the money to be
 raised under it cannot be
 appEied to a redemption of
 ih easury notes the contrary
 it is specifically provided that
 the loan shall be devoted
 to the meeting of any
 de ficiency in the current
 revcnues of tl C Govern
 It is true that that
 may bc changed In menl
 the next place if wo
 should only givc place to
 ono loan by another we
 might reduce thc loan provided
 in the tariff bill to
 Mr PHELPS Then the gentleman
 admits that he anticipates a
 deficicncy of under the tariff
 bill Mr SHERMAN I do
 not anticipate any such deficiency
 but i do say that
 it is Wisc to nrovidc
 against any contingency which may
 arise l he surn sve
 have here to do is
 not beyond the capacity of
 the youngest boy in an
 arit htnetic class Hero we
 have a debt of and
 how are we going to
 pay it You have 10
 000 000 of Treasury notes
 bearing twelve per cent interest
 which arc due next December
 How are you going to
 pay trhcm My friend from
 Missouri Mrl says by the
 loan in thc tariff bill
 But there is already a
 loan bill upon our statute
 books under vhich these Treasury
 notes can be withdrawn when
 they become due Why then
 repeal one law to give
 place to another unless it
 bc to show that the
 new Administration have borrowed 21
 000 000 to pay the
 liabilities of the Governrnent I
 say to you gentlemerl on
 the other side pay your
 own liabilities or pleduo the

 with Mr GARNETT of Virginia
 who has been suddenly called
 away by the death of
 a relative IVIu FLORENCE not
 being within the bar when
 his name was called asked
 leave to vote Objcctiop was
 made Mr FLORENCE would have
 voted in the nemcttivc The
 vote was announced as above
 recorded Mr SHERMAN moved reconsider
 the vote by which the
 amendment of the Senate was
 non concurred in and also
 moved that the motion to
 reconsider be laid upon the
 table The latter motion was
 agreed to ENROLLED BILLS Mr

 FROM TIIF SENATE A messagc
 was received from the Senate
 by Mr PATTON onc of
 its clerks House that that
 body returned House bill No
 714 in accordance with the
 request of the House for
 the correction of a clerical
 error and also that it
 had ordered the printing of
 certain documents ILLINOIS SALINE LANDS
 T hc SPEAKER stated the
 next question in order to
 be the consideration of I
 louse bill No 975 for
 the confirmation of title to
 salinc lands in Jackson county
 in the State of Illinois
 to D H Brush and
 others N lr LOGAN I
 move that the bill be
 now put on its passage
 will saya word in explanation
 before any vote is taken
 on the bill The ordi
 nanco admitting Illinois into the
 Union provided that the saline
 lands in the State should
 be reserved to the State
 for the purpose of being
 leased In 1847 Congress passed
 a law authorizing the Lc
 gislature of the State of
 Illinois to pass a law
 to The Legislature sell these
 lands to purchascrs passed such
 a law appointiug a commission
 to disposc of the lands
 The lands were sold in
 pursuance of this authority and
 the purchasers received their decds
 from the commissioners But on
 exan lination of the records
 in the land depart ment
 i find that thcrc is
 no record there of the
 reserved lands The Commissioner of
 the Gen eral Land Oflicc
 suqrgested to me that the
 best plan was to get
 a bill passed recognizing the
 title rl he description of
 the land of these purcllasers
 is set out in the
 bill with the namcs of
 thc pur chasers and tho
 bill only recocrnizcs their pur
 chases as valid for the
 purpose of making their claim
 of title complete The bill
 is recommended by the Conn
 nissioncr of the General Land
 Ofiice These are thc facts
 Thc bill is a meritorious
 It will save one and
 I hopc it will be
 passed much unnecessary litigation Mr
 BINGHAM Is the bill confined
 to the lands which have
 already been sold Mr LOGAN
 It is The lands have
 been sold and the nmnes
 of the purchasers are in
 the bill The bili was
 then ordered to be encrossed
 and read a third time
 and boing engrossed it was
 accordingly read the third time
 and passed Mr LOGAN moved
 to reconsider the vote by
 which the bill was passed
 and also moved to lay
 the motion to reconsider on
 the table The latter motion
 was agreed to POSTAL SERVICE
 Mr COLFAX I now withdraw
 my motion to recommit House
 bilt No 95 in regard
 to the postal service and
 offer a substitute tor the
 bill I desire to say
 which send to the Cicrk
 s desk seceded from the
 Union an inference which the
 committee did not desire to
 have drawn they have thought
 proper to authorize me to
 report a more general provision
 covering the same ground which
 will last till and be
 as applicable to the year
 1900 as well as to
 the vear 1861 The substitute
 was read is follows Strike
 out the preamble and all
 after the etwcting cluuse and
 insert l hat whenever in
 the opinion of the Postmaster
 General the postal service cannot
 be safely continued or the
 Post Office revenues collected or
 the postal laws maintained or
 the contents of the mailg
 ptescrved inviolate till deliv ered
 to thc proper address on
 any post route by reason
 of any insurrection or resistance
 to the laws of the
 United States the PosünasterGcnerai is
 hereby authorized to dis continue
 the postal service on such
 route or any part thoro
 of and at any post
 offces thereon till the sanne
 can be safely restored and
 shall report his action to
 Congress Mr COLFAX The House
 will see there is no
 preamble to this substitute that
 it lays down the broad
 and general proposition that when
 the postal laws cannot be
 maintained the Postmaster General shall
 be authorized to discontinue the
 service and report his action
 to Congress I now dcsire
 to enter the motion to
 recommit and after that motion
 is entered I desire to
 state that although I have
 a speech of half an
 hour which would like to
 deliver yet at the same
 time as it s vas
 debated yesterday by one speech
 in favor and one aTainst
 the proposition and as gentlemen
 arc desirous that it should
 be immedi ately brought to
 vote and inasmuch as I
 myseif think that votes are
 better speeches than mere words
 I shall forego the explanatory
 and statis tical speech i
 desired to make and move
 the pre If the House
 desire to keep on vious
 question debating the bill for
 a week they can vote
 down the previous question I
 desire to Mr CRAIGE of
 North Carolina offer a substitute
 and I hope the gentleman
 wiil permit it to bc
 read Mr VAI LANDIGHAM 1
 ask the gentle man from
 Indiana to withdraw the previous
 ques I would say to
 the gentleman that the sub
 t ion stitute now presented
 is materially different from the
 one which has been printed
 and which has It is
 duc to the members becn
 under discussion of the House
 that the substitute should be
 printed and an opportunity allowed
 for examination 1 or that
 rcason hope the gentleman will
 not insist upon the prcvious
 question but let the substitute
 be printed in tho Globe
 or in the usual manner
 in which bills are printed
 and let us have at
 least one or two days
 in which we may look
 into its provisions and effect
 to see whether it is
 consti tutional and whether it
 is a proper plan to
 be adopted at any time
 I am not sure from
 hear ing it read but
 that it is a bill
 which ought to pass Mr
 McCLERNAND 1 desire to the
 chair man of the Committee
 on the Post Offce and
 Post Roads a question in
 order to enlighten myself I
 think I am ready to
 vote for upon the matter
 the bill if f understood
 aright the gentleman s explanation
 of it Did I understood
 the chairman to say that
 this bill dispenses with the
 preamble Mr COLFAX It does
 Mr McCLERNAND Did 1 understand
 the gentleman to state that
 the operation of the bill
 fs not limited to any
 particular section State or locality
 Mr COLFAX It is not
 Mr McCLERNAND Or to any
 particular Mr COLFAX To cases
 which may occur anywhere Mr
 McCLERNAND To the obstruction of
 mails anywhere in the United
 States Mr COLFAX Yes sir
 Mr McCLERNAND Then 1 am
 prepared to votc for it
 Mr CRAIGE of North Carolina
 1 hope the allow my
 amendment to be read rycntleman
 will The SPEAKER The only
 motion now is upon seconding
 the demand for the previous
 ques tion Mr SIMMS I
 desire to put a question
 to the gentleman from Indiana
 Although the gentleman has said
 that the terms of this
 bill are general I desirc
 to know whether it was
 not intended espc cially to
 apply to seceding States Mr
 COLF AX I will answer
 the gentleman to the I
 louse that as it yesterday
 appeared that I if tho
 unanimous consent of the Housc
 allows me some gentlen lcn
 supposed there tnicrl t bc
 an in I fercijcc drawn
 frorn he bill as it
 was reported The provisions of
 tbe bill would have applied
 to of an acknowledgment that
 certain Statos had II the
 city of Erie Pennsylvania when
 the rioters 776 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 6 prevented the
 mails from passing that city
 a few ago The post
 offcc could have been sus
 pended and the mail routes
 to it and harmony would
 thus have been soon restored
 Mr SIMMS But that event
 in our history is passed
 and we are not legislating
 for events which took place
 four or five ears ago
 Mr VÄLLANDIGÅAM 1 hope the
 gentle man will this bill
 to pass over until to
 mor row Mr BRANCH Ifthe
 gentleman frorn Indiana can satisfactorily
 ansx ver me two questions
 I In the first place
 I think I can support
 his bill would like to
 know whether the Postmaster Gen
 eral doesnot possess under existing
 laws all the power that
 is proposed to be conferred
 upon him by this substitute
 Mr COLFAX It must be
 a matter of some doubt
 as the gentleman from North
 Carolina and the gentleman from
 Kentucky had a very able
 debate upon one branch of
 that very question the other
 day Mr BRANCH Another question
 If the sub stitute now
 proposed by the gentleman from
 Indi ana is adopted under
 that and under existing laws
 can the Postmaster General make
 arrange ments for transferring the
 mails when they reach the
 borders of the States in
 which obstructions exist over to
 any mails that may be
 carried under the authority of
 those States so that citizens
 of States which have not
 seceded can correspond with the
 citizens of States which have
 Mr COLFAX I will say
 to the gcntlcman although this
 bill has no reference to
 State lines that the mails
 may of course be carried
 to the borders o the
 States to which mail routes
 lead under existing contracts even
 if discontinued be Besides that
 letters may be yond those
 borders carried all over those
 States by express companies ifthelettersare
 placedin stamped envelope s Even
 now under existintp laws where
 express compa nies run upon
 the same lincs with the
 nmils they can carry letters
 in competition with thc Depart
 ment if the letters are
 in closed in starnpod envel
 opes which by the law
 J ever can be used
 a soc ond time Therefore
 the correspondence with all States
 can be carried on through
 the express com panies by
 letters placed in stamped envelopes
 If I can get a
 satisfactory Mr BRAN CH answer
 upon that point I can
 vote for the gentle 1
 have no desire that this
 Govern man s bill ment
 shall keep up mail service
 in those Slates which huvc
 chosen t say that the
 laws of the Union are
 no longer in forec there
 Do I then understand the
 gentleman from Indiana to say
 that if this bill is
 passed under it and under
 the existing laws the citizens
 of those States that have
 not attempted to secede will
 still have the means of
 corresponding with persons livin in
 those Slates that have seceded
 Mr COLFAX I have no
 doübt that they will The
 mails could bc carried to
 the border of thc State
 which has seceded and after
 that 1 suppose the authorities
 of that State would have
 to cafry then Thus in
 the wilderness frontier wo carry
 letters as near the settler
 as our l ost al
 system extends and he has
 to sec to getting them
 from that terminus at his
 own expense Pike s Peak
 last ycar was a signal
 instance of tl iis Till
 we established mail routes and
 postal service there the whole
 mail for that region was
 taken at the frontier by
 an express company under the
 con sent of the Department
 and conveyed over the plains
 to the miners at twenty
 five cents per letter They
 brought back replies and mailed
 them on our frontiet Mr
 BRANCH That is the point
 After letters reach the borders
 of those States is the
 Postmaster General authorized to make
 arrancre ments with those States
 or the inhabitants for transferring
 the letters across the border
 Mr COLFAX If in any
 region our postal laws cannot
 be maintained we can only
 take the mails as far
 as they are protected by
 law The letters will thus
 be carried to the terminus
 of the route upon the
 borders of the States There
 they will stop and I
 doubt not that like the
 Pike s Peak arrangement if
 means are provided for their
 being carried further on there
 would be no ob jection
 to this being done It
 certainly ought to be done
 and doubtless wilt Mr BRANCH
 Delivered to the persons to
 whom directed or an authorized
 public aoent Mr COLFAX Not
 to the person directed perhaps
 for we have no post
 route to his resi dcnce
 but if any arrangements should
 have been made for carrying
 the mails there no objection
 could be made to their
 taking them on at their
 own expense Mr BRANCH I
 understand the gentleman to say
 then that if this law
 passes the Postmaster General will
 be invested with power bv
 law to make arrangements for
 carrying letters addressed to persons
 resident in the States that
 have seceded to the borders
 of those States and there
 deliver ing them over to
 the authorized agents of those
 States to bc transferred to
 their destination Mr COLFAX Certainly
 sir to any means that
 those people who are not
 on existing mail routes should
 provide for their reception and
 trans mission Mr MAYNARD 1
 desire to ask the gentle
 man from Indiana one question
 I objected to the gentleman
 s bill because on its
 face it recognized the act
 of secession of different States
 I wish to ask him
 if it is the policy
 of his party Mr CRAIGE
 of North Carolina Irise to
 a I want to know
 if this debate question of
 order is in order pending
 the demand for the previous
 question The SPEAKER It is
 not in order Mr COLFAX
 As objection is made I
 insist upon the previous question
 The previous question was seconded
 and the main question ordered
 to be put Mr COX
 called for the reading of
 the substi tute The substitute
 was again read Mr COLFAX
 withdrew the motion to recom
 mit The amendment in tho
 nature of a substitute was
 agreed to rllhe bill was
 then ordered to be engrosscd
 and read a third time
 an l being encrossed it
 was accordingly read the third
 time Mr COLFAX moved the
 previous question on the passage
 of thc bill previous question
 was seconded and the main
 question ordered Mr BURN Efl

 and Wright So the bill
 was passed During the roll
 call Mr BURCH when his
 name vas called said I
 desire to say that although
 I am a member of
 the committee that reported tho
 oriøinal bill if it had
 been pressed in the form
 in which it was first
 presented I should have voted
 against it With the modification
 however now presented by the
 chairnnan of the committcc I
 vote for it Mr BURNETT
 when his name was called
 o entlemen on the other
 side of the House said
 desire to repeal all laws
 of the United States appli
 cable to the seceding States
 and will introduce a bill
 to make this thing operate
 equitably and justly upon them
 I will vote for it
 but when they pro pose
 to collect taxes within the
 seceding States to make them
 pay taxes for the support
 of this Government and treat
 them as within the Union
 and then undertake under cover
 of the general provisions of
 this bill to cut off
 their mail facili ties I
 cannot vote for such a
 measure I there fore vote
 no Mr FLORENCE when his
 name was called said I
 think this is partial legislation
 and I am therefore compelled
 to vote no Mr HINDMAN
 when his name was called
 said I regard this measure
 as pro tanto a recogm
 tion of the right of
 secession and I therefore vote
 for it as a disunion
 measure Laughter Mr VANCE when
 his name was called said
 If this bill sir repealed
 or suspended the opera tion
 of the revenue laws in
 relation to all of the
 States which have seceded from
 the Union I would vote
 for it but as it
 only repeals the laws affording
 them postal facilities leaving them
 nom inaily at least the
 burdens of taxation and as
 it Iso incurs the danger
 of a collision between the
 tates going out of the
 Union and the General Government
 which I consider the greatest
 barrier to peaceful reconciliation and
 which I have sedu lously
 endeavored to avoid and to
 which I am thoroughly opposed
 in any and all shapes
 I shall vote no Mr
 WINSLOW when was called said
 There are delegates from fifteen
 of the States of this
 Union now in session in
 this city endeav oring to
 adjust our present diffcultics and
 restore peace and harmony to
 the country Pending their deliberations
 I think we ought to
 adopt a policy of masterly
 inactivity and do nothing what
 ever to irritate the public
 mind A measure of this
 kind is just as offensive
 to me as the military
 display of mercenary soldiers around
 this Capitol I vote no
 Mr BRABSON said For the
 purpose of keep ing down
 any excitement I vote no
 Mr HOLMAN said I desire
 to say sir that inasmuch
 as this bill cannot possibly
 be construed as recocrnizincr even
 remotely the secession of any
 State from the Union or
 the right of such seces
 sion and as the measurc
 of redress proposed by the
 bill is the mildest possible
 remedy for a great political
 evil I will vote ay
 Mr SIMMS when his name
 was called said Mr Speaker
 I would ask the indulgence
 of the House for moment
 to explain the vote I
 am If this bill only
 involved the prin about to
 give ciple that this Govcrnment
 should not furnish mail facilities
 to these seceding States I
 would vote for it because
 this Government is under no
 obligation to furnish mail facilities
 to thosc States which disclaim
 all allegiance to it Upon
 that principle I would vote
 for any proposition in this
 Congress to suspend mail facilities
 in thosc States believing that
 they do not either expect
 or desire this Government to
 do so I am sir
 from Ken tucky which has
 ever been among the most
 loyal and devoted to the
 Constitution and the Union I
 believe it has been the
 object of every represent alive
 from that State both in
 this Hall and in the
 Senate Chamber to do all
 that could be done for
 the purpose of bringing about
 an adjustment of our existing
 difficulties I believe that the
 passage of this bilt would
 complicate those difficulties and retard
 a settlement if not destroy
 all hope of an adjustment
 Sir Kentucky the State I
 in part represent upon this
 floor would avoid the calamity
 this condition of things will
 bring upon the country Whatever
 may be the final result
 she will stand guiltless before
 the world The gentleman from
 New York Mr SICKI ES
 referred yesterday to the fact
 that the authorities of the
 State of New York had
 seized upon arms belonging to
 the State if Georgia Now
 that act will probably be
 followed by some retaliatory acts
 on the part of the
 State of Georgia This she
 may do by denying to
 merchants of the city of
 New York the right to
 sue in her courts for
 the collection of debts due
 them by citizens of Geor
 gia When this condition of
 things is once inau gurated
 there will be no limit
 to acts of wrong und
 injustice from both sections I
 would avoid this as I
 would preserve to the last
 every chance fora reconstruction of
 the Government The result of
 this bill will be only
 to complicate matters and prevent
 an adjustment I shall therefore
 vote against it because I
 know that whatever it may
 appear to be upon its
 face it is intended to
 operate exclusively against the seceding
 States It is but one
 of the many meas ures
 of coercion now pending in
 this House 1861 masked under
 the plea of enforcing the
 laws There is no gentleman
 upon this floor who does
 not know this to be
 the purpose of this bill
 Knowing this I am resolved
 to resist every such measure
 Coercion in any form against
 States asserting by their highest
 acts of sovereignty the right
 of revolution shall never be
 inaugurated by my vote especially
 when I know that the
 inau guration of that policy
 will be the death knell
 of the Uniön Kenzucky witl
 resist this policy of coercion
 and M hen you press
 these issues to a hostile
 act by armed invasion or
 otherwise the cause of the
 South will be a common
 cause This Union can never
 be maintained or reconstructed It
 was not formed by force
 The lig by force aments
 that bind it together are
 its justice equal ity and
 fraternity These are the pillars
 of its Its protection the
 citizen will repay by strength
 his loyalty I eny this
 and he will despise and
 resist your Government Protection is
 the price of allegiance to
 every Government and the Gov
 ernment that denies the first
 and demands the last I
 vote no is a sham
 and a cheat Mr CAMPBELL
 stated that Mr HICKMAN was
 detained from the I louse
 by indisposition Mr WEBSTER who
 was not within the bar
 when his name was called
 asked leave to vote Mr
 STEVENS of Pennsylvania objected Mr
 WEBSTER stated that he should
 have voted ay Mr FARNSWORTH
 stated that if he had
 been within the bar when
 his name was called he
 should have voted my Mr
 BOTELER stated that ifhe had
 been with in the bar
 when his name was called
 he should have voted no
 Mr BROWN said Recognizing the
 independ ence of the States
 that havo seceded and to
 them this bill is chiefly
 intended to apply and believ
 they have no furlher ing
 that havino seceded clåim upon
 the bounty of this Government
 I vote Mr FLORENCE said
 I may have misappre hended
 the purposes and intent of
 this bill and I do
 not desire to bc placed

 regarded it as special and
 local in its character but
 I may be mistaken and
 I therefore change my vote

 McCLERNAND said Believing sir that

 they are or may be

 that it should not do
 so I vote for the

 This bill last session as
 an unfinished report of the
 Committec on Patents and t
 hc Chair supposes the gentleman
 has a right to call
 it up Mr NIBLACK Let
 the bill be read and
 then a brief explanation will
 suffce The bilk was read
 Mr NIBLACK If House will
 indulge rne I will make
 a brief statement in relation
 to t11i3 bill which will
 put the House in possession
 It passed I ll is
 is a Senate bill of
 the points the Senate unanimously
 at thc last session of
 the present Congress Thc Conunittcc
 on Patents in the Senate
 gave it a great deal
 of attention and the bill
 was regarded as a good
 one by the Com mittec
 on Patents in the House
 so far as it went
 The bill came to this
 House and was referred to
 the Committee on Patents There
 some mnend ments were swr
 ycsted That committee gave it
 a xood deal of attention
 and reported it back with
 tbc several amendments that have
 been read this mornmo By
 a vote of the House
 heretofore the bill was postponed
 till the 12th of December
 in the pres ent session
 Previous to that time the
 attention of the Committee on
 Patents in the Elouse had
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 777 been called
 to some further amendments and
 therefore the committee let the
 time pass with out calling
 it up Since then we
 have taken up I these
 amendments in an informal manner
 without having the bill recommitted
 to us They have instructed
 me this morning to report
 some addi tional amendments Some
 of those are merely ofa
 verbal character such as we
 think are requisite to make
 sections of the bill more
 intelligible Some of them will
 have we think the effect
 of retrench ing the expenditures
 of the Government under this
 bill In addition to these
 verbal amendments w e propose
 three or four additional sections
 These amendments I will send
 up to the Clerk s
 desk and ask that they
 be read and if any
 explana tion of them is
 desired I shall be happy
 to give it The first
 section of this bill is
 highly important and has been
 urged on the attention of
 Congress for the last seven
 years but while it has
 some times passed one Mouse
 and sometimes the other it
 never passed both Houses at
 the same Congress and has
 consequently never becozne a law
 It is designed to renmedy
 what has been always ac
 I knowledged to be a
 defect in the laws organizing
 the Patent Offce Under the
 present system there is no
 process by which an applicant
 for a patent can compel
 the attendance of witnesses before
 any offcer in order to
 have testimony taken The ap
 plicant has to hire his
 witnesses at whatever price they
 may charge and he can
 only procure the testimony of
 such witnesses as are willing
 to ap pear voluntarily beforc
 an officer The first sec
 tion of the bili remedies
 this defect and authorizes subpenas
 to be issued compelling tho
 attendance of witnesses as in
 other cases and punishincr them
 for non at tendance This
 is manifestly and in every
 point of view proper The
 other sections of the bill
 merely change details and adjust
 the machinery of the offce
 to the present exigencies of
 the public service It is
 not necessary to explain all
 the sections of the bill
 in detail for its reading
 shows they are proper and
 that there is nothing objectionable
 in them We reported amendments
 at the last session in
 regard to designs which are
 of some importance Un der
 the present law patents are
 issued for designs of all
 classes for seven years and
 under the laws for the
 extension of patents the patentees
 are not entitled to an
 extension This does not work
 well There is a manifest
 difference between va rious species
 of inventions of this sort
 For in stance there are
 certain kinds of designs in
 orna mental iron work that
 ure permanent in their character
 for which a protection o
 seven years is too short
 On tho contrary we have
 a class of designs such
 as walk paper c for
 which seven we have reported
 years is unnecessarily long an
 amendment which gives the applicant
 for patent for a design
 the option whether he shall
 take it for fourteen years
 for seven years or for
 three and a half years
 and scales the prices ac
 cordingly A fter giving the
 subject a good deal of
 consid oration we have come
 to the conclusion that as
 a inatter of public policy
 as well as of justice
 to invcntors the amendments ought
 to be adopted We hope
 the House wilk adopt them

 gentleman from ln diana whether
 this bill reduces the fees

 011 NEW JERSEY Mr THOMSON
 Mr President 1 ask leave
 to present the resolutions of
 the Legislature of the Slate
 of New Jersey in reference
 to the present distracted condition
 of our country and setting
 forth among other things that
 the resolutions and propositions submitted
 to the Senate of the
 Uk it cd Stat cs
 by Elon JOHN J CRITTENDEN
 of Kentucky for the compromisc
 of the questions in dispute
 between lhc people of the
 northern and of the southern
 States or any other constitutional
 method that will Fjermancntly settle
 the question of slavery will
 be acceptablc to the people
 of the State of New
 Jc rsey and the Senators
 and Ilep resentativcs in Con
 ft on l New Terscy
 bc and earnestly urged to
 support those resolutions and propositions
 h consequence of my abscncc
 from this paace and a
 slight indispo sitron I have
 not had it in 11
 y power to present these
 resolutions at an car licr
 day I do so now
 and take thc occasion to
 dissent in tho most en
 lpl iatic way from tbc
 opin ions of In y
 colleague as reported in the
 ncsvspa pers as to their
 not expressing the views and
 feel Ings of the Stato
 we have the honor to
 represent in this body My
 colleague refuses to obcy these
 instruc tions as he calls
 them for several reasons First
 Sn far the Constitution is
 concerned the State from which
 eotne has no more legal
 right to load rne with
 in than I have hcr
 and only deference to her
 in thi particular would arise
 solciy the superior wis intelligence
 and patrioti sln ot tl
 C rnajority in her don
 prt seat added to their
 better ureans of knowi from
 a distance than i possess
 frorn beina preseut on the
 spot and acting in the
 lni ist of all surround
 in circa Instances And second
 because he believes them to
 be con tl ary to
 the wishes of the people
 of his State recers in
 support of this opinion to
 the votes cast for the
 various candidates in New Jer
 sev at the last election
 Ä nd again for a
 third reason because the Legislature
 of N cw Jcrscy with
 an accidental ma jority in
 one of its two branches
 most strangely aud most suddenly
 acquired by a strict party
 vote have undertaken to instruct
 us here to vote against
 the wishes of the people
 as declared in November last
 Mr Presiden t his reasons
 for hesitating to obey these
 instructions as instructions are set
 forth in his own argument
 and in the full extracts
 from the speeches of distinguished
 Senators from New Jer sey
 who have preceded us as
 members of this body We
 regard to this right of
 instruction there have been différentopinions
 ever since the foundation of
 the Government or rather the
 formation of the two great
 political parties in the country
 Dcmocrats and Federalists I shall
 not enter into the discussion
 of this question It is
 not necessary My colleague docs
 not believe in the doctrine
 of instruction I do The
 party to which he belongs
 hold with him generally The
 party with which have always
 acted hold that it is
 the duty of an agent
 to consult the wishes and
 obey the instructions of his
 principal the power from which
 he holds his office and
 if he cannot do so
 to resign his place that
 one may fill it who
 will I will add but
 another word on this subject
 and that is if my
 memory does not woefully de
 ccive mc two of the
 high authorities to which he
 refers may be quoted also
 on the other side of
 this question The late Mr
 Southard when Governor of the
 State in a message to
 the Legis lature maintained the
 right of representatives of tho
 people in New Jersey to
 instruct their Repre sentatives in
 NV ashington and in a
 short time afterwards as a
 Senator of the United States
 when instructed himself took the
 oppositc ground as very correctly
 quoted by my colicague And
 General Wall to whom he
 also refers was woll known
 as not only holding the
 doctrine to be sound and
 I emocrat ic but as
 carrying it out in his
 own person and by his
 own vote But Mr President
 this question of instruction was
 110t fairly presented by thc
 resolutions which have led my
 colleague into an arrrumcnt on
 this subject and I will
 not pursue it Ry these
 the Senators and Representatives in
 Congress are merely rcqucstcd not
 instructed to support thc Crittenden
 resolutions and propositions Tho question
 of instruction it will be
 seen is not in volved
 in them a request and
 an instruction being regarded as
 very differcnt things in legislative
 pro cccdings compliance in one
 case being consid cred by
 one party at least an
 obligation and a request in
 the other as leaving obedience
 entirely discretionary ithus the usual
 language employed in such ros
 olutions is that Senators in
 Congress be instructed and the
 members of thc House be
 requested c And thc reason
 for this difference in phrase
 ology is obvious Senators are
 chosen by the Legisla_t ures
 and represent the State while
 mem bers being representatives of
 districts arc subject only in
 like manner to thc people
 who elected then I The
 Legislature had no lesirc to
 make these Senators a merc
 Diachine to record their but
 on tl le contrary they
 de ayes arid noes Sired
 to convey to then ut
 this Capitol what they bciieved
 to be the feelings and
 wishes Of their and our
 constituents And the Senator admits
 that thiy had better opportunities
 of knowing what these were
 than he had being morc
 distant from them They earnestly
 desired thc restoration of peace
 to the country and expressed
 such anxious desire to their
 Senators in the only form
 in which they could do
 so and adopted the expression
 ofa request instead of an
 instruction to avoid wound incr
 our pride of place or
 delicale sensibilities My colleacruc also
 hesitates to obey these in
 structions bccausc he believes them
 to be con trary to
 tho wishes of the people
 of that Stato listens to
 the instructions contained in and
 he the expression of their
 voices at the last election
 A h sir would that
 he would only listen to
 them and obey them rather
 than instructions from any other
 quarter What sir are they
 The author ity to which
 will refer my friend is
 one that he It is
 the Tribune Alma will hardly
 rcpudiatc nac very carefully prepared
 and certainly with no view
 to diminish the strength of
 the popularity I of Mr
 Lincoln Fronn this it appears
 that Mr Lincoln received 58
 324 votes and tl ie
 votes cast acrainst him wore
 62 801 or a majority
 against him in that State
 of 4 477 But the
 vote which Mr Lincoln received
 was not due alone to
 the were induced to believe
 that the Democratic can didates
 were unfriendly to the iron
 interest in New Jersey and
 the Opposition in favor of
 pro tecting it This largely
 swelled the vote of the
 Opposition And since the election
 my colleague I think should
 know that a mighty change
 has taken place in his
 State against his party I
 confess Mr President that when
 I read the remarks of
 colleague on this point I
 Was more than surprised for
 I think 1 never knew
 the sen timents of the
 peoplé of New Jersey more
 decided on any question than
 on that in regard to
 a settle ment of the
 questions in dispute between the
 pcoplc of the northern and
 southern States by the adoption
 of the resolutions and propositions
 of tho Senator from Kentucky
 or any other con stitutional
 method that will permanently settle
 the q uestion of slavery
 I will go further and
 give it as my decided
 opinion that these resolutions of
 the Legislature would be sustained
 by the peoplc of New
 Jersey by an enormous vote
 The gcncral feeling in the
 State has been think that
 thc South had been aofft
 icvcd had just cause of
 complaint some of the free
 States and that its wrongs
 should be redressed and that
 peace security and equality should
 be secured to It by
 constitutional guaran tecs which could
 not be violated And these
 un doubtcdly could have been
 obtained better and easier had
 the Gulf and cotton States
 remained in the Union instead
 of going out of it
 My col league himself goes
 far to admit this And
 yet sir at the same
 time in this connection I
 am con strained to say
 that thc lawless acts of
 the people of the South
 in seizing by violence the
 propcrf y of the United
 States its forts arsenals custöm
 houses post offices hospitals rcvcnuc
 cutters and even vessels employed
 in the scientific survey have
 greatly weakened the friendly of
 the coast feeling that previously
 existed in the North to
 But notwithstanding this I am
 con ward them fident that
 even now a very large
 majority would sustain the resolutions
 of the Legislature ri he
 third and last reason of
 rny colleaguc for disregarding thesc
 resolutions it strikes me is
 It is because as he
 says not a very good
 one the Lc islature with
 an accidental majority in one
 of its two branches have
 undertaken to in struct us
 herc to vote against the
 wishes of the I people
 as declared in November last
 Now to gay nothing of
 the changes which have since
 taken place in public sentiment
 in New Jersey as cverywherc
 else the November clec tiou
 to which he appeals showed
 a majority as I have
 before stated against the candidate
 of Chicago of forty four
 hundred and forty seven votes
 and in both branches of
 the Legislature there is also
 a majority opposed to him
 and the vote on these
 resolutions was 11 to 6
 in the Senate and 31
 to 11 in the House
 of Assembly Now I would
 like to know whether he
 or they best understand the
 wishes of the people So
 much sir for this third
 and last and vv orst
 reason My colleague cannot differ
 more widely than I do
 frorn those who assert thc
 right of a State to
 scccdc frorn the Union at
 its own will and pleasure
 Nothing in rny judffment is
 less warranted in tho history
 of tho formation of our
 present Union than the claim
 of such a right unt_lm
 the Constitution If a and
 nothing more fatal to its
 preservation single State can at
 any time and for any
 reason dissolve her connection with
 her confederates the whole fabric
 of our Government held together
 and cemented as onc grand
 and perfect arch mav at
 any moment fall to pieces
 and all its parts be
 in volvcd in one common
 ruin by thc rash or
 madness of one of its
 members The right of se
 cession cannot bc found in
 thc Constitution if it is
 not constructively forbidden there right
 at all it is nothing
 but a revolutionary right and
 I think can only be
 maintained as such by those
 who have lately so freely
 exercised it and by it
 have practically at least for
 a time dissolved the Union
 But my friend says If
 this Union be dissolved the
 madness of the act will
 bc equaled only by its
 stupendous The dissolution of the
 Union did sav No sir
 no It nay be attcnnpted
 we may have strife and
 conflict wc may have blows
 and grill visaged war bloodshed
 rnay have war this Union
 of our fathers this b
 essed Union this priccless mere
 sti cngth of his party
 or his platform The tariff
 question had much to do
 with it T hc people
 II be destroyed without a
 struggle a 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 779 nor do they
 vanish in an hour They
 do not die as infants
 do l hey feel by
 far a greater pang than
 when a giant dies They
 nust protect themselves they must
 protect their power they must
 preserve their limits they Inust
 main tain control Now if
 I understand this aright it
 means co ercion coercion of
 States which have withdrawn from
 the Union back into it
 and that by blows and
 bloodshed we must preserve this
 price less heritage Now Mr
 President if the right of
 coercion was as clear as
 a sunbeam in the Constitution
 in our present circumstances it
 would be worse than madness
 to enforce it But it
 is not clear and un
 disputed I grant that on
 the principle of the right
 of Government like an individual
 to pro tect itself as
 a natural and inherent right
 it is far more clear
 than the right of secession
 though neither is provided for
 expressly in the Consti tution
 Yet sir the attempt to
 coerce by force of arms
 and by blows and bloodshed
 States to remain in the
 Union after by the assertion
 of the right of revolution
 they had withdrawn from it
 and had established independent governments
 would be not only an
 act of madness and folly
 but an act which of
 necessity would lead to hor
 rors in comparison with which
 all we read in the
 history of war would fade
 into insignificance A civil X
 var between such people as
 those which compose the different
 sections of this country probably
 a servile war at the
 South and a rc ncwal
 of thc horrors of St
 Domingo which a protracted struggle
 would I think inevitably pro
 duce humanity sickens to contemplate
 and yet that would be
 the result No Mr President
 no Let us win our
 erring sisters back to our
 embraces by kindness by jus
 tice by good feeling and
 by good deeds but to
 attclnpt to force them by
 arms and by blows and
 bloodshed is as wicked as
 it is impo ible If
 wc cannot preserve Chern in
 the Union without force in
 the name of our common
 ancestors in thc name of
 humanity in the namo of
 liberty which would be crushed
 out in the attempt in
 the name of l iffh
 Heaven let them go in
 peace Time and returning reason
 in the North and in
 the South may reunite us
 in a stronger bond than
 has ever yet bound us
 together And if this should
 never happen we may still
 hope by leagues and treaties
 offensive and defensive to compel
 the respect of tho world
 and insure a deffree of
 prosperity if not as o
 reat as under our present
 Union still such as is
 enjoyed by no other nation
 under I leaven Let us
 Mr President save the Union
 by yield ing our prejudices
 on both sides Save it
 In the noble language of
 the great state sman of
 New York Saye first the
 Union and then after that
 save all else that is
 worth savincr I move that
 the resolutions be laid upon
 tho table Mr TEN EYCK
 A few words in reply
 to the courteous remarks of
 my honorable colleague I am
 sure I had no disposition
 in submitting the resolutions which
 I presented and in making
 the few remarks which I
 offered to the Senate on
 Fri day last to avail
 mysclf of the absence of
 my colleague Mr THOMSON I
 did not intend to suggest
 anything of that kind sir
 Mr TEN EYCK I supposed
 it was my duty although
 1 did not agree with
 them promptly and at the
 earliest moment to present those
 rcso Iulions to the Senate
 and to the country as
 the views of that portion
 of the Legislature of the
 State of New Tcrsey that
 had indorsed and passed I
 regret the illness of rny
 colleague which them prohibited him
 from being present on that
 occa Sion to make his
 reply upon the spur of
 the mo mcnt but I
 am glad to find that
 his illness has not been
 so serious as to preclude
 him from mak ing a
 prepared reply to me N
 y friend and colleague states
 that the resolu Lions did
 not contain or involve the
 doctrine of instruction Sir they
 do not use the word
 in struct but tbcv use
 what is tantamount to it
 They request they earnestly urcre
 They do not use the
 word Instruct I grant but
 cun ning phrases were employed
 to mean that thing and
 they meant itin effect I
 did so regard them and
 if 1 acknowledged the doctrine
 of instruction I should obey
 those resolutions as promptly as
 if they had contained the
 particular word in struct We
 werc requested we werc earnestly
 urged to vote for t
 he propositions contained in the
 resolutions offered by the Senator
 frolü Ken tuck y When
 the Legislature of my State
 speaks out I do not
 stop to cavil about mere
 words or phrases I do
 not allude to the point
 taken by my col league
 that these resolutions represent the
 pres ent views of the
 people of New Jersey It
 is his opinion that they
 do it is my opinion
 that they I do not
 refer to or base myself
 upon do not the excited
 heated feelings of the community
 filled with fears and anxieties
 for the perpetuity I re
 of this Union t his
 glorious heritage peat I rely
 upon the calm sober reflection
 and action of the people
 in thc ordinary mode as
 evinced by themselves at the
 last election after months of
 canvassing and consideration By the
 votes cast then only three
 months since if there is
 any reliance to bc placed
 upon that voice the people
 of New Jersey were expressly
 and em phatically against the
 leading proposition of the Senator
 from Kentucky I allude to
 the one in relation to
 the Territories in particular I
 know and I am glad
 to know that the people
 of that State are in
 favor of many of the
 propositions contained ill the resolutions
 submitted by the Senator from
 Kentucky My honored colleague says
 that he thinks the people
 of New Jersey arc in
 favor of these reso lutions
 He says in the Senate
 they were carried by a
 vote of eleven to six
 Sir I know that four
 members of the Senate would
 have voted against these resolutions
 which would have left the
 vote but those fbur were
 sick standino eleven to ten
 and although requests and appeals
 were made by the friends
 of those Senators who were
 absent for a delay of
 the vote for a single
 lay in order that they
 have an opportunity if well
 enough to appear in thc
 Senate and cast their votes
 they were rushed through the
 Senate in defiance of the
 appeals of the friends of
 those gentlemen who were opposed
 to the passagc of these
 resolutions r herc wore then
 in fact ten opposed and
 eleven in favor of them
 and had it not becn
 for qn acci dental majority
 I repeat the word an
 accidental majority recently obtained and
 most strangely obtained in the
 Senate of that State by
 a vote being changed from
 the morning to the afternoon
 of a day these resolutions
 never would havc passed that
 body How it was done
 by what cabalistic influence I
 cannot say for was not
 on the spot to understand
 it I do not undertake
 to say Mr THOMSON Will
 my colleague allow me to
 ask hitn if ho calls
 Mr Norcross whosc vot e
 it is said xvas changed
 a Republican Mr EYCK Hc
 was Repub ticket by a
 majority lican on the Opposition
 of fourteen hundred in the
 county where i live and
 his course has brought pain
 and sorrow to the hearts
 of truc and honest who
 cast their votes that the
 people of the United States
 are individ ually bound by
 its authority it is the
 duty and it ought to
 be the practice of the
 Government to enforce its laws
 and 10 see that they
 are fu Ily ex ecuted
 against all offenders and against
 all persons who would risc
 up in rebellion against thOse
 laws unless the opposition assumes
 so great a I lead
 and front as to amount
 to a successful revolution when
 it would be against humanity
 and against all ideas that

 extinction of our race With
 these remarks leave the subject
 Mr THOMSON A single word
 and I shall yield My
 colleague spoke of my sickness
 and rcferred to my ability
 to prepare a speech He
 was probably not aware that
 I was on Friday morning
 very unexpectedly called to New
 Jer sey and remained there
 until Monday night I did
 not see his speech until
 I came here on Tues
 day morning The resolutions were
 ordered to lie on the
 table ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr
 WADE I move to take
 up the resolu tion of
 the I louse of Representatives
 on the mat ter of
 the McCormick patent Mr BIGLER
 I should bc glad to
 get in some memorials PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr BRIGHT in the
 chair The Chair will rcceive
 memorials as being first in
 order AMENDMENTS TO TIIE CONSTITUTION
 Mr COLLAMER 1 have a
 memorial which I present the
 memorial of I desire to
 present J Blake and eighty
 one others inhabitants of Swanton
 Vermont praying for the adoption
 of the measurc commoll y
 knowrn as the border State
 It is think that I
 trouble propositions the Senate but
 I desire now to make
 some re marks for which
 I beg indulgence for a
 few mornents in relation to
 this subject I am not
 proposing to make remarks about
 secession or coercion or slavery
 or the merits of any
 of these topics at all
 but the petition which I
 have pre scnted invokes the
 exercise of the power of
 Con gress in relation to
 amcndmcnts to the Constitu t
 is upon that topic that
 I wish to speak tion
 for a few moments Mr
 President I am willing at
 all times when the occasion
 properly calls for it to
 exercise the powers that we
 legitlmatcly have by the Consti
 tution but in nay estimation
 no exicrencies can ever justify
 us in resortincr to any
 sort of devices and expedients
 which the occasion Inay cull
 for that are not consistent
 with the fair construction of
 the provisions of that instrument
 Now sir what is the
 truc meaning the fair import
 of the for him who
 Ilke Inorning of t hc
 luccting of I powers whicharcgivenin
 the Constitution to Con the
 Legislature stood one way and
 in tho after It was
 by such Incans as thesé
 that noon anothcr those resolutions
 verc carried through the upper
 branch of our Legislature And
 sir with i espect to
 the other House the Assembly
 these resolutions were passed under
 thc whip and spur of
 party tactics but the majority
 was nothing like that mentioned
 by colleague After urgent efforts
 and appeals for delav roade
 by those gentlmnen with w
 hcnn I coincide in opin
 ion politically finding thata suspension
 of the rulcs took place
 and that these resolutions were
 to be railroa l speed
 driven through in haste with
 many of them abandoned the
 Chamber of our lower House
 and left the friends of
 measure to carry it through
 in their mvn way and
 at their own pleasure I
 would not have referred to
 these circumstances had it not
 becn for the allusions made
 by my friend and colleaguc
 to the votes as they
 stood in both Houses of
 our Legislature I and I
 shall havc done One word
 Inore sii think 111 y
 colleague misul derstands me when
 he I do not think
 says my doctrine is coercion
 he desires improperly or erroneously
 to misrep resent me My
 doctrine means nothing else but
 this self defense which is
 the sacred right of a
 gress in relation to its
 amendment When the Constitution was
 adopted and those who made
 it were about to put
 in exercise this great experiment
 having created for thc first
 time a General Government with
 all its departments and curtailed
 in large proportion the powers
 which the States had previously
 exercised to corro II spond
 with it they said Now
 it may be that this
 Constitution docs not investsuffcient powers
 in the General Government for
 its smooth and suc cess
 ul operation Experience may show
 that M hat th en
 shall be done in such
 acon tingency It will be
 a contingency in which Congress
 wilt have I asccrtaincd by
 experiment precisely what further power
 they need say thercfore that
 when Congress have thus ascertained
 that they need any more
 delegated power they shall have
 au thority to propose amendments
 to the Constitu tion which
 they shall send to the
 States or to the people
 of the United States if
 you please in their States
 either in convention or in
 their Legisla tures for their
 adoption and if three fourths
 of them adopt them they
 shall become a portion of
 the Constitution This was wanted
 for the use of Congress
 No occasion was required for
 calling any national con nation
 as of an individual and
 if the doctrine of I
 vention huttheoccasion would be one
 which expe rience would develope
 and which Congress would self
 defense of preservation for a
 nation and a Government leads
 to blows and bloodshed they
 fccl the need of und
 such vas the arrangement to
 meet that contingency But they
 further said I would not
 hasten to thc I must
 conoe and fall fict d
 of strife I would Iciay
 l v rould expostQate Perhaps
 upon experience and upon trial
 it will turn out that
 we have transferred too much
 power L would earnestly exhort
 our breth would plead from
 the States to the Gencral
 Government it no steps which
 might lead to such a
 ren to talco dread result
 Eut sir regarding as I
 do the Con rnay work
 hard for the Statcs they
 Inav need to have amendincnts
 now what provision shall sve
 stitution of the United as
 the snpremc law 780 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 7 make
 what arrangement shall we prepare
 for such a contingency It
 cainot be reasonably ex pected
 that Congress will in such
 an event make any propositions
 for amendment to strip them
 selves of power which has
 been already delegated to them
 We therefore must not look
 to Congress for relief in
 such an emergency at all
 Hence it was that provision
 was made in the same
 article for such an event
 for such a contingency by
 providing that if two thirds
 of the States shall pass
 resolutions requesting the call ofa
 general convention for the purpose
 of proposing amend ments to
 the Constitution Congress shall call
 it They said if the
 States want the Constitution amended
 let them amend it as
 it was made by a
 national convention let them see
 each other all around let
 them compare their views let
 them see cach other face
 to face and then make
 such arrangements as the circumstances
 at the time may rcquire
 and when they have thus
 proposed then amendments Congress shall
 send those pi op ositions
 to the States eitherin their
 Legislatures or their conventions foradoption
 Itwill be observed that in
 thc latter arrangement the first
 leading fea turc is this
 when the people or the
 States want amendments which they
 suppose they need they are
 to have them whether Congress
 will or not If they
 call a national convention in
 this way Con gress has
 no power to stop it
 but is obliged to call
 it without knowing what amendments
 will be proposed The Statcs
 are not bound in their
 res olutions which ask for
 a general convention to state
 what amendments they want but
 simply to declarc that they
 want a convention and Con
 gress in case two thirds
 of the States join in
 the is bound to call
 it and again whcn it
 is called and it proposes
 amendments Congress has no right
 to examine into the merits
 of thosc atnendments but is
 bound to send them out
 to the States at once
 it is imperative on Congress
 to do so Hence it
 is we sec Mr President
 provision is here made that
 amendments to the Constitution are
 to come from those who
 want thern No idea entered
 into their heads in thosc
 days that the old rule
 of conunon sense would be
 overthrown which is that propositions
 for relief of any kind
 should come from those who
 want it and not from
 those who do not want
 it Now let us apply
 this to our presenb condition
 Docs this General Govcrn ment
 feel the want of any
 morc delegated power Has experiencc
 shown that our General Govern
 ment docs not operate smoothly
 for the want of some
 other delcffated power that we
 need Not at all No
 one suggests anything of that
 kind we wantnothing kind What
 next What is wanted or
 what is said to be
 wanted It is said that
 a number of the States
 desire amend ments to the
 Constitut ion forthcir security I
 am not about to enter
 into the rncrits o those
 amend ments but I say
 that is said to be
 the case Now is it
 not frorn thc provision of
 the Constitution tö which I
 have alluded perfectly obvious as
 to how such an is
 to be reached T think
 it it leaves no doubt
 about it Well sir have
 any of these States ever
 made any attempt to call
 a national convention to get
 redress of grievances according to
 the Constitution Not one Some
 of them have flown into
 secession but not an attempt
 has others are thrcatenincr it
 beer made by any of
 them to get any redress
 I have nothing to within
 the Constitution at all say
 of that particularly but I
 say that Congress ought not
 to undertakc to exercise the
 power which is iven to
 get amendments which they need
 for the purpose of getting
 arnendments for the States which
 it is said they need
 It is to pervert the
 uses for which it was
 givcn to them by so
 doing Such attempts will always
 fail and it is obvious
 First we undertake to con
 h y they will fail
 jcclure what tho States want
 We arc going about framing
 amendments to send out to
 the peo plc amendments Anything
 we x vantor need No
 but something which it is
 conjectured the States need Who
 knows what they need Who
 knows what they want Who
 knows what they v ill
 be satisfied with I lave
 they mani festcd it to
 us n no way It
 is mere matter of coli
 jcctt n e and I
 kowever much respect I may
 have for the source frotn
 which these conjectures corne still
 or all I cannot but
 sce that itis lame and
 im potent attempt to use
 a power which was granted
 for one purpose to effect
 another and an entirely different
 one Now Mr President let
 me go a little further
 to show its inapplicability Suppose
 we agree to the amendments
 here Have the people of
 the different States ever seen
 each other in con vention
 and understood each other s
 views about them Never at
 all but we are going
 to make them up here
 and invent them ourseivcs initiate
 them and send them out
 to the States and ask
 them to act upon them
 without ever seeing each other
 at all The attempt never
 can succeed In the nature
 of the thing it cannot
 succeed The pro vision of
 the Constitution is not adapted
 never was meant to secure
 any such purpose by the
 action of Congress originating amendments
 for the States which they
 have not asked for The
 conclusion then I come to
 after what re flection I
 can give it is that
 as I view this part
 of the Constitution which I
 think very clear when read
 and considered in the light
 of the circum stances in
 which it was madc I
 never can under take to
 participate here in undertaking to
 make up and invent and
 contrive and conjecture amend ments
 for States which the States
 themselves I think it is
 entirely mal have ncvcr asked
 for apropos It will be
 entirely unsuccessful and the very
 fact now that you find
 such odds and ends such
 various opinions about what they
 shall be and a thousand
 projects that are presented to
 us the very fact that
 you find yourselves in this
 con dition manifests that the
 principle which I state is
 right It shows that you
 are in this condition because
 yoü are trying to use
 an instrumentality which you have
 for one purpose for another
 for which It was ncvcr
 prepared and to which it
 is not at all adapted
 Now Mr President I have
 one other Mr BIGLER A
 single Mr COLLAMER 1 desire
 to finish what 1 have
 to say and then I
 will hear the gentleman s
 I do not desire to
 be interrupted now question Mr
 BIGLER i desire simply to
 understand the Senator on n
 point which I supposed it
 would bc very agreeable to
 him to illustrate The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr BRIGHT in the
 chair Does the Senator from
 Vermont yield the floor Mr
 COLLAMER The gentleman says he
 wishes me to explain If
 that is all I yield
 Mr BIGLER I certainly had
 no Wish to in terrupt
 the Senator from Vermont but
 I sup posed that so
 universal a privilege in all
 kindness and forbearance would be
 accorded Mr COLLAMER Proceed sir
 ask your question Mr BIGLER
 I simply ask the Senator
 from Vermont to tell us
 how he reconciles the theory
 which he lays down with
 the fact that the very
 first amendment made to the
 Constitution with reference to the
 sovereignty of States was sub
 mitted by Congress Mr COLLAMER
 I will answer you entirely
 if you will hear me
 through You need not in
 terrunt me You will hear
 it all PRESIDING OFFICER It
 is the duty of the
 Chair to announce that the
 hour for the spe Cial
 order has arrived Mr COLLAMER
 1 hope 1 be allowed
 t Certainly Certainly to 0
 on Mr FOOT I hope
 by common consent the special
 order will be passed over
 informally until my shall have
 concluded his remarks I presume
 the whole Senate are desirous
 to hear Certainly him upon
 this point The PRESIDING OFFICER
 If there be no objection
 the Senator may procccd The
 Chair hears none Mr COLLAMER
 I have said nothing and
 shall say which can possibly
 involve the feelings of different
 sides or different parties in
 the Senate At this time
 I have nothing to say
 I rise to make remarks
 due to myself about that
 in relation to the memorial
 which I have presented which
 invokes the exercise of the
 power of Con gress in
 relation to constitutional amendrnents An
 illustration may be drawn from
 our history in confirmation of
 the principles which I have
 stated In the election of
 President of the United States
 in 1801 it was found
 that the arrangements which had
 been made in the Constitution
 did not operate smoothly There
 was almost a failure in
 the Gov ernment Congress then
 thought the contingency had arisen
 for which this provision was
 made and Congress proposed an
 amendment in order to be
 relieved of that difficulty They
 sent it out to the
 States That was exactly what
 Congress It was adopted ought
 to have done I come
 now to another thing which
 I was just about to
 speak of when the Senator
 from Penn sylvania interposed It
 is quite easy to imagine
 and our own history presents
 a precedent for it this
 state of things Suppose for
 instance a State or a
 certain number of States not
 two thirds do not desire
 to call a general convention
 either because of a want
 of time or some other
 excuse no matter what they
 desire no general revision they
 only desire one or two
 particular amendments and suppose that
 one two three or more
 States should state to us
 that they desired the following
 articles of amendment to be
 adopted as part of the
 Constitution of the United States
 naming them and they present
 these to Con gress with
 the petition or request that
 Congress will submit them to
 the conventions or the Legis
 latures of the different States
 for adoption now suppose such
 a state of things presents
 itself how would that fall
 within the principles which I
 have before remarked upon When
 Congress prepares amendments to the
 Constitution and sends them to
 the people they express their
 approbation of them it implies
 that they are their amendments
 they make them and it
 requires turo thirds to do
 it which implies I take
 it the exercise of their
 judgment and a judgment so
 decisive as will carry two
 thirds of the Senate and
 of the House of Representatives
 They are the amendments which
 Congress want and which Congress
 ap prove But suppose one
 two or three States should
 draw up some amendments that
 they say they do want
 not that we conjecture at
 not that we gucss but
 which they say they do
 want what will you do
 in such a case Suppose
 some of the States pre
 pare and reduce to proper
 form the amendments which they
 desire and they have so
 much confi dence in their
 sister Sates that they are
 willing to submit them to
 them for that very desire
 and rc quest to submit
 them implies a confidence now
 what should Congress do on
 an occasion of that kind
 I think it is quite
 clear what they should do
 I believe Congress should not
 pass on the merits It
 is a petition a respectful
 of those amendments petition asuitable
 petition I should not think
 that Congress should not present
 them as their amcnd ments
 MT ell how would you
 do it I would do
 it in this way I
 would recite that whereas such
 and such certain States naming
 them had prepared such and
 such articles of amendment to
 the Constitution and had presented
 them to Con gress and
 had requested Congress to submit
 them to the States therefore
 and in pursuance of that
 request Congress present them to
 the States for adoption and
 do it by the two
 thirds majority required by the
 Constitution to render the proposal
 effective I grant xvhen they
 are amendments which Con gress
 prepared undoubtedly it is implied
 that they express their approbation
 of thcm but in the
 case I am supposing and
 which I consider a middle
 case between the two no
 approbation or disap probation of
 Congress is expressed or implied
 nor is it necessary Let
 me read the article The
 Congress whenever two thirds of
 both Houses Shall deem it
 necessary shall propose amendments to
 this Constitution or on the
 application of the Legislatures of
 two thirds of the several
 States shali call a convention
 for proposing amendxnents which in
 cither case shall be valid
 to all intents and purposes
 as part of this Constitution
 when ratified by the Legislatures
 of three fourths of the
 several States or by conventions
 in three fourths thereof posed
 by the Congress It does
 not say that Congress shall
 recommend the amendments or any
 of them It is said
 that they shall propose the
 amendments hut not that they
 shall recommend them 1 think
 Congress when there is a
 respectful petition by any State
 for certain articles of amendmen
 t should pass such a
 joint resolution as I have
 just indicated with the recital
 or preamble thereto Now I
 come to the case that
 the Senator from Pennsylvania alludes
 to When the States adopted
 in their several conventions this
 United States Constitution several of
 the States recommended certain amendments
 a number of the States
 did I do not know
 whether two thirds or all
 but a number of them
 recommended certain am endments to
 the Constitution What did Congress
 do with them They were
 not amendments that Congress prepared
 What did they do The
 States in 1861 theirconventions had
 requestedthese amendments to be adopted
 What did Congress do I
 will turn gentlemen to what
 they did on that occasion
 as if you please a
 precedent for what I state
 In 1789 in the First
 Congress was passed the fol
 lowiw Phe conventions ofa number
 of the States having at
 the titne of their adopting
 the Constitution expressed a de
 sire in order to prevent
 misconstruction or abuse of its
 powers that further declaratory and
 restrictive clauses and as extending
 the ground of public should
 be added confidence in the
 Government will hest insure the
 benefi cent ends of its
 institution Resolved bv the Senatc
 and House Rcpresentati ccs qf
 the United States of amcrica
 in Congress assembled two thirds
 of both Houses concurring I
 hat the following ar ticles
 be proposed to the Legislatures
 of the scverai Suites as
 amendments to the Constitution of
 the United States all or
 any of which articles when
 ratified by three fourths of
 the said Legislatures to be
 valid to all intents and
 pur poses as part of
 said Constitution rl here isa
 direct precedent for the case
 to which the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania calls my atten tion
 thaL is the very case
 which have now sup posed
 There the States or several
 of them did request amendments
 to be made stating what
 they were and Congress did
 not propose those amend ments
 as theirs but they passed
 a joint reso lution stating
 the fact that several States
 had requested those amendments to
 be made and therefore they
 presented them to the people
 for Tl hat was the
 very case That is in
 adoption confirmation of my view
 It is a direct precedent
 Now Mr President without taking
 up the time of the
 Senate which dislike to do
 exceed ingly these views govern
 me in my action in
 rela tion to amendments to
 the Constitution though they probably
 may not govern anybody else
 should like to have them
 understood more at large because
 I think the people have
 been somehow or other led
 to look to Congress for
 relief by constitutional amendments when
 the powers of Congress as
 I understand them are utterly
 una dapted to them But
 I cannot say as I
 frequently hear said in this
 body that I desire to
 speak to the country I
 have no idea that the
 country will ever hear what
 I say about it but
 still I have presented my
 views of what I regard
 true duties And now I
 have to say that though
 I see little prospect of
 amending in this way confident
 it never can succeed yet
 after all something may be
 I have nothing to say
 about calling a na done
 tional convention That is a
 matter for the States and
 the people to do as
 they please upon It is
 perfectly evident from the Constitution
 that it was intended to
 be callcd whenever it was
 desired by the States without
 any action of Congress at
 all but even in despite
 of its opinion if you
 will Though men may not
 acrree upon amendments here may
 not agree upon amendments in
 the con ference that is
 going on now in this
 city I can still conceive
 it possible that two or
 three or morc States might
 agree on some amendments and
 send them here as is
 proposed in the resolutions of
 Virginia with the request that
 we should send them out
 to the Legislatures of the
 States I say I can
 conceive that Chat contingency may
 happen and my mode of
 treating that subject would be
 what i have indicated I
 think In my humble judgment
 that on such a contingency
 Congress should pass a resolution
 such as they did in
 i 789 reciting that this
 had been requested and present
 ing it to the people
 by a two thirds vote
 and not stand up and
 say they did not like
 the amend ments and would
 not permit the people 10
 have a chance to vote
 on thein Such are my
 views Sir The memorial was
 ordered to lie on the
 table MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE
 A messaze from the House

 VIRGINIA The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will now call up
 the unfinished business of yes
 Mr WIGFALL 1 desire Mr
 Pres ident to obtrude on
 the patience or time of
 the Senate but when all
 Other Senators are through with
 the business which is before
 them with ref erence either
 to practical legislation ot saving
 the Union I propose as
 briefly as I can to
 discuss not the question which
 has been before the Senate
 for the last two days
 but the comments made by
 the Senator from Tennessee Mr
 J0i1NsoN There was much that
 was said during the two
 days of rambling and discursive
 harangue which it will be
 necessary to notice but I
 promise the Senators who may
 give me their attention that
 I will dispatch the work
 before tile as briefly as
 possible and I think it
 will not require very much
 time The matterthat seemed to
 weigh moston the mind of
 the Senator from Tennessee was
 that he had been a
 special object of persecution since
 the 19th day of DeCembcr
 when he made the extraor
 dinary speech to which he
 alluded I am one of
 those who in the ordinary
 discharge of my duties have
 generally been in the Senate
 and yet 1 have not
 seen here any exhibition of
 It any such disposition on
 the part of Senators is
 true that some particular portions
 of the speech have been
 occasionally animadverted upon and alluded
 to but when that was
 the case it came up
 in tho ordinary course of
 discussion There was as well
 as I can recollect but
 one Senator who replied to
 him directly and that was
 the Senator from Oregon Mr
 LANE After six weeks considera
 tion the Senator from Tennessee
 now complains that he was
 misrepresented He denies that on
 the 19th of December he
 advocated coercion us to the
 States It is very stranTe
 sir knowing the courtesy of
 the Senator from Ore gon
 if he was misrepresented and
 if he did not desire
 time to write revise add
 to and strike out from
 what he said that when
 his speech was fresh in
 the memory of every Senator
 upon this floor he did
 not rise and then correct
 the misrepresenta tions Six weeks
 have elapsed I can say
 for myself that I have
 never read what he published
 I suppose there are but
 few Senators who have I
 know only the impressions the
 strong impres sions which werc
 made upon my mind at
 the time arid those were
 that hc was in favor
 of co crcion war to
 the knife and the knife
 to the hilt It was
 charged upon him He acquiesced
 in tl le charge and
 it is now too latc
 for him to attempt to
 object to the conclusions which
 were drawn and charged at
 the time his speech was
 delivcred Thinos have occurred in
 his own State so say
 the newspapers which have caused
 him possibly to take a
 sober second thought It is
 said that he has been
 shot hanged burned from one
 end of the State of
 Tenncssce to the other in
 effigy He must before many
 weeks return to that State
 What will be done with
 him in propria persona is
 a matter that may more
 concern him than it does
 me He was understood I
 am sure by the entire
 Black Republican party certainly by
 their press to have taken
 that position A leading pa
 per advocating the doctrine took
 that speech as reported by
 the letter writers published it
 in its editorial columns and
 kept it stereotypc d as
 con taining the doctrines of
 the party I allude to
 the paper edited by Colonel
 James Watson Webb of the
 regular army formerly Laughter The
 Senator secmcd to take especial
 offense that a northern Senator
 should have replied to him
 The great Carolinian once said
 that those living north of
 Mason and Dixon s line
 who were nearest to us
 were further from us than
 those living south of that
 line who were furthest is
 I believe the only sentiment
 or opinion that he c
 ver uttered in which Ido
 not entirely concur I have
 too long seen and known
 and felt the faith fulnessof
 men living north of Mason
 and Dixon s line in
 their gallant defense of the
 principles of the Constitution of
 this country I have too
 often seen and regretted to
 see the treason of southern
 men who knowing that the
 non slaveholding States either had
 now or soon would have
 if this Union were preserved
 the entire control of both
 Houses of Cougress and the
 electoral college and would therefore
 have the disposition of all
 the public I have too
 often secn patronage of the
 country weak terday being the
 motion to print additional copies
 southern rnen to use a
 _ sonÄtnon phrase when our

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 7
 expressed their willingne ss to
 yield and the re suki
 generally has been that they
 have received their reward Matters
 have reached that point in
 which it is necessary for
 our own safety to dissolve
 the ties which bind us
 to the North We coald
 trust the northern men who
 stand by the Constitution but
 with the dominant party in
 the northern States aided by
 southern treason we feel that
 nei her our liberties nor
 our property are longer secure
 in the Union The Senator
 from Tennessee pre tends that
 this is a movement on
 the part of poli ticians
 Politicians I would be glad
 if he would inform me
 what he is if not
 a politician a states man
 he would hardly say Politicians
 have done this thing States
 have seceded from the Union
 and it is the act
 of politicians And he hazarded
 the assertion that if the
 ordinance of secession in South
 Carolina even had been submitted
 to the popular vote it
 would not have passed Why
 sir it IS extraordinary that
 men are so reckless of
 their reputation as to hazard
 expressions of this sort which
 they know will become public
 Did not the Legislature of
 South Carolina appoint a day
 on which the people vere
 to vote Were not candidates
 brought out in every district
 and every parish Were not
 the opinions of every candl
 date for that convention known
 Did not the peo ple
 vote for those who were
 in favor of immediate secession
 and against those who were
 opposed to it Did they
 not elect their representatives in
 order that an ordinance of
 Secession might be Is this
 fact not known to the
 Senator passed from Tennessee Did
 not those delegates who were
 elected after a discussion of
 all these ques tions bcforc
 the people meet in convention
 and with entire unanimity vote
 that South Carolina should cease
 to be one of the
 States of this Union Has
 not the press of that
 State since that time been
 far alicad of the action
 of the State authori tics
 and docs he not know
 this Has not the Charleston
 Mercury to which he has
 alluded been ur Ying the
 Governor to attack Fort Sumter
 arid bring on the crisis
 Has not the position of
 that paper been supported by
 the entirc press of the
 country Have not the people
 risen cn Inasse aud cried
 out for blood because they
 believe it is u reproach
 upon their honor that a
 fort within their territory still
 remains in the possession of
 a Government that they regard
 as not only foreign but
 hostile a fort held in
 derogation of their sov crcicnty
 and in denial of their
 right of self gov crnment
 Are these facts not known
 to that Sen ator Yet
 he has thc recklessness to
 rise here and say that
 the people South Carolina are
 living under a tyranny and
 that the politicians are tram
 pling them in the ground
 and that it they were
 permitted to speak through the
 ballot box that State would
 yet be in the Union
 Is not what I have
 said of South Carolina true
 of Georaia of Alabama of
 l lorida of Missis Is
 it not true of my
 own sippi of Louisiana Is
 it not true of Arkansas
 Will it not be Sta
 te true of his State
 and of every other Stutc
 in which the question of
 secession has bccn Inade an
 issue in the past or
 in which it will be
 made an issue in the
 coming clcctions I he people
 forsooth arc not allowed t
 he right of self government
 I Ie says when he
 and the Senator frorn Illinois
 Mr DOUGLAS get through their
 private conferel lce I will
 go on I want his
 attention the peoplc are not
 permitted to govern themselves Oh
 no Docs he not know
 he should have known before
 he made the assertion that
 the people of South Carolina
 are allowed to vote And
 yet he boldly recklessly and
 confidently asserted yesterday that the
 people of that State wcre
 denied the ckect i ve
 franchise Whom docs he mean
 by peo ple Negroes Women
 and chil lrei i Persons
 under twenty one years of
 age and Indians If he
 means that class of the
 community I acknowl edge his
 statement was true but if
 he means by people men
 twenty one years old citizens
 of the State his statement
 is wholly and utterly without
 foundation It has been a
 charge that has been noude
 iu this body for the
 last twenty years and been
 corrected tirne and again by
 the consti tu tion of
 South Carolina being brought here
 and read that every man
 twrent y one years old
 and white and a citizen
 of the State is entitled
 t vote I here is
 no property quali and allowed
 to vote ficalion required il
 that State and there has
 not l jeen for the
 last hau century These are
 facts that are known and
 yet to excite prejudice against
 that particular State he indulges
 vain in this stale slander
 which like false coin has
 been so often nailed to
 the counter I was gratified
 to hear a Senator from
 the North rise and repudiate
 the doctrines which he advo
 cated I was glad that
 it came from that quarter
 It came appropriately fi om
 that quarter and the Senator
 who advocated the doctrines for
 which we contend may with
 propriety advocate them and do
 it without exciting prejudice for
 no fair right minded man
 can doubt his patriotism or
 his devotion to the Union
 His fealty has been vvrit
 ten upon the battle field
 under the stars and stripes
 and with his own red
 blood and when he was
 thus recording his devotion to
 the coun try where was
 the Senator from Tennessee Not
 up on the battle fields
 of Mexico Electioneering suppose trying
 to get placo and office
 He rises here and denounces
 as wantino in patriotism the
 man whose whole life has
 been devoted to his country
 His doctrines are so extraordinary
 they are so disjointedly uttered
 and so incoherently thrown together
 that it is difficult to
 follosv him He complains that
 his great argument was not
 an swered Beau Brummel I
 believe on one occa sion
 was asked by a taiior
 how he liked a coat
 He took it by the
 lappel and looking at it
 asked the tailor if hc
 called that thing a coat
 His great argument When and
 where did he make any
 great argument or argument of
 any sort what ever 1
 have not heard it Our
 positions have been stated we
 have referred to the Constitution
 we have referred to the
 journals of the convention that
 drafted it we have referred
 to the debates of the
 conventions of the different States
 that ratified it we have
 referred to the Federalist as
 explaining the meanings of the
 Constitution as understood by the
 States which ratified it and
 has he answered any of
 our arguments Has he attempted
 to do anything except to
 read newspaper extracts to read
 the opinions of this man
 that man and the other
 Icavinff out always the context
 and fre qucntly himself misapprehending
 the moaning of the very
 sentcrjces which he reå l
 And vet he complains that
 we did not answer his
 argument The Senator from Louisiana
 Mr few days ago bid
 us farewell ill tones so
 touch ing that I supposed
 any man liviiV north or
 south who had a heart
 could not fail to feel
 VI welve scats here are
 vacant never never ao ain
 to be filled The Union
 is disrupted These Senators bade
 along and last farewell to
 this body and to some
 of us they expressed the
 hope that before long we
 should rncet in other fields
 and under more favorable circumstances
 All seemed to feel except
 the Senator from Tennessee He
 alone looked upon it as
 a farce that was to
 be played off in which
 the mourners were to be
 called out and before the
 curtain was raised and the
 performance was begun those who
 vere to shed tears were
 advised of the roper time
 I hat disruption of this
 is the ilnprcs sion that
 the act love so dearly
 pro Union which he professes
 duces upon his mind Elc
 talked of devotion to the
 Union and the Constitution and
 there is no man who
 novv lives who has done
 morc than he has to
 produce this I he policy
 which he has very state
 of things for years past
 been advocating of a hornestcad
 alone if it had over
 been adopted and carried bill
 out to the full extent
 would have caused a dis
 ruption of the Union and
 yet he professes to be
 a Union rnan r r
 hc Senator Inay not be
 a statesman but he understands
 as X vell as any
 man living how to take
 advantacro of the prejudices of
 the populace and with what
 safety a man may if
 he wears the livery of
 heaven perform acts which those
 who are entitled to that
 uniform are not in I
 recollect sir some the habit
 of performing twenty years ago
 reading a book which was
 Paul Clifford PiggyL0b ofthe Mug
 who was a very sagacious
 woman had the edu cation
 of little Paul intrusted to
 her care She ple goes
 more by what you says
 than what you does Sdy
 that you are for the
 Union denounce everybody who is
 opposed to it trample the
 Con stitution under foot deny
 the existence of the States
 betray your own section sacrifice
 the lib erty of your
 countrymen do all this but
 say Paul that you are
 for the Union that is
 ail that is necessary because
 people goes more by what
 Laugh ter you says than
 what you does Who is
 in favor of the Union
 What is the Union Years
 and years ago thirteen separate
 and sovereign States having achieved
 their inde pendcnce and each
 feeling that it was not
 strong enough to protect itself
 against foreign a ogression entered
 into a compact with each
 other and or ffanized a
 Government to which they delegated
 certain specific powers the right
 for them and in their
 name to enter into treaties
 with forei n nations to
 keep up a common Army
 and a com mon Navy
 to conduct a common diplomacy
 and to have a common
 Treasury When the sover eignty
 of these States is denied
 or destroyed when this Federal
 Government has become con verted
 into a consolidated despotism when
 upon the ruins of this
 Federal fabric a consolidated de
 mocracy has been erected then
 I say the Union it
 is the is destroyed This
 is not my opinion opinion
 of the father of the
 Democratic party Thomas Jefferson said
 that this Union could be
 destroyed in two ways first
 by consolidation next by disruption
 and that of the two
 he pre ferred disruption though
 he would regard that as
 a very great calamity He
 was in favor of the
 Union as it was established
 by the Constitution He was
 in favor of the Union
 a union being an agreement
 between separate and distinct persons
 not a fusion and amalgamation
 That was the doctrine of
 the man from whose brain
 Minerva like sprang the great
 Democratic constitutional party As Minerva
 sprang armed and equipped from
 the brain of Jove so
 did this great party spring
 from the brain of Jefferson
 to rescue the Constitution and
 to save the Union The
 Senator has a wonderful lovc
 for the peo pie he
 has great regard for the
 right of self gov ernment
 he thinks that politicians ought
 not to be permitted to
 trample upon the people and
 what are the doctrines that
 hc has been advocating here
 He was guilty I do
 not wish to use offensive
 terms yet to convey my
 ideas I may be betrayed
 into terms that may not
 be exactly senatorial he was
 guilty of usine the that
 the people of Louisituaa had
 been bought by the United
 States as chattels A man
 professing to be in favor
 of the people talking thus
 indecently of the people the
 white men of one of
 the sovereign Slates of this
 Union being purchased as chattels
 In order to sustain himself
 he attempted to make I
 sup pose what he would
 call an argument by reading
 from the treaty of 1803
 what had been read by
 t he Senator from Louisiana
 the day before and who
 had quoted everything that was
 material I choose not to
 waste my time nor that
 of the Senate by rereading
 what was read and has
 been published The first article
 of that treat y explains
 thc cause of the cession
 It conveys the sovercignty of
 tlie territory territory in common
 parlance means land The second
 article of the treaty goes
 on and specifies what is
 conveyed the forts the navy
 yards the public buildings the
 public ofiices everything The territory
 and its appurtenances are specified
 in the second articlc ofthc
 treaty in called Paul one
 day and said to hill
 Paul my I child road
 your Bible and talk like
 a pious un order that
 there may be no misunderstanding
 as territory to the meaning
 of the term Then the
 third article of the treaty
 which his tory tells us
 was l vritten by Napoleon
 himself the third article written
 by the First Consul him
 self does what Does it
 convey the pcople of It
 specifies that the people Louisiana
 as chattels of Louisiana shall
 be vested with the right
 of solf crovernment that they
 shall at the earliest momer
 t practicable bc admitted into
 this Union as a State
 with all the rights and
 privileges of the original States
 of the American Union It
 declares explic itly that until
 they are admitted into the
 Union States they shall be
 entitled to perfect and full
 for people goes more by
 what you says than protection
 in their lives their liberties
 their prop erty and their
 religion and when the First
 Con what you does if
 you want what is not
 your sul had signed the
 treaty he expressed as history
 own Paul try and do
 without it my child but
 if you can t take
 it by insinivation and not
 by II tells us the
 hope that the Frenchmen v
 hosc alle bluster for them
 as swindles gains more and
 risks giancc had been transferred
 from France remem less than
 them as robs I Laughter
 l here was bering that
 he had secured to them
 the right of a world
 of worldly wisdom in that
 advice Read sclf2governrne1it would always
 in their bosonjs the Bible
 Paul and talk like a
 pious un for peo nourish
 akind yfeelingforthatGovcrnmenbwhich 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 783 had secured to
 them their liberties That was
 the What were the other
 considerations that in duced tho
 First Consul of France to
 make this cession is a
 matter that is wholly impertinent
 I suppose that it wras
 no love of liberty He
 had to part with Louisiana
 The United States de manded
 only New Orleans The right
 of ingress and egress and
 a place of deposit was
 ail we demanded but as
 he had to part with
 New Or leans and probably
 could not hold the rest
 of the territory he determined
 to strike a fatal blow
 at England and strange to
 say that great man look
 ing far into futurity predicted
 not only that he was
 striking a most fatal blow
 at his bitterest enemy but
 predicted that if this Confederation
 should ever In after tirnes
 be so administered as to
 involve the rights and the
 liberties of that peo ßle
 they were in a position
 to assert those rights and
 that a disruption of the
 Union would be the result
 Strangely sagacious was that great
 man Yet with these facts
 plainly staring no I sup
 pose he did not know
 them but had he taken
 other counsels than those which
 he did the Sen ator
 prohably would have been advised
 of the facts and would
 not have fallen into the
 egregious errors which he did
 Rumor is a jade and
 is said I beg the
 attention of not to be
 very veracious the Senator from
 l ennessee for a moment
 I wish not to make
 any charge that is not
 sustained by the facts but
 it is said upon the
 streets that the Senator was
 in close conclave with Senator
 whom I do not now
 sec in his seat from
 New York Mr SEWARD and
 the Senator from Mas sachusetts
 Mr WILSON before making that
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee Does
 Sen ator wish rne to
 make a reply now IV
 Ir I merely wanted to
 know if the remark which
 I have heard and which
 is generally believed that the
 Senator frotn Ten nessee vvas
 in consultation with the two
 Senators I have designated is
 true Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 Sen ator wish me to
 make a reply now Mr
 WIGFAT Tu Undoubtedly or 1
 would not have asked the
 question Mr JOHNSON of All
 1 can say is i
 the gentleman predicates his information
 on rumor that the rumor
 has no foundation and I
 do not think it very
 proper to bring into the
 Sen ate what the Senator
 may pick up outside on
 the mete basis of ruinor
 Mr WIGFALL De gustibus non
 est disputan I think it
 is a very proper place
 and ru dutn mors which
 might be true nnd without
 a lenial are believed to
 be true are alluded to
 in order that the Senator
 may deny them The Senator
 then referencc to the public
 lands and other subjects and
 then if he had been
 a lawyer as he told
 us he was not the
 act of corning into the
 Union was declared irrevocable he
 would have known that when
 one is on the without
 the consent of the United
 States witness stand he is
 required not only to tell
 the Where and when was
 the act of cdmihg into
 truth and nothing but the
 truth but he is also
 re the Union declared irrevocable
 without the con quired to
 tell tl æ whole truth
 and that the Senator sent
 of the United States So
 far from that being did
 not tell When Alabama was
 admitted into true the very
 first clause of the act
 of Congress the Union there
 were conditions annexed to her
 admission Alabama was carved out
 of Federal territory by territory
 I mean land When the
 inhabitants of that Territory became
 a people had a government
 of their own became a
 nation the eminent doma n
 would have vested in them
 but as there was much
 public property in Alabama in
 the shape of land it
 was necessary to guard acainst
 this and therefore it was
 provided that thc people of
 Alabama should agree with the
 Fcd eral Governmcnt that they
 would at all times there
 after recognize the right of
 the Federal Govern ment to
 that land and to the
 disposition which it was dccmcd
 prudent that this Government should
 make of the public domain
 in A labama The act
 of Congress of March 2
 1819 declai ed and provided
 always Tliat the said convention
 shall provide by an ordinmrce
 irrevocable without the consent of
 the United States that the
 people inhabiting the said territory
 do am ce and declare
 that they forever diselailn all
 right and title to the
 waste and unappropriated lands lying
 within the said territory and
 that thc same shall be
 and ren ain at sole
 and entire disposition of the
 United States and Illoreover that
 each and every tract of
 land sold by the United

 Union was The said convention
 ehalt provide by an ordinance
 irrevocable without the consent of
 the United States that inhabiting
 the sai l do agrec
 and de the people ciare
 that they forever disclailki ail

 Now sir that being the
 condition of the admission when
 the inhabitants of the Territory
 were about to become a
 people when Alabama was about
 to be admitted into the
 U Ilion they met in
 convention and after drafting a
 constitution for their own government
 they go on to say
 This convention for and in
 behalf of the people inhab
 iting this State DO ACCEPT
 the propositions offered by the
 which authorized the inhabitants to
 become a people declares That
 the inhabitants of the I
 crritory of Alabama be and
 they are hereby authorized to
 form for thelnselves a constitution
 and State government and to
 assuune such nmne as they
 may deenr proper and that
 the said Terri tory when
 tormed into a State shall
 be admitted into the Union
 upon the same f0Mina with
 the original States in all
 respects whatever T hc act
 of Congress declares that they
 shall be admitted into the
 Union upon the same footing
 with the original States and
 yet he asserts that they
 came into the Union with
 a distinct deélnra tion that
 they never should leave it
 without the con 1 dislike
 to waste the sent of
 the United States time of
 the Senate and I Consider
 it a waste of time
 but cannot permit such things
 as these to pass unnoticed
 or un rebuked Previously to
 this pretended quotation from the
 act of Congrcss and the
 ordinance the Senator from Tennessee
 uses this language New States
 may be admitted into this
 Union not upon au equality
 at all but new States
 lilay be admitted into It
 being an express urant to
 adlüit the exer this Union
 cise of a power say
 the Federal overnment can exer
 cise incident that are necessary
 and pFoper to carry the
 admission of Stat cs into
 existence upon such a basis
 as I am they believe
 the good of the Govennnent
 demands not so sure but
 the adtnissioo of a new
 Stato is placed upon a
 different ground to what Ivas
 1 110 admission of States
 confina in originally ratiåS ing
 the Constitution As the Senator
 seelns to be so fålnikiar
 with things ot this sort
 will refor to the act
 adrnitting the State of Then
 herc is the clear Qndisguised
 doctrine of the Black Republican
 party that the right to
 admit new States into the
 Union gives to this Federal
 Government the discretion of saying
 what State shall be admitted
 and what shall noi and
 impos ing any terms upon
 tbc inhabitants of rrc rritory
 when they come to form
 their State constitution l he
 Constitution of the United States
 declares that Congress may admit
 new States into the Union
 republican in their form of
 government That is the only
 qualification and we of the
 South and the Democracy of
 the North have from time
 beyond vv hich the memory
 of man runneth not to
 the contrary advocated the clear
 constitu tional doctrine that the
 only question which could be
 asked by this Federal Government
 was is the Is it
 slaveholding or constitution republican non
 slavehokding is not the question
 But the Senator from Tennessee
 who I am sorry to
 having denied that he took
 into his counsels the two
 distinguished Senators to whom I
 have al laded I let
 it pass for what it
 is worth Persons who are
 reliable state the fact of
 the consul alion the purpose
 of it I was not
 advised of But bc that
 as it 11121 y the
 charge which he made which
 the Republican press has made
 and which Re publican Senators
 have rnade that the people
 of Louisiana were purchased is
 not sustained by history and
 it is I will say
 a most extraordi nary thing
 that those who have such
 a sensitive ness upon thc
 subject of human rights who
 are soshocked at the idea
 of traffcking in human flesh
 the souls of and buying
 to use a cant phrase
 when these men and women

 the riffht right for which
 our ancestors contended in that
 bloody war of 1776 the
 right of self government What
 they don y flatly and
 unqualifiedly to their own color
 they assert for the African
 race There is a point
 which the Senator will not
 find It very casy to
 get over because it is
 recorded He assorted and read
 from the record to prove
 that thc people of Alabama
 when they became at people
 ceased to be a people
 t iat when the in
 habitants of the Territory of
 Alabama by tbc con s
 cnt of the Federal Government
 became a State in the
 very act of becoming one
 of the sovereio n States
 of this Union they ceased
 to have the right ofiiving
 under such a Government as
 they saw fit He gaébled
 the documents he told the
 truth but 784 He was
 sent from that State to
 the American Congress as soon
 as she was admitted into
 the Union and was a
 member of Congress at the
 termination of the second term
 of General Wash ington when
 an address was made to
 the Presi dent a portion
 of which I shall read
 Mr Presi dent it is
 well to go back It
 is sometimes well to open
 the volume of history and
 see what it is that
 our ancestors have done Weems
 wrote a life of Washington
 I have often thought it
 a great pity that any
 other was written He was
 the Father of his Country
 he wasa great man he
 was a good man but
 there was a powerful party
 that differed with him as
 to the character of this
 Government and the proper mode
 of administer ing it As
 to the mere abstract authority
 of Gov ernment this powerful
 party differed with him John
 Adams succeeded him and in
 carrying out the policy of
 Alexander Hamilton which had been
 adopted by Washington he was
 crushed It is known to
 every man at ail familiar
 with our history that the
 difference which grew up in
 the Cabinet between Mr Jefferson
 on the one side and
 Alexander Hamilton on the other
 caused Mr Jefferson to withdraw
 from the government When his
 second term had expired the
 Congress of the United States
 presented an address to Gen
 eral Washington It is very
 lengthy and I shall read
 but a sentence or two
 And while we entertain a
 grateful conviction that your wise
 firm a nd patriotic administration
 has been signally conducive to
 the success of the present
 Orm of govern ment we
 cannot forbear to express the
 deep sensations of regret with
 which ve conteinplate your intended

 resolution which is now a

 the Democratic party adopted in
 1852 at Balti more indorsed
 in 1856 at Cincinnati the
 platform upon which the present
 incumbent was elected the platform
 upon which the Senator from
 Ton nessee professes to stand
 that resolution is in these
 words That this Assembly doth
 explicitly and peremptorily declare that
 it views the powers of
 the Federal Governnuent as resulting
 fron i the cmnpact to
 which the States are par
 ties as lirnitcd hy the
 plain sense and illtention of
 the in strutncnt constituting that
 compact as no further valid
 than they are authorized by
 the grants enumerated in that
 com pact and that in
 case of a deliberate palpable
 and dan gerous exercise o
 other powers not granted by
 the said coinpaet the States
 Not the people of the
 United States nor the people
 of America but the States
 as sovereign parties to the
 compact who are parties thereto
 have the right and are
 in duty bound to interpose
 for arresting the progress ot
 the evil aud fi n
 maintaining withiu their respective limits
 the au thorities rights aud
 liberties appertaining to them That

 of Jackson CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 7 of Macon of Giles
 and of the great men
 who rescuedth States at that
 time from destruction by a
 misconstruction of the Federal compact
 The first Kentucky resolution is
 in thcsc Words Reso ved
 That the several States composing
 the Uni ted States of
 America are not united on
 the principle of unlimited submission
 to their Generai Government but
 that by compact under the
 style and titlc of a
 Constitu tion för the United
 States and of amendments thereto
 they constituted a General Government
 for special purposes delegated to
 that Government certain definite powers
 re serving each State to
 itself the residuary mass of
 right to their ow n
 self government To thcir own
 self government was the residuary
 mass reserved a right which
 is denied by the Senator
 from Tennessee denied by the
 Republi can party denied by
 nationalism from the or ganization
 of the Government to the
 present time under whatever name
 it may have made its
 ap pearance and that whensoever
 the General Government assumes undelegatcd
 powers its acts arc unauthoritative
 void and of no förce
 that to this compact each
 State acceded as a State
 and is an integral party
 That is the doctrine that
 the Tennessee Sena tor has
 avowed in his pretended support
 of the Democratic party That
 this Government created by this
 compact was not made the
 exclusive or final judge of
 the extent of the powers
 delegated to itself since that
 would have made its discre
 tion and not the Constitution
 the Ineasure of its powers
 but ihat as in all
 other cases of compact among
 parties hav ing no conunonjudge
 cach party has an equal
 right to judge för itself
 as weil ot infractions as
 of the mode and measure
 of redress T hc Senator
 in his celebrated 19th of
 Decem ber 1860 speech to
 which he has alluded thought
 that he had discovered the
 truc intent and mean ing
 of the Democratic platform He
 referred to the Virginia resolutions
 and said that it said
 States and that meant all
 the States and therefore when
 all the States declared that
 the com act was violated
 of course that declaration wou
 d be final and binding
 against the Federal But without
 stopping to criticise Government a
 comment of that sort I
 ask him if he finds
 States here This is also
 a part of the plat
 form that hc professes to
 stand upon But that as
 in all other cases of
 coinpact among par tics having
 no con unon judae each
 party has an equal right
 to judge tor itself as
 well of infractions as ofthe
 Inode and Ineasure of redress
 The word nullification seems to
 have ex cited his ire
 He does not drasv the
 distinction between nullification and secession
 Those who have read the
 Constitution and understand it know
 that there isa difference between
 the two remedies nullification applying
 to the act of the
 acrent the Federal Government and
 secession to the parties the
 States by separating from them
 when cither they or their
 a rcnt have violated the
 compact But i shall not
 go into any discussion of
 the question I merely wanted
 to draw the attention of
 the Senator if he will
 listen to the origin of
 this word nullification In the
 Ken tuck y resolutions of
 1799 which were adopted by
 the Legislature of Kentucky for
 the purpose of explaining and
 making explicit their meanin r
 in the resolutions of 1798
 I find the following paragraph
 I llat the principlc and
 construction contended for by sundry
 of the State Legislatures The
 same principle contended for by
 the Sen ator from I
 ennessee that the General Government
 is the exclusive judge of
 thc extent of the powers
 delegated to it stops nothing
 short of despotisan since the
 discretion of those who adli
 inister the Govet tunent and
 not the Constitution would be
 the measure of their power
 1 hat tlie several States
 who förrued that instrument being
 sovereign and independent have thc
 unquestionable right to judge ot
 the infraction and that a
 nullification by those sovereignties of
 all un thorized acts done
 under color of that instrument
 is the rightful remedy That
 was the doctrine in Kentucky
 in 1799 going a stone
 s throw beyond the right
 of seces sion and asserting
 that a State Inay remain
 in the Union and in
 tbc Union may deny the
 right to the Federal Government
 of enforcin f any lawr
 which she in her sovereign
 capacity has declared unconstitutional and
 unwarranted by the com pact
 Now sir as to the
 author of the doctrine I
 of nullification and secession desiinated
 as syn onymous tertns by
 the Senator from Tennessee and
 also designated as the prolific
 mother of all heresies and
 sins The Senator from Tennessee
 read with much approbation yesterday
 from an i editorial of
 the Richmond Enquirer as containing
 It is the first time
 in my life the true
 doctrine that I have ever
 known any one on the
 floor of the Senate or
 elsewhere to take the editorial
 ofa newspaper published nearly half
 a centnry ago and bring
 it as a test of
 political orthodoxy or as a
 proper exposition of the doctrines
 of the party to which
 he belongs or professes to
 belong or as any authority
 in settling disputed constitutional points
 and yet the Senator rosé
 here with an air of
 triumph and somebody or other
 having fur nished him with
 an old copy of the
 Richmond Enquirer he read it
 as orthodox Would to God
 that he had the former
 numbers of that paper and
 would peruse them The denunciations
 of the Hartford convention were
 one thing strong lan guage
 written under a moment of
 excitement in reference to the
 treasonable purposes of those men
 was one thing their deliberate
 enunciation of constitutional doctrine is
 quite another During the war
 with Great Britain a war
 brought on in defense of
 New England commerce and New
 Eng land seamen denying the
 right of search and pro
 tecting that section from the
 a yressions of the British
 Government they treacherÖusly and per
 fidiously assembled at Hartford and
 It is said proposed or
 were prepared to propose terms
 of alliance with the British
 Government while we were at
 war vv ith them While
 I do not deny the
 right of any State at
 any time to secede from
 the Union to revoke the
 ratification of the treaty which
 binds her to the other
 States while I say it
 is a clear legal right
 under the law of nations
 resulting from the compact a
 clear constitutional right resulting from
 the character of the ratifica
 tions of at least three
 of the States of this
 Union while I do not
 deny that any State may
 at any time and under
 any circumstances with or with
 out cause withdraw from the
 Union I do say that
 if when this Government is
 engaged in war any one
 of the States withdraws from
 the Union and affliates and
 enters into an alliance with
 a nation with which we
 are at war she rnust
 share the destiny of her
 allies And so the Senator
 from rrcnnessec will find as
 to himself When a war
 of sections is on and
 when we are striking for
 the right when he secedes
 from the people whom he
 misrepresents and enters into an
 alli ance with Black Republicanism
 he will find that it
 is a casus belli at
 home But sir while it
 would be a cause of
 war it would bc nothing
 else You might coerce the
 Government you might declare war
 against the State you might
 plow her land with artillery
 and trample it with cavalry
 you might put the torch
 to the house of every
 private individual you might sack
 their cities you might destroy
 their property you might blot
 the inhabitants from the soil
 of the State but you
 would have to call it
 war for war it would
 be You could not tyrannicalfy
 and hypocritically talk of enforcing
 the laws When the sovereign
 power ofa State that ratifies
 the Constitution solemnly in the
 same manner in which the
 ratification was made revokes that
 ratification as its citizens were
 bound by its act of
 ratification and became subject to
 the Constitution and treaties and
 the laws made in accordance
 with the Constitution whether they
 assented to it or not
 so when that ratification is
 revoked the treaty ceases to
 be binding between that State
 and the other States and
 the citizens arc released from
 all obligation to obey the
 laws that State is a
 foreign nation That is the
 whole It is the common
 sense law upon the subject
 upon the subject You rnust
 take one horn or the
 other of the dilemma Talk
 of not coercing a State
 but of enforcing thc laws
 Take South Carolina for instance
 There they have a TOV
 ernment There is no other
 government dejhcto in that State
 There is no other authority
 there that deals with life
 or liberty or property There
 is no other power within
 the limit of that State
 that passes a law that
 is regarded by anybody or
 which anybody dares to observe
 or obey We are told
 by the Senator from Tennessee
 that he is only in
 favor of enforcing the laws
 but is not for coercing
 the State I say that
 that propo If the sition
 is not only absurd but
 it is cruel people of
 South Carolina have not the
 right of self government if
 they have not the right
 to es tablish such a
 government as they see fit
 to live under if such
 a government is established there
 illegally and wroigfully and unconstitutionally
 and this Government intends to
 cnforcc its lasvs in derogation
 of their rights and in
 contempt of TII E CONGRESSIONAL

 WASHINGTON D C THIRTYSIXTH CONGRESS
 2D SESSION their asserted sovereignty
 the first thing this Gov
 ernment must do and the
 only thing it can do
 is to send its fleets
 to their harbors and its
 armies to their fields to
 subvert that wrongful that revolu
 tionary that illegal government When
 they have removed the coercion
 when they have crushed out
 that revolutionary power which is
 coercing the people whether they
 will or not to obey
 its behests when they have
 done that and left every
 individual in South Carolina to
 obey the laws of this
 Government or not as he
 sees fit then they may
 punish him if he disobeys
 But I say it is
 a monstrous cruelly to allow
 a goverrnnent that you call
 wrongful and revolutionary and illegal
 which government is now dealing
 as it pleases with the
 lives with the liberties with
 the prop erty of every
 man woman and child within
 the limits of that State
 to leave that goven iment
 in fall power and then
 say if the individuals there
 that are under that power
 do not obey your laws
 you will hang draw anfl
 quarter them Remove the coercion
 give them he right of
 volition and when you have
 done that then you may
 with propriety and without cruelty
 attempt to enforce your laws
 but to say that you
 wili not use co ercion
 aoainst a State that you
 will leave this government there
 in full power to confiscat
 e every man s property
 deprive him of his liberty
 put him into the pillory
 or the penitentiary or exe
 cute him under the gibbet
 if he does not obey
 that form of government to
 leave that govern ment in
 full force to deal thus
 with every man in the

 will confiscate you will deprive
 of liberty you will deprive
 of life every individual who
 docs not obey your laws
 is as I said before
 a monstrous cruelty and an

 by their right names Say
 you are going to coerce
 if you intend to do
 it say that you are
 going to stop that government
 say that you are going
 to establish another government there
 and do it in the
 only way you can by
 force of arms Let the

 follow the bloody banner if
 he desires it But he
 tells us he is a

 here in the Sen FRIDAY
 FEBRUARY 8 1861 I was
 speaking of a different man
 altogether speaking of the immortal
 Jackson of what wrere his
 politics and what were his
 political opinions I was attempting
 to remove the slander which
 nationalism now attempts to put
 upon his char acter The
 Richmond Enquirer of the 13th
 of March 1832 says NULLIFICATION
 AN ERROR CORRECTED We have
 conic belöre the public to
 correct an error into which
 we have betrayed them Some
 of the politicians of South
 Car olina had nraintained the
 opinion that Mr Jefferson was
 not only the friend but
 the father of the doctrine
 of nulli tication and tiieir
 principal argtune lt was that
 he was the author of
 the Kentucky resolut ions of
 1799 as well as those
 of 1798 and that in
 those of 1799 is to
 bc found the mem orable
 passage that the several States
 ec WV e had a
 great curiosity to ascertain the
 truth of this We have
 now to state I opinion
 our conviction that we were
 wrong and the South Caro
 tinians right as to Mr
 Jefferson s opinions A stnall
 mnn uscript book has been
 Ibund mnonghis ptqpers which with
 other articles contains two copies
 in his own handwriting that
 appear to have been the
 originals of the Kentucky res
 olutions Now if the Senator
 wishes to denounce seces Sion
 und nullification e o nonvi
 n e let him go
 back and denounce Jefferson let
 him denounce Jack son if
 he dare and go back
 and look that Ten nessee
 Democracy in the face and
 see whether they will content
 themselves with riddling his effigy
 General Jackson approved of the
 doctrine of nullification in 1798
 MT as he a Republican
 in I will read the
 record those days Lot us
 see Dr William Dickson September
 1 1801 was a candidate
 for Congress in the district
 ill x vhich General Jackson
 lived I have gone into
 detail to show v 7hat
 was the doctrine of the
 Republican party The Kentucky resolutions
 of 1798 and 1799 were
 the doctrines of the Republican
 party and the Virginia resolutions
 of 1798 and the Vir
 ginia report of 1799 were
 also the doctrines of that
 party Mr Jcfferson was its
 great head Upon those doctrines
 he had been voted for
 As the exponent and the
 author of those doctrines he
 had becn elected On the
 1st day of September of
 1801 Dr Dickson was the
 candidate for Con gress in
 I enncssee General Andrew Jackson
 says to him that ho
 believes that RI y citizen
 who docs obtain the suffrages
 of the freemen of Ten
 a Republican and in politics
 must be n essee like
 Caesar s wife not on
 y cliaste but unsus pected
 and therefore he propounds thcse
 inter rogatories to this candidate
 I lave you always been
 an adihirer of State author

 but of the State authorities

 you always been an adnlirpr

 Or would you like to

 and the conunandcr in chief
 the licutenant general in collecting

 of the country And lastly
 are you a real Republican
 in principle and will you
 be a Republican in practice
 Those were the searching questions
 which An drew Jackson on
 the 1st day of September
 1801 propounded to a candidate
 who ofün ed his services

 had not asking the reasons
 for the non com pliance
 and to this President Jackson
 answered The Indinns thus situated
 cannot be regarded in any
 other light than as members
 of a foreign Government Or
 that of a State within
 whose chartered limits they reside
 If in the farmer the
 ordinary legislation in relation to
 them is not warranted by
 the Constitution which was established
 for the benefit of our
 own not of a foreign
 people If in the latter
 then like other citizens or
 people resident within the limits
 of the States they are
 subject to thetr jurisdic tion
 and control To maintain a
 contrary detrine and to require
 the Executive to maintain it
 by the employment of mil
 tary force would be to
 piace in his hands power
 to nake war upon the
 rights of the States and
 the liberties of the country
 a power which should be
 placed in the hands of
 no individual Pretty good strong
 Republican State rights doctrine such
 as was adopted and endorsed
 at Baltimore in 1852 and
 at Cincinnati in 1856 such
 as the Senator from Tennessee
 has been professing to live
 up to from that day
 to this IS well known
 to the Senate if not
 to the Senator that in
 1830 a great debate sprung
 up on some reso lutions
 introduced by Mr Foot of
 Connecticut and which is alluded
 to generally as the debate
 upon Foot s resolutions He
 who has been called and
 by some the great ex
 the God like pounder of
 the Constitution Daniel Webster on
 that occasion advocated the doctrines
 which the Tennessee Senator now
 advocates and Rob ert Y
 Hayne of South Carolina advocated
 the doctrines of Kentucky and
 Virginia It is use less
 to read from his speech
 because it is known to
 every one what his views
 were He advocated to the
 extremest point the right of
 State sover eignty and State
 interposition Subsequently to that time
 there was a dispute it
 was after the issue of
 the proclamation as to what
 General Jackson s real views
 were Mr Daniel pf Ken
 tucky in the House of
 Representatives rose and stated that
 General Jackson had indorsed but
 two years before the principles
 announced by Robert V Hayne
 of South Carolina in that
 speech Of his which contained
 the doctrine of secession and
 nullification Mr Bell of Tennessee
 who at that early day
 had turned Natiönalist seemed to
 doubt it I will read
 what was said Mr Daniel
 declared The doctrines advocated by
 Mr Hayne as well as
 the mode in which they
 were advocated had at that
 time met svitll the approbation
 of the President as expressed
 in di rect tenas in
 a letter fron hill to
 Mr Hayne The terms employed
 Were as strong as languaae
 could afford were to the
 effect that the speech contained
 an exposition of the truc
 principles of republicanism Republicanism was
 a word that Old Hick
 ory wras very fond of
 and that it should be
 bound up and placed in
 his library along with the
 works of Thomas Jefferson Mr
 BELL of I ennessee here
 rose in his place and
 in quired of Mr DANIEL
 whether he I tad a
 personal knowledge of the President
 s approval of those principles
 an l of his eommendation
 of Mr Hayne s speech
 Before Mr DANIEL could reply
 Mr CARSON of North Carolina
 rose with much ear nes
 Lness and said r from
 my personal knowledge can I
 he President expressed iii declare
 that such is the fact
 approbation of that speech to
 me in person Mr BELL
 and Mr CARSON having resumed
 their seats C Mr DANIEL
 proceeded and said what he

 the various staternents of gentlemen

 tradictiot It will be seen
 froth that that Felix Grundy
 emment and its powers and
 the rights of the States
 leaving out the proclamation entirely
 I come down to the
 last year of his administration
 He issued a farewell address
 and in that docu ment
 upon which he based his
 reputation with posterity he used
 this languaøe But tbc Constitution
 cannot be maintained nor the
 Union preserved in opposition to
 public feeling by the mere
 exertion of the coercivc powers
 confided to the Gen erai
 Government The foundations must be
 laid in the affections of
 the people in the security
 it gives tolife Iib erty
 character and property in every
 quarter of the coun try
 and in the fraternal attachments
 which thc citizens of thc
 several States bear to one
 another as metnbers of one
 politieal f nnily mutually contributing
 to promote the hap Hence
 the citizens of every State
 piness of each other should
 studiously avoid everything calculated to
 wound the sensibility or offend
 tuc just pride of the
 people of other States and
 they should frown upon any
 proceedings within their own borders
 likely to disturb the tranquillity
 of their ticular subject there
 issue wasmade and that matter
 was discussed and there being
 a State rights feeling throughout
 the entire country the federative
 character was beld up prominently
 to view and the idea
 of there beincr nationalism in
 the Constitution was denounced everywhere
 Mr Madison wrote in the
 thirty ninth number of the
 Federalist these words On exaniining
 the first relation it appears
 on one hand that the
 Constitution is to be founded
 on the assent and ratification
 of the people of America
 given by deputies elected for
 the special purpose but on
 the other that this assent
 and ratification is to be
 given by the people not
 as individuals coxnposing one entire
 nation but as coniposiilf the
 distinct and independent States to
 which they respect ively And
 because I have said that
 my face has been laughed
 in here time and again
 because I have said that
 there was no such nation
 as the people political brethren
 in other portions of the
 Union II of America that
 there were no such people
 asthe count ry so e
 tensivc as the United States
 and with pur suits so
 varied the internal regulations of
 the several States must frequently
 diflOr fi cnn one anotbcr
 in ünportant par tieulars and
 this difference is unavoidably increased
 by the varying principles upon
 which the A Enerican colonies
 were originally planted principle s
 which had taken deep root
 in t heir social relations
 betijre the Revolution and thereiöre
 t necessity influencing their policy
 since they But each State
 has becarne free and independent
 the unquestionable I lffllt to
 regulate its own internal con
 cerns according to its own
 pleasure and while it docs
 not in terrerc with the
 rights of the people of
 other States or the rights
 of the Union every State
 Illust be thc sole judge
 of the nreastu es proper
 to sccure the saft ity
 of its citizens and promote
 their happiness and ail efforts
 on tl e part of
 the people of other States
 to cast odium upon their
 institutions and aki measures calculated
 to disturb their rights ot
 prop crty or to put
 in jeopardy their peace and
 internal tran quillity are in
 direct opposition to the spirit
 in which the Union was
 formed and rnust endanger its
 safety He says further Fronn
 the extent ot our country
 its diversified interests different pursuits
 and different habits it is
 too for argutncnt that a
 ingle consolidated Govern enent would
 be wholly inadequate to wateh
 over and protect its interests
 and every friend of our
 free institut ions should be
 always uu in paired and
 in full vigor the prepared
 to Inaintain rights and sovereignty
 of the States and to
 confine the ac tion ot
 the General Govenunent strictly to
 the sphere of its apprcjpriate
 du ties This is the
 last exposition that we have
 of Gen eral Jackson s
 views Beøinnino in the year
 1797 and frorn that time
 continuously until the year in
 which he passed from pubiic
 life we have an un
 broken chain of evidence that
 he was a Republi can
 according to tho doctrines set
 forth in the people of
 America that there were no
 citizens of any such single
 political community that a man
 could not bc a citizen
 of tbc United States for
 thc simple reason that it
 is ilnpossible for one to
 be a citizen of a
 country that has no existence
 conclusion is perfectly satisfactory t
 o me however absurd it
 may seem to others that
 as there is no such
 political corn rnu nit y
 as the peoplc of the
 Uni ted States it is
 impossible that there can be
 any citizen of the United
 States but they are citizens
 of the several States TR
 s is the language of
 Mr Madison when he was
 writing this article to make
 it acceptable to the people
 of Virginia Phis assent and
 ratification is to be given
 by the people not as
 individuals composing one entire nation
 but as coni posing the
 distinct and indépende11L States to
 which they it is to

 ag these tel lns are

 of Madison when he wrote
 to make this Constitution acceptable
 to the K on tacky

 But further Mr Madison singlo

 and that was in the
 Virginia convention w heu the
 Constitution the proclamation Yet this
 single isolated paper is now
 seized upbn by Black Republicanism
 and was assailed and it
 was declared that it would
 form a nation would obliterate
 State lines and by the
 Senator from Tennessee and every

 the powers of Government may
 be reassumed by I everywhere
 wherever the Federal flag floats
 or the the Constitutions their
 understanding will control I the
 people whensoever it shall become
 necessary to their all of
 those provisions in which the
 meaning is happiness latent or
 doubtful Here then in Virginia
 in her No people of
 the United States there but
 the convention when she was
 about to ratify the Con
 stitution we find in the
 debates that Mr Madison people
 of New York in convention
 speaking for themselves declared that
 all powers being derived not
 only denied that there was
 any such people as the
 people of the United States
 but he asserted from the
 people may bereassumed by them
 when ever it becomes necessary
 for their happiness unqualifiedly that
 there was a right of
 secession not only a right
 of secession but that that
 right being inherent in the
 people removed a question of
 anxiety and was an additional
 reason why it should be
 ratified The Senator went into
 a learned discussion yes terday
 as to the ratification of
 Virginia and com I shall
 be very brief in mented
 upon the terms noticing that
 WV hat was her ratification
 We the delegates of the
 peop e of Virginia duly
 elect ed c do in
 the and in behalf of
 tbe people of Virginia declare
 aud rnake known that the
 powers granted under the Constitution
 being derived froin the people
 of the United States ntay
 be resluned by thcln whensoever
 the satne shall be perverted
 to their injury or oppression
 Now sir let us look
 at the language let us
 look at the circumstances Who
 were speaking The people of
 Virginia Who were alluded t
 o The people of Virginia
 and the people of the
 other States Why did they
 use the term United States
 Because the powers herein be
 ing derived from the people
 of the States united by
 Then sir in addition to
 the great right which was
 secured by the seven years
 war the right of self
 crovernment set forth so explicitly
 in the Declara tian of
 Independence we have we havc
 New York we have Rhode
 Island which ratified in precisely
 the same terms as New
 York declar ing when they
 became parties to this compact
 that they had ihe right
 to resume or reassume the
 powers derivcd from them whenever
 they should be perverted to
 their injury or oppression or
 whenever that course should bc
 necessary to their i differ
 from tlle Senator Vir happiness
 minia LIMN HUNTER in declaring
 as he did the other
 day that secession was not
 a constitutional right but a
 right derivable fronl the very
 nature I sav that it
 is derivable of the compact
 itself from the nature of
 the compact but it is
 also de rivab e from
 the Constitution because when par
 ties come to sicrn an
 agreement if any one of
 them specifies any additional stipulation
 and is per mitted to
 si rn with that stipulation
 it is as much this
 instrument it was proper that
 the fact should I a
 part of the compact as
 if it were written in
 the Federal Government has jurisdiction
 Yet that resolution was voted
 for by me was voted
 fQi by the Senator from
 Oregon was voted for by
 every Senator on this side
 it was even voted for
 by the Senator from Tennessee
 He rises here now rand
 charges us with having voted
 against the doctrine of protection
 to property He says that
 he sup ported our candidates
 for the Presidency and Vice
 Presidency that he ignored all
 charges of disu nionism What
 was the doctrine on which
 these candidates ran The second
 plank in the platform is
 in these words c That
 it is the duty of
 the Federa_l Government in all
 ite departments to protect when
 necessary the rights of persons
 and property in the Territories
 and wherever else its constituti
 fnal authority extends Both upon
 the land and upon the
 sea it is the duty
 of the Federal Government to
 protect prop ecty of every
 species slaves as well as
 other prop erty The Republican
 party denied this right I
 they said that slaves were
 not property and wherever the
 Federal Government had jurisdic tion
 they had the right and
 they would exercise the right
 to confiscate that species of
 property i because man cannot
 own property in man We
 asserted the converse of the
 proposition we went into the
 fight with our constitutional principles
 brightly blazoned upon our banner
 We suffered a defeat but
 it was m a glorious
 caude We were charged then
 by the Opposition with having
 done be made patent The
 powers of tbc Government were
 not derived from the people
 of Virg inia alone l
 he powers were derived from
 the people of t ne
 different States the Stat es
 united They were derived fronl
 all the States that came
 into the com pact Hence
 the jropriety of that languao
 e and being derived from
 the people of the different
 united States or States united
 then they go on and
 declare that thev may be
 resumed by them By whom
 By those from whom they
 werc de rom the rived
 WV ho were they derived
 from people of America r
 l bere vv as no
 such people But from thc
 people of the different States
 par ties to the compact
 was the word sump What
 is thc meaning of resume
 Every man who speaks English
 knows the mean body of
 it and it inures not
 only to his benefit but
 to the benefit of every
 individual who had precisely what
 the Senator ft 01ü Tennessee
 now either previously sigr ed
 or who subsequently charges that
 in our vote upon the
 Brown resolu tions we voted
 against these principles I Bhowed
 signed it r l he
 Senator from Tcnncsse c yesterday
 said from the record that
 the resolution which was in
 that admitting all this to
 be so South Carolina troducod
 by Mr BRowN was offered
 as a sub a rainst
 which State he seems to
 have special stitute for the
 resolutions which I have read
 in spite cannot c hiim
 it because she ratified the
 troduced by Mr DAYIs The
 vote was between I preferred
 that introduced I Constitution before
 Virginia ew York and the
 two resolutions I Rhode Island
 did Had he been a
 lawyer he by Mr DAY1s
 and therefore voted for that
 That i I would have
 known that the Constitution stood
 prevailed over the other and
 there never was a subject
 to amendment by ratification until
 il that whenever onc party
 last party signed it the
 thirty fourth State that caz
 ne in the other day
 came to ratify that Constitution
 she was ad mitted with
 any addititional qualification and it
 ingofthe word resume It IYlcans
 to take back would be
 a oart of the compact
 and inure not to that
 which has already been given
 by you Had her benefit
 alonc but to the benefit
 of all the con they
 meant that in the event
 of this Constitution tracting parties
 So much then for his
 consti being perverted to the
 injury and oppression of tutional
 argument as he has called
 it the people of the
 United States as a single
 polit There is one matter
 which I explained so fully
 ical comrnunity its powers should
 pass to them on a
 former occasion that I shall
 not take up thei they
 woul d have said that
 in this event its powers

 of the different It is
 stale slander that wvas circulated

 are perverted be assennod I

 itself and nobody ever voted
 against it As to the
 resolution introduced by the Senator
 from North Carolina Mr CLINGMAN

 the Senator from Mississippi Mr
 BROWN the one asserting that
 the necessit y then existed
 the other that it did
 not exist to legislate as
 to the protection of slave
 property in tl ke timer
 ritories I said and every
 other Senator almost on the
 floor who voted with me
 said it was a I
 voted question of fact and
 not of principle then so
 did the Senator from Oregon
 so did the Senators froin
 Virginia so did my colleague
 first a yainst the resolution
 declaring that the ne by
 tho people of the whole
 United States as one the
 last canvass that has been
 revamped and pro i cessity
 existed and then ao ainst
 the resolution political contmunity which
 would itself have made i

 from Tennessee that as amended
 declaring that it did not
 exist As it a national

 and fused the whole into

 long restunes the lioiit hc
 gave her throne and passion
 fled same means to takc
 back t låt which you
 gave the scholars the mop
 of education the states rnen
 who were in that convention
 in Virginia had intended that
 when this Government became the
 powers should bo assumed by
 and pass to the people
 of the United States as
 a polit ical comn uunity
 they would have used words
 to convey the idea and
 they would have declared these
 powers being derived from the
 people of thc different States
 for the good of the
 whole when they shall be
 perverted to the injury and
 oppres Sion of the whole
 they may be assumed by
 the t hc Democratic party
 the Senators here voted to
 that fact we voted against
 the resolution both ways givincr
 as our reason that we
 did not in against the
 doctrine that was contained in
 our platform and that vras
 that slaves were property tend
 to be diverted from our
 line of purpose We I
 intended to incorporate a I

 speech which the Senator from

 I have an aversion to
 Tennessee made on the 19th
 of December 1860 II ever
 since the Kansas Ne cyreat
 principle I interrupted him to
 correct it and he refused
 to braska bifl became the
 subject of discussion The principle
 on which we were voting
 was t aat it allow
 the correction and I stated
 to hilu then was the
 duty of the Federal Government
 to pro that I supposed
 he wished the perversion without
 tect property of every kind
 wherever it hud juris the
 correction to go into his
 speech and hc should His
 speech was pub diction We
 voted for that yet the
 Senator from be entitled to

 correction Some days Tennessee rises

 to allow himself to be

 Illinois Mr Douc i runted

 to be spread I disputed
 it flatly L AS made

 February 7 Union if we
 could possibly avoid it We
 were determined neither to cheatnor
 to be cheated We determined
 to assert clear constituti on
 al righ ts to go
 before the people of the
 North and the South advocating
 these rights and to defeat
 the opposition in whatever complexion
 it presented itself uhder whatever
 name under whatever ban ner
 it might fiffht and we
 believed conscientiously that We could
 that the truth would prevail
 and that in electing a
 man Who would abide by
 the C o nstitution and
 sustain our rights under it
 we Should not dilly save
 the Union but render it
 worth saving We were defeated
 in that canvass I Arn
 not going to say whose
 faultit was certainly not ours
 Nearly two million men over
 twenty ohe years of age
 in the rion slaveholding States
 voted that our property should
 not be protected that our
 property Should be confiscated wherever
 this Federéd Government had jurisdiction
 We were beaten The opposite
 party has come into power
 We gave notice both North
 and South that if Abraham
 Lincoln was elected this Union
 was dissolved I never made
 a specch during the whole
 of the canvass without asserting
 that fact I know not
 how the Tennessee Senator dis
 cussed these matters nor what
 hc said I know that
 in his own Slåte judging
 from the newspa pers he
 was regarded as a very
 lukewarm sup porter of his
 own ticket I know that
 he was repo rted in
 speech at Memphis to have
 at least countenanced If he
 did notmakc the very charges
 which he is now making
 against us I know that
 his heart and his sympatl

 party which seceded at Charleston
 ttnd which nominated ticket at
 Baltimore It was too sound
 for him Success not principle
 was the ques tion with
 him He would have supported
 any body If he did
 fight the good fight and
 keep the fäith if he
 did enter that canvass earnestly
 and warmly then his own
 party friends in Tennessee have
 much misreprcscnted him the party
 press there have misrepresented him
 his speech at Memphis has
 been misrepresented and his whole
 Ilhese are facts which course
 in that carlvass are known
 to myself as well as
 to everybody else who reads
 tbe newspapers They I say
 that our purpose was not
 to dissolve the Union but
 the dire necessity has been
 put upon us The question
 is whether we shall live
 longer in a Union in
 which a party hostile to
 us in every respect has
 the power ill Congress in
 the executi ve department and
 in the electoral col pafty

 Admit it to be true
 disposition to confederate with non
 slaveholding States is the result
 of a belief that non

 to be trusted with the

 institution of slavery ergo the
 Senator says that after we
 have formed a confederation of
 slaveholding States non slaveholdcrs in
 our own States will be
 deprived of all political power
 fir says he if it
 is not safe to confederate
 with non slaveholding States then
 it is unsafe to allow

 flesh born on the same
 soil descended from the same
 ances try with the same
 glorious memories of the past
 transmitted to them from their
 sires who fought for the
 establishment of liberty in this
 country Who bu t a
 Black Republican or a renegade
 south erner and Helperité has
 ever dared to assert such
 a slander on the people
 of the South either slave
 holders or non slaveholders Who
 but such a man ever
 dared to say that the
 slaveholders ever distrusted their breth
 pen Who has over hinted
 that the non slaveholders were
 not as sound to the
 South on this question as
 those who owned the most
 So far as my cxperience
 goes I can say that
 throughout the broad litnitsof the
 southern country the soundest mcn
 I know are non slave
 holders Ei hey fecl and
 they know the facts as
 they are presented to them
 and the issues as they
 now stand and demao cpism
 will not be able except
 at the risk of its
 neck to raise any such
 issue in any slaveholding State
 Who are interested in the
 matter Slaveholders are men of
 enlarged ideas of education and
 of property for no man
 who holds slaves owns slaves
 alone he must own land
 horses and pos sessions chattels
 of different kinds When the
 day comes that four and
 a half million Africans are
 turned loose free in our
 country the slave holders will
 have the means and the
 ability and the inclination to
 Icave the country and leave
 it they will Who will
 be left to contest the
 palm with these emancipated slaves
 of African race Who but
 the non slavcholders The man
 who has a srnall farm
 with a wifi and to
 sup port on it who
 has lived nowhere else who
 has ncvcr bccn beyond the
 limits of his own country
 of education is there a
 fixture and he has to
 stay and he has to
 contest the question of ec
 uality with the African These
 men cannot be Ictd by
 thc nose by demao ogism
 They will listcn not to
 appeals against those who are
 more fortunate than themselves in
 the world s goods They
 know that in the veins
 of slaveholders runs Therefore sirrah

 But he rose here and
 denounced JEFFERSON Davrs as a
 disunionist per se That charge
 was once made against that
 gallant soldier He is nb
 sent I feel that I
 can speak of him because
 he is a friend and
 because i know him to
 be worthy of the language
 which I shall use A
 man who from his youth
 upwards has followed the flag
 of his country and would
 follow it to the death
 as long as it was
 the flag of his country
 who never deserted it whose
 blood was shed in its
 defense whose body would have
 been wrapped in its broad
 folds had he died in
 defending it that man here
 dc nounced as a traitor
 the ally of Abolitionists the
 coadjutor of Phillips and Giddings
 and men of that character
 The slander was uttered when
 DANIIs was not here to
 resent it Why sir of
 the four footed beasts it
 is said that the jackal
 preys only upon the carcasses
 that his royal master has
 It belongs to our own
 species to feed upon the
 dead lion himself DAvrs gone
 He is not here to
 resent it That charge was
 once Inade against him and
 he answered in emphatic lan
 guage he answered in monosyllables
 and it is the answer
 that would have been made
 again here upon this floor
 had the charge been made
 during his presence From whatever
 source it might havc come
 thus he would have answered
 to prince or peer or
 plebeian from Highland or from
 Low land from far or
 from near Lord Angus thou

 Several SENATORS Clear them now
 Mr CHANDLER 1 that the

 was aorecd to The PRESIDINGäOFFICER
 The Sergeant at Arms will

 They feel and they Mr
 CLINGMAN I suppose it is
 in order for kilow that
 they are citizens of their
 own State i me to
 move to reconsider that motion
 I have They know and
 they feel that they arc
 freemen been here f or
 many weeks and I hear
 applause They know and they
 feel that they have an
 in every day dozens of
 times It was done acrain
 alienable right of self government
 and they intend and again
 yesterday and the day before
 and 1 de to assert
 it and when the question
 is presented to those n
 icn of whcthcr they will
 fio ht for ne o
 roes now or fight ncm
 oes hereafter they will not
 bc long in deciding that
 que étion Helperism will not
 distract and divide the truc
 and loyal men of the
 South in this our day
 of darkness and of dansrer
 Iihe Scnator from Tennessee says
 that the cot ton States
 will not bc able to
 give any protection to the
 border States arid that we
 of the cotton States wish
 to make war upon Mexico
 and to o ct the
 Virginians and Tennesseeans and Kentuck
 inns to do our fiubting
 and to furnish us tng
 money Who told him that
 we wanted to make war
 upon Mexico Which of his
 Black Republican friends has communicated
 this secret to him I
 never heard of it On
 t he contrary I know
 the reverse to be true
 that it wili be as
 much as we can do
 to attend to our svn
 affairs W c have no
 use for Mexico We cannot
 colonize it We have no
 surplus slavc population So fur
 as Texas is con cerncd
 she can receive for years
 to come the whole surplus
 slave population and till profitably
 It is another Black Republican
 her ferliie soil slander that
 gets up and dares to
 announce in the prosence of
 southern men I lc waited
 pa tiently waited for six
 long weeks until BENJA MIN
 and I a nd others
 left and then he rose
 I to reply to their
 speeches Why did he not
 an thing for Helper that
 he never has devised he
 has ncvcr imacrined he has
 never written any swerthcmwhen thcy
 were present When honest thing
 that was more unsound and
 treasonable to Jack Falstaff havhpcounterfeited
 death rose and sire theretöre
 a uniform rule on the
 subject If men are to
 be applauded on one side
 I thillk it perfectly fair
 that they should upon the
 other I therefore make my
 motion to reconsider Mr MASON
 I hope it Will not
 be reconsid I cred The
 galleries were once cleared and
 I think II with beneficial
 results and I hope they
 will be I i cleared
 again Mr KING I hope
 the order will be proceeded
 with Mr MASON Let the
 order be executed The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from North
 Carolina tnoves to reconsider the
 order Mr CLINGMAN 1 am
 indifferent about it I am
 in favor of seeing order
 preserved generally but I observe
 whenever a man speaks in
 favor of the Union and
 there is applause no exception
 is taken to it Mr
 COLLAMER Irise to a point
 of order i Did the
 Senator vote in the affirmative
 Mr CLINGMAN There was no
 division I ii did not
 vote at all Ifthe Senator
 makes the point I have
 said ali I desire to
 say and he may regard
 I the motion as withdrawn
 Mr MASON Let the be
 executed The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 motion is withdrawn and the
 order is in process of
 execu tion I Mr JOHNSON
 of Tennessee I am in
 hopes that the order will
 be suspended Oh no Mr
 POWELL retiring the South than
 the sentiments which the Senator
 of a slaveholdino Sta e
 has uttered upon this floor
 said Applause in the galleries
 Wii nay he not rise
 as as found gunpowder Percy
 lying near him he I
 suppose that order will not
 extend to them Mr CHANDLER
 My motion was that the
 galleries on tho right of
 the Chair be cleared 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 789 The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair ex
 pressly excepted the ladies gallery
 and gave the order according
 to the motion to clear
 the galleries on the right
 of the Chair Mr G
 WIN Is it in order
 to move to adjourn Oh
 no J I do not
 see that we are making
 much headway in the process
 of clearing tho gal leries
 The alleries having been cleared
 The BRESIDING OFFICER The Senate
 will come to order The
 order of the Senate for
 clearing the galleries on the
 right of the Chair having
 been executed the Senator from
 Texas will proceed with his
 remarks Mr WIGFALL Mr President
 1 was ing at the
 time of the interruption of
 the distin guished Senator from
 Mississippi and what more I
 might have said I do
 not know it has escaped
 me I did fee sir
 deeply grieved not only grieved
 but indignant when a man
 of his character was held
 up herc to reprobation by
 a Senator from a southern
 State a man who more
 perfectly than any have ever
 met combines all the great
 qual ities of Jackson and
 Calhoun With the iron will
 pure patriotism and distinguished military
 abilities of the one he
 combines in the most sin
 gular manncr thc clearness of
 j l tdgment the won
 derful sagacity and tho remarkable
 accuracy in his knowlcd re
 of the great constitutional ques
 tions that are acritating thé
 country of the ot he
 r I felt it therpfore
 an outrage that the Senator
 should wait hero for six
 weeks and make a cas
 ual remark of that Senator
 a subject of comment and
 couple it with denunciatioil and
 charges of want of patriotism
 As to Mr Benjamin and
 the sneers at him and
 his being a lawyer he
 needs no defense at rny
 hands My relations towards him
 have not been so personally
 intirnate and close as those
 with the Senator from Mississippi
 and I therefore felt less
 indignant at that The mousing
 ow will strike at the
 eagle in his towering flio
 ht without disturb ing the
 proud bird and I Ceci
 thero is no occasion to
 defend the reputation of Mr
 Benjamin his capacity to comprehend
 either an act of Congrcss
 or a treaty of the
 United States or to draw
 legit imate conclusions such as
 a lawyer does draw His
 arouments on such questions need
 no defense But the point
 from which I was diverted
 was that tho cotton States
 desire not from any good
 fce inæ but for their
 own protection to precipi tate
 these border States into a
 revolution The charge is groundless
 That we feel sympathy With
 these border States that we
 nave similur in stitutions that
 we desire that our destinies
 should be the same is
 true but what is there
 to prevent us not only
 from asserting but carrying oat
 to its legitimate conscquenccs our
 separate State existence With exports
 o the amount of hun
 drcds of millions of dollars
 our imports must bo States
 have left this Union and
 others are going to leave
 it simply because they choose
 to do it that is
 all Mel e do not
 ask your consent do not
 wish it We have rcvokcd
 our ratification of the treaty
 commonly known as the Constitution
 of the United States a
 treaty for common defense and
 general welfare and we shall
 be perfectly willing to enter
 into another treaty with you
 of peace and amity Reject
 tbc olive branch and offer
 us thc sword and we
 accept it ve have not
 the slightest objection Upon that
 subject we feel precisely as
 thc great Lowndes felt upon
 another important subject the Presidency
 which he said was neither
 be sought nor declined TV
 hen you invade our soil
 look to your own I
 borders You say that you
 have too many peo plc
 too many towns too dense
 a population for us to
 invade you I say to
 you Scnators t there is
 nothing that ever stops the
 march invading force except a
 desert Ithe more opu lous
 a country the more easy
 it ist s sist an
 army l hcrc are some
 other matters that we under
 stand and possibly you do
 not Not only are our
 non slaveholders loyal but even
 our negroes are We have
 no apprehension whatever of in
 not the slightest M Te
 can arm our surrection neo

 absent T_hat is a fact
 You cannot In thesc rnodern
 steal negroes in a carnnaitrn
 t ilnes when armies mai

 as little ba2gtvve as possible
 Sineo Napoleon adopted the bivouackino
 system very little is carried
 and movements and quick chan
 of posi I tion are
 the important poi at s
 Lhat every military conunanclcr looks

 that you will never cross
 our border with equipaoe than
 will be necessary to carry
 your sick and wouruled You
 will not be able to
 have tllat amount of transportation
 which will be necessary to
 bring off many of our
 necrrocs Without it you cannot
 bring the womcn and childrcn
 and the mcn will not
 leave their wives But suppose
 you could suppose you could
 steal one hundred thousand in
 a sinffle campaifft l w
 hul is that to us
 We have four tnillion ar
 d a half and it
 would cost you morc to
 feed them than it would
 us to lose them we
 may as well talk plainly
 about this matter This is
 probably the last time I
 shall have an opportunity of
 addressino you There is another
 thing an Invading arnoy cannot
 do It cannot i burn
 up plantations You can pull
 down fences but the neoroes
 put t hQlH up the
 next morn r I he
 worst fuel that ever a
 Inan undertook it will not
 burn to make fire witli
 is dirt Now i liavc
 told you what an invading
 army cannot do ket price
 it has been at for
 years past We shall import
 a bale of something else
 föÉ eVery bale of cotton
 that We cxport and that
 bale Will bé Worth fifty
 dollars We shall find ho
 diffcült y under a war
 tariff in raisino an fibundance
 Of mo ney We have
 beeri at peace for a
 véi y long time We
 very prosperous Our planters use
 their cotton not to buy
 the necessaries of life but
 for the Sli perfluitieswhicb they
 can do witho ut Thé
 States themselves have a mine
 of wealth in the loyart
 y and the wealth of
 their citizens Georgia Mis sissippi
 any one of those States
 can issue its SIX per
 cent bonds to morrow apd
 receive cotton in payment to
 tbc extent almost of the
 entife crop They pan first
 borrow from their own citizens
 they can tax them to
 an almost unlimited extent and
 they can raise revenue from
 a tariff to an almost
 unlimited extent How will it
 be withi Now EnTland Where
 rom your cus will their
 revenue come from tom houses
 What do you export You
 have been telling us here
 for the last quarter of
 a cen tury that you
 cannot manufactui c cv én
 for the I horne Inarket
 under the tariffs which we
 have given you When this
 tariff ceases to operate your
 favor and you have to
 pay foi coming into our
 what will you export MT
 hen machinery ceases to move
 and your ope your ratives
 are turned out will you
 tax your broken capitulist or
 your starvino operative MT hen
 the navigation laws cease to
 operate what will be conM
 Of your shipping interest You
 are going to blockade our
 ports you say That is
 a very innocent game and
 you suppose we shall Sit
 I speak quietly down and
 submit to a blockade not
 of the foreign interference for
 we look not to it
 We arc just as competent
 to take Queen Vic toria
 and Louis Napoleon under our
 protection as they are to
 take us and they are
 a great deal more interested
 to day in receiving cotton
 from our ports than we
 are in shipping it You
 may lock up every balc
 Of cotton within the limits
 of the eight cotton States
 and not allow us to
 ex port obc for three
 years and we shall not
 feel it further than our
 military resources are concerned Exhaust
 the supply of cotton in
 Europe for one week and
 all Europe is in revolution
 These are facts You will
 blockade us Do you suryose
 we shall do nothing even
 upon the sea How many
 letters of marque and reprisal
 would it take to put
 the whole of your ships
 up at your wharvcs to
 rot Will any merchant at
 Havre or Liverpool or anv
 other portion of the habitable
 globe ship u cargo upon
 a New Eng land or
 New York or Pliiladclphia clipper
 or other ship when he
 knows that the seas are
 with letters of marque and
 reprisal cut you out of
 tbc carrying trade of the
 civilized An invading at yny
 in I tell you what
 if can do it is
 a very different question from
 that world I an enemy
 s country w hore is
 a dense population cawi subsist
 itself at a very little
 cost it does not between
 this Government Great Britain and
 the same With a lighter
 tariff than any evcr undertook
 to live under we could
 have n larger revenue We
 would be able to stand
 di rcct taxation to a
 greater extent than any people
 ever could before since the
 creation of the world feel
 perfectly competent to meet all
 issues that may be presented
 either by hostility from abroad
 or treason at home So
 fär as the border States
 are concerned it is a
 matter that concerns them alone
 Should they confederate with us
 beyond ull doubt New England
 machinery vvill be worked with
 the water power of Tennes
 sce of Kentucky of Virginia
 and of Maryland the tariff
 laws that now give New
 England thc monopoly in the
 thirty three States or that
 did when there wore thirty
 three States will give to
 these hovder States a monopoly
 in the slavehold ing States
 Should the nod slaveholding States
 choose to side a ainst
 us in orcanizing their Gov
 ernments and cling to their
 New Engiand breth ren the
 only result will be that
 the moat the horses the
 hemp and the grain which
 we now buy in Pennsylvania
 in Ohio in Indiana and
 Ii inois will be purchased
 in Kentucky and in western
 Virginia a nd in Missouri
 Should Penn sylvania stand out
 the oniy rcsult wiEl be
 that alwrays pay for what
 it gets An invading army
 can burn down towns an
 invading artny can burn down
 manufactories und it can starve
 operatives It can do all
 these things but an invading
 army and an army to
 defend a country both require
 a military chest You rnay

 Inar 790 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 7 I came here
 to These Senators are facts
 plead for peace but I
 have seen so much and
 felt so much that I
 am becoming at last to
 tell the plain truth about
 the matter rather indifferent as
 If you war to which
 way the thing turns vou
 can have it If you
 want peace you can get
 it but I plead not
 for peace i suppose that
 for the remarks which I
 have made I shall be
 treated by the Republican papers
 as usual with denunciation I
 have spoken plainly I have
 spoken what I thOught right
 what I believe to be
 the sentiment of the section
 in which I live I
 see this in the Tribune
 of yester day JoxNgoN of
 Tennessee tnade the strongest anti
 secession speeeh in the Senate
 to day that has been
 deiivered ih that body He
 overhauled sotne of his late
 po litieal confederates who have
 turned secessionists with immense em
 ct He confronted their recent
 acts and argu znents with
 a scries ot votes on
 Eho Brown resolutions in favor
 ofcongressional protection to slavery givcn
 last sprincr in tbe Senate
 and utterly overwhelmed them by
 his ex position JOE LANE
 of Oregon who was the
 Senator s candidate for the
 Vice Prcsidöncy was badly smashed
 It is seldorn that an
 arerurnentative tritunpl has been so
 com Piete in the Senate
 But that is not all
 The Tribune had to notice
 it twice take two bites
 nt the cherry Again the
 Tribune says Our republican representative
 form of govern viously how
 they were 60ing to vote
 exercise their own jiidgment and
 casi the vote of their
 ment was not adopted as
 a pis alter as something
 State That was the principle
 which was adopted that was
 bad in itself only not
 quite so bad as It
 was not a substitute for
 the in the Constitution just
 as you appoint during something
 else market placc democracy of
 former times because good behavior
 a man to preside over
 your Sa preme Court with
 no assurance how he is
 going that was impracticable but
 it was that the peo
 to decide cases You select
 a man for his great
 wiSdom and his great purity
 and his accurate knowledge of
 the law and you trust
 to his dis cretion to
 decide all questions of meum
 and tuum between man and
 man So it was intended
 that the people or the
 Legislature of each State acting
 in such manner as the
 Legislature should pre scribe would
 vote for the requisite number
 of the ablest and purest
 and most patriotic men with
 out asking any questions and
 that those men would meet
 together at the scat of
 government of their State and
 cast their own vote in
 their own way f0k the
 good of the country Pacey
 caucuses have broken that up
 first con gressioßQi ucuses and
 thcn theso popu lar Demo
 cratic anc l hig conventions
 and finally the thing has
 got down so low that
 nnxen come out their own
 hook to use a vul
 yar phrase run for the
 Presidency and stump the country
 Why ple themselves ought not
 to exercise directly their power
 That is it that it
 is safer that a man
 should be selected competent to
 construe the law and be
 paid a salary as judge
 to construe the law that
 it is safer and better
 for the great mass of
 the com munity than that
 the people should meet together
 in popular assembly and decide
 the law of the case
 that it is better that
 representatives should be selected to
 hold their terms of office
 fbr a cer tain period
 and påss laws far better
 that they should do it
 in that way than that
 the people en masse should
 meet and pass their own
 laws far better that men
 should be selected as Governors
 and sheriffs and constables to
 execute the laws tl lan
 for the people to turn
 out cn qnasse and exe
 cute them Representative republicanisrn the
 Senator from Tennessee seenls not
 to have the slightest con

 I had as well not

 chare res that the people

 it and he says we

 Who is it that he

 not the motive that influences
 me for among all the

 not I think I have

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 791 that
 Government was administered not caring
 for freedom not caring for
 right taking up arms arainst
 their brethren from an imagined
 higher law which bound them
 to their sovereign fol lowing
 a flag a miserable piece
 of buntino with figures on
 it and forgetting liberty and
 rirrht this wyas the sentiment
 which influenced the Tory party
 It is the sentiment which
 influences the l ory party
 at the South now the
 sacredness of tho Union without
 knowing what the Union is
 or caring what it is
 And yet he denounces the
 very men who in 1776
 in South Carolina occu pied
 the position that he nosv
 occupies He says that he
 will take up arms in
 Tennessee when her ordinance is
 passed and that if she
 is taken out of the
 Union they will have to
 pass over his dead body
 I IQ not believe that
 I think he will not
 be in the breach but
 he says so and it
 shows the sentiment it shows

 an n us much so

 not perhaps feel that kind
 of paternal solicitude about it
 which the Sen ator from

 we must pass them at
 some time or other and
 I hope wc sliall pass
 the bill which he suggests
 or something like it I
 do not want to have
 any coiliSion of opinion even
 between him and mc We

 I feel a little more
 responsibility with regard to these

 myself in the position of
 op posing anything that he

 is pro Sidc of the

 a little propositions that have
 been offered and I they
 do choose to do it

 to do so in Cho
 absence of the chairman Senator
 from Rhode Iskand he will
 make no speed but I
 can notify our friends that
 f do consider it by
 this haste but if he
 succeeds in his motion his
 motion for the present as
 I sce and under stand
 that the Senator from wants
 the of some importance that
 they should be taken up

 be a and passed at
 this session of Congress some

 to unite his effort s

 to put them off eternally

 will be just Mr WILSON
 I will say to the
 Senator from Tennessec that do
 not think I oucrht to

 desire to say a few
 words on this question and
 1 desire that we shall

 have been suficiently discussed it
 cious task for Ine to
 object to that bill of

 gain nothing by thosc bills

 opinion that our taking tho
 advantage of a thin Se

 may find it of some
 importance to have a special
 order for to morrow for
 as soon as I some
 money in the Treasury to
 appropriate as there can be
 a full Senate I shall
 move to post pone it
 if nobody else does TN

 ator from Pennsylvania can pass
 that bill without debäte and
 when I simply ask for
 one that bin Which proposes
 to tax by the lineal
 foot and the square footand
 the cubic foot and every
 other imaginable contrivance shall lie
 over long enough for us
 to understand what is the
 amount and rate of taxation
 put upon property it seems
 to me an appeal that
 ought to be regarded I
 hope there fore that the
 Senator from Maine will get
 up the åppropriation bill and
 for my part as soon
 as I can I hall
 prepare myself to take p_art
 against this other bill or
 at least avainst the general
 prin ciplés of the tariff
 Mi SIMMONS wish merely to
 make one suggestion The Senator
 from Ohio says that this
 bili iS suddenly thrust upon
 him It was before the
 Senate a good part of
 last session Every one has
 had all summer to read
 it if they choose to
 read it an d understand
 it It was postponed until
 the first Mondåy of Decmnber
 of this session It has
 been before the Committee on
 Finance five or six wceks
 tind then it was referred
 to the select committee Now
 I agreed to postpone the
 bill until to morrow at
 one o clock in Ordei
 that the naval appropriation bitl
 might be taken up to
 night i have not proposed
 to interfere with the Navy
 bill but I cannot make
 a motion here about a
 bill but what somebody opposed
 to the bili wants to
 find out how to make
 a speech against it before
 it will come up MI
 PUGH I want to find
 out what the bill is
 I want to find out
 what property is to be
 tüCd I can understand taxing
 property accord ing tÖ its
 value We put that in
 a territorial bilt the other
 day but taxing by the
 square inch I do not
 understand Mr SIMMONS This bill
 has been reported I hope
 the question will be takcn
 over a year Mr CAMERON
 Let us have the question
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 beg leave to suggest to
 thc Senator from Pennsyl vania
 that as soon as it
 is proper that is when
 debate ceases thc Chair will
 put the qtlestion Mr LATHAM
 i move that the Senate
 ad journ It is very
 evident there is not a
 quorum present The question being
 put there were on a
 divis ion ayes 4 noes
 20 The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 senate refuses to adjourn but
 there is no quorum present
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 will suggest
 that it is perfectly useless
 for us to waste our
 strength in disputing about this
 thing There is no quorum
 hete and no quorum can
 be got here We can
 take up no bill to
 night if a division is
 called for Mr SIMMONS 1
 withdraw the motion Mr FESSENDEN
 Then 1 to up the

 being no objection it was
 so ordered Mr NIBLACK 1
 call for the regular order
 of business PATENTS The House
 proceeded to the regular order
 of business being the consideration
 of Senate bill An act
 to promote the No 10
 in addition to progress of
 the useful arts Mr NIBLACK
 I think I said suffeient
 yes terday to explain the
 bill and the amendments as
 reported at the last session
 I now call for the
 reading of the amendments which
 submitted yesterday The amendments were
 read Mr PHELPS 1 have
 only had a short time
 to examine the bill nom
 v pending but discover that
 there is a proposition in
 it to increase the salary
 of the Commissioner of Patents
 from I to 4 500
 The same reasons which would
 call for an increase of
 the salary of this bureau
 offcer would compel us to
 increase the salaries of all
 the other bureau offcers under
 the Government of the I
 doubt not that tho duties
 of this United States offcer
 are very onerous and arduous
 in their char acter but
 they are not more so
 than those which devolve upon
 the accounting offcers of the
 Treas ury Department through whose
 omcers all the accounts of
 the expenditures of the Government
 I cannot therefore sanc must
 necessarily pass I also find
 tion the bill with that
 provision in it that there
 is a proposition to add
 to the number of examiners
 and first and second assistants
 twelve omcers Mr HOARD We
 propose to strike that out
 Mr PHELPS well sir 1
 desire my protest against this
 increase of the salary of
 the Commissioner of Patents for
 if you increase his salary
 you ought in justice and
 equity to increase the salaries
 of all the other bureau
 officers Mr NIBLACK Mr Speaker
 objections I made by the
 gen tleman from Missouri were
 duly considered by the Committee
 on Patents ana after givino
 a careful consideration to thc
 subject it was agreed by
 the committees of both I
 louses that an increase of
 the salary of the Commissioner
 of Patents was in every
 way desirable and proper I
 his officer does not stand
 upon the same as other
 heads of bureaus The Patent
 Office is a self sustaining
 institution and is no tax
 upon the Government Again it
 requires the service of a
 gentleman of peculiar qualifications to
 discharge the duties of this
 office satisfactorily and well At
 the present salary the office
 of Commissioner of Patents is
 literally going a begging You
 cannot get any gentleman to
 hold the office for any
 great length of time Now
 inasmuch as the office pays
 its own expenses we think
 it to the interest of
 in ventors as well as
 to the public service that
 we should pay a salary
 which will command the ser
 vices of the very best
 man for such a place
 and also to place him
 in a position so far
 as pay is concerned which
 will make him x villing
 to occupy the position permanently
 There is a general provision
 which must have escaped the
 attention of the gentleman from
 Mis sourl That is that
 in no event shall the
 expenses of the office oxcced
 its receipts and in no
 event If there can it
 be a tax upon the
 Government fore it be for
 the interest of inventors and
 of the country generally that
 these officers shall receive higher
 salaries it cannot be an
 objection that it would be
 a tax upon the Treasury
 Nor does the objection In
 regard to the salaries of
 other bureau officers apply to
 this because they are paid
 out of the Treasury of
 the United States differently from
 the manner in which these
 offcers are paid Mr PORTER
 Will the receipts be adequate
 to pay these increased salaries
 Mr NIBLACK So far as
 our information goes they will
 be sufficient and will leave
 a sur plus besides if
 the business of the omce
 does not diminish from what
 it has been several years
 past Mr PORTER Is there
 any provision made in the
 bill for a deficiency Mr
 NIBLACK There is not There
 is at present a large
 surplus in the Patent Office
 held there for general purposes
 The Patent Offce has never
 beeh a tax on the
 Treasury of the United States
 and we provide that it
 never shall be In asmuch
 as there is already a
 surplus to pay in creased
 salaries the Committee on Patents
 think it right and proper
 that a portion of it
 at least shall be expended
 in this way So far
 as the librarian is concerned
 we propose to increase his
 salary from 1 600 to
 1 800 a year The
 offce of librarian is perhaps
 the third most important offce
 in the bureau coming after
 those of the Commissioner and
 chief clerk His duties have
 been greatly increased during thc
 last three years He is
 required not only to be
 acquainted with modern languages but
 to give translations of any
 documents called for by the
 examiner He has also charge
 by recent arrangement of the
 copy right business This has
 increased his duties and we
 think there should be a
 corresponding increase of salary This
 salary question and the last
 amendment are we think the
 only propositions that are likely
 to excite discussion or opposition
 The last sec It proposes
 to tion is one of
 some importance limit hereafter the
 extension of patents and is
 intended to cut off an
 extension of those mammoth patents
 that have been extended in
 time s past am not
 myself prepared to say that
 the policy of the section
 is clear but a majority
 of the Com mittee on
 Patents after giving the subject
 full con sideration have come
 to the conclusion that there
 ought to be some limit
 to this extension of pat
 ents and have instructed me
 to report the section It
 provides that no patent shall
 bc extended here aftev when
 the net profits of the
 invention shun equal or exceed
 100 000 If there be
 any seyious ohiection to that
 section of the bill and
 if it be desired to
 have a separate vote upon
 it I have no objection
 Mr STANTON Will the gentleman
 Indiana tell me how much
 this increase of salaries amounts
 to Mr NIBLACK of the
 Commissioner from 3 000 to
 4 500 a yeal that
 of the chief clerk from
 2 000 to 9 500
 a year and that of
 the librarian from 1 600
 to 1 800 a year
 That is all Mr STANTON
 hope that a separate vote
 may be taken on the
 increase of salaries 1 think
 the bill is a very
 valuable one and one which
 ouz ht to be passed
 But do not want to
 have it mixed up with
 an increase of salaries opposed
 to that entirely I do
 not want salaries and I
 hope the committee will not
 em incxcased barrass the eneral
 law regulatino the Patent Offc
 c with a question about
 salaries Let that cro inlo
 sorne other bill Mr NIBLACK
 There is difficulty about that
 The provision for the increase
 of the sal aries of
 the Commissioner and chief clerk
 is con tained in the
 bill as it passed the
 Senate The proposition for the
 increase of the librarian s
 sal ary is an amendment
 reported from the Committee on
 Patents We cannot therefore strike
 out the proposition relating to
 the salaries of the Com
 missioner and chief clerk without
 interfering with the original bill
 Mr CAREY What does the
 Com missioner get now Mr
 NIBLACK Three thousand dollars and
 the omce is going a
 begg_ing There is no regalar
 occupant of it but it
 is handed about from one
 to another Mr CARE Y
 I believe that Government sal
 aries are generally much highcr
 than they ought to be
 and as one of the
 Republicans of the House I
 protest at the advent ofa
 new Administration aoainst raising the
 compensation of officers Mr COX
 One word in relation to
 my col league s remark
 about salaries If my colleague
 will send for this bill
 and examine it he will
 see that there are additional
 duties to be performed and
 of course the salaries ought
 to be increased As to
 the salary of the Commissioner
 of Patents every gentleman in
 this House knows the respons
 ibility attaching to that offce
 We know from developments made
 in the public press about
 this McCormick patent of the
 responsibility at tachcd to the
 offce and which every farmer
 in the United States afiixes
 to it We knox v
 that a man ought to
 be paid in proportion to
 the respons ibility and trust
 he assumes I believe that
 no man who is fit
 for that ofhcc can be
 had unless the salary be
 increased W c had a
 distinguished gentleman from low a
 Mr Mason in the office
 but he icft because the
 salary was inadequate He could
 make double or perhaps treble
 the sal ary by attending
 to his business as patent
 agent As to the salary
 of the chief clerk I
 know noth 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 793 ing but I
 know something of the duties
 con nected with the office
 Mr NIBLACK As far as
 the chief clerk is concerned
 I beg to say that
 he is required to give
 bonds and heavy responsibilities are
 imposed upon him under existing
 law Mr COX I shall
 take the action of the
 Com mittee on Patents who
 I know have examined this
 bill carefully I think the
 bill ought not to go
 by the board for the
 sake of a little economy
 It would look too much
 like the savings of can
 dle ends and cheese parings
 The librarian has to perform
 more duties than are apparent
 He is not simply the
 custodian of books He hus
 to read proof of the
 Patent Offce report a long
 tedious labor Hc has to
 translate from the mod ern
 sornotimes from the ancient languages
 He has to examine all
 the patent oflice reports of
 for pio n countries whenever
 he is called upon to
 do so by the examiners
 This requires great erudi tion
 great patience T I re
 librarian must be a fine
 linguist to perform his duty
 properly He has also charge
 of the interchange of national
 books between Europe and this
 country He has moreover i
 believe the indexing of the
 Patent Office reports and other
 reports connected with the offce
 Besides these duties he must
 give his regular attendance day
 by day at the Patent
 Office and I know we
 are paying other clerks more
 than 1 800 for services
 nothing like so im portant
 as those of the librarian
 of the Patent Office Mr
 CARE Y I hear precisely
 tho same argu mcnts always
 used whenever it is proposed
 to raise salaries Nine tenths
 of the heads of bu
 reaus of this Government leave
 almost their entire business to
 be done by a clerk
 and their ownduty is nothing
 mörc than mere supervision Yet
 you continue to raise the
 compensation because the business increases
 but you also increase the
 num bcr of clerks to
 three or four times the
 increase of I know that
 in the last month a
 great business many morc clerks
 have been employed in the
 Pat ent Office than there
 has been employment for I
 have this from the head
 of the department Yet we
 are talking about raising the
 compensation of offcers at a
 time when the Government is
 lying at the mercy of
 stock jobbers Members talk verv
 differently here about raising the
 salaries of om cers from
 the speeches they mako on
 the stump I want it
 to be under before their
 constituents stood that I advocate
 the same principles and measures
 here that I do to
 my own people my judgment
 thc tröubles of the country
 at this very day arise
 to a very great extent
 from the struggles for oflicc
 in consequence of there being
 protest against ad so much
 moncy in them vancing the
 pay of any officer one
 loilar Mr NIBLACK 1 will
 say to the gentleman that
 the increase of salary is
 to como from the Patent
 Oflicc fund and that not
 a dollar will come out
 of the l reasury Mr
 CARE Y It makes not
 a bit of difference from
 what fund it comes the
 Government will have to pav
 it Mr NIBLACK I cal
 for the previous ques tion
 on the bill and amelidments
 The previous question was seconded
 and the main quest ion
 ordered to be put is
 due to such peyson from
 the time the offcer by
 whom was ordered I hope
 thc House will put the
 bill or under whom such
 elaim is made became entitled

 it can be amended said

 I make the point order
 Mr ANCH that the bifl

 of the MI hole on
 tke state of t hc
 because it contains ari appropriation
 The attempt to evade the
 rule bv the provision the
 794 bonds shatlt be made
 payable only when Congress shall
 make an appropriation cannot prevent
 the bill from going to
 committtee under the rede nt
 decision of the Speaker in
 the parallel case of the
 Pacific railroad bill Mr COX
 I suppose thc House understands
 that by the estimates which
 have been before us this
 bill will take from the
 Treasury some seven I think
 million five hundred thousand dollars
 we ought not to consider
 a bill of this magnitude
 in this summary manner Mr
 FENTON Upon the subject of
 the point of order raised
 by the gentleman from North
 Car olina 1 call the
 åttentiö n of the Chair
 to the last clause ofthe
 thirteenth section The thirteenth section
 was agrain read Mr BRANCH
 1 make the PQint of
 order that the bill is
 obliged to go to tho
 Committee of the Whole on
 the state of the Union
 because it pro There is
 a general vides for the
 issue of bonds statute of
 the United States which authorizes
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 to pay any outstand ing
 bonds of the United States
 out of any surplus tf
 unds which may be in
 the I reasury The pro
 viso which has been read
 therefore does 110t re lieve
 the bill from the objection
 that it rnakes an appropriation
 because it does not deprive
 the Sec retary of the
 Treasury of thc right of
 paying the bonds under the
 general law If there shall
 be a surplus in the
 Treasury he can apply it
 for this purpose Mr GROW
 I think the gentleman from
 North Carolina is mistaken as
 to the effect of this
 pro viso The general law
 upon the subject would apply
 to all outstanding bonds against
 the Gov ernment if no
 subsequent law should be passed
 i nterfering with the exclusive
 application of that law This
 proviso declares that the bonds
 shall not be paid under
 the general law that they
 shall not be paid until
 Congress shall make an appro
 priation for that purpose It
 therefore expressly takes out of
 the general rule what would
 other wise be an appropriation
 Mr STANTON 1 hope the
 Chair will dc cide the
 question of order The SPEAKER
 It appears to the Chair
 that this case is taken
 out of the gencral rule
 because there is an express
 declaration that the money shall
 not be paid until Congress
 shall make an up propriation
 1 he Chair therefore decides
 that there is no a
 ropriatiation made by the bill

 February 7 Mr STANTON It
 has been altered so as
 to avoid the rule which
 requires appropriation bills to have
 their first consideration m the

 That I I believe is
 the only change made in
 the bill of the last
 session Mr BRANCH I am
 confirmed then in the fact
 that the bill before the
 House is not printed I
 think there ought so that
 members may get it to
 be copies of the bill

 the bill printed at the

 COX I wish to say
 a word about this bill
 becore the ycas and nays
 are taken on order I
 believe it is substan ino
 the main question tially the
 same bill which was introduced
 in the I think Senate
 the Thirty Fourth Congress it
 is the same one or
 substantially so Perhaps it calls
 for a littlc rnore rnoney
 I think that the officers
 who fell in the xvar
 of the Revolution are also
 included in this bill r
 hpy were not included in
 the bill passed in one
 branch during the T ha
 ty Fourth Congress In the
 rcport ofa speech made by
 Senator CLAY of Alabuna I
 find an estimate made by
 the Commissioner of Pensions as
 to the amount of Inoney
 this bill will require I
 am not going to argue
 whether the bill is just
 or equita i only Inake
 the point Ibat it is
 not now the proper litne
 under the haste and pressure
 of the previous question to
 consider a bill which the
 Comniissioner of Pensions says involves
 the sum of 5 314
 250 Mr CLAY included also
 those who fell in the
 battles of the Revolution anci
 added onc hundred per cen
 t to that calculation and
 then the bill would take
 7 500 000 to meet
 its demands upon the Treasury
 I ask whether if the
 bill be passed or not
 it ought not first to
 have mature consideration If it
 has there is much to
 be said on both sides
 let it not be hurricd
 through in this uusatisfäc tory
 manner Thé SPEAKER stated that
 the morning hour had expired
 and that the question in
 order was the consideration of
 the report of the select
 com mittee of thirty t
 hree Mr DAVIS of Maryland
 obtained the floor I STATE
 OF TI IE UNION Mr
 CORWIN With the consent of
 thegen t eman from Maryland
 I wish to announce to
 the House that I do
 not intend to call the
 previous question to day on
 the report ot the select
 com mittee of thirty three
 By the advice of many
 gentlemen who desire to speak
 on the subject I speak
 in their support No objection
 being made the joint resolution
 was received and ordered to
 be prmted It is as
 follows Joint resolution proposing amendments
 to tho Constitution M hercas
 the Constitution of the United
 States is a grant of
 specific powers delegated to the
 Federal Government by the people
 of the several States all
 powers not delegated to it
 nor prohibited to the States
 being reserved to the States
 respectively or to the people
 and whereas it is the
 tendency of stronger governments to
 enlarge their powers and jurisdiction
 at the expense of weaker
 governments and of majorities to
 usurp and abuse power and
 oppress Ininorities to arrest and
 hold in check which tendency
 cmnpacts and constitutions are xnade
 and whereas the only effectual
 constitutional security for the rights
 of minoritics whether as people
 or as States is the
 power expressly reserved in constituti01
 1s of protecting those rights
 by their own action and
 whereas this mode of pro
 teetion by checks and guarantees
 is recognized in the Fed
 cral Constitution as well in
 the ease of tbe equality
 of the States in representation
 and in suffrage in the
 Senate as in the provision
 for overruling the veto of
 the President and for amending
 the Constitution not to enumerate
 other examples and whereas unhappily
 because of the vast ex
 tent and diversified interests and
 institutions of the several States
 of the Union sectional divisions
 can no tonoer he suppressed
 and whereas it concerns the
 peace and stability of the
 Federal Union and Government that
 a division of the Statcs
 into mere slaveholding und non
 slaveholdingsec fions causing hitherto and
 from the nature and necessity

 There is then no real

 permit me here to say

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 7 might
 give my assent to some
 of the declara resolutions of

 proper as adeclaration of sentiment
 in a pri vate caucus
 or in at town meeting
 but they an swer no
 ppropriate end here They may
 be re go morrow They
 give no security against whaét
 may happen hereafter They are
 desired by nobody Sked for
 by nobody and will have
 no prectieäl result therefore feel
 constrained to vote against every
 measure of compromise which has
 been offered A gain think
 the day for compromises is
 past They have proved hitherto
 mere delusions sus tained only
 SQ long as they did
 not stand in the way
 of any favorite pofiOy of
 a majority Take the mostAolemn
 of them all the Missouri
 com prqmiwpf 1820 it stood
 while nobody was in tens
 ted inprocuring its repeal it
 stood un til party iitérest
 demanded that it should be
 broken down and then without
 regard to the sanctity of
 the compact an old compact
 under whicll benefits lesslystricken down
 That act shocked the moral
 sense of the people I
 said then as I say
 now that it removed the
 existing barrier between any feelings
 which we entertained in regard
 to the right of Tecritories
 south of that line to
 come into the Union as
 slavc States It opened the
 whole ter ritoriql question upon
 its merits It enabled us
 tQ sgy if slavery was
 good south of that line
 it WAS g oodo noeth
 of that line and it
 enabled us also to sayifit
 was a political amoral and
 a social evil north of
 an imaginary degree of latitude
 it WAs gqually political moral
 and social evil southiot thAt
 line gay again that nota
 single Representative of any southern
 State is able to give
 any assurance whatever that the
 adoption of any of the
 meas ures recommended by the
 committee s report would either
 induce one rebel State to
 return to its allegiance or
 secure the loyalty of a
 single onc which yet remains
 true to the Government Who
 is to say that when
 we have debased ourselves by
 yielding to these compromises with
 slavery thul a single State
 upon the other side is
 to be bound by our
 action or even influenced in
 any decisive degrees by what
 we shall do here Sir
 it is a dmogerous principle
 to amend or abolish laws
 under excitement or from impulse
 or frorn fear and much
 more is it dangerous to
 alter our orcranic lawr thc
 Constitution rl ho proposed amcnd
 ment of the Constitution is
 to pacify a mere im
 agipm y fem for the
 future and lull apprehensions of
 events which will never take
 place It is not no
 one claims the power which
 this amendment denies But if
 I am mistaken in all
 this if it is impos
 sible to say what may
 be the future complication of
 events and how it may
 affect us if it is
 im possible to see that
 what looks like good now
 may not prove hurtful to
 morrow if it should out
 In the future t uxt
 some two or th of
 these States should desire e
 and should desire to be
 aided in tbC11 en orts
 by the General Government you
 pcrceive that this amendment ties
 their hands stifles thcir voices
 and prevents us from affording
 them the aid which they
 may unanimously desire until the
 remotest State upon the Gulf
 is satisfied to allow them
 to inaugurate and carry out
 a system of emancipa ti
 pn For these reasons I
 am opposed to any alter
 ation of the Constitution If
 this amendment to the Constitution
 does Tive an additional guaran
 tee to the institution of
 slavery if it docs Inalce
 the task ofemancipati ng the
 slaves in any State harder
 arid more difficult if it
 protracts then bondage for one
 single day in any State
 of this Corifedcracy therA am
 opposed to it upon principle
 and I would rather my
 right arm should drop from
 its socket than to Hdrnic
 the principle that by consti
 tutional amendment or by a
 legislative enact ment you can
 add one single hour of
 slavery to any human being
 on any pot of tho
 earth which God s sun
 visits Again sir as to
 the New Mexican project I
 say that it necessarily cheats
 one side or the other
 f must use good bold
 English in regard to this
 matter or I shall not
 talk about it as understand
 slave State yet nobody can
 deny the fact that it
 is offered to the South
 as a concession a yielding
 to them Of the Territories
 of New Mexico and Ari
 zona The people of the
 slave States will so un
 derstand it If they can
 be deceived in regard to
 the purposes of the Republican
 party spread out as they
 are in the sun so
 that the wayfaring man though
 a fool need not err
 in regard to them if
 they can be made to
 believe that we are to
 assail then institutions by Federal
 legislatioR that we are to
 attack them within the boundaries
 of the States ask if
 they are not compelled to
 believe when you offer this
 to them asa measure of
 peace that they are to
 have it as a slave
 State for their property to
 go to for them to
 establish their in stitutions in
 and yet you will go
 home to the North and
 say that aithough we have
 yielded what they demanded on
 the subject of slavery in
 the Territories by allowing them
 io bring in a State
 already Inarkcd for slavery by
 an inhuman code such as
 few other States can show
 although vve had been derived
 upon one side it was
 remorse I have done this
 although we have consented that
 a State may come into
 the Confederacy without sufficient population
 without the means of carry
 ing on a State government
 at all yet we did
 it for the purpose of
 deceiving the Sputh and letting
 them imagine thata tub was
 thrown to the whale when
 after all we meant it
 as a gilded and barbed
 hook 1 do not believe
 in such legislation as this
 i do not believe it
 is honest I do not
 believe it is fair I
 do not belicvc you can
 justify yourselves in the face
 of an honest con stituency
 for offering a measure of
 this kind as a measure
 of peace Why you know
 that whenever this State comes
 here with a free constitution
 and is admitted as a
 State you will be reproached
 for your perfidy and you
 cannot stand up in the
 face of outraged southern constituencies
 and say we did not
 in tend to deceive you
 in this matter It is
 impos siblc that any honest
 man should do it Again
 I am opposed to this
 measure because I do not
 desire to sec a competition
 for New Mex ico between
 the free and the slave
 powers of this Confederacy I
 do not desire to see
 again re peatcd upon this
 continent the fraud and force
 and corruption of Kansas the
 strife of emigration armed contentious
 vindictive and sectional But it
 is said that it is
 only a small sacrifice 0111
 y two hundred and forty
 thousand square miles which this
 barbarous code of New Mexico
 covers which enables a mun
 only over that small area
 I to scourc o and
 stripe labor and wring from
 it unrequited toil and it
 is very poor land at
 that Why sir I care
 not if instead of twenty
 four there was but a
 si ngle slave upon that
 soil never would consent to
 the admission of that State
 until those barbarous laws were
 repealed I nevcr would consent
 to it under any supposed
 obliga tion under tbc orcranic
 act of 1850 or any
 compact anywhere I say that
 New Mexico should come I
 this Congress or whatever Congress
 she approaches for admission as
 other States come and when
 she con rs she shall
 be tricd upon her merits
 If she is found wanting
 in any of the particu
 lars which were so pertinaciously
 required of Kansas she shall
 not have admission to this
 Union by ny vote or
 rny influence And yet we
 are cntreat ed to yield
 this small Territory to sla
 very and to settle this
 question upon that basis Commerce
 approaches us and takes us
 upon a very high hill
 and shows us these broad
 and splendid fields of cotton
 with their rivulets of silver
 and the golden sunsets beyond
 and asks us if wo
 cannot givc even this boon
 to satisfy the South Commerce
 would say Cheat the South
 if you will but get
 the bill passed and the
 Union saved and then start
 your emigration societies and your
 nneans for making it what
 you avow it is your
 design to make it here
 on this floor a free
 State But I must pass
 frorn this topic I am
 opposed to compromise because I
 believe the complaints as staled
 by the members of this
 committee to have becn brought
 beföre them are utterly groundless
 and thc proposed remedies puerile
 It does not touch the
 matter in controversy And here
 my learned friend from Massachusetts
 Mr ADAMS witl pardon me
 for saying that I have
 read with great interest his
 historical parallel to show that
 it It is offered if
 the committee mean anything a
 strong and proud nation should
 not despise even as a
 compromise as a cvcession and
 although I trivial and groundless
 complaints I do not so
 men may stand up in
 their places and say that
 I read the history of
 the Revolution of our fathers
 1 do not understand that
 they went to war upon
 they think New Mexico svill
 be a free tale that
 t hey think it Mill
 not come into the nion
 asa trivial and groundless complaints
 I do not un derstand
 that that great contest was
 a mere con test about
 a three cent duty on
 tea or a stamp upon
 paper or a duty imposed
 upon window glass but I
 do understand it to have
 been a con test for
 a great principle going to
 the very foun dation of
 organized civil society understand that
 the Parliament of Great Britain
 asserted the right in all
 cases whatsoever to tax or
 in other words to legislate
 for the colonies and this
 with out any representation upon
 their part and that they
 irnbucd with the true principles
 of Englis h liberty the
 principle which established the right
 of revolution at home which
 led them abroad to Holland
 and again across the trackless
 waste of waters to this
 country contended for the ever
 living principle of freedom that
 taxation should be accompanied in
 all cases by representation that
 they contended for that principle
 and that submission to laws
 among freemen implied a voice
 in their enactment There is
 no lesson in history which
 teaches that compromise or concession
 to the groundless demands or
 complaints of equat States not
 only fully represented but with
 more than an equal representations
 based not only on persons
 but upon their propertso and
 who have exercised throughout all
 our history to the pres
 ent time a controlling influence
 upon our legisla tion and
 upon the foreign and domestic
 policy of the Government are
 to be dignified by a
 compar ison with the complaints
 of an oppressed people who
 were denied all representation by
 those who sought to govern
 them But we are told
 that the great Lord Chancellor
 of England The greatest meanest
 of mankind advised yielding something
 to discontentments Now I think
 with all due deference to
 superior learning that he never
 advised yielding to insolent demands
 from a discontented people nor
 yet to change the British
 constitution and laws to re
 move discontentments föunded on no
 possible rightful complaints I hardly
 think that at this day
 you will find a British
 statesman of approved sense and
 wisdom who would advise concession
 a change in the time
 honored constitution and a reconstruction
 in their laws bccause thc
 clans of Scotland asserting their
 ancient independence should again rally
 on their mountains and come
 down with anns to demand
 guarantees for rights which nobody
 threatened relief from laws by
 which nobody was oppressed and
 security against events which it
 was perfiwtly impossible should ever
 happen Dut sir I am
 profoundly impressed with the wisdom
 of the saying that the
 surest way to prevent sedition
 if the times do bear
 it is to take away
 the matter of it f
 ör if there bo fuel
 pre d it is hard
 to tell whence the spark
 shall e that shall set
 it on fire Tell me
 whence comes the spark which
 has set this country in
 a blaze What is the
 matter of sedition in our
 day that should be removed
 if the times do bear
 it What is there beyond
 these trivial and groundless complaints
 beyond these discontents that appear
 on the surface What is
 there in this country which
 is always a magazine not
 merely of prepared fuel but
 of the dryest powder which
 a single spark might explode
 to thc destruction of this
 whole Confederacy What is it
 that in the whole course
 of our history has alone
 threat cned the liberty the
 Union the prosperity of this
 country What is it that
 in 1811 nay before that
 and in 1820 in 1832
 in 1850 in 1860 has
 been perpetually threatening the liberties
 of this country Does anybody
 wait fbr an answer Does
 anybody desire to know to
 what I point It is
 the institution of slavery inwrought
 into the very framework of
 our Gove rnment covering wi
 lh a black pall nearly
 one half of this Confederacy
 jealous of its rights inflammable
 unreasonable easily excited with cause
 or without No sir we
 need fear no foreign war
 We need fear no aggression
 from without The armies of
 the world may invade us
 Our fortifications may be in
 the hands of the traitors
 who have now wrenched them
 from the Federal Government they
 maybe sunk in the sea
 with our ships and yet
 so long as the red
 school house stands on our
 hills we are invincible unconquerable
 by any for eign force
 or any foreign element of
 power that may be brought
 against us But what is
 it that rupting the very
 life blood of the Confederacy
 Need 1 answer acrain it
 is that accursed institu 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 797 tion
 of slavery which in all
 time has been and in
 all time to cornc will
 bc a perpetual weakness a
 disgrace a calamity Now sir
 this is the disease with
 which we have to deal
 It is not a case
 for the placebos of the
 com mittee of thirty three
 nor yet for the small
 pills of Hahnemann nor for
 the bleeding and warm water
 of Dr Sangrado It isa
 case for surgery I am
 not now to speak of
 slavery as I look on
 it as an institution of
 barbarism 1 am not to
 speak of it as my
 people regard it not Vo
 speak of it as all
 historians describe it as all
 poets sing of it as
 all moralists and philosophers teach
 about it as all philanthropists
 look upon it I merely
 wish to speak ofitas a
 poli ticak power in this
 Confederacy It is a great
 power Whenever any of its
 real or supposed interests are
 affected it rallies around it
 the Represen tati ves and
 Senators of fifteen States as
 one man It scents danger
 in the tainted breeze It
 is unwearied in its vigilance
 unrelentinø in its it has
 controlled the politics of this
 purpose country for six ty
 years and more and now
 when its political encroachments and
 unreasonable de mands have rallied
 the North against it and
 when the census with unerring
 finger points to the end
 of its political power and
 influence it breaks out into
 rebellion and violence it would
 usurp the Government by force
 and overridö the expressed will
 of the people by terror
 and bloodshed In several of
 the States it is a
 settled policy to make this
 institution perpetual There is no
 diligent student of the history
 of the time but knol
 vs that when the Constitution
 was formed it was the
 intention of its fran iers
 that that institution should in
 a reasonable time be abol
 ished by the voluntary action
 of the people of the
 States Six States performed their
 duty in regard to it
 by adopting schemes of gradual
 emancipa tion And now because
 it is profitable because it
 is a source of political
 power bccausc it is thing
 to which politicians may address
 their ap peals in an
 inflamed and excited community a
 in ten Lion a nd
 spirit of change has come
 over the the country and
 this institution is to be
 made per It insists not
 only on tolerance not only
 petual that we shall leave
 it within the limits of
 the States untouched but it
 insists on universal assent to
 its rightfulness and on constitutional
 recognition and protection Grant this
 and who does not know
 that its next step will
 be to demand the reopenino
 of the slave trade And
 rightfully because if it is
 just in itself if you
 have a moral and political
 right to hold slaves you
 have a right to a
 supply tection of the Governmcnt
 in the vast Territories the
 forcible seizure and Subjugation of
 which is now contemplated If
 an adjustment is effected upon
 the basis of this committee
 s report it will not
 stand year against the threatened
 piracy plunder privateer ing the
 renewal of the slave trade
 and the seizure ofadjacent States
 which is contemplated The policy
 and aims of slavery its
 institutions and civilization and the
 character of its people are
 ull at variancc with the
 policy aims institu tions education
 and character of the North
 There is an irreconcilable difference
 in our inter ests institutions
 and pursuits in our sentiments
 and feelings No truth is
 more apparent than this that
 this Government cannot permanently remain
 half slave and half free
 The idea of a temporary
 separation and a permanent recon
 struction is visionary and foolish
 Whenever the slave States of
 this Confederacy shall be ac
 knowledged by this Government to
 be rightfully separated from their
 allegiance that separation Cl he
 North stands will bc final
 and permanent ready while they
 are in the Union to
 perform its constitutional obligations but
 let them once be acknowledged
 to be free from those
 constitutional obligations to be separated
 from their relations as States
 within a cmnmon Confederacy and
 you cannot find school district
 within the North that will
 ever consent to a reconst
 ruct ion of this Gov
 ernment upon any such basis
 of the representa tion of
 property as is now permitted
 in this I louse upon
 the part of the slaveholding
 States Nay you cannot find
 any district which would consent
 to admit such a State
 at all unless with a
 full provision for the speedy
 emancipation of its slaves If
 gentlemen choose to try the
 experiment upon that basis the
 quicker they go about it
 the bet ter it wili
 suit the Representatives of a
 great pro portion of the
 inhabitants of the North am
 satis But sir I must
 hasten to a close fied
 that thc experiment ofa perpetual
 Unio n be tween free
 and slave States under a
 republican Government is a fåilure
 You may tinker it you
 nmy patch it you may
 doctor it you may turn
 it over to a council
 of politicians or a coun
 cil of physicians it will
 come back to the same
 position that there is an
 irreconcilable difference between froe and
 slave institutions and if States
 that maintain both systems rernain
 under the same Government one
 oi the other must yield
 Now how do propose to
 settle this matter Because I
 go not for concession or
 comprolnisc I go for settl
 cjnent that shall be final
 tbat shall of that labor
 from any source open to
 your reach leavc each to
 pursue its own policy without
 the and the slave trade
 will be as it has
 already been interference or clashing
 of hostile interests It will
 justified on the rostrum and
 in the pulpit the first
 place I shall insist as
 a prelimintu y be demanded
 as a just tribute to
 the progress of step if
 it shall take generations to
 accomplish it Christianity and the
 enlightened influence of the age
 that laws barbarous obsolete criminal
 laws I that the Constitution
 and laws musl be restored
 to their integrity and the
 rebel States to obedience Ldeclaring
 this just commerce piracy shall
 be rc pealed and the
 slave traders shall again sit
 among I We will put
 our laws upon a foot
 ing where they the merchant
 princes as tho honorable of
 the earth and thc blessing
 of Heaven will be pronounced
 each returning Sabbath on the
 sails of the pirate as
 on the sails of all
 others who go down to
 the sea in ships Xu
 y alittlc further As frec
 opinions and their exponents free
 speech and free press are
 incon sistent with it as
 it suppresses them at home
 by t he cord or
 by fire so it demands
 through the committee of thirty
 three their suppression as with
 intent to subvert thc institutions
 of another State V cry
 careful and slow in its
 approaches and now for thc
 first time receiviY 0 lecrislative
 countenance freedom of the press
 is to be put down
 But I must pass along
 x his institution as I
 have described it has twenty
 Representatives on this floor of
 its property or should have
 if the v had not
 bas qy fled from their
 trust and abandoneil their seats
 here to establish treason against
 the It should Government in
 their several States have twenty
 Representatives upon this floor of
 its property and this inequality
 it will necessarily I carry
 into any territory it may
 acquire and bring in as
 a slave State You cannot
 admit New Mex ico as
 a State without admitting her
 with fhisin equality It has
 but six of the thirteen
 original States all the rost
 have as I have said
 in accord ance with the
 scntiment existinry at tho formation
 of the Government and the
 implied understanding npon which the
 Constitution was agreed to eman
 cipated those slaves Yet it
 has increased its numbers to
 fifteen and it novv demands
 thc pto i shall be
 executed we will have the
 property that has been wrenched
 from us by rebellion and
 robbery We will have the
 forts we will have the
 arsenals we will have the
 hospitals we will have the
 mints and the vessels which
 treachery has betrayed to our
 enemies W o will have
 everything that belongs to us
 and the old status fully
 restored and then we will
 have a settle ment of
 this controversy How I would
 con sent that all the
 slave States with contiguous ter
 ritory which desire to makc
 slavery perpetual should go into
 a separato Confederacy peaceably and
 quietly with the full consent
 of all partics in Lhe
 Government they should assunu their
 just share of the public
 liabilities they should have lirnits
 such public propertv as lies
 within their not by the
 necessities of our condition If
 any of the Slavo States
 choose to remain vvould provide
 that the Federal Government should
 make full and fair compensation
 for their slaves with thc
 condition of gradual emancipa If
 no tion and their colonization
 if need be slave State
 chose to runain I would
 Ilicn amend the Constitution so
 that no slave State should
 would then over be admitted
 into the Union provide for
 the freedorn of all the
 avenues ofcom merce and especially
 for the froe and unob
 strucf ed mvigation of the
 Mississippi river The right of
 search should not be driven
 from the ocean to bc
 reéstal lisbcd upon the banks
 of the Mississippi would retain
 such fortresses and ened pi
 racy or privateering by an
 y Po Weron ea th
 These two civilizations might then
 start peaceably on theii several
 careers of generous rivalry And
 permit me to say that
 if the Union is destroyed
 the world will soon comprehend
 the difference between a compact
 nation of educated free and
 self dependent citizens and a
 community of lent and insolent
 proprietors of land living in
 hourly dread ofa herd of
 slaves I need not stop
 to speak of the glory
 of the northern empire with
 its capital upon the great
 lakes with a ship canal
 from the Mississippi to the
 ocean with improved rivers harbors
 and roads with all the
 vast territories about her ready
 to rush into close alliance
 with a nation which has
 shown that it dared to
 be just and has freed
 itself from an institution which
 alone has excluded it from
 national sympathy And I need
 not point If the success
 of the to the other
 experiment cotton dynasty fulfills the
 expectations of the prophets and
 seers who have talked to
 us about it it will
 be the first nation on
 the face of God s
 earth that was ever established
 with its founda tions broad
 and deep in inhumanity and
 injustice which has prospered and
 whose disgraceful and ignominious history
 has not been written from
 its commencement to its close
 But the Represent ativcs of
 the seceded States talk about
 withhold hog their cotton until
 they bring France and Eng
 land on their knees as
 suppliants praying for an alliance
 with them Sir the failure
 of an Amer ican supply
 of cotton is a contingency
 which has been long looked
 forward to in England and
 care fully guarded against Lord
 John Russell in letter to
 the Manchester Cotton Supply Associa
 tion has pointed to this
 precise event and the remedies
 proposed In view of that
 fact China has recently been
 opened by British and French
 arms and negotiation India also
 produces abun dant cotton Australia
 with a much longer sea
 son produces as good an
 article as you can grow
 on your sea islands In
 Africa and Central Amer ica
 cotton is an indigenous plant
 It grows with out labor
 and they are capable of
 affording an inexhaustible supply of
 the article In the North
 we shall try to get
 along with such a substitute
 as nature affords us Flax
 of short fibre mixed with
 forty per cent of cotton
 can now be furnished to
 the cotton looms of New
 England at cight cents per
 pound and flax of long
 fibr0 when inverltion born of
 necessity has suc cecdcd in
 perfecting as she sooo will
 do a few littlc machincs
 already in the Patent Offce
 can bc furnished to the
 linen spinner ata much less
 price per pound And this
 article flax grows on every
 variety of soil and in
 every climate from Maine to
 Minnesota The manufacturing world long
 ago determined not much longer
 to be subject to the
 caprices of a slaveholding oligarchy
 whicl i they hate d
 and despised but whose cotton
 they had then found no
 substitute for And if I
 could procure no other suffcientsubstitute
 rather than submit to this
 tyrannous dictation of king cotton
 I would go back to
 the coStume of our first
 parents in the garden of
 Eden before t he fall
 An honorable gentleman from Virginia
 Mr GARNETT to show us
 I OW slavery strengthened and
 ennobled a people has referred
 us to histor ical examples
 He says that slavery prevailed
 in the mightiest and most
 cultivated empires of the Old
 World and was the source
 of their strength I knDw
 that slavery existed bot h
 in Athens and Rome And
 thc same history bae taught
 us that the Athenians soon
 lost the hardy virtues of
 their early life and became
 cruel unjust effeminate all d
 corrupt that t hey drove
 Pericles into exile for his
 justice and poisoned Socrates for
 his wis dom and virtue
 and became soon the prey
 of the spoiler and the
 petty province of a stronger
 and more barbarous despotism If
 I have read history aright
 it w as not the
 luxurious and effcminate Roman of
 the later and slaveholding empire
 who bore the unconquered eagles
 over the burnino sands of
 Lybia and the frozcn rco
 ions of the North but
 the hardy indus trious virtuous
 Roman of the brave days
 of old and the slaveholder
 has read Roman history to
 little profit who has forgotten
 that a Thracian gladiator at
 the head of sixty thousand
 slaves slaughtered the mightiest armies
 of Rome drivinsc back consul
 after consul in defeat and
 disgrace and threatened with his
 victorious arms the very that

 slavery question ible not on
 v to my constituents and
 t my I and I
 have never seen the necessity
 for the intense country but
 to my God for my
 acts h c and excitement
 which has prevailed I believe
 that elsewhere in the oro
 anization of this Government it
 was There is not a
 Inan here or in thö
 country w ao i distinctly
 understood that the extension of
 slavery feels the importance of
 the times more than I
 do was to be suppréssed
 That was the rule adopted
 II There is no man
 in the country that has
 greater in the early history
 of the country and we
 never reason for attachment to
 this country than I have
 had any diffculty on the
 subject until 1820 NO 1
 am one of the oldest
 men in the House of
 Rep one ever doubted the
 right of Congress to govern
 I went into the wilderness
 when I resentatives the territory
 northwest of the Ohio river
 It is wasa boy less
 than six years of age
 and in that the departure
 from the practice of our
 ancestors Territory where there were
 then but twenty five the
 intermeddling with the provisions of
 the Con or thirty thousand
 inflabitants there are now more
 stitution by adopting ccnnpromises that
 has than nine million people
 I have probably wit brouz
 ht us into our present
 condition nessed as great physical
 improvements in the What in
 the name of God did
 we establish the country as
 any man will ever live
 to see I mean Constitution
 for if tho Inonu nt
 wegetinto a fever in the
 physical developments and resourccs of
 the ish and excited stat
 e the present sve aban
 country was brougl lt up
 from the cradie to don
 it and make platformsand planks
 on which we look pon
 the Government of United States
 may crawl out of these
 difficulties Suppose the and the
 Union of the States as
 of the uttnost im Legislature
 caned touether under the constitution
 portance to the people under
 it I have believed of
 a State to make laws
 were to say to the
 people until within a few
 months that it was strong
 and you are supren 0
 we will just let you
 do as you that there
 was no party and no
 set oc nwn that I
 please and every time you
 have any difficulty would be
 able to break it down
 in this age and we
 will give you a ccn
 nproraise would you be quent
 language that the country is
 in danger and that we
 have no right to inquire
 what has caused the diffculty
 but that we must cure
 it Now that is very
 good logic if it is
 logically applied but it will
 not do to apply it
 in all cases I think
 It is important to know
 what diseases are before you
 begin to doctor them I
 believe that physi cians always
 attempt to ascertain what the
 com plaint is before they
 apply remedies they see whether
 the body wants depletion or
 stimulants I hat is not
 the rule here and I
 do not wonder that we
 are asked not to look
 on the causes ofour troubles
 It I had been guilty
 of breaking down the Government
 white I had control of
 it I should not want
 my conduct to be looked
 into and inves tigated There
 is another party represented here
 for which I have high
 respect that is the party
 rep I r senting the
 border States I want talk
 re spectfully to every one
 I would not be guilty
 of intensif9ing the feeling that
 exists or of mocking at
 any of the whininos or
 weepings that may grow out
 of it But ask is
 it not a most extraor
 dinary state of things that
 a party which has not
 yet got possession of the
 Government should be so remarked
 more than a year acro
 in this Cay willino to
 live under a government under
 which called upon to settle
 the difficulties of the country
 itol but to n y
 astonishinent I see now what
 I life and property had
 no more security than that
 i ask my friends from
 the border States whether supposed
 would require centuries to bring
 about which lepends upon capricc
 and the excitement that is
 not asking too much Suppose
 Mr Bell in this Government
 I have seen that species
 and of the nunnent No
 Inan can enter a government
 had been elected a man
 whom I esteem highly degree
 of wickedness and corruption growing
 up some of his individual
 rights though I did not
 vote for him and suppose
 my in this and mighty
 country which few Gov to
 the public interest and he
 is very well paid let
 party had corjspired to prevent
 his inauguration ernments have ever
 before witnessed and I in
 I me teli you if
 he has the laws properly
 and fully tend in my
 remarks to endeavor to trace
 the executed Now I say
 that there is no question
 causes which have produced the
 present state of now before
 the country which cannot be
 better things in the country
 I shall not aim it
 would be settled by the
 Constitution and the constitution nonsensical
 for me to aim to
 dcpict these causes ally organized
 courts than by anything we
 can do wit l t
 anything like eloquence Public speaking
 in this body has not
 been the habit of 1M
 y life I have been
 Now sir I believe that
 a great deal that has
 accustomed to look with interest
 upon bhe con been said
 here srnce 1 have been
 in Congress has structions which
 have been put upon the
 admin done more harrn than
 good I believe that if
 you istration of the Government
 of my country I would
 leave this quosiion to day
 to the people was raised
 to believe that an honest
 administra they would settle it
 much quicker than we can
 do tion of this Government
 was of more importance it
 by attemptine to legislate upon
 t le subject But look
 Mr Speaker at the peculiar
 and to the people than
 any other thing rhet e
 never was u difficulty between
 private extraordinary position of the
 country on this im individuals
 and there never wasa neighborhood
 I i portanl question llcre
 is the party known as
 the Republican party I ask
 you whether that county State
 or national quarrel in which
 tbe true causes which produced
 it were not almost always
 party has ever had any
 power to control this kept
 out of sight You will
 find that when the Government
 J ask you if they
 have ever been feelings get
 erllisted and become alienated every
 able to pass a solitary
 law in the Congress of
 the do you think that
 I would go with them
 in such i a movement
 Notat all ask gentlemen from
 the border States to chanæe
 their course on this subject
 and address themselves to their
 own peo ple with the
 eloquence and feeling that they
 have displayed here during this
 session Tell them that this
 secession is nothing short of
 the blackest trea I son
 and that you are not
 to be forced into treason
 Ill at is the way
 I talk to them I
 do not let syc ophants
 and demagoøues and traitors drive
 me and my people into
 their arms I ask you
 again if you have anything
 to com plain of for
 which you cannot find a
 remedy in the Constitution Complaints
 are made about personal liberty
 bills and not enforcing the
 fugi tive slave law If
 there were no foolish or
 wicked people in the world
 we would never want Con
 stitutions or laws either The
 man who helps to make
 laws and expects they will
 never be vio pretext is
 seized upon to heighten to
 extend I United States I
 ask you if the Government
 has lated must be a
 very green kind to intensify
 the interest of the people
 That is not been in
 hands of the self constituted
 Demo how easy it is
 to create fuss and excitement
 in cratic party a conservative
 party if you please communities
 The party that has had
 control of precisely the case
 now in this countrv but
 there not a question of
 difference now between the Now
 what condition do we find
 the Government the Government for
 years has no other object
 in North and the South
 which could not be settled
 in Prostrate at the feet
 of traitors and the first
 E view now in seceding
 and breaking up the Union
 without difficulty if you would
 take the ordinary I thing
 we find on our arrival
 here isa demand for than
 to get control of the
 Government again concessions from that
 party which has never had
 Some of the leaders of
 that movernent arc dis course
 you pursue to settle difficulties
 between in dividuuls when they
 comc if conflict You have
 powcr and has nothing to
 concede and at the nuo
 tinguished and gallant men They
 have repeated a constitutional Government
 which as I have told
 ment thcsc concessions are demanded
 the traitors for years past
 that whenever they should lose
 the you I have learned
 to admire so much But
 bas who make the demand
 and their accomp ices are
 control of the Government they
 would break it the constitutional
 power of this Governmentcver rl
 hey have gone out and
 I can understand seizing the
 forts custom houses and pu
 blic prop up yct been
 resorted to to settle any
 question of diff crty of
 the country to be converted
 to their own as well
 as I can understand any
 other fact that cutty which
 has arisen in this country
 The they havc gone out
 witli the idea that if
 they can hellish usps Constitution
 has been been kept out
 ofsight and Mr Speaker when
 I talked to my people
 last OITly draw every slave
 State with them they will
 instead you have made new
 cornpronuses and fall I pointed
 out to thcrn the danger
 of parties build up a
 southern empire Chey expect to
 be concessions What has been
 the consequence of I told
 them not to fix their
 eyes upon any patty great
 rnen in the proposed confederacy
 that coursc Now this slavery
 question which because all tl
 10 parties of this coun
 Now I will tell you
 where we have been all
 in is called so almighty
 in this country would be
 I E try have becotne
 corrupt and I always say
 it fault and it is
 a most iknportant thirBr for
 us to found to have
 nothing in it to any
 extcl t you I with
 shame I do not believe
 that there has ever consider
 I have almost trembled when
 I have can push it
 if you would only pursue
 in relation been a rnorc
 corrupt Government upon the face
 thought of the consequences to
 the country grow to it
 the course von pursue in
 reference to set of the
 earth than this Government has
 been under ino out of
 one of the greatest abuses
 and one of tling ordinary
 individual differences But unfor I
 do the most uncalled for
 abuses that have ever the
 administration ot the last eight
 years If slaverv were to
 be removed ten thou not
 believe that there has been
 a Government on known tunately
 for tl fis country it
 has become a political earth
 that has had less regard
 to the general good sand
 miles from this country the
 Government clement and the atmosphere
 of the politics of this
 country is at this time
 as corrupt as corruption than
 this Government has had during
 the last would stil sink
 in its own infåmy unless
 its pol i eieht years
 of its administration man icy
 in the rnatter ofexpenditurcs be
 chaüged Let can make it
 I will now sir say
 a few words in reference
 to judges impartialiy can doubt
 this for a moment us
 just reason the case Cllhirtv
 seven years ago Look at
 the result and see what
 is before you when i
 left the county of Franklin
 the ordinary this delicate question
 of the admission of Terri
 tories as States There is
 not under anybody s When
 this Congress met found an
 Execu li expenses of the
 State of Ohio were 75
 000 Now construction of the
 Constitution a single difficulty tive
 here sworn to support the
 Constitution and the people of
 Ohio are taxed 10 000
 000 a yeo r that
 can arise between those who
 wish to bring especially to
 see to the execution of
 the laws YVhat do yon
 find in the States and
 even in the 800 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 7 counties
 and townships You find a
 rush of peo pie for
 ofice people who would like
 to live with out labor
 And this great element of
 evil in the country is
 not even hinted at There
 is not ade partment of
 this Government to day that
 is not expending more than
 double the arnourlt that is
 necessary to have its business
 faithfully per formed You are
 multiplying from yearto year and
 from month tfmonth the number
 of em ployés and are
 at the same time increasing
 their compensation Recollect that these
 expenditures are abstracted from the
 labor of the country But
 we are cheated by demagogues
 and politi cians When a
 rnan comes to me and
 begins to tell me how
 religious he is I take
 it at once that he
 is a hypocrite If another
 comes an d tolls me
 he is a vei y
 honest man I Will watch
 him And when a man
 says he loves the people
 rnost ax V fully I
 regard him as a demagogue
 and a dema gogue is
 no better tl lan a
 horSe thief That is my
 conception of this thing Now
 I ask you to go
 to work like honest men
 North and South and put
 down these demaff0ffues Strike right
 at them and tell them
 they are villains Tell your
 neigh bors that these men
 are villains and that they
 are trying to ruin the
 country is tho way to
 talk about them That is
 the way I will talk
 and Ido not want to
 see a drop of blood
 shed aet in this conflict
 1 am not much ofa
 warrior and do not want
 to indulge in bravado The
 expenditures of the Goternment are
 over seventy lil lion dollars
 year r l lie moment
 the party that controlled the
 patronage of the Gov ernment
 saw the handwriting on the
 wall then they becra n
 to threaten secession Tl hey
 threat ened to up the
 Government and then to go
 I wish Some learned man
 for a reconstruction would tell
 mc the distinction between treason
 and secession for confess I
 cannot see that any such
 distinction exists Mr Speaker there
 is a great deal of
 importance attached to this question
 and there _is very good
 It is an important question
 but reason for it we
 are not staring that question
 fairly in the face The
 first thing that this Congt
 éss should lave done when
 it assembled last l ecember
 was to require the party
 in power to answer to
 the coun try for their
 conduct We should not have
 allowed ourselves to be d
 rawn out of the line
 of ou r duty for
 the purpose of pacifying these
 traitors gen tlemcn from the
 border States would talk as
 the gentleman from Maryland Mr
 DA VIS did to day
 two weeks vould not elapse
 ufit il these trai Ele
 said tors would be trembling
 in their shoes that he
 would meet revolution with revolution
 If the men were only
 met with a proper spirit
 they would bc etisily put
 down for men arc never
 brave when they are cno
 agcd in a bad cause
 Now L return to tho
 colisideration of the coun I
 havo been pay try ih
 regard to expenditures ino some
 attention to this thing and
 I ask gentle men w
 f 0 are cx pectil
 lo to have retrenchment and
 reföz m in the Govern
 illcnt to look at it
 Walking founded upon principle Every
 principle has its law and
 when any man violates that
 law he must It is
 a law in Govern take
 the consequences ments as in
 plants that the greater the
 rapidity with which they grow
 into maturity the Sooner will
 t hey go to destruction
 That Government is most stable
 and enduring which commences with
 the practice of economy and
 which is builtup with labor
 Such a Government cannot boast
 of mag nificenco but it
 will be one of much
 greater en durance than one
 Which has been built up
 in magnificence The progress of
 Governments is precisely like that
 of men They first seek
 and are satisfied with the
 necessaries of life then the
 conveniences of life then the
 luxuries of life and then
 thc magnificencies of life Every
 Govern ment which E uns
 to extravagance with the rapid
 ity with which this Government
 has gone on will soon
 become so corrupt that like
 many of the Governments of
 the Old World it can
 only be maintained by force
 of arms Such has been
 the history of many of
 the despotisms of the Old
 World Mr Speaker I will
 now proceed to another sub
 jöct not a new one
 by any means but connected
 with the onc I have
 been discussing have in i
 timated what my views are
 upon the subject of slavery
 It never should have been
 the subject of so much
 contention Why I ask you
 is it necessary for a
 Territory whick when it comes
 to form a State government
 must be left to its
 own discretion as to what
 it shall be and what
 it shall have to be
 made the subject of contention
 and controversy If we had
 never made any com promises
 gentletnen would see that there
 would ncvcr have been any
 broken compromises Mr Speaker in
 my judgment all the diffeul
 ties which now environ the
 country have grown out of
 the evasion and failure on
 the part of Con gress
 to perform its proper duties
 The Congress of the United
 States when the Constitution has
 established the mode and manner
 by which a question is
 to be settled has no
 business what If you want
 to make a ever with
 that question change in your
 Government rnake it by chanffino
 the Constitution Bull ask you
 and I ask the coun
 try hethcr the people of
 this nation are at this
 time in the proper spirit
 to ell ter upon the
 work of remodeling Chis most
 sacred and time honored I
 submit to you that this
 is no time to the
 work of patching up thc
 Con stitution I he very
 moment you commence to mend
 it you begin to make
 it ragged I do not
 care bow in reniously the
 work is lone fl he
 very i attempt to mend
 wears the fabric oftentimes anu
 does more injury than it
 would I Y lettincr look
 upon tho Constitution as too
 it alone sacred an instrumcnt
 to he ligl l t
 y tampered with I look
 with no favor upon any
 proposed amend ll ent to
 the Constitution and am now
 especially averse to it when
 there is no question at
 issue that cannot be settled
 if gentlemen l vould only
 bril k their feelings to
 t_hose of reasonable men herc

 It shows its face ull

 mere sample of what is
 designed Oh ME Speaker I
 wish to God I wish
 from tl lé bottom of
 rny soul that we could
 take going on in the
 country Statesmen and scholars are
 very likely to look this
 people back to the condition
 in which they over the
 hea ls of the masscs
 of the world They were
 when this unfortunate agitation connuenced
 the agitation of the proposition
 to destroy the arc for
 science literature und the arts
 for mao nificence That is
 what tbcse gentlemen are now
 comprolY1ise made between the people
 of the North and the
 South upon this absorbing question
 Yes trying to bui d
 up a southern governtrnent for
 They clesire to build up
 a magnificent government sir would
 to God could induce to
 move They care backward to
 that point When Inen come
 before of which they can
 have the control their constituents
 and say they have made
 a solemn nothing rnQi e
 about the rnasses of the
 people or the ri crhts
 of mankind than do the
 nabobs of the compact which
 they have had the full
 benefit of North if you
 please and while they have
 anv and nowthatitis justabout to
 operate for the ben hope
 of success you can never
 remove the diff efitQf thc
 other to the compact and
 t hereföre cultieg that lic
 in the way of the
 pacification of they soize held
 ofa egal technicality and say
 that our troubles Sir slavery
 does not expand the they
 will violate all he stipulations
 of that com human heart
 You have got to i
 equirc every man pact and
 will regard it as null
 and void I say it
 to act well his part
 before you can ever secure
 is time that we should
 return back to the spirit
 Of any stability to the
 institutions of the counory the
 men who made the compact
 Let me tell you that
 good Governments are No one
 ever the right to take
 slaves into the Territories until
 the year 1847 Mr Calhoun
 then said in a resolution
 which he presented in the
 Senate of the United States
 that he believed they had
 that right The resolution was
 pre sented and after an
 elaborate discussion in the Senate
 by that able talented and
 I am willing to say
 good man it was brought
 to a vote and received
 the votes of four southern
 Senators and the vote of
 Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire
 And sir the vote of
 Mr Pierce upon that reso
 lution made him President of
 the United States He gave
 his vote with that of
 Mr Calhoun upon that abstract
 question and he was the
 oniy north ern Senator Who
 so voted When in the
 Balti more presidential nominating convention
 of 1852 you recollect at
 the close of a long
 struggle the conve ti was
 about to break up without
 making a nonu tior the
 Virginia delegation retired from the
 hall for the purpose of
 consultation Look ing to this
 vote they believed Mr Pierce
 was the very man to
 suit their purposes He was
 nominated he was elected and
 when he came in his
 inaugural address that he would
 not inter fcrc with the
 compromises that had been inade
 upon the subject of slavery
 only two years an l
 a half previous Yet he
 was scarcely well settled in
 the Whitc House before an
 attack was made upon the
 venerable compromise of 1820 Thus
 has the South advanced step
 by step in its progress
 of power Senator Hunter said
 a few years ago that
 when he came here in
 1854 there was a portion
 of the southern people who
 believed they had a right
 to carry then slaves into
 the Territories He was among
 that portion They found their
 northern friends vere not willing
 to accede to this doctrine
 but they were willing to
 repeal the Missouri com promise
 for the purpose of allowing
 southern men to carry their
 slaves north of the line
 of 360 30 Then the
 tempter came They swept away
 that time honored compact and
 look at the con sequences
 I here is not a
 Democrat now North or South
 who does not say the
 slaveholder has a right to
 carry his slave into any
 of the rl erritories of
 the Union Now when did
 they acquire that right Where
 is thcrc anything in the
 Constitu tion of the United
 States that guaranties that riffht
 VVho has ever attempted to
 find it up to this
 time T Ire next step
 very naturaliy followed They wanted
 Congress to protect their slave
 property in the Territories And
 if this Government holds together
 it will not be ten
 years before they de mand
 the right to carry their
 slaves anywhere they please within
 the limits of the Union
 Now sir f appoal again
 to gentlenoen of all parties
 to stand by this Government
 and not per It puts
 mit it to bc broken
 up by demacyoo ues rne
 in mind of the crises
 which sometimes occur in our
 monetary affairs and I have
 some very curious information on
 the subject which I have
 dcrivcd from conversations with merchants
 bank It occurred to me
 as passing ers and others
 strange that men in business
 never pay their debts when
 money is plenty and they
 can do so with ease
 And there is the point
 in this whole thing If
 inen would pay the II
 debts when Inoney is plenty
 there would bc no crises
 in the country Men never
 will pay their debts when
 Inoncy is plenty but put
 them off frmn day to
 day until tl lere is
 a stringer c y in
 the morie y mavket and
 money becdmcs valuable and then
 they are com pelted to
 pay while property of all
 kinds is de preciatcd and
 of course failure and serious
 em barrassment ensues Here is
 the secret Mr Speaker of
 thie bankruptcies that have from
 time Instead of caution to
 time startled our people and
 promptness there is a fast
 young America feeling which puslie
 s us into l he
 evils under which we labor
 Too many persons it appears
 to me are trying to
 live at the expense of
 some body else than themselves
 There is the great trouble
 If it were better known
 perhaps it would be remedied
 I will now say a
 few words on a subject
 that has been much discussed
 in this House I rnean
 slavery in the States where
 it is now established think
 those who know me Mr
 Speaker will ac knowledffe I
 have frankness and honesty enouslh
 to declare upon this and
 all other questions that which
 I believe Gentlemen from the
 South twain and again here
 and elscwhcrc allege that the
 North arc determined to interfere
 with slavery in the States

 THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS
 PUBLISHED BY JOHN C RIVES
 THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D SESSION
 men in the North on
 the question of slavery it
 would be ridiculous for me
 to deny but sir I
 do affirm here this day
 with uplifted hand in the
 presence of yourself and the
 House that never knew more
 than halfa dozen men in
 my district who believed that
 Congress had a right to
 inter fere with slavery in
 the States In the North
 so far as I know
 there is not and never
 has been any disposition to
 get your negroes amoncy us
 We have no desire to
 interfere with them All we
 want is what it was
 agreed that we should have
 We want that which was
 so ruthlessly torn from us
 You must know by this
 time how hard freemen are
 to be put down when
 they arise to assert their
 rights And now as the
 result of your past action
 you are reaping the fruits
 of the principle of popular
 sovereignty It has done more
 to curse this coun try
 and its politics than anything
 else It came here in
 the guise of great love
 for the people Never before
 had one word been said
 about the governments of the
 Territories All had gone on
 smoothly and peaceably until tho
 advent of pop ular sovereignty
 I defy any man here
 or else where to put
 his finger on an instance
 where com plaint was justly
 made against the government of
 the Territories Popular sovereignty was
 founded upon a pretext and
 upon pretexts I Know parties
 often live and thrive There
 is another great curse to
 this country I which ought
 to be eradicated and that
 is the con tinual construction
 of party platforms They have
 done not a little toward
 the subversion of this I
 have no respect for party
 plat Government forms I spit
 upon them Cries of Good
 How mortifying it is when
 members in this House and
 in the Senate get up
 to discuss great questions of
 Goverument to hear them parleying
 about this and the other
 platform made by designing dema
 I never read the Chicago
 platform the gogues Baltimore platform
 or the Charleston platform and
 I do not care to
 I do not bother myself
 with them any more than
 with these compromises for the
 reason that I have a
 good old Constitution made by
 our fathers and which justly
 deals by all sections of
 the Union For God s
 sake Mr Speaker I implore
 the House to let that
 covenant It is a noble
 work alone A MEMBER Then
 you ought to have gone
 for Bell for he had
 the Constitution for his platform
 Mr CARE Y He is
 a great statesman and I
 1is oppo has had niy
 esteem for many years sition
 to the passage of the
 Kansas Nebraska act and thc
 repeal of the Missouri compromise
 did I preserve his speech
 on the him much honor
 occasion as a text from
 which many good ser mons
 could be preached pertinent to
 the present condition of the
 country Now sir I feel
 disposed to be plain and
 out spoken I am willing
 to have guarantied to every
 man in the United States
 all the rights that he
 is I am willirv entitled
 to under the Constitution to
 go to great lencths for
 conciliation and peace But do
 not ask me I pray
 you to violate the Constitution
 of the United States I
 cannot do it I dare
 not do what I have
 sworn to support it i
 know to be wrong for
 I should not only lose
 my own self respect but
 the respect and approvftl I
 care nothing for party of
 my fellow citizens dictation and
 will do whatever I cab
 constitu tionally to meet the
 demands made upon us on
 the part of the South
 I never anywhere voted for
 anything because it was a
 party measure It must SATURDAY
 FEBRUARY 9 1861 ity and
 the happiness of millions of
 people The lust of offce
 is the passion that drives
 the dis unionists to treason
 against the Government They would
 rule or ruin but Mr
 Speaker if we are true
 to ourselves they will do
 neither the one nor the
 other Stand firmly upon the
 Con stitution exercising all the
 powers its grants hnd yielding
 all the rights it conf
 rs and in ten years
 the race of demagogues and
 traitors will become extinct in
 our Inidst I know thm
 e are thousands talkinrr of
 breaking up this Union in
 order that it may be
 recon strutted It is in
 my judzment moonshihe to think
 of a recohstrucuon after the
 Union is once shattered into
 fragments You may rest assured
 of this I know too
 that a great effort is
 made to de moralize the
 Republican party to induce them
 to follow a course Lbat
 will destroy them Where has
 the Republican party done an
 unconstitutional act It cannot be
 pointed out I would never
 interfere with slavery in the
 District of Columbia while slavery
 existed in the neighboring States
 01 without the consent of
 the people here The northern
 people are disposed to deal
 justly by you MI e
 have I know some extreme
 men in our midst who
 conscientiously differ from me I
 know we have a great
 many foolish men But you
 need not be sensitive Your
 rights cannot be assailed Let
 us talk frankly about these
 things and not like spunky
 boys Laughter W c spoil
 our men in their growth
 There are boys now who
 talk flippantly and k nour
 far more thun their fathers
 Some boys of fifteen pretend
 to knöw more tban those
 who in 1787 framed the
 Con stitution Yet if the
 Constitution were read to them
 they could not tell whether
 it really was the Constitution
 or something else Mr LEACH
 of North Carolina then ad
 dressed the House on the
 state of the Union His
 speech will be published in
 the Appendix Mr JUNKIN Mr
 Speaker 1 not for the
 purpose of making a speech
 I do not know that
 I have anything to offer
 upon the important ques tions
 prcsented to the cor sideration
 of this body but now
 at this late hour of
 the night I will en
 deavor in a few remarks
 to vindicate a portion of
 my constituents from a charge
 preferred against them by a
 gentleman from Maryland Mr WEB
 STER on the 29th of
 last month Sir I was
 sur prised and confounded when
 I heard a gentlelaan whose
 district joins my own and
 between the pco ple of
 whose district and the people
 of my district there exists
 the rnost complete harmony assert
 here in his place that
 the citizens of thc borough
 of Carlisle had murdered a
 citizen of the State of
 Maryland in cold blood when
 he was in pursuit of
 his slave lhope he uttered
 that remark without dueconsideration 1
 hope that it was nothing
 more than a hasty and
 ill considered observation or that
 in the heat of tho
 struggle and contest which prevailed
 here he uttered the charge
 without com plete knowledge of
 the facts Why sir when
 I shall have sent to
 the Clerk s desk to
 be read a statement of
 the facts of the case
 a statement made by the
 very attorney of Mr Kennedy
 himself and who witnessed the
 proceedings from the begin ning
 to the end you will
 learn the fact that this
 alleged murder never was committed
 at all that the man
 died of indigestion probably unused
 to the solid living of
 Pennsylvania he may have eaten
 saurkraut or cabba e Laugh
 or with some other In
 1847 Mr Kennedy NEW in
 arresting the Slaves Im the
 mean time thes negroes obtained
 counsel and took of Ijabeas
 corpus and brought the slaves
 before judges Hepburn who was
 the judge Of thatljüdici al
 disv trict Pending the examination
 Sömebod yjn i formed the
 counsel of these two slaves
 that the Legislature had just
 passed an aet repealing the

 after ascertaining ibis clared that
 he had no but be
 told Mr Kennedy There are
 yomvslaves and you have right
 to carry them hötne bj
 ihé common law right of
 recapture Mr Kennedy availed himself
 of that advice and having
 sent for carriages for phe
 purpose of conveying them away
 Mr Milier his counsel with
 some others came down the
 stairs of the court house
 together and as theyapproached the
 carriage a free necrro of
 the boi ouglrmtfde a rush
 at him he having charge
 of the female slave at
 the time They endeavored to
 seize tbe slaves and to
 get them off and in
 doing this I am not
 aware that they used violence
 toward Kennedy But they endeavored
 to get the female slave
 away He battered the necroes
 over the head with a
 stick and in the mean
 time the parties commenced moving
 from the carriages and the
 whole party stumbled upon a
 pile of boards upon which
 Ken S nedy fell and
 fractured his kuee pan He
 taken to the hotel the
 best physician was em ployed
 and the citizens of Carlisle
 made every effort to rearrest
 the female slave They also
 arrested all the negroes who
 participated in the riot tried
 tli em and sent them
 to the penitentiary Six weeks
 after the occurrence Kennedy had
 recovered from the injury sustained
 in the fight and he
 made preparations to go home
 He was about to leave
 next mornint when contra ry
 to the advice of his
 physician he ate something which
 produced colic and he died
 some time in the following
 night Now this circutnstancc is
 attested bythe coun sel of
 Kennedy a rnan of different
 political com plexion from myself
 and who never supported rnc
 either of my canvasses I

 detailing the facts in the
 case That letter send to

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 7 the
 door Mr Kennedy was in
 front with the riegro woman
 and the others followed in
 a kind of procession after
 A one or our police
 and when Mr Kennedy got
 close to the carriage the
 negroes crosed dround hill and
 attelnvted to pull the woman
 away Mr Kennedy had a
 srnall cane in his band
 and commenced beating thenr over
 the bead They continued pulling
 the woman away and the
 fight be The crowd of
 negroes was dense around came
 general him and they succeeded
 in dragging the wornan off
 some thirtytyäfås he still beating
 them over the bead until
 they got to a pile
 of boards when Mr Kennedy
 fell and untOr tunateiy broke
 the cap of his knee
 In the mean time the
 man was seemed and driven
 off The thing was so
 sudden a hd unexpeeted that
 e ery one was taken
 by surprise and uhfortUnately not
 manywhite men were about but
 those who were there immediately
 took sides with Mr Kennedy
 and attacked the negroes A
 pile of cord wood was
 lying c109e by from whiéh
 some of our citizens supplied
 them gelVés and béat the
 negroes over the head A
 nurnber of the negroes were
 severely injured and in ten
 minutes after the riot commenced
 there was not a negro
 to be seen in teanng
 the woman loose froxn him
 and running her into sOme
 one of the little alleys
 and although hot pursuit was
 immediately made by such white
 men as were present the
 negroes scattering in every direction
 and no one of our
 citizens being able to identity
 the wonnan if they did
 see her she escaped Mr
 Kennedy was carried to the
 hotel where he lay for
 some five or six weeks
 apparentiy rapidly recovering l o
 Cian and family thought he
 was doing as well as
 could possibly be expected he
 suddenly died From what cause
 it is impossible I suppose
 certainly to tell but his
 physi Cian one of the
 most erninent in our town
 declared it to be from
 cramp in his stmn agh
 caused by certain indigest When
 his corpse was taken from
 town our citizens turned out
 en masse as en escort
 to express their deep regret
 and all the bells in
 town were tolled have several
 times since visited the relatives
 of the de ingé for
 the citizens of Carlisle While
 the occurrence has been to
 us a source of deep
 and universal regret it is
 a tioos with taking any
 part in it other than
 to defend Mr stances As
 I said but few white
 Inen were present No attack
 was apprehended ro n the
 negroes and after the hearing
 in the court nearly every
 one supposed the matter was
 ended and returned home Atter
 the riot the most intense
 excitement prevailed against the negroes
 Our citizens assmnbled in crowds
 and it was wiih difliculty
 many ot thmn were restrained
 from attacking the negro houses
 aud tearing then down No
 danger was apprehended ut the
 time of Mr Kennedy s
 life or I bavc no
 doubt the negroes would have
 been driven at onee from
 the town Fifteen of theru
 were convicted and sentenced to
 the penitentiary l hi explains
 the fcel ings out eitizens
 had on the subject and
 shows whether Mr WEBSTER is
 justified in representing til nn
 as Inur derers If an
 opportunity occurs our citizens wish
 you to correct circumstances like
 these into willful and down
 I Commonwealth of Pennsylvania men
 who en his assertions Yours
 truly Ron B F W
 H MILLER fight murder and
 that too charged against the
 people of Carlisle who are
 not only intelligent but loyal
 Union loving and law abiding
 citizens Let me tell you
 it is the grossest charge
 which could have been made
 against the character of that
 people When the invasion into
 Virginia was made by John
 Brown and some of his
 followers escaped and made their
 way into the mountains of
 Pennsylvania this very borough arrested
 one of the conspirators and
 coadjutors of Brown ar rested
 him Without process of law
 and upon the merest suspicion
 that he was concerned in
 the raid They not only
 arrested him without au thority
 but confined him in the
 county jail and still morc
 when the agent of the
 State of Virginia who made
 the demund upon the Governor
 of Pennsylvania for the delivery
 of the fugitive was not
 able to identify him these
 very citizens of Carlisle who
 are denounced as murderers by
 n Representative of an adjoining
 State held that criminal until
 Virginia was able to get
 evidence there to identify him
 and he was returned to
 Vir ginia tried convicted and
 suffered death submit whether it
 is fair when we surren
 dered up a man even
 in defiance of law who
 had been guilty of participation
 in the John Brown raid
 I submit whether it is
 fair or whether it will
 tend to heul the differences
 which nosv exist between the
 North and the South to
 make ec parte statements a
 nd convert a mere riot
 into willful malicious and felonious
 murder Why sir we have
 lived near to the Commonwealth
 of Mary land nearly a
 hundred years we have delivered
 up to them a thousand
 slaves within tbe last sixty
 years and we have done
 it without stint and without
 limit We have done it
 freely and cheer fully not
 niggardly and grudgingly and I
 tell you that out of
 the one thousand slaves that
 we have delivered up to
 the State of Maryland there
 never was any difficulty except
 about the two that I
 have already named the slave
 of Mr Ken I submit
 nedy and the slave of
 Mr Gorsuch then whether _it
 is fair to make such
 charges aoainst that good old
 Commonwealth God bless her she
 ig a great State She
 sleeps there to night with
 three million white men in
 her bosom more white nien
 than there are in all
 the six seceding States She
 has not as many negroes
 and of course no slaves
 for which God be thanked
 but there she Bleeps to
 night a giant in repose
 She is not aeruinst the
 people of Maryland We have
 not boughtu rnusket nor even
 uniformed a tingle mun to
 our militia We repose in
 the confidence of our strength
 We arc ready at any
 and at all times to
 meet the enemies of the
 Republic either without or within
 We have con fidenc e
 in the State of Maryland
 Ido not believe that the
 people of Maryland themselves would
 rnake any such charge as
 this against the people Mr
 JUNKIN 1 will single word
 If any man can make
 murder out of those facts
 de tailed by eye witnesses
 by a man who partici
 atod in the struggle by
 the vcry attorney of Mr
 in the teed that testi
 ennedy himself mony the State
 of Maryland or any one
 of her Representatives can charge
 the people of Curlisle with
 being guilty of the murder
 of Kennedy then all I
 can say is that they
 have the queerest kind heard
 of of notions about criminal
 law I ever The very
 negroes themselves could under the
 circumstances be only convicted of
 et craffing in a riot
 They were so convicted and
 sent to the penitentiary för
 two three years That judg
 ment the court however had
 no right to pro nouncc
 because by the law they
 could only be sent to
 the county jail and they
 were one year afterwards released
 by the supreme court upon
 habeas corpus I would state
 further that this is not
 the first time that I
 have hoard this case referred
 to in debate I know
 the people of the South
 have been made to believe
 that two men have been
 murdered in Pennsylvania Kennedy iB
 one and a Mr Gor
 of Pennsylvania They have known
 us too long We have
 lived together in brotherly love
 for a hundred years and
 by the blessing of God
 know we wili live together
 a thousand years longer know
 that we are not going
 to make war against one
 anot her She shall have
 every right to which pledge
 she is entitled under the
 Constitution the Cmnrnonwealth of Pen
 Insylvauia to night that not
 a slave will she fail
 to deliver up whenever the
 proof is made that he
 owes service to his master
 I assert that she never
 did refuse to deliver up
 fugitive slaves I assert that
 she has delivered up more
 slaves than any Commonwealth in
 this Con federacy and has
 done it cheerfully and without
 Let me now refer for
 a moment to the case
 of M r Gorsuch which
 occurred in Lancaster county It
 has been asserted upon this
 floor time both of the
 House me in the Ii
 assertion that these two cases
 have been referred people of
 Lancaster The fact is that
 Mr Gor tertained no prejudice
 towards the State of Mary
 land or the South for
 my own father an old
 Democrat was on that very
 jury I should like to
 know why they did not
 convict that white man if
 he vvas guilty Look at
 the charge of Judge Grier
 in which he told the
 jury that there was no
 not be a conviction and
 the jury returned a ver
 dict accordingly And yet men
 stand up here and upon
 their responsibility as Representatives charge
 that as murder I will
 not trespass upon the time
 of the House much longer
 because i feel that I
 am robbinn my friend from
 Ohio Mr ALLEN and I
 fed uncommonly grateful fot the
 opportunity of say ing anything
 upon this occasion I do
 not see much use in
 bemg a member of Congre
 ss here it would certainly
 be much more creditable to
 be a member ofa decent
 debating society because one cannot
 get the floor when he
 wants and should I have
 have it to repel such
 charges as these watched five
 days for this opportunity and
 it comes even now only
 by the courtesy of my
 friend from Ohio Mr ALLEN
 Mr SMI rH 0fNorth Carolina
 Iwould ask the gentleman from
 Pennsylvania for what offense in
 the Gorsuch case Mr JUNK
 IN For treason in resisting
 the laws of the United
 States and for conspiracy to
 prevent the execution of the
 fugitive slave law That was
 the charge and the jury
 did not con vict him
 Mr SMITH of North Carolina
 Was henot discharged on the
 ground that this was a
 sudden rescue and not a
 premeditated combination to re sist
 the execution of the law
 Mr JUNKIN one the grounds
 of his dis charge was
 the entire absence of proof
 establish ing a prearranged conspiracy
 to defeat and resist the
 execution of the fugitive slave
 law And fur ther if
 any such proof did exist
 as it did not the
 prosecution did not offer it
 as testimony in chief but
 offered it in rebuttal of
 the defense Nevertheless it was
 well known that no such
 I Ianway was a miller
 and proof could be made
 was summoned in his shirt
 sleeves and in a felt
 hat by the sound of
 the horn and the shouts
 of the negroes Under these
 facts sir I claim a
 verdict of not guilt y
 on this count also Now
 Mr Speaker we of Pennsylvania
 do not pretend to be
 better than the people are
 anywhere else We have bad
 men among us who some
 times attemi t to resist
 the execution of the fugi
 tive shave law but very
 rarely because public opinion is
 overwhelmingly in favor of the
 execu tion of that law
 We look upon the man
 who who would attempt such
 a thing a rescue ag
 It is true we will
 not vv orse than a
 sheep thief permit negroes to
 be taken from within our
 bor d ers unless they
 are taken upon good and
 legal grounds and that we
 have a right to do
 But I assert here in
 my place to night that
 so fur from there being
 any disposition to run away
 s aves I knol l
 of no underground railroad in
 Pennsyl vania As I said
 last evening southern men are
 allowed to bring their slaves
 into Illat State and hold
 them there and to return
 with them to the slave
 States from which they came
 livino now in my tow
 II a slave who was
 brought from the State of
 Georgia and has been there
 for know two gentlemen who
 three or four years come
 there annually from the State
 of Mississippi and bring their
 servants there and hoid them
 m a Republican town in
 a Republican county and as
 I believe in a Republican
 State and any man ill
 our community who would attempt
 to induce those slaves to
 leave their masters would be
 looked upon as a thief
 I for one do not
 understand Republicanism to mean negro
 stealing Ifit is then I
 am no Repub to again
 and again and I am
 free to that such was
 murdered by his own staves
 He was was not heretofore
 particularly acquainted with warned before
 he undertook to arrest them
 that lican ar d never
 wili be one If believed
 at tbe same time that
 it meant abolition so help
 me the Carlisle case nor
 did I feel myself at
 liberty I the necn oes
 were known to be desperate
 and that the would undoubled
 y take t l leil
 master s life God I
 would be the first to
 abandon and denounce to speak
 of it until I obtained
 the necessary in formation which
 was last Monday morning Now
 i can in some degree
 at least to my own
 mind occount for the extraordinary
 excitement which prcwails at the
 South for if in such
 a case as this a
 near neighbor to I ennsylvania
 can see murder I am
 no t surprised that the
 people of the South expect
 the North to liberate their
 slaves To what proportions may
 not the acts of the
 Re publicm party be magnified
 when they distort and Mr
 Gorsuch swore by l is
 Maker that he it and
 whenever gentlemen upon this floor
 de would arrest them lie
 in the atternpt He made
 velop the fact that the
 Republican party is tending to
 abolitionism whenever I find the
 Republican the effort and was
 shot down by his own
 slave and not by Pennsylvanians
 But it may be said
 ship beginning to direct its
 prow into that terrific that
 white men were engaged in
 it Well if that I
 and fearful sea why then
 want to jump over be
 true should like to know
 why they could not board
 even at the risk of
 Jonah s fate I will
 go with them in all
 constitutional rneasures in every convict
 those white men One white
 man was thing that is
 right and fair and just
 to both sec tried in
 the Federal court before a
 Federal judge and by a
 jury selected from one of
 the entire tions öf the
 country but they cannot go
 help me 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE God pass me one
 step beyond what I conceive
 to bexny bounddn duty Party
 or no party plat form
 or no platform I will
 act under the obliga tions
 of my oath to do
 all in my power to
 heal the breach that now
 exists bctv reen the North
 and the South for the
 sake of the loyal Union
 men who so bravely stand
 by the old flag of
 my coun try even where
 that loyalty is pronounced treason
 by the mad revolutionists in
 their midst But I find
 that I was about to
 enter on the dis cussion
 of the great question On
 that Iny tnind is irrevocably
 made up I have my
 verdict in my heart and
 am ready to render it
 whenever called I will tell
 you Mr Speaker what upon
 to vote this controversy reminds
 me of It puts me
 in mind ofa story related
 in one of Bulwer s
 novels A worthy couple named
 J Q hn and Joan
 had lived happily together many
 a year tili one un
 lucky day they bought a
 new bolster Joan said the
 bolster was too hard and
 John said the bol stcr
 was too soft so of
 course they quarreled After sulking
 all day they agreed to
 put the bolster between them
 at night After they had
 thus lain apart a little
 time very silent and sullen
 Tohn sneezed God bless you
 said Joan over the bol
 ster Did you say God
 bless me cries John then
 here goes the bolster Laughter
 Now sir the acquisition of
 new territory and the negro
 question are our bolsters and
 we have been sulk ing
 for some years with these
 bolsters between us and when
 our disagreement begins to threaten
 the integrity of our great
 Union the voice of the
 Old Dominion is heard shouting
 in unmistaka ble carnestncss over
 these bolsters of contention God
 bless the Union Sir I
 must as a true man
 respond t o the nobl
 sentiment of Virginia i say
 away with these bolstcu s
 of contention and let us
 settle these conteml tiblc causes
 of quarrel in some way
 honorable and satisfactory to both
 Now sir what are we
 quarreling about in this matter
 What are we talkirg about
 As I un derstand it
 the Republict n party are
 apprehen Sive that slavery is
 going i ito the Territories
 north of 960 30 Or
 rather they cnow that it
 cannot cro there and a
 great number of them think
 that It will not even
 go south of that line
 Then the entire diffculty is
 whether we can draw this
 line It is not for
 the benefit of anybody as
 I under stand it for
 no one is going to
 derive any benefit from it
 I do not beli ve
 that it will either cause
 I do not believe slavery
 to go in or ke
 p it out it would
 have the effect of putting
 one slave more south of
 that line or one slave
 less But or e thing
 I do know know that
 the line of 360 is
 con secrated ay canonized in
 the hearts of the people
 of the free States and
 although some Republicans may stand
 up and say that the
 people would never consent to
 restoring that line i do
 know that the Republican party
 sprung into existence on the
 I know the fact that
 we have abrogation of it
 gone before the people of
 Pennsylvania over and over and
 over affain and said that
 the Democratic party had repealed
 the old l fissouri comprornise
 line and that we were
 slavery should of the objects
 and purposes of the Republican
 party I ask him whether
 he understands that one of
 their objects is ever to
 interfere with sla very in
 the District ot Columbia or
 in the dock yards arsenals
 and navy yards or with
 the inter State slave trade
 Mr JUNKIN so far as
 my knowledge goes in canvassing
 not only my own district
 but others and sb far
 as I have heard politics
 dis cussed in the free
 States I do not believe
 there ever was an election
 of any kind in which
 the question of slavery in
 the District of Columbia entered
 as an element in any
 shape or form The idea
 that the people of the
 great free States should undertake
 to make a specific issue
 on the aboli tion of
 slavery in the District of
 Columbia a little place less
 than ten miles square that
 you could hardly have made
 a decent shooting match out
 of when was a boy
 in our country and should
 make a quarrel with respect
 to it is supremely ridiculous
 I do not believe that
 any man electea to Congress
 in the free States ever
 discussed that subjcct nt all
 lthcy do not think about
 it The ple do not
 care about it and do
 not want to ave anything
 to do with it But
 t iey have always had
 in their mind the great
 question whether they would secure
 t he territory north of
 360 30 for what they
 call freedom That is to
 say that the freemen of
 thc North do not want
 to work along side of
 slaves That is all When
 you talk about the hostility
 of the peo ple of
 the frec States to slavery
 you are greatly In error
 Go into these districts where
 the people are supposed to
 be so intensely hostile to
 the in stitution and you
 will find that they talk
 very little about it and
 never propose to interfere with
 it in the States where
 it exists or in the
 District of Columbia or ill
 the dock yards arsenals and
 navy yards or to interfere
 with the coasting slave trade
 or the inter Statc slave
 trade I never heard the
 people talk of such things
 and I can safely assert
 that such questions are never
 considered I never heard in
 a political in the North
 these subjects discussed till I
 came to Congress and w
 Ilion came here I felt
 very much like the old
 farmer w ho went into
 a court room for the
 first time to see what
 court was like They were
 trying an action of replevin
 about a cow and the
 third day of the trial
 had been reached when the
 do not believe it cvcr
 I never cro north of
 it ve made our word
 will go liorth of it
 I believe that overv otof
 territory north of 360 30
 is consecrated to freedom although
 the line is abrogated Therefore
 to my judgment it does
 not make a particle of
 difference so far as the
 rcal question is concerned whether
 you restore the line or
 leave it alone Formy own
 part I shall vote for
 the propositions reportéd by the
 commit tee of thirty three
 because I think they effect
 substantial restoration of the Missouri
 compro mise Sir it is
 cowardly for the Republican party
 and the great frec North
 to refuse this small boon
 to our brethren of the
 South Fair play is my
 motto and would scorn to
 take advantage of the masters
 and their slavcs m and
 I do honestly and verily
 believe that to day they
 stand ready to come paucity
 of their numbers by legislative
 bar to your aid and
 assistance in maintaining the LNow
 it is true there arc
 some dozen slaves in New
 Mexico I do not see
 how we can get them
 I institution in the States
 where it now exists out
 I do not sce how
 we can have any control
 I Hence it is that
 f only express the sentiment
 I do knox v that
 the legislation of of 111
 y people when I vote
 for a clause in the
 Con in the matter 1850
 settled that question and fixed
 the stat u s of
 stitution that Congress shall never
 interfere with slavery in the
 States and I assort that
 when I that Territory or
 left it to the people
 of thc Ter When vote
 in that way but support
 the Chicago plat ritory which
 amounts to the san1e thing
 If my Ropublican brethren believe
 that I was a I
 emocrat I felt bound to
 stand by t ne form
 I do not see how
 legislation of 1850 I stood
 by it then and I
 stand I their platform is
 a good thing by it
 now It made a settlement
 of the contro they can
 obiect to taking a portion
 of that plat versy and
 I understand that the propositions
 of form and incorporatincy it
 in the fanda mental law
 the committee of thirty three
 do nothing more of tbc
 land If it is a
 good thing in a platform
 it will be good thing
 in the Constitution Why than
 carry that legislation into effect
 And I tell you honestly
 that any Repub Mr HATTON
 The gentleman is speaking not
 old gentleman becoming im patient
 that the valu able time
 of the court should be
 wasted on such a trivial
 matter shouted out ut the
 top of his voice and
 pulling out his purse at
 the stuno time Judge Y
 vhat is this old cow
 mtvorth I ll pay her
 value and let the court
 proceed to something J So
 when I came Laugh of
 importance here and listened day
 after day to long speeches
 about slavery ill the District
 of Columbia I felt like
 asking what this District bc
 bought for I tell you
 that these questions are Laughter
 never discussed among the mountains
 of Penn sylvania They havesomestrongideas
 thereabout slavery but they never
 expect to be called upon
 to regulate the affairs of
 thc District of Colum bia
 This is the only place
 where such questions are over
 heard discussed The people themselves
 never talk about them although
 I am free to con
 fess that the people of
 my district have got some
 pretty strong notions in thcir
 mind about slavery but they
 do not arise out of
 any hostility to you who
 own slaves They never dream
 of interfer ing between you
 and your slaves for I
 tell you they would I
 hate in the worst sort
 of way to have your
 ne roes emancipated and sent
 among them and they would
 not submit to it They
 dislike even the free neo
 rocs and do not in
 any manner associate with them
 I never heard my constituents
 assert any desire to interfere
 between licanrwho fails to proposition
 reported by the dörhni tee
 thi ee will be in
 my astehd ing towards abolition
 and will weakenGihy con fidence
 in the Republican party I
 do notbelieve there are ten
 men On this side of
 the House who will fail
 to vote for that proposition
 I know it was argued
 here to day by a
 gqntle man who occupied a
 chair behind meÅMr SEDä WICK
 that there may a time
 come when weernav want to
 take a hand In purchasing
 the Slgvgs in the border
 slave States or in some
 way slavery in those States
 and therefore he felt dis
 inclined to support the proposition
 He geexned to have the
 impression that it might in
 some way prevent a State
 from abolishinx slavery within its
 own limits Why sir if
 I understand that prop osition
 it has no reference to
 the action Of any If
 the State It only applies
 to Congress State of Marylafid
 shalt desire tö abolish slavery
 within her own limits or
 any other State shall desire
 it they may do it
 but Congress cannot Now what
 earthly objection can there be
 to that I admit there
 is a single objection in
 my mind It may tend
 to create excitcmeot in the
 North It may tend to
 deepen the agitation upon these
 questions and in that way
 do inore harm than good
 butl think the Legislatures of
 the States can so deal
 with the question as to
 prevené the occurrence Of havm
 from that source I again
 acknowledge my obligations to the
 gen tleman from Ohio for
 yielding me the floor and
 hope that thc time I
 have occupied will not be

 CORMICK S PATENT Mr WADE
 move to take up the
 resolution of tbc House of
 Representatives on the subject of
 McCormick s patent for a
 reaping machine I VICE PRESIDENT
 Senator from Ohio moves to
 take up the joint resolution
 H R No 71 extending
 the time for taking testi
 mony on the application of
 Cyrus H McCor mick for
 the extension of his patent
 MI BRAGG hope that matter
 will be passed I have
 several reports to over for
 the present make and I
 desire to dispose of the
 papers which have been lying
 or my table for several
 days I am satisfied if
 that matter be taken up
 it will I believe the
 morning hour by lead to
 debate the rules is appropriated
 to the presentation of memorials
 and reports from committces Mr
 WADE I would very willingly
 give way for that purpose
 but if this resolution is
 to be acted on at
 all there is great necessity
 for its being acted upon
 now It proposes to give
 time for taking testimony for
 the purpose of showing that
 it is not proper to
 extend this patent for seven
 years more We are in
 danger of an immediate decision
 by t he Commissioner of
 Patents The House of Representatives
 under these circum stances have
 passed this resolution and of
 course if it is to
 be acted OD at all
 it ought to be done
 in mcdiately for ifwc postpone
 it it may be of
 no II is for this
 reason that am anxious it
 should supersede all other business
 and be acted upon at
 once for there is no
 question of greater importance to
 the farmers of the wholc
 country than the controversy about
 the extension of this patent
 lb is very easy to
 show that this patentee has
 received ai ready an immense
 sum with which he ought
 to be content from Ibe
 proceeds of this patent and
 it will be greatly the
 detriment of the public interests
 in In y judgment if
 it shall be But I
 do not rise to renewed
 for seven years artyuc it
 I will not it I
 10W because if might provoke
 argument on the other side
 All I want IS the
 decision of the Senate upon
 the question Mr FITCH This
 appears to bea proposition to
 take a case out of
 the hands of the Coenmis
 sioncn of Patents and amend
 the law to suit the
 I know nothing convenience of
 i rivate parties of the
 merits of the coutroversy but
 I think the proposition itself
 is u very dangerous one
 to be acted by the
 Senate The Senator says there
 I hold it my hand
 is danger of havino a
 deciston written brief of the
 attorneys for the protestants in
 which tl ley say t
 here is no danger whatever
 and all they desire according
 to their own lun is
 a decision They say his
 McCor mick s proof amounts
 to nothing and 0 111
 proof I covers the case
 at all points Further F
 roof would Still it seen
 s they de i be
 merely curnulative we do not
 sire to take it Fl
 hey say further think the
 application Or an extension will
 be suc And here is
 the report of the acting
 Conomisu sionerof Patents on the
 subject in which he states
 all the points urged by
 the protestants and pro ceeds
 to give the testimony on
 file before him answering every
 one of them and yet
 it is pro posed to
 take this caso out of
 his hands and It to
 Congress in order to subserve
 thc interest of private parties
 Those interests it may be
 very I know nothing of
 the merits proper to consult
 of the controversy On general
 principles I have ari aversion
 to prolonginst patents but if
 the case Mr DOOLITTLE from
 the Committee on li is
 to be urged now it
 is no more than justice
 to Indian Affairs to whom
 was referred the bill S
 the acting Commissioner of Patents
 that his nn No 469
 for the relief of A
 H Jones and H M
 swer to the application of
 the protestants should C Brown
 reported it without amendment and
 be read and shall send
 it to the Clerk s
 desk to be read if
 the vote is to be
 pressed The proper recommended its
 passaø e Mr KENNEDY from
 the Committee on motion would
 be and I make that
 motion to refer Naval Affairs
 to whom was referred the
 memorial i this joint resolution
 to the Committee on Patents
 of James Harwood asking to
 be allowed com and the
 Patent Office They can report
 it to mor row lnorning
 if it be desired and
 i presume they pensation for
 extra services performed as parser
 1 prefer that it should
 pass through during the expedition
 to Pmaguay submitted a will
 do so their hands report

 S No 559 for the
 f WADE I wish to
 ask the Senator whether relief
 of James K Harwood The
 bill was read the acting
 Commissioner has not refused further
 and passed to second reading
 gnd the report time for
 taking testimony wus ordered to
 be printed Mr FITCH I
 respond to the inquiry by
 say ing that he has
 refused and he alleges ample
 reasons to sustain him in
 his decision which I have
 here in manuscript reasons which
 ouo ht to be satisfactory
 to every Senator and every
 gon Into the truth of
 them tieman if they are
 true the Committee on Patents
 if there is any doubt
 about it can inquire Mr
 GRIMES i hope the Senator
 from Indi ana Will send
 that letter up and let
 it be read on this
 motion Mr FITCH Certainly sir
 It appears there have been
 two applications for an extension
 of time The VICE PRESIDENT
 The question is on the
 motion to take up the
 joint resolution Mr MASON I
 ask respectfully if the rules
 do not requite that the
 morning hour shall be ap
 propriated 10 petitions and reports
 have some reports which I
 am anxious to make from
 a com mittee The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Chair thinks not
 The rules indicate the course
 of business which the Chair
 shall call up but it
 is subject to the order
 of the Senate This has
 been repeat ed y decided
 by the Chair Mr FESSENDEN
 1 wish to make an
 in quiry which perhaps may
 affect my vote some I
 have understood that the application
 for what the renewal of
 this patent is really made
 to the Commissioner more than
 a year before the expi
 ration of the old patent
 and that it is made
 to and tried by a
 gentleman who is merely the
 act ing Commissioner who accidentally
 at this pe riod fills
 thc position long anterior to
 the time when there will
 be any necessity for actinry
 upon I should like to
 know if that is true
 it I can only answer
 the Senator Mr FITCH so
 faras I derive my knowledge
 from these papers The application
 appears to have been made
 a year or so before
 the expiration of the patent
 but it was made while
 there was a Commissioner of
 Patents and his decision is
 only being carried out by
 the acting Commissioner Mr FESSENDEN
 There can be no hurry
 in his action upon it
 certainly if that is the
 case Mr FITCH And furthermore
 the Commis sioner says these
 applications a year or so
 in advance are very cornmon
 and a renewal is often
 made that length of time
 in advance The VICEVRESIDENT The
 reading of the Let us
 hear it If there letter
 is asked for be no
 objection the Secretary will read
 it The Secretary read as
 follows ID the matter of
 McCormick s application for Extension
 Ithc counsel for Inost of

 in such cases and it
 has required considerable time to
 examine them and to separate
 the titct Crom the allegations

 examination of the witness H

 and was deferred until then
 only because the oppo nents
 declined to cross examine on

 both sides that relate to
 the merits of the case
 on final hearinl and thereföre
 do not require notice on
 this nwtion On the t
 onner tnotion tor a postpone
 ncnt which was overruled it
 was stated that the reception
 o f tuc application eleven
 Inonths before the patent expired
 and the fixing of tbe
 day of hearing on the
 lith of February were acts
 of the late Comtnissioner done
 with deliberation and with a
 view tliat Inore than to
 protect and promote the public
 interest the usual titne for
 taking testiinony had becn allowed
 narnely t orty sevcn days
 Dine days only n the
 tune been occupied by bottl
 parties taking testirnony and that
 too by tnutual agreernent that
 it tile applicant s account
 as alleged is untäithful aud
 untrue the delåutt in this
 re gard is at his
 peril and he Illust take
 the consequences And if bis
 cornpcnsation has been adequate as
 is ROW al leged that
 pact alone must be tatal
 to the extension in view
 of all the circumstances presented
 on the former tnotÉon it
 was held that sufficient reason
 tor granting a postponement appeared
 and the inotion was consequently
 overruled I cannot see now
 that the reasons tar a
 post ponement are strengthened in
 any degree and I therelöre
 I decline to change thé

 S T s JGERT acting
 Co gnissioner PATENT OFFICE January
 29 1861 The VICE PRESIDENT
 The question iso the motion
 to take up the joint
 resolution The motion was acreed
 to and the joint so
 lution was considered as in
 Committee of the Whole Mr
 PUGH I move now that
 the joint reso lution be
 referred to the standing Committee
 on Patents and the Patent
 Office and if the Senate
 wili give me their attention
 for a few rnonlent s
 I think I can show
 them the propriety of that
 mo lion Mr FITCH Will
 the Senator so modify his
 motion as to let the
 papers go with the resolution
 to the committee Mr PUGH
 Certainly By the general law
 as I understand every patentee
 before the expi ration of
 his term is entitled to
 apply to thc Com missioner
 of Patents and with certain
 cvidencc which he is required
 to produce may have an
 ex It seeuns that in
 this tension for seven years
 case whatever may be the
 value or the validity of
 the patent the applicant has
 departed in no wise from
 the lavv He has made
 his application Others it seems
 feeling opposed to the extension
 of the patent have been
 heard by their testimony and
 their counsel The Commissioner as
 it ap pears the paper
 which has been read has
 twice been asked to extend
 the time of taking testimony
 and upon affidavit and argument
 has decided against it mod
 now application is made to
 Con o ress hurriedly without
 exarninalion by any standing cornmittee
 of this body to use
 the law making powt n
 of the Government in a
 private Iit igation to orant
 an appeal from a decision
 t wice made by the
 proper offcer under the name
 of a joint resolution What
 wtfl be the consequence If
 we cause this applicant any
 mischief i y our interference
 he will be here with
 bis petition to be illdemni
 vvouid have given I think
 he can tnake at teasta
 very fair claim on the
 equity of Congress if not
 do not know Mr a
 claim of riffht Now sir
 McCormick und I presume I
 am as much inter ested
 as any Senator in virtue
 of rny agricultural constituents if
 they have any interest the
 pat ent in having it
 opposed but if Mr McCormick
 has a right to his
 extension by law I will
 not take it from him
 if he has no right
 to it let the Commis
 sioncr of Patents decide against
 him The Com missioner at
 present has long been in
 the office I have never
 heard anything said against his
 in tegrity or his capacity
 and I am indisposed as
 a member of Congress that
 is ali I mean to
 say about it to be
 used on either side of
 a lawsuit Therefore I hope
 our Committee on Patents will
 take the resolution and will
 read these papers I could
 not hear all the paper
 sent from thc Com missioner
 there was so much confusion
 at the time it was
 read but I heard enough
 to satisfy me that it
 is a controverted case of
 litigation and feeling on both
 sides and that it is
 not wise for I trust
 therefore the Com us to
 act in haste mittec on
 Patents will examine the papers
 and if they find that
 we have the power to
 do this and that there
 is a propcr case made
 I shall be willing to
 vote for the resolution but
 I am not willincr to
 do it in the lark
 and there fore I insist
 on my motion that the
 joint resolu tion and the
 papers be referred to tho
 standing Committee on Patents and
 the Patent Office I doubt
 not they will give it
 speedy examination I hope so
 Nil r WADE I do
 not think there is any
 ne cessity for relin ring
 this resolution to the Com
 r i he question involved
 is a mittee on Patents
 very great one indeed one
 of morc public inter est
 could hardly be suggested I
 do not profess to know
 anything of the merits or
 demerits of this application for
 a renewal of t he
 patent but I can see
 as everybody can that the
 public are It is a
 great ques most vitally interested
 in it tion in volving
 millions of dollars to be
 taken from the pockets of
 our farruers wrongfully if clie
 de cision should be wrong
 and if the decision that
 is now contemplated shall be
 finally made in favor of
 this applicant a little delay
 will not injure him II
 Why can not give the
 parties all the at Inc
 that is necessary in order
 to bring in all the
 testimony which is essent inl
 to decide a contro versy
 so important as this I
 he applicant himself il seems
 from the paper which has
 been read took testimony as
 late as t hp 28th
 of J anuary and it
 was the testimony of witnesses
 scattered abroad ir a great
 many pluccs all over the
 country but the attorneys of
 the con testants have made
 affidavit that their witnesses are
 scattered abroad in distant parts
 of tbc coun try avid
 that they have not bad
 time sufficient to bring the
 testimony that they have to
 bear upon the case and
 they want time to do
 it It can be of
 no disad vantage to the
 applicant himself because his patent
 does not expire until the
 23d patent all the weetértü
 deuntfry v ularlj the reaper
 and mowor has dispensable implement
 to Athe farmer Every reaper
 and mower manufactured in the
 Uhit ed States not made
 Mr McCfiniek bae to pa
 y him a tribut e
 of fifteen dollarS That comes
 dia rectly from the ihrming
 interests ofzthe country Already he
 has received his millions far
 sdme small inventions in reference
 to the reaper and mower
 and that the whole made
 to pay tribute to him
 to the amount Of if
 teen dollars for every reaper
 and mower boughp by the
 farmers for the next seven
 years is ter Ithat their
 representatives here should 1 0ök
 tOl I take it there
 an be no objection to
 postponing the timc for taking
 evidence because his patent does
 not expire for eight or
 nine months yet Mi WADE
 I did not state before
 foi i did not know
 then the time when the
 decision vis to hud no
 time to investigate this mat
 be made tet and I
 only said the public were
 deeply inter ested but I
 see now that the decision
 is to be made next
 Monday and that too Ove
 the hfida vits of the
 counsel the public that they
 have testimony completed I want
 to know if the Sen
 ate will now permit this
 great decision to be made
 under these circumstances Two of
 the counsel for the defendants
 for the public make oath
 that they have not had
 time to get their testimony
 and yet the case is
 about to be foreclosed without
 it What Senator wants decision
 of this kind to be
 made upon such principles and
 a snap judgment taken on
 imperfect testimony The case will
 be closed I believe and
 tl e arcu ment of
 the case cormnenced next Monday
 Sir it would be an
 out rage in my judgment
 to permit ouch a case
 to be decided in such
 a manner Mr FUL CH
 The reading of the papers
 was caiied for and I
 supposed Lhatevery Senätor who listel
 ed to the response of
 the acting Commis sioner would
 be perfectly satisfied of the
 impi o priety of gt
 anting the prayer of the
 protestants T bey have had
 a tnple tnne all the
 time ever allowed Due notice
 t ullnotice was given They
 filed heir proof and the
 attorneys themselves say in their
 plea His McCormick s proof
 amounts to nothing and our
 proof covers the case at
 al l points Further proof
 would be merely cumula tive
 and tl ley close their
 argument by saying we do
 not think the application for
 extension will be successful This
 is what the attorneys for
 the protestants say and yet
 they first apply for an
 extension to the 4th of
 March Why that particular day
 It sinacks little of a
 supposition that a change of
 Administration might be benefi Cial
 to their interests Subsequently application
 is made for an extension
 of time to the first
 Mon It will be seen
 by day in Jt dy
 or thereabouts those who listened
 to the written answer of
 the acting Commissione r that
 every solitary allega tion rnadc
 bv the protestants is answered
 and sat istactotlly answered There
 is nouhe first sein tilla
 of proofon which to hang
 an appliqationfo t a continuation
 except to consult the convenience
 I day of October next
 What necessity is there fur
 and possibly the interests of
 certain men who are rivals
 of this manufacturer tl lis
 hot haste in closing the
 testimony when the patent does
 not expi re for n
 ine or ten mon Lhs
 A word as to what
 the Senator from Ohio said
 There can be no necessity
 for it whatever and in
 il relative to thc interests
 of the farmers a case

 to tbe public I Several
 SENATORS The Scnator from Michi
 as this evidently does it
 strikes me that all the
 gan liebt which can be
 obtained on the subject should
 Mr FITCH Ohio first and
 then Michigan bc obtained and
 that there is no occasion
 forc ios subsequently The farmers
 l nave no interest in
 this controversy but some of
 your manufactur ing the case
 so early and hence no
 propriety in delaying this resolution
 have no doubt that the
 iv g nt lcnncn have
 isa rivafry between them Commiitee
 on Patents if they make
 a thorough T l ntt
 is the whole sum and
 substance of it examination will
 corne to the same conclusion
 a rivalry between different manufacturi1P
 estab that have now come
 to have no fears of
 its lishments Other establishments desire
 to purloin goino to them
 but time is very essenåal
 in this an improvement and
 not give the originator of
 it I do not know
 when the decision is to
 the patentee of it its
 fuil benefit matter be made
 but undoubtedly very soon At
 all The argument in favor
 of passing this resolu events
 these parties ought to know
 and know as tion that
 this patentee applied a year
 in advance soon as possible
 whether their rights are to
 be II is futile nothing
 is more common as the
 records of the Patent Office
 show forever closed within a
 few days or not for
 per if he waits until
 his patent expires he haps
 they can get some testimony
 in the mean mind that
 time but if the closing
 of the case is postponed
 carmot apply Any wise man
 would not wait i until
 the evc of the expiration
 of his patentbefore according to
 this resolution there will be
 no difü he made his
 application for a renewal and
 there ficulty in the parties
 being thoroughly heard and a
 decisiot being made that ought
 to be satisfactory II is
 a cuse now pending here
 from the Committee II on
 Patents clearly showing the propriety
 of an I d not
 wish to pt mong the
 debate to ali a case
 in which n hope it
 will not be considered necessary
 to send early application f
 inventor of an important improvement
 in fied and should like
 to k nox v what
 argument this joint resolution to
 any committee en rines faded
 to make his app ieation
 for a re Me BINGHAM
 Mr President the agricul could
 be rnade against indcmnification tural
 interests of the United States
 are very deeply newal until
 it was so late t
 hat the Commissioner conterncd in
 the question of the extension
 Of this of Patente could
 not decide and it fell
 to the lowing the law
 as it is written on
 your statute book up tb
 the period of decision we
 then inter 806 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 8 ground tothe
 manifest injustice as the commit
 tee and Impresume the Senate
 when they look into it
 will readily see and to
 the gross wrong of the
 patentee Another argument in favor
 of the extension of time
 is that the applicant took
 testimony on the 28th of
 January Surely the Senator from
 Ohio fMr W ADE would
 not use that kind of
 argu ment against him when
 he knows that it was
 the fault 0K the protesants
 that testimony was taken on
 that day for the testimony
 taken by the ap plicant
 was merely rebutting On that
 very day protestants filed an
 application to take testi mon
 y and did take testimony
 and the applicant took rebutting
 testimony That was all ho
 took Had the protestants not
 taken any he would have
 taken none Hc has as
 the answer of the Com
 letter of missioner shows fully
 complied wit h the the
 law and desires nothing but
 the law I he protestants
 arc not satisfied with this
 and desire Congress to bend
 the law to suit their
 conve nience Mr TRUMBULL Mr
 President this case it seems
 to me is a very
 small onc when properly understood
 The law auth orizes an
 extension of a patent for
 seven years on certain conditions
 What are they One condition
 is that the in ventÅon
 or discovery must have been
 novel An other is that
 the inventor or discoverer must
 have used reasonable diligence in
 introducing his im provement into
 use and not have received
 a rea sonable remuneration for
 his labor bestowed upon it
 during the existence of the
 patent for the four teen
 years for which it is
 first granted That is the
 law and the Commissioner has
 no authority to renew a
 patent for seven years unless
 these He decides upon this
 testi facts are madc out
 mony and if hc is
 satisfied i liese he may
 extend the patent for seven
 yeurs Now what do we
 see in this case An
 appli cation is made to
 renow a patent for which
 the patentee has recei vcd
 already in Fl oss than
 three million nine hundred thousand
 dollars Hc admits that he
 has rcceivcd nrore than three
 mil lion nine hundred thousand
 dollars in gross is true
 he uses a good dcul
 of this r noncy in
 ex penses This application is
 ruude a yeav beforc i
 low can you tcll whether
 the patent expires he will
 not receive during the ycar
 which is to follow a
 sum sufficient to n mke
 the rcrnuneration labor ho hos
 be tune an l the
 ample for all the stowed
 upon t he invention And
 if such appears to be
 the fact the Commissioner has
 no right to extend the
 patent A1 though tbc paten
 tee should not wait ns
 the Senator fronn Indiana says
 until the last day before
 lye makes his application neither
 should he make his application
 a year advance for the
 renewal of a patent for
 which he has recei ved
 such monstrous profits as are
 shown in this cnsc r
 I he profits this very
 year will be hundreds of
 thousands of dollars Offcourse they
 that the It seems to
 IÜC cannot be shown fact
 that t llis ftl plication
 is Inade so long in
 ad testimony ought to be
 in the hands of the
 Com missioner before he acts
 upon the case I am
 reminded by the Senator from
 Ohio Mr WADE that the
 affidavit of the attorneys is
 such that it would require
 from any court an extension
 of the time of taking
 testimony What harm can result
 from it Is anybody going
 to be injured Do you
 not want all the testimony
 Is there not ample time
 to take it Is there
 nota very great impropriety in
 deciding this case a year
 in ad vance and saying
 that Mr McCormick has not
 received a reasonable remuneration for
 the time and labor he
 has bestowed on this improvement
 when he has receivc l
 from it nearly four million
 dollars and may for aught
 we know receive another million
 during the ensuing year which
 will never be brought into
 the account if the case
 is now to be closed
 If the time is to
 be ext cndod at all
 it must be done immediately
 for I see the argument
 is fixed fbr the 11th
 of February Mr BAYARD Mr
 President 1 knownoth ing but
 what I bavc heard fall
 here us to the mer
 its of this controversy I
 neither know the value of
 Mr McCorn ick s patent
 except from gon eral reputation
 nor the extent of his
 gains but it seems to
 me that we are about
 to adopt a prece dent
 if we suffer this joint
 resolution of the T lousc
 of Representatives to pass either
 before going to a committee
 or after going to a
 committee far beyond any attempt
 that Congress has previously made
 to interfere With the ordinary
 execution of the laws This
 resolution was passed in the
 House of Representatives on the
 5th of Fcbruary and came
 to the Senate on the
 6th as appears from the
 Journals It came hcre two
 days ago and it is
 called up to day and
 we are asked to pass
 what What is tho character
 of the resolution To as
 sume judicial functions in an
 individual case involving individual rights
 Whether I look at the
 Constitution as regards its intent
 of keeping judicial and legislative
 powers or separate the whether

 irnpossibility of supposin T that

 disgraced that is receive the
 per so nal npplication the
 personal statement and the personal
 solicitations of iridividuals for or
 against the particular rncasure it
 seems to mc that if
 carry the systo lü as
 it would be carried in
 this case to the extent
 not of granting tunytlling which
 does not exist but of
 interferino with the ordi we
 are grossly nary action under
 a general law pov rers
 o t Consrress I abusing
 the II is nol lliug
 to me v rhet h

 Mr iVIc Corrnick be interested
 in this matter no right
 to asstune that thc Commissioner
 of Pat ents will not
 discharge his duty rightfully and
 rnako a rn oper decision
 on the evidence before L
 ID tnay reject this proposed
 renewal of the hirn patent
 the Cons uituLion your authority
 IS to pass laws the
 protection of and vancc and
 when there is no necessity
 all for discoverers of and
 processes which Your a lithorily
 I are of great utility
 t the pu blic hurry
 should have been a sullicient
 inducement is to give adequate
 rewart ls uude r creneral
 for the Conn nissionm to
 extend the titne to takc
 testimony to any reasonable period
 before the You have puss
 cd general iaw which authorizes
 an Inventor in the first
 instance to have a patent
 patent was about to expire
 for fou rt c nn
 years with the right of
 renewal w h ich The
 testimony taken on the part
 of the patentee vas taken
 the first of it on
 the 21st of January you
 confide judicially to the investigation
 of an executive oflicm thorough
 y skilied in the whole
 and ended on the 28th
 and taken at various places
 in different parts of the
 United States What E matter
 and competent for the discharge
 of his opportunity has there
 becn to rnoet this testimony
 duties There is no allegation
 here no attempt to I
 show that there is any
 fraudulent bias on the part
 Witnesses have been examined in
 York in Washington city and
 in parts of the of
 the person wli0 is authorized
 10 decide but country and
 there is no opportunity to
 meet this you arc asked
 to do what When in
 the course testimony in seven
 days No possible harm can
 I of a judicial investi
 ration under a general law
 I the oiliccr having the
 authority has formally de result
 to anybody from an extension
 of the time cided that
 there is no reasonable ground
 for the for taking testimony
 Now without going into the
 merits of the case further
 prolongation of the controversy between
 at a it seems to
 me that this application is
 so the parties whoever they
 be Congress is to manifestly
 proper that the Senate ought
 not co come in by
 special law and nullify that
 judicial It is an attempt
 to inter hesitato a momentin
 altowing further time to take
 decision of the officer the
 testimor y But the Senator
 from Indiana fere in an
 ec parte manner on a
 mere one sided tells us
 that the attorneys say have
 made out statement for it
 to that and without evcrl
 a good case already and
 it is not necessary to
 have the investigation or recommendation
 at a com olher testimony
 Of course the attorneys who
 mittce you are to take
 away from aman the rights
 were resisting the extension of
 this monopoly that belono to
 him under your laws because
 the would not state that
 theircase was defective r Chey
 public may be interested in
 resisting the exten would not
 admit that because the did
 not know Sion of his
 patent Do you know what
 the Com rnissioner will decide
 No Sir I would just
 as that the time would
 be extended They think on
 soon vole in favor of
 a bill where there was
 a case the case as
 it stands thc Commissioner ought
 not i to extend this
 patent but while they think
 so pending in the circuit
 court of the United States
 they say there is other
 testimony and the whole invokving
 millions of dollars and they
 often do so depend between
 A and B where the
 court had decided that according
 to the general rules of
 the law of evidence there
 was no further reason for
 protracting the controversy or extending
 the time for taking evidence
 I should just as lief
 think of undertaking to revise
 that judicial decision by in
 terposing the law and saying
 that one side should have
 a right which the general
 law did not give him
 as I would vole in
 Cavor of this resolution You
 are assumin o judich 1L
 powers to the broadest extent
 You are interi ik kllg
 in the administration of justice
 in the country between man
 and man if you pass
 this resolution that is now
 before you I do not
 enter into the question at
 all of whether the Commissioner
 ought to have granted more
 I have had no opportunity
 to read time or not
 his reasons and if I
 had he did not state
 them for our inspection They
 may go far beyond it
 His judicial opinion 1 understand
 is riven why he den
 the motion before him for
 a further postpouement as to
 the time of taking evidence
 Is this Is this a
 proper body to controvert that
 a proper body to investiffate
 a question of that kind
 Honorable Spriators may have constituents
 who come to them and
 tell them we have a
 vast interest iii this matter
 ve think the general lawr
 ought to be set aside
 and that you ought to
 assume judicial functions in order
 to prevent the officer from
 carrying out the laws that
 exist accord ing to the
 duties that are imposed on
 him I can not reason
 in that triode Mr President
 I cannot believe it can
 ever coir e to good
 MI hcthcr this patent is
 to be or rejected or
 suffered to die at the
 termination of the present grant
 makes to me no matter
 of difierence The question of
 amount is nothing compared with
 the false prin ciple embodied
 in this resolution do not
 know how it will affect
 my constitu I dare ents
 They are an agricultural people
 say they and the public
 generally if thcpatent is valuable
 i vould like to get
 rid of the stringency of
 it and of the emolument
 paid to the inventor It
 is very probable there us
 soon as possible are hundreds
 of Illen in my State
 who would be il i
 favor of having this resolution
 passed because I the object
 is sitnplyto extend the opportunity
 for litigation It is in
 fact though an interference with
 the judicial course of action
 in favor of one man
 oronc setofmen against another man
 I can not sanction by
 any vote of mine such
 action on the part of
 Congress am very sure that
 justice whether it be between
 one man and many men
 tween a rnan und the
 State must be imper 01
 if it is intended to
 be justice at all T
 hc son moment you suffer
 individual claimants to come to
 members of Concrnsg Dt ivatcly
 and tell them 17his will
 be very in u lous
 to us this interest by
 it and you as and
 t lat interest wiii i
 legislative action and sumc that
 as a grou interrupt the
 ordinay v ocess of the
 laws with no charp of
 fraud made no charge of
 incompe tency against the officer
 who is about to decide
 upon the question and has
 not yet decided as to
 the rights of the parties
 it seems to me that
 there would not be a
 possibility of justice being done
 I admit the major influence
 in such a case such
 cases would generally prevail Sometimes
 it might prevail for tlne
 purpose of obtaining a patent
 which ought not to be
 granted Some til nes it
 might obtain for the purpose
 of defeating a paterü which
 according to your laws ought
 to be extended But it
 is no noatter whether we
 are in favor of the
 extension or of the rejection
 of this application of McCormick
 whoever the party may be
 that is not subject which
 in my judg It rests
 by your laws men t
 we can safely touch in
 1110 hands of the Commissioner
 and you vio latc the
 first great principles of law
 when you at tempt in
 the Legislature to interpose in
 judicial action between man and
 man t These are objections
 to the resolution whether It
 only makes it it goes
 to a committee or not
 In the face worse not
 to send it to a
 committee I of the rights
 of parties you are to
 undertake to with thosc rights
 because the right to have
 a case heard according to
 general law and the right
 when evidence has been taken
 on both sides to have
 that case decided beyond all
 ques Gon belongs to every
 citizcn in every dispute that
 arises under a general law
 I defy gentlemen to distinguish
 they can between this case
 and an attempt made here
 to interpose against a decision
 for instance of a court
 of equity which is very
 common where an application has
 been made to 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE to secure an
 extension of time in ordcr
 that tes extend the time
 for taking depositions and the
 timony might be had If
 you believe them and court
 has refused it and the
 parties come here and ask
 Congress to passa special law
 overruling I suppose you arc
 bound to believe them they
 say in their affidavits why
 they have not been able
 the decision of the court
 and you should under we
 do to take all the
 testimony they desire they show
 take to look at thaÜdecision
 and say not think the
 ground fo r refusing the
 extension of how material it
 is and tl ey show
 that the merits time this
 individual of the case cannot
 be reached without the testi
 Case we will give to
 the party rights which do
 not belong to him under
 the general law of the
 land in other words sir
 we will suffer personal favor
 to take the place of
 impersonal justice 1 can vote
 for no such resolution no
 matter how it affects The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr F00T in
 the chair The morning hour
 having expired it is incumbent
 upon the Chair this day
 having been assigned by order
 of the Senate for the
 con sideration of the Private
 Calendar to announce that the
 first bill upon that Calendar
 is in order and now
 before the Senate Mr SEWARD
 I wish barely to say
 in rela tion to the
 first business upon the Private
 Calen dar that heretofore I
 have held rela tions on
 the subject of the patent
 in general which have been
 such although they do not
 affect the present question before
 the Commissioner of Pat ents
 as to render it improper
 for me to vote on
 the bill before the Senate
 Mr WADE I move to
 postpone all farther business in
 order to continue this matter
 Oh It will take but
 a moment to pass it
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 with diffdcnce will suggest the
 day baving been assigned by
 special resolution to the considera
 tion of the Prxvate Calendar
 that the appropriate motion and
 the only appropriate motion is
 a motion to suspend that
 order Mr WADE well 1
 to suspend that ord cr
 Mr BIGLER 1 wilt suggest
 to the Senator from Ohio
 to permit the reading of
 the messacye of the Presidont
 which is on the table
 Mr WADE I suppose it
 will také but a mo
 I do not wish to
 say anything more about it
 But let us take a
 vote upon it because if
 sve postpone it of course
 there will be no use
 of ever calling it up
 again The PRESIDING OFFICER I
 he question before the Senate
 is on the motion to
 suspend the order assigning this
 day for the consideration of
 the Private Calendar Mr BRAGG
 On that motion I ask
 for the yeas and nays
 The yeas and nays were
 ordered Mr BRAGG I hope
 this motion will not pre
 vail Notwithstanding what the Sernator
 from Ohio has said as
 to the time the resolution
 which has been betore the
 Senate during the morning hour
 will take I mn perfectly
 satisfied frorn what I see
 all around me that if
 we go into that subject
 and suspend the regular order
 of the day we shall
 have the greater part of
 the day consumed in the
 i am per mony which
 they desire Now if we
 permit this question to go
 by there is the end
 of it because the Commissioner
 has utterly refused to give
 them any longer time than
 Monday next and there fore
 every Senator who believe s
 that McCor mick having received
 4 000 000 for his
 patent already ought not to
 receive any more from the
 pockets of the public will
 vote I trust for the
 suspension of the rules and
 for continuing the consideration of
 this resolution until We geta
 vote I upon it Mr
 FITCH The object of the
 Senator from Ohio will not
 be attained namely the passage
 of the joint resolution to
 day by that course The
 Senatör from Illinois on this
 side Mr DOUGLAS intends to
 be heard on the qcæslion
 and a single objection will
 prevent the passage of the
 resolu tion to day and
 that objection wilk most assuredly
 be made i think he
 had better let the resolution
 take the usual course and
 go to the Committee Question
 Question on Patents Mr FESSENDEN
 1 am sorry to delay
 an impatient body with reference
 to this matter but I
 want simply to say that
 shall vote for the postponement
 for the simple reason given
 by the Senator from Ohio
 Mr WADE which is that
 a vote against the postponement
 it successful de feats his
 object entirely Though ordinarily I
 would go with the chairman
 of the Committee on like
 this and Claims to pass
 over a resolutiot l take
 up the claims assigned for
 to day yet when a
 question comes up which is
 alleged to be of very
 great consequence and which can
 only be settled by the
 postponement of the Private Calen
 dar I think it is
 a fair argument because it
 that be true and I
 have no doubt it is
 from what is said by
 the Senator from Ohio the
 F ost ponement is destruction
 to the measure We ought
 at least to afford an
 opportunity to the Senate to
 vote upon it even if
 a day which was assigned
 for pri vate bills does
 go by because another day
 can be given them but
 there can bc no other
 day for this particular question
 Mr PUGH It seems to
 me that the Senator from
 Maine is deceived in his
 view of this ques tion
 My colleague says the argurnent
 is to com mence next
 Monday Now if hc thinks
 that law yers are going
 to make short work of
 a case that involves hc
 is greatly mistaken There will
 be plenty o time for
 argument and plenty of time
 if necessary for Inore testimony
 Sen ators say that there
 is all t his vast
 amount of money received by
 Mr McCormick I did not
 i do not know how
 they know know it before
 it unless they have heard
 It from somebody else But
 if it be so that
 he has received this amount
 of money and our committee
 ascertain it to be the
 fact and the Comrnissioner ascertains
 it to be the fact
 I take it for granted
 that the patent will not
 be extended 1 take that
 for certain In the next
 place if our committee ascertain
 between t his and Monday
 as they can that pass
 ing this resolution does no
 injury as these Sen ators
 say I shall be ready
 to vote for it but
 I am not to be
 humbugged into the passing of
 a reso lution on ec
 parte statements and upon represent
 ations of the necessity of
 haste surprising the Senate into
 the passage of a proposition
 which t ve may find
 afterwards to be productive of
 the utmost mischief almost always
 find that when things are
 pressed in t hat way
 it is because they do
 not bear much examination I
 shall vote there set aside
 foÉ the consideFation bf thé
 endüi The PRESIDING OFFICER Mt
 That motion will not be
 in ordér Thé quöétidn is
 on setting the Private v
 Calendar t0 day and continuing
 the consideratiön of this joint
 es olution Mr FITCH It
 is pöSSible that saying that
 a single objection wouldnéarj y

 A ingle objection Wiltöärry it
 over of course if it
 has been read the first
 ind second times to day
 but if ithas Éeceived i
 is6i ät and second readings

 it would but desire to
 call the attentiOWÖf the Senate
 for one moment to one
 other pöintf in the case
 and especially to call the
 attentiön ffthe members of the
 Committee on the Judiciary and
 ofotherfai r mir ded Senators
 to that pdint When f
 had the honor of serving
 iti the other end Of
 the Capitol some years since
 thiSsame man McCor mick applied
 to Congress to give him
 ah exten Sion of his
 original patent and the ground
 offhe application was that he
 liäd delaved his appl ca
 lion for a renewal at
 the Patent Öffcé too latét
 to get all his testimony
 before the Commissioner and have
 it properly examined and therefoi
 e the Commissioner could not
 grant it We ruledhim to
 the strict letter of the
 law and woüid notgivé him
 the extension Now suppose we
 Violate the law to bis
 prejudice when he has complied
 with it what will be
 the consequence Will it not
 be very hard toward him
 The PRESIDINGOFFIC ER The Chair
 will answer the inquiry which
 was made by the Sen
 ator from Michigan by saying
 that he is informed by
 the Secretary that this joint
 resolution has had two readings
 before to day and therefore
 if the question comes on
 its third reading a single
 ob jection does not control
 it The question now is
 on the motion to suspend
 the oi der assigning to
 day for the consideration ofthe
 Private Calendåt the yeas and
 nays have been ordéred and
 the Clerk will call the
 roll l he Secretary i
 oceeded to call the roll
 Mr BAKER when his name
 was called I have paired
 off with the seniör Senator
 from Cal ifornia Mr Gw1N
 on the direct question and
 I think it is proper
 t erefore to refrain from
 voting on the inciderltbl one
 Mr FITCH The Senator from
 California is aware of the
 presence of the Senator from
 Oregon und deems his pair
 at an end unless it
 has been renewed this mornino
 Mr BAKER The Senator from
 California said that as we
 usually voted opposite to each
 other we mizht as well
 pair off on this question
 Mr FITCH very well 1
 was not aware of l
 be result was announced yeas
 26 nays 16 as follows
 discussion of this McCormick matter
 feetly satisfied of that and
 now in the name of
 private claimants who are here
 before Congress who have certainly
 some claim upon the consid
 eration of the body when
 they havc had but one
 day during the session last
 Friday was appro priated to
 another business and when this
 day was specially assigned for
 the consideration of private bills
 something like a week ago
 I akk for them some
 consideration by the Senate and
 by the Senator from Ohio
 himself I am satisfied that
 the matter he is now
 pressing will take up the
 greater partof the day if
 not the whole of it
 The indications all around me
 are to that effect and
 I really think that under
 the circumstances the motion of
 the Senator from Ohio oughl
 not to pre vaii I
 make an appeal to the
 Senate and I feel it
 my duty to do so
 as in some degree represent
 Mr WADE 1 am satisfied
 sir more a long time
 than the one which is
 contained in this resolution of
 the House of Representatives I
 am also satisfied and so
 is everybody else that this
 great question now must turn
 upon the vote about to
 be taken whether this motion
 shali prevail or not because
 if the resolution now gets
 the go by there is
 the end of it t
 have no desire to consume
 time and I have refrained
 from reading the afli davits
 of the attorneys who have
 opposed this re i the
 majority newal but in those
 affidavits they make outa case
 such as would suffice in
 any court under heaven fore
 against suspending the regular order

 motion to refer the joint
 resolution to the proper com

 OFFICER so the Senate suspends
 the order assigning to day
 for the con sideration of
 the Private Calendar and the
 ques Mr PUGH to refer
 this joint resolution to the
 Commit tee on Patents and
 the Patent Offce Mr BIGLER
 hope by general consent table
 will be read and an
 order made to print the
 document and then we can
 proceed with this question which
 will undoubtedly lead to further
 discussion The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator from Pennsylvania asks unanimous
 consent for the readine of
 the President s message Mr
 WADE Let us have the
 vote upon this The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Chair un derstands
 the Senator from Ohio to
 interpose an objection to the
 consideration of the President s
 message Mr WADE Yes sir
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on referring the joint
 resolution to the Com mittee
 on Patents and the Patent
 Offce Mr BIGLER Before that
 vote is taken with 808
 opt entering into the merits
 of the question 1 de
 sire to say as chairman
 of the Committee on Patents
 in order that all parties
 may understand exactly the aspect
 of this question that I
 shall feel required to call
 the committee toeether imme diato
 ßy and report the facts
 in this case back to
 the Senate to morrow morning
 Therefore there be only this
 poincnow to be decided whether
 there are any facts which
 are not known to the
 Senate that may be presented
 by the committee l tbinbit
 right to say that the
 joint resolution if referred shall
 be promptly reported back to
 the Semte in order that
 the decision of the body
 may terminate its fate and
 not the action of the
 com mittee Mr WA DE
 do not think there is
 any ne I believe it
 cessity for referring this resolution
 pgrfectly understood by the Senate
 and there fore there is
 no use in referring it
 and hence all who intend
 to have the testimony complete
 before the Commissioner will vote
 against the motion to re
 r Mr FITCH I sincerely
 trust the Senator from Ohio
 will let the resolution take
 the usual course now since
 this statement on the part
 of the chairman of the
 Comrnittee on Patents That is
 all the Senator ought to
 desire and I trust cer
 tainly the Senator will not
 drivc those opposed to the
 summary passage of this resolution
 into meas ures which they
 might otherwise be unwilling to
 resort to in order to
 prevent a finål vote to
 day Mr WADE I wish
 to state that it is
 not any distrust of the
 committee which impels me to
 ask for the immediate consideration
 of the resolution but know
 that in matters of this
 kind delays are exceedingly dangerous
 and that time is of
 the very essernce of thc
 whole matter I must there
 fore insist on a decision
 now Mr DOUGLAS 1 feel
 constrained Mr ident to say
 a few words before the
 vote is taken on the
 question of reference Some years
 two Mr McCormick rnade an
 application t o Congress to
 renew his original pater t
 after it had expired I
 took a very decided part
 inedefeating that re newal by
 an act of Congress voted
 for an act of Congress
 to renew a pat ent
 1 have always believed that
 these controversies about patents ought
 to be referred to the
 Patent Offce arid to the
 courts of justice and that
 the Senate ought not to
 be converted into a court
 for the trial of these
 contested cases I made the
 ob jection to Mr McCormick
 s renewal after his pat
 ent lmad expired that the
 right to man facture these
 machines had vested in the
 public and Congress had no
 pov rcr to divest hat
 right arid give it back
 to him exclusively and I
 cast the blame on him
 of having been guilty of
 negligence in not apply ing
 to the Patent Oifice in
 tiine to his renewul as
 be lost the oriqrirtal patent
 hen and now only holds
 a pate lt for certair
 improvenncnts on his it seems
 that he orrrinal rnach has
 taken a hint ft orn
 the lesson then taugl lt
 him a ad I plied
 no v at Ibo proper
 for a rene wa l
 In tn ne und the
 act that he l as
 niade cation one year ud
 of tbc expiration thc patent
 IS t lOW brought up
 in conde n against him
 Certainly 3ne of two things
 is true eithcr his application
 at f he Patent Office
 a year in advance of
 the ex of the patent
 is no good and valid
 objection now or I did
 hirn rent injus tice uræino
 neo lWence a oamst him
 before bc cause he had
 not made the application previous
 to the expiration of the
 patent I do not know
 why the Senate should interfere
 With the due process of
 law in the extension of
 patents I am aware that
 there is a great conflict
 between manufacturers of every patented
 article and the patentee Those
 who hold a patent de
 sire the cxclusive privilege according
 to heir right and those
 who are engaged in the
 manufac ture of articles and
 pirating on a patent wish
 to deft at every renewal
 they possibly can It is
 a contest between manufacturers generally
 I know that my constituents
 are interested on both sides
 of the question Mr McCormick
 being one of my constituents
 residing in my own town
 has his establishment there and
 there are rival estab lishments
 engaged in the manuracture that
 would ike LO use his
 improv nnents and all his
 pat cnts without being bound
 to pay the patent fee
 I am not disposed as
 a Senator to interfere be
 tween these respective claims and
 rights I hc law has
 provided the mode in which
 they shall be adjusted I
 have refused heretofore to entertain
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 8 the
 claims when they have come
 before me and I do
 not feel disposed now by
 any action of mine to
 arrest the due execution of
 the laws of the land
 as they stand Nor do
 I see any necessity for
 It seems that the counsel
 for this interference thc contestants
 of Mr McCormick s patent
 have declared that they have
 proof covering the whole case
 that all the additional proof
 they wish to take hereafter
 is merely cumulative and that
 they have no apprehension that
 the case can be decided
 against them The issue it
 seems has been fairly made
 up under the law Why
 should we inter fere to
 defeat the judgment of the
 proper tribunal whatever it may
 be upon the issues that
 the par ties have Inade
 up and the proofs they
 have filed I do not
 hear any complaint of any
 Impropriety or unfairness in thc
 taking of the testimony and
 I can see no reason
 why we should interfere with
 this matter for the purpose
 of reopening the issues between
 the parties My colleague has
 referred to the amount of
 Mr McCormick s receipts from
 the manufacture I apprehend and
 sale of machines as patentee
 that the great amount of
 those profits v ras under
 his original patent which has
 long since expired and which
 h is ri vals are
 now usinty without making I
 apprehend that buff a him
 any compensation very small portion
 of those profits have arisen
 under tbc patents for the
 improvements which are now matters
 of controversy Hence I do
 not think that has anything
 to do with the question
 and very clearly it ought
 not to be considered by
 us for the reason that
 the question of the suffciency
 or insufficiency of the profits
 to afford an adequate remuneration
 is by law left to
 the in that form it
 will be accepted All I
 desire is to have the
 joint resolution and papers go
 before the proper committee Mr
 YVADE I hope that will
 not be agreed to It
 is said that this is
 afl fbr the benefit of
 man ufacturers but does not
 the Senator from Illinois know
 that the cost of these
 patents comes out of the
 pockets of those who use
 them and not of manufacturers
 Fifteen dollars are paid on
 every patent reaper that is
 used in the United States
 and that sum is taken
 frorn the farmers wbo use
 them That is all I
 wish to say on that
 point Nobody need be täken
 in by the sug restion
 that this is a scramble
 between rival manufacturers It is
 a question between the farmers
 of the coun try and
 a man who is already
 admitted to have got nearly
 four million dollars out of
 this same patent Mr DOUGLAS
 I do not think this
 is a ques tion between
 the farmers and a man
 who is ad mitted to
 have got 4 000 000
 out of the patent I
 do not think we should
 ever have heard a word
 about it if there were
 no rival establishments The question
 is whether these rival establish
 ments who do not own
 the patent may pirate upon
 it without any remuneration to
 the man who made tbc
 invention and holds the patent
 The law gives the right
 to the patentee to apply
 for a renewal in the
 event that he has not
 been suff ciently remunerated for
 the patent Whether he has
 been remunerated or not is
 by left to the Commissioner
 of Patents to ho has
 made his application in pursuance
 of law There is no
 pretense of any unfairness or
 any departure from law or
 of any irregularity W by
 not then discretion and judcment
 of the Commissioner of leave
 it to the Commissioner The
 application was not made to
 the acting Commissioner but to
 Patents I shall not go
 into a review of the
 testimony I the Commissioner of
 Patents appointed by the I
 hold that the Senate is
 incapable of goinc r into
 President and confirmed bv the
 Senate the details of the
 figures to ascertain thal fact
 that Now as to the
 that it is said he
 has it is properly left
 by law to fiirm exente
 d for II received that
 I thillk is calculated to
 mislead It is his business
 to decide the that purpose
 question and I would no
 more interfere with his right
 to decide that question under
 the law than woul f
 with tbc judgrnent of a
 court or Vivo an opinion
 upon the merits of a
 judgment ought to be in
 advance of the Of the
 judgment with a view to
 the re d itio I
 cat not understand psst ponerncnt
 of the trial why in
 this casc we arc to
 interfere and prevent a decision
 in due course of law
 If we are to do
 it in this case wre
 shall have applications in every
 If a party is about
 to get beaten or other
 case a party has some
 advantao e to gain by
 the position of the legislative
 power in the case we
 shalE be called upon to
 interfere at the instance of
 1 one party or the
 othcn to control the decisions
 of department on matters that
 beloncr to them uudt_n the
 law with which we have
 no right to Nely obicc
 t is to wash Iny
 bands of this whole If
 the Patent Office laws are
 wrong lot us a tnend
 tho not by provisions to
 eases not with a view
 of interferinn Wilh one Inan
 s rights and secnrincr special
 priv ilecres 10 another but
 let us correct those laws
 by trencral pro visions applicable
 hereafter to all cases Why
 is it brought in here
 What has the ques of
 profits to do with this
 body in determining upon this
 question unless wre are going
 in fact to set aside
 the law and come to
 conclusions on a staunnent of
 profits instead of lea ving
 that ques tion to the
 law officer to whom it
 belongs Mr TRUMBULL lfmy colleague
 will allow me if he
 alludes to the statement I
 made I think he did
 not understand the connection in
 which I used it The
 law which authorizes an exten
 Sion of a patent requires
 a statement of accounts to
 be made to the Commissioner
 and the Commis sioncr must
 be satisfied that a reasonable
 remu has not been received
 by the patentee for his
 labor and expense in introducing
 the inven tion use before
 he would be authorized to
 extend the patent Hence he
 application bccn made a year
 befijre the patent expired he
 could not make up that
 account very well That was
 the use which I made
 of it Mr DOUGLAS On
 that point Mr President I
 have a word to say
 in reply to rny colle
 aoae f II ink he
 hus totally misapprehended the true
 state of the question All
 of the account has been
 made up that can be
 made up even if you
 make this extension before the
 decision is made The re
 and leaving the part ies
 havino interests involved sults of
 the sale of reapers correspond
 to the crop to bring
 themsetvcs within the provisions of
 the But sir I have
 an aversion to this interfer
 ence in a special case
 cither for the benefit of
 mau afa cturers rival manuiåcturingcstablisbment
 s or of patentees ot
 to the injury of patentees
 I have struggled to keep
 these patent controversies out of
 Congress ever since I have
 been here I have never
 yet entertained a proposition to
 decide for or against a
 patent in this body 1
 think it better belongs to
 the courts and to the
 Departments than I fear that
 it would be a matter
 of favorit to us it
 would lead to electioneering we
 shall I have a lobby
 surrounding us and urginff us
 to interfere in this case
 or that case to give
 an ad vantage to this
 or a disadvantacc to that
 man and we shall never
 get rid of it in
 the world un I less
 we leave it to the
 regular courts of law and
 to those departments that are
 created by law to I
 decide these controversies Mr FITCH
 I believe the question is
 on the i reference of
 the joint resolution to the
 Committee on Patents The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Yes sir Me FI
 I CH 1 move question
 be mod ified so as
 to refer with instructions to
 report the i joint resolution
 back to morrow morning I
 hope i I do not
 know him by Bight I
 do not know his of
 wheat and grain that would
 be cut by the reap
 ers When the year is
 through and he harvest is
 obtained the accounts of the
 year arc made up No
 accounts can bc made from
 the next year g reapers
 until a year from now
 when the patent will have
 expired Hence if you postpone
 it until April until the
 4th of Tnlv or the
 1st of September you do
 not bring into your account
 any one reaper that is
 not brought into the pres
 ent account He has brought
 up his account to the
 last year which expires before
 the expiration of the patent
 The next year s work
 cannot be brought in between
 now and September it can
 not be brought into the
 account before the 1st of
 January and the patent expires
 in October and therefore it
 is an entire misapprehension to
 sup pose that he has
 not brought into this account
 every dollar that can be
 brought in even if you
 grant an extension If on
 the contrary it should be
 supposed that what might be
 manufactured be tween now and
 the 1st of October ought
 to be taken into account
 the Commissioner could esti mate
 the average of the previous
 years or of the last
 year and compute that up
 to the 1st of Octo
 ber 1 do not know
 who the Commissioner is I
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 4ame
 but I have not apprehension
 but what he make ajüGt
 deciSo n on the question
 of prof it He will
 have the data all before
 him on which he can
 decide the case Why not
 allow him then to decide
 it It can not be
 true that more testimony is
 wanted with reference to bringingin
 new profits that have arisen
 dioce the last account The
 statement here is that ic
 is not to bring in
 any new testimony it is
 not to giake any new
 accounts but it is merely
 cumula tige of w hat
 they have already got What
 is the use of cumulati
 ve evidence if they have
 got enough to show the
 fact if the fact has
 been cstablished by two witnesses
 Perhaps they might get cumu
 rative evidence to the amount
 of two hundred wit nesses
 but that does not establish
 the fact any more firmly
 or any more satisfactorily Then
 again as to the 4
 000 000 of receipts the
 amount of receipts is not
 conclusive as to the amount
 of profits on a patent
 The receipts should be consid
 ered in connection with every
 kind of expense the cost
 of the patent the cost
 of manufacturc the ma terial
 the work the capital invested
 interest upon the capital rent
 and all other items of
 necessary expenditure He might have
 4 000 000 of re
 ceipts and not a dollar
 of profit or he might
 have 4 000 000 of
 receipts and of profit Receipts
 are not the basis on
 which to settle the question
 of profits or the sumciency
 of the remu neration and
 the very loose manner in
 which Senators speak of the
 total receipts shows how improper
 it is for us to
 attempt to decide that ques
 tion Let it go to
 the Commissioner let him under
 his oath of offce ascertain
 by a cureful ex nrninution
 of the testimony the amount
 of receipts the amount of
 expenditu rcs the arnount of
 profi ts and ascertain how
 much of that profit has
 arisen on the patent now
 in question and how mach
 of It arose under patents
 which have expired and which
 the public are usitv gratis
 and t hen he may
 determine what is just belween
 the parties My objection is
 to the Senate taking cognizance
 of the question of profits
 of this question of rival
 interests between patentees and manufacturers
 i wish to leave it
 where the law of the
 land has placed it i
 the hands of the proper
 offcer Let him be governed
 by the testimony and if
 he abases the discretion reposed
 in him by the laws
 let hirn be impeached and
 we shall attend to his
 case when it shall come
 before us in due form
 Mr BINGHAM desire to ask
 the Senator from Illinois a
 question Mr DOUGLAS Certainly Mr
 BINGHAM I want to ask
 him itin this contest between
 rival manufacturers and McCor mick
 they have to pay him
 fifteen dollars for every machine
 they make whether that does
 not come out of the
 farmers Mr DOUGLAS In the
 first place I have not
 inquired whether they pay him
 fifteen dollars apiece or anything
 1 do not know what
 they pay I do not
 know the amount of lhc
 patent fees I do not
 know whether the other manufacturers
 t he use of it
 or pirating upon it are
 payirv i IF ve not
 inq kired into it and
 know nothing about it That
 belongs to tl ke ofliccr
 of the law to asccrlaiu
 and the very inquiry of
 the Senotcn frorn Mich igan
 shows that he does not
 know either W hy should
 he and I go to
 settling a question of other
 men s rights when neither
 of us know anything of
 what we are doing Mr
 BINGHAM My question was whether
 the farmers would not have
 to pay the expense Mr
 DOUGLAS On that point will
 answer the Senator I do
 not think it necessarily follows
 that the farmers pay the
 expense for I have no
 The first question is on
 the motion to amend by
 giving instructions to the committee
 Mr BIGLER I understood the
 Senator from Indiana to make
 the first motion and then
 subse quently to modify it
 by adding instructions to the
 J believe that is the
 question committee therefore but one
 motion The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator modifies his motion so
 as to embrace both insta
 uc tions and a motion
 to refer in one general
 motion The Chair then understands
 twat the Senator from Indiana
 moves the reference of this
 resolu tion to the Committee
 on Patents and the Paten_t
 Office with instructions to report
 it back to mor row
 morning Mr PUGH If the
 instruction is merely to report
 it to morrow I shall
 make no objection though I
 think it is unnecessary The
 question being put the Presiding
 Offcer declared that the ayes
 appeured Jo have It Mr
 PUGH ask for tbe yeas
 and nays on the question
 The yeas and nays were
 ordered Mr NICHOLSON 1 wish
 to state that on this
 question I have paired off
 writh the Senator from California
 Mr LATHAM who would vote
 in the negative The question
 being taken by yeas and
 nays resulted yeas 18 nays

 So the Senate refused to
 refer the resolution to the
 Committee on Patents with instructions
 Mr BIGLER I desire to
 explain in a single I
 shall vote word my vote
 on this resolution acruinst it
 because of the character of
 the legisla tion and because
 of the views presented by
 the i think it is
 setting r a Senator from
 Delaware most dangerous precedent and
 one which will come back
 probably to plague succeedirp Con
 gresses While this in itself
 may not ao any special
 wrong it is the worst
 possible system of legislation that
 can be initiated My own
 State has had sad experience
 of this killd of special
 For this rea interference and
 special legislation son I cannot
 vote for the resolution I
 have had occasion to look
 into this question to some
 extent and I will say
 because i deem it justice
 to myself to say it
 that were I the offcer
 of the law I should
 not extend this patent I
 think it is perfectly clear
 case acrainst it I have
 read the papers and satisfied
 myself that there is no
 substantial reason why chis patent
 should be ex tended but
 that isa question for the
 proper ofiicer and have no
 reason to presume that he
 will not perform his duties
 in good faith and carry
 out the I shall therefore
 vote law in its letter
 and spirit atra inst this
 resolution The joint resolution was
 reported to the Senate without
 amendment Mr DOUGLAS How long
 is the time ex tended
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The resolution
 will be read at length
 The Secretary read it as
 follows Be it resoloed ec
 That the further timc of
 ninety days bc given to
 parties interested in resisting the
 extension of the patent of
 Cyrus II McCormick for his
 patent reaper or his unprovements
 or modifications of the saine
 to enable them to take
 testimony in opposili01i to said
 extension to be used before
 the Cotnmissioncrot Patents on the
 hearing of the application of
 said McCormick for an extension
 of Mr DOUGLAS Clerk tö
 reduce I move to insert
 after the iword G it
 the words or supporting so
 that it That the further
 time of ninety daj_s be
 given t epariies interested in
 resistipg or eupponjng the Mr
 WADE I hope that be
 adopted There is nonecessity_ for
 i whateveri This party has
 asked for no time buFis
 a decision and if he
 does m wants time there
 doubt at all that the
 Cotnniissioner will him a He
 has full authority to do
 its and undoåbt edly would
 permit him at his timony
 within the time limited by
 ills Therefore I am opposed
 to the amendment becÅuse fiföit
 should have to go back
 to the House Of Repfé
 sentatives again it probably would
 not be acted I trust
 therefore that ffe friende upon
 in time of the resolution
 will vote aoainst this amendment
 Mr DOUGLAS m undersund that
 is an objection to allowing
 the patentee to thave the
 privilege of taking testimODY Mr
 GRIMES Senator from Illinois will
 allow me wish td ask
 himaquestioh tizvhether he really thinks
 that Mr McCbrmicksqiould be denied
 the right or privilege of
 taking timony under the resolution
 as it nowstånds Mr DOUGLAS
 I understand it is so
 plainly Mr GRIMES I understand
 it is not a nega
 tive pregnant at all Mr
 DOUGLAS It strikes me the
 language is peculiar and as
 if it were very artfully
 drawn 10 allow testimony on
 one side and exclude it
 on the other and certainly
 if such is not the
 design there is harm in
 inserting the words Mr FESSENDEN
 The Senator will allow me
 to ask him a question
 whether if we do not
 pass this resolution the Commissioner
 has not perfect authority if
 he chooses to exertit to
 ex tend the time ninety
 days or more for the
 purpose of allowing Mr McCormick
 to take testimoßy That is
 the question If we do
 not pass the res olution
 can he not do it
 if he pleases Mr DOUGLAS
 Is the Senator through Mr
 FESSENDEN That is one question
 1 wanted to ask another
 Mr DOUGLAS One at a
 time if you please Mr
 FESSENDEN very well IV lr
 DOUGLAS I have not looked
 at the law to see
 what the Commissioner s powers
 are I am not familiar
 with the question of thé
 renewal of patents never tried
 za patc nt case in
 mylife I never had an
 application before the Commis I
 f the Commissioner has that
 power under sroner the law
 I am willing to let
 him exercise the power under
 the law and I do
 not vant to interfere vith
 him It may be however
 that he has that disr
 cretion under the law as
 it now stands and it
 would be justly exercised if
 you allowed the law to
 stand but it does not
 follow that such wili be
 the law after you pass
 this resolution By thig doubt
 it is a question of
 profits between manufac said patent
 turers and that the interests
 of farmers are not Mr
 DOUGLAS It seems it is
 extended to involved enable them
 to take testimony in opposition
 Are Mr WADE I barely
 wish to say that the
 in structions tothe committee moved
 by the Senator they not
 willing to let testimony in
 support of it from Indiana
 do not relieve the question
 atall be to be taken
 too It is very strange
 that ninety cause if they
 should adopt this motion it
 is very days should be
 given for testimony on one
 side It is I so
 understand it probable that we
 might adjourn over to morrow
 and none on the other
 and that would be fatal
 as fatal as a vote
 aøainst i very extraordinary if
 this is a proposition to
 give I it We might
 lose it in a great
 many ways We a fair
 trial to enable justice to
 be done that we i
 missionér has a perfect power
 to take all the testi
 resolution you are passing a
 law that in this case
 testimony may be takcn on
 one side but and by
 inference not on the other
 The Commissioner has decided this
 question and you propoéélto re
 open it so far as
 to take testimony on one
 side Of the case and
 not to reopen it as
 to the other side of
 the case and I want
 to see what this means
 I presume it is all
 fair I cannot comprehend it
 We are told the object
 is fair trial It e
 let the testimony be taken
 on both sides Those of
 us who have practiced law
 know how important it is
 when new testimony comes in
 on one side to be
 permitted to get rebuttincr testimony
 in on the other The
 fate of nearly every law
 case de pends upon that
 privilege and if the applicant
 who is required to make
 out his case cannot be
 permitted to bring in rebutting
 testimony you might as well
 legislate his rights away from
 him Mr FESSENDEN I care
 nothing in the world I
 voted with my friend from
 about this matter Ohio because
 I thought he was right
 but really if the Senator
 from Illinois bc ievcs in
 the point taken by him
 now it is a mystery
 to me how he ever
 practiced law Why sir everybody
 knows who knows anythine or
 pretends to know anything upon
 what this is founded The
 Com are driven to decide
 it now or never That
 is all should not allow
 him to rebut the new
 testimony to be taken I
 move to amend by saying
 that the there is about
 it and therefore I hoée
 this mo first forty five
 days of the extension may
 be ern tion to refer
 will be negatived The PRESIDING
 OFFICER ft is moved to
 I ployed by the contestants
 and the other forty five
 refer the joint resolution to
 the Committee on by McCormick
 so that they may divide
 the time It is moved
 to The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator Patents and the Patent
 Ofiice from Illinois will reduce
 his amendment to writ amend
 that motion by adding instructions
 to re ing port the
 resolution back to morrow morning
 mony that he chooses and
 to postpone from t ime
 to time until he is
 satisfied any time before he
 has decided the case That
 is unquestionably so nobody disputes
 it I ask the Senator
 whether he has any doubt
 of it He will not
 admit that and I must
 believe that when he practiced
 law he loarned never to
 admit anything for fear of
 the 810 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 8 consequences because my
 next question to him 70üld
 be whether mif he had
 that power which he clearly
 has the passing of this
 resolution would take itawayfromhim This
 resolution is founded on thisidea
 the Cömmissioner refuses at the
 re questofthecontestant to postpone the
 case The contestants come here
 and ask Congress to inter
 fere and say that he
 shall allow them time Then
 the Senator makes a point
 will you not allow the
 otherparty time Does anygentleman deny
 if we grant the ninety
 days here by an act
 and then the applicant Wants
 further time that the Commissioner
 has Ferfect power to grant
 it We donot take it
 away from him in any
 shape or form Therefore there
 is nothing in the world
 in this point now such
 as might apply to the
 ear but has no sort
 of application to the Mr
 DOIJGLAS I have noticed that
 when men find themselves incapable
 of maintaining an aroument they
 hEive the indecency to talk
 about inen ever practicing law
 ought to know something Mr
 FESSENDEN Mr President Mr DOUGLAS
 understand those allu sions Mr
 FESSENDEN But 1 do not
 understand the gentleman s mode
 of speaking Mr DOUGLAS 1
 will tell you Mr FESSENDEN
 What does the gentle man
 mean by the word indecency
 Mr DOUGLAS I will tell
 you what I mean He
 said if I ever practiced
 law I ought to know
 something about It and that
 was an indecent in sinuation
 he should not have made
 Mr FESSENDEN The Senator and
 1 may differ in our
 opinion about it but as
 to the ques tion who
 is decent and who is
 indecent I am ready to
 put myself against him at
 any time here or elsewhere
 Mr DOUGLAS I am not
 willing to put my self
 against him on that comparison
 Mr FESSENDEN The Senator would
 not im rove his position
 he PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 must arrest the altercation between
 the Senators Mr DOUGLAS I
 insist that the Senator be
 called to order The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Illinois
 is entitled to the floor
 I sup Mr FESSENDEN very
 well sir pose I must
 let him go on until
 he gets through The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Does the Sen ator
 from Illinois yield the floor
 to the Senator from Maine
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 do not
 ask him to yic ld
 it Mr DOUGLAS Mr President
 1 had dis cussed this
 question in entire good temper
 I had shown clearly to
 the satisfaction of every candid
 man that under this joint
 resolution us it stands testimony
 can l e t uken
 on one side and not
 on the other I had
 hoped that it was lone
 by inadvert 1 ency I
 had hoped that thero was
 no design l lence when
 I had hoped it was
 not a trick pointed it
 out did not il timatc
 that there had been a
 design I could wish had
 silice occurred to satisfy rne
 that it isa design to
 legis late Mr McCormick out
 of his rights and sir
 if it is not amended
 it will stand as evidence
 to the world that it
 is done for the purpose
 of de l rauding him
 out of his rights in
 tl fis trial I will
 read the language That the
 further tillie of ninety days
 be given to the par
 ties interested in resistinrr I
 havc proposed to insert the
 words or sup porting the
 extension of the patent of
 Cyrus H McCormick for his
 patent reaper or his nnprovmncnts
 or modifications of the same
 to enable them to take
 testimony in opposition to said
 extension to be used bcfhre
 the Connnissioner of Patents on
 the hearing of the application
 of the said Mc Cormick
 tor an extension of said
 patent Now you propose to
 give an extension of time
 for a purpose You specify
 the purpose in the i
 law The case is now
 closed The final decis ion
 has been made against opening
 the testimony for either side
 You propose by the law
 to open it for one
 side and allow testimony to
 be brought in against the
 applications and not to allow
 it to be brought in
 for the application No matter
 what the law now may
 be you change it by
 this joint resolution After I
 had told him I did
 not know what the existing
 law vvras for I never
 had u patent case never
 was the agent of a
 patentee in my life but
 always resisted them the Senator
 then said I did not
 choose to know Sir when
 I had told him frankly
 I did not know that
 I was not a lobby
 member and not in the
 employment of patentees or contestants
 and lobby agentS of any
 kind and hence I did
 not know I supposed that
 would have been sufficiently explicit
 without the insinuation that I
 did not choose to know
 and would not admit anything
 an insinuation uncalled for I
 had hoped that this resolution
 meant what was said on
 its face that it meant
 to open it to both
 sides to allow rebutting testimony
 Hence I move to insert
 the words or supportinø the
 application so that then it
 will allow testimony to be
 taken by those resisting the
 application or in support of
 it Then it wilVbe fair
 both parties will stand on
 an equality and have a
 trial accord ing to the
 law as it now stands
 If those words arc not
 inserted I apprehend it will
 receive an oppo I site
 construction i The House of
 Representatives are now in session
 There iVill be no trouble
 in making the amendment and
 let it go there and
 be concurred in and become
 a law before the sun
 sets to day It might
 be done before we have
 done talking about this question
 if the amend ment were
 not resisted Mr FESSENDEN The
 Senatorfrom Illinois used the word
 indecency with reference to what
 I said before and I
 might well ask anybody who
 heard him whether the insinuation
 that oth ers not himself
 were lobby agents and patent
 agents here was decent as
 applicable to other members of
 the Senate whoever he might
 have meant That I suppose
 is a specimen of the
 Senator s idea of decency
 in debate and coupled with
 a loud voice and an
 imperious manner I suppose it
 goos to make it out
 to the satisfaction of everybody
 Now sir if the Senator
 had had the good sense
 because even a Treat man
 may sometimes show a want
 of that common quality to
 have been aware that what
 I said before was in
 perfect good and intended to
 be so and sportive in
 its character instead of getting
 into a rage tild as
 suminx that sort of manner
 towards me I tl iink
 he would have apneared a
 great leal better than he
 did He ougl it to
 have known that I cared
 nothing about this thing and
 he did perfectly well know
 it I know nothihg about
 the merits of tho case
 itself in any shape or
 form The resolution coming up
 I attempted to expose what
 I supv osed to bc
 and what i now think
 to be unless the Seri
 ator tells me that it
 is not so a ruse
 of his in order to
 obtain an amendment to t
 he resoluti01 1 and thus
 obtain delay and thereby l
 Ofeat it appeared so to
 lne and why II appeared
 so to me because that
 was palpable on the face
 of it I could not
 believe not that mean to
 question the Senator s word
 in any particular I could
 not suppose when he said
 carclessly that he did not
 lü i0 v what the
 law was that he meant
 anything n lou e than
 that hc did not choose
 to answer with reference to
 thatparticular point because it seemed
 it is unnecessary that a
 to me so perfectly plain
 man should be a patent
 lawyer to know a thing
 so very common and apparent
 to cverybody as that seemed
 to mc to be Now
 sir how does it stand
 when look at it calmly
 I am very sorry that
 I svas be traycd into
 a n y loudness of
 voice bub man is an
 imitative animal he cannot help
 being loud some times when
 his neighbors arc Laughter Let
 us look at this mighty
 question of law that has
 been raised here with reference
 to this matter seems that
 there was an application pending
 be fore the Commissioner of
 Patents for the renewal It
 does not require a great
 many of a patent years
 experience in the Senate to
 know that the Commissioner of
 Patents has power to renew
 a patent at the end
 of fourteen years under certain
 circumstances and I think it
 does not require very extensive
 knowledge or practice of law
 to be aware that any
 court or any inan who
 is hearino a casc before
 him which he is not
 bound to term inate for
 a year may wait thirty
 sixty or ninety days on
 the application of either party
 for the purpose of taking
 testimony Now what are the
 facts here These contestants come
 before Con gress and say
 that they have this important
 ques tion pending that tho
 Commissioner has refused to extend
 the time for them to
 take testimony and that their
 rights are in danger of
 being sacri ficed and a
 resolution is accordingly brought in
 directing that for the benefit
 o the contestants the time
 shall be extended Does the
 Senator from Illinois really seriously
 mean to argue that if
 the resolution passes in that
 shape and the question is
 opened the Commissioner cannot give
 Mr McCormick all the time
 he requires The Senator does
 not answer and I have
 a right there fore to
 conclude that he does not
 mean seriously to contend that
 t he passage of this
 resolution would if it would
 have no such have any
 such effect effect what in
 the world is to be
 gained except delay and defeat
 by amending this resolution and
 sending it back to the
 House of Representatives Nothing Mr
 DOUGLAS 1 wish the Senator
 from Maine to understand that
 I did say that it
 struck me very clearly that
 the passage of the resolution
 does have that effect Mr
 FESSENDEN Does the Senator mean
 to say that it strikes
 him so now Mr DOUGLAS
 Certainly clearly so Mr FESSENDEN
 very well Mr President then
 all I have to say
 about it is that am
 sorry I cannot agree with
 the Senator that the matter
 is perfectly plain to me
 thc other way and that
 I am utterly surprised to
 hear a Senator of his
 in telligence and his knowledge
 express such an It seems
 to mc surprism and I
 am opnpion still more surprised
 to hear him charge me
 as he does very distinctly
 and those who have voted
 for this resolution with the
 cool and deliberate intention to
 get up a case here
 where testimony may be taken
 on one side and cannot
 be taken on the other
 simply because his amendment is
 op posed and opposed on
 the ground that it is
 not necessary Sir was it
 necessary to make such an
 imputation of motive of bad
 motive upon the majority of
 the Senate who had voted
 for this resolution It is
 an imputation of the grossest
 kind I fccl that if
 I could vote understandingly for
 a resolution changing in one
 particular the course of legal
 proceedings for they are legal
 proceedings and gi ving rights
 to one party which I
 did not give to another
 I should be committing a
 fraud on the legislation of
 the country and be guilty
 of an act for which
 I ought to be held
 up the reprobation of the
 community and it is no
 light thing for the Senator
 from Iklinois within the bounds
 of decency to make such
 an imputa tion on the
 majority of the Senate who
 have just acted on a
 question of this description That
 sir is the explanation which
 I have to give to
 the Senator for what my
 vote has been and will
 be upon this resolution and
 also of all that I
 designed to say originally or
 in any por tion of
 the remarks I made with
 reference to the Senator from
 Illinois Mr DOUGLAS Mr President
 if the Sen ator had
 said when he knew that
 I considered his language objectionable
 that he had used it
 play fully that would have
 been an end of the
 contro versy and nothing unpleasant
 would have oc curred Mr
 FESSENDEN All 1 said now
 1 thought the Senator ought
 to have known without charg
 ino me with indecency in
 debate Mr DOUGLAS The manner
 was offensive as well as
 the matter and hence I
 took it that he wished
 the Senate to understand that
 he did use it in
 the fullest import of the
 words Let that go Now
 sir I did not charge
 anybody on the other side
 of the Chamber or anywhcrc
 else with im I said
 that I proper motives in
 this question neverdreamed that there
 was any other object than
 to give u fair trial
 by taking new testimony on
 both sides and hence I
 was amazed when I found
 the amendment resisted which would
 give the priv ilege of
 taking testimony on both sidés
 and i said that wished
 now that I could believe
 they in tended to give
 a fair trial The only
 reason I have for thinking
 the contrary is that they
 are not willing to allow
 the amendment to be made
 so as to give it
 T hc Senator from Maine
 wants to know whether the
 Commissioner under the resolution if
 it passes will not have
 the power to give an
 exten Sion of time to
 Mr McCormick to take testimony
 I answer that I as
 well as to the contestants
 think not He thinks the
 Commissioner will have that power
 Mr FESSENDEN The Senator will
 not un I did not
 ask whether he derstand my
 words did not have the
 pow er under the resolution
 T be resolution does not
 specifically give it but my
 question was whether if wc
 pass the resolution gil 1861
 he would not still have
 the power notwithstand ing the
 resolution Mr DOUGLAS Very well
 That is precisely the idea
 l intended to convey but
 I accept his words if
 they please him better He
 thinks that notwithstanding the resolution
 the Commissioner will have the
 power apprehend that he will
 not have it but the
 Senator does not say it
 will be compulsory on the
 Commissioner if the resolution I
 do not understand him as
 saying that the Commissioner will
 be compelled to allow him
 to have the privilege The
 Senator says nothing on that
 point The resolution is compulsory
 that this privilege shall given
 to the contestants but not
 compulsory that it shall be
 given to the pat entee
 But still the Senator proposes
 to give an extension for
 the ninety days until thcrc
 shall be a new Commissioner
 with compulsory power to give
 the privilege to one side
 and not compulsory on the
 other He does not contend
 that it is com pulsory
 to give the privilege of
 taking testimony on both sides
 The most that he contends
 is that it may bedone
 Suppose weextendthetimeninety days then there
 will be a new Commissioner
 a Commissioner appointed on the
 recommendation of the very mcn
 that now arc hurrying through
 this extension and he will
 be compelled to give the
 privilege to one side and
 not compcllcd to I trust
 there is no such in
 give it to the other
 tention as this no such
 object But what does it
 mean when Senators are not
 willing to insert the provision
 that testimony may be taken
 in support of the extension
 of the patent as well
 as against it If it
 is compulsory on one side
 I vv ant it com
 If you are going to
 leave pulsory on the other
 It to the discretion of
 the Commissioner on one side
 leave it to his discretion
 on the other I do
 not want to have a
 resolution passed in these equivocal
 terms that may decide a
 case involvino a man s
 whole fortune without giving him
 a chance to bc heard
 Nor does it reconcile me
 when the Senator asks if
 I seriously believe such is
 the construction I cannot comprehend
 how a lawyer can believe
 It is inconceivable to my
 mind anything else how any
 other construction can be put
 upon it Clearly it is
 admitted that there is no
 compulsion on the Commissioner to
 grant the privilege to Mr
 McCormick but it is compulsory
 to grant it to his
 contestants under this resolution and
 in view of the fact
 that there is to be
 a change of Com missioner
 in the mean time think
 the Senate ought to acquit
 itself of any suspicion on
 the part of anybody that
 there is any design in
 this fur ther than to
 give a fair trial That
 can be done I do
 not want to by adopting
 my amendment believe that there
 is any such design and
 I think the vote of
 tl e Senate will show
 by adopting the amendment that
 there is no such design
 Mr BAYARD Mr President it
 sccms to me that the
 amendment proposed by t he
 honorable Senator from Illinois ourht
 to be made to thisjoint
 resolution without reference to the
 question how gentlemen may suppose
 the Commissioner will decide if
 the amendment be there or
 be not there We must
 take the facts as they
 stand The Com missioner has
 ylready had before him the
 ques mony and he has
 twice decided it the proofs
 are closed under the existing
 law according to his decision
 He has closed the proofs
 on both sides Now the
 proposition is by special legislation
 to compel him to extend
 the time on one side
 alone I do not know
 the construction the Com missioner
 will give to this joint
 resolution Under the law as
 it stood before undoubtedly without
 reference to this resolution the
 Commissioner might have extended the
 time on either side He
 declined to do so thc
 proofs were closed and I
 suppose every equity lawyer understands
 the meaning of that The
 proofs were closed by ju
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE bound by it
 This resolution provides that as
 a matter of righ t
 one side alone may take
 testimony His discretion as to
 that is gone The time
 is specified that they shall
 have pinety days more All
 discretion is put an end
 to on one side alone
 It only shows what all
 this special legislation will end
 in this interference by Congress
 with the performance of duties
 judiciai in their nature Of
 course favoritism and partiality It
 can end in nothing else
 When the Commissioner comes to
 look at this law of
 yours he finds his discre
 Is he going to revise
 the tion gone on one
 side action of Congress and
 say I have already decided
 under the general laws on
 the facts be fore me
 that there is no ground
 whatever for opening the proofs
 in this case or extending
 the time and am compened
 without regard to dis cretion
 to extend it on one
 side alone does that render
 it obligatory on me is
 it my duty taking that
 law which binds me to
 the extent that it is
 compulsory and no further to
 throw the case open on
 the other side when Congress
 have seen 1 think fit
 to throsv it open on
 one side alone it very
 doubtful I will not say
 that he would be prohibited
 by this resolution from openibg
 the proofs on the other
 side but taking the just
 con clusion as applied to
 the facts as they exist
 now that the proof s
 have been closed on both
 sides I doubt whether the
 present Commissioner would open the
 proofs except to the extent
 that your law compelled him
 to do it But take
 a step further Suppose the
 existing Commissioner within the next
 forty days should be removed
 frorll offce and the application
 should be made under this
 resolution thc language of which
 is that the parties interested
 in resisting the extension of
 the patent the right is
 given to shall have a
 right to take testi them
 alone mony in opposition to
 the extension This is the
 resolution as it stands It
 is mandatory and of course
 he must let them take
 testimony for ninety days it
 gives thetn an absolute right
 be yond his discretion When
 he turns to the case
 otherwise under the former law
 which gave a discretion he
 may say I cannot let
 you take testimony on the
 other side because the decision
 of my predecessor has foreclosed
 the matter he has decided
 after hearing that the proofs
 were closed it is not
 for me to revise hisactlon
 founded on any equity arising
 out of this act of
 Congress for if Congress had
 meant that the proofS should
 be opened on both sides
 they would have so pro
 vided in the law and
 not provided without refer ence
 to discretion that they should
 be opened on one side
 alone This is the view
 I take Without assuming what
 the decision may be it
 may well be that under
 this resolution the Commissioner may
 de cline to take testimony
 except on one side On
 the other side it is
 mandatory he is obliged to
 take it if your resolution
 passes That is not jus
 It is an interference by
 legislation with a judicial investigation
 with regard to rights between
 man and man but it
 is only characteristic in rny
 judgment of the whole system
 I have nothing to do
 with the motives of gentlemen
 I impeach the motives of
 no one but it is
 the falsity of the system
 that I protest aøainst it
 is the danger of the
 precedent of Congress interfering for
 the pur pose of disturbing
 the course of justice because
 It is the course of
 justice in this case where
 the action is by the
 appropriatc offccr skilled in his
 offce under an existing law
 and undertaking to interfere with
 the course of his proceedings
 on the application of one
 side You cannot distin guish
 this case from the one
 which I stated to you
 If you have right properly
 to pass such a law
 as this and arrest an
 investigation which is judicial in
 its character before the Commis
 sioner of Patents and extend
 the time for taking to
 keep legislation distmet judieiål action
 in thc one casser than
 in twe othér Sir I

 to send your resolution back
 to you arid then I
 do not think you can
 get quite two thirds of
 the S n ate to
 pass it Mr PUGH I
 want the attention of Sen
 ator from Maine for a
 moment as he was so
 coh fident ili his legal
 propoSition 1 say the p
 ssage of this joint resolution
 will have theéffect to åvoiå
 the renewal of the patent
 if it is grahted if
 l un derstand the act
 before me This act thé
 of 1836 provides Whenever any
 patentee of an inventibh Oi
 dßebvery shall desire an extension
 of his patent beyonä the

 of the Patent Office setting
 forth the grounds thereof and
 the Commissioner Shill 00 tbeeap

 of fbrty dollars to the
 credit Of the k l
 reasury as in the case
 of original applieationfor a pdt

 in one or rnöre of
 the principali paper or papers
 as he may deem proper
 published in the section of
 country most interestéd adversely to
 the exien Sion of the
 patent a notice of such
 application and of the tinie
 and placc where and when
 the same will be consid
 ered that any person may
 appear and show cause why
 the extension should not be
 granted Brightly s Digest of
 the Laws of the United
 States p 733 A subsequent
 section fixes the term of
 the a d vertisement at
 ninety days and requires the
 C m missioner upon the
 application benng made to reé
 mit it to the chief
 examiner of patents who shall
 inquire into the novelty of
 the original claim and also
 requires the applicant to make
 and file under oath a
 certain statement of his profits
 NOW ob serve that the
 notice is to all the
 world tp appear on a
 day certain That is the
 only notice they have When
 that day comes they are
 to be there If they
 arc not there of course
 their rights are foreclosed That
 notice has been given in
 this case the testimony has
 been closed Certain per sons
 saw fit to resist others
 did not They did not
 find it necessary to resist
 upon that testimony or upon
 that stato of the case
 Now if we inter fere
 and grant anothér hearing to
 particular par ties those who
 did not choose under the
 former state of the case
 to appear at the former
 hearing will not be bound
 by the decision in favor
 of re newing the patent
 There is a decision to
 that effect by one of
 the circuit courts as appears
 from this note in Brightly
 s Digest The grant of
 a patent is not of
 itself a bar to an
 inter locutory injunction in favor
 of one claiming to he
 a prior patentee of the
 same thing such person not
 having received notice at thc
 Patent Oßice to appear and
 be son vs Barnum 1
 Wallace jr p 347 The
 diffculty is that Mr MCCormick
 s proof is ended as
 against all the world the
 time has ex pired Thc
 Commissioner might possibly enlarge It
 as to these parties he
 cannot enlarge it as to
 anybody else We cannot grant
 it for Mr Mc Cormick
 in such a way as
 to give him a valid
 claim against other persons though
 these parties might possibly be
 taken by consent or by
 application to be bound and
 that is the consequence of
 this Ottempt to interfere by
 resolution of Congress with grave
 controversies between parties pending before
 an appropriate tribunal next that
 if some counsel having causes
 heard in the Supreme Court
 of the United States feara
 decision adverse to the interests
 of their clients they will
 be here and if they
 are of the right pol
 itics and suffciently industrious I
 suppose we proofs in a
 case where the general law
 leaves that shall be called
 upon to grant new trials
 in that as a matter
 of jud icial discretion with
 a full knowl I said
 at the outset that I
 wanted the commit edge of
 the facts to hiln you
 have just the same dicial
 decision or on motion made
 Then comes right if a
 case is pending in a
 circuit court of the tee
 to examine this joint resolution
 but I have in special
 legislation special manda now examined
 it suffciently to come to
 a conclu tory for the
 benefit of one Sidc alone
 and reopen Uiiited States and
 on the application of one
 of ing as matter of
 right the proofs on side
 the parties the court decides
 that the proofs are Sion
 in my own mind and
 as 1 intimated in and
 leaving it discretionary on the
 other If these ii closed
 and refuses him lime to
 take further tes I beginning
 I am satisfied that the
 passage of this parties were
 to come before the Commissioner
 II timony and sets down
 the case for trial at
 a given joint resolution will
 give Mr McCormick a claim
 day to undertake in the
 interion to reverse the I
 which he will press against
 your Government It without this
 resolution of course ho would
 say is the design of
 these parties rl am now
 satisfied in the particular case
 decis on of the court
 made to interrup t the
 due and regular administration of
 The question is decided you
 have had two ar to
 compel the court to allow
 testimony to bc fbundation for
 reopening the case They bring
 taken on one side alone
 There would bc no justice
 in the Patent Offce in
 order to wrest his patent
 from him and turn him
 over against the greater violation
 of the spirit the Constitution
 It is a clear vio
 now this joint resolution You
 have the power to pass
 it and the Commissioner will
 doubtless be no greater violation
 of the great general rule
 that is Treasury of the
 United States Of law and
 it means more than appears
 Opon its face Under the
 pretext of giving time it
 i intended to strike out
 of his hands the appli
 cation which he has made
 for a renewal accord ing
 to law and make the
 application itself wortli less So
 it is these things are
 pressed on us We do
 not pass a bill to
 gtve a pension we do
 not pass a bill for
 a private claim without referring
 it to a standing committee
 but under a sudden pressure
 from the outside we are
 to be forced in thisburriednanner
 into interfering with the rights
 of piop_erty which it has
 been made the special business
 and duty of Cpngeess to
 protect As I I do
 not know how much money
 Mr Mc Cormick may have
 made I do not know
 whether his patent ought to
 be renewed or not and
 I am not going to
 examine it for I do
 not belong to the committee
 but I do know that
 this is a very gross
 departure from all the principles
 of justice and in my
 judgment it is an attack
 upon his rights of property
 which will if these parties
 succeed be made the pretext
 of a claim against us
 Mr FESSENDEN As the Senator
 from Ohio Mr PUGH appealed
 to me and called my
 spe ciabattention to that act
 I will say a word
 in rc ply What is
 his point The statute provides
 tbat certain notice shall be
 given to all parties to
 come in thus of course
 implying that at the end
 of that period if the
 notice rightly given all Darties
 who do not come in
 are precluded they nö longer
 have any right to object
 One party doesncome and contests
 for a certain length of
 time and at the end
 of that period Congress inter
 feres and says thtit that
 party may have a longer
 time to contest Now the
 Senator from Ohio argues that
 that would have the effect
 of depriv mg the parties
 who were duly invited at
 first and never did come
 of any notice If that
 is law I do not
 know what sort of ideas
 of law he Mr PUGH
 The Senator has taken very
 great pains I was about
 to say not to understand
 me and I cannot very
 well see how it can
 be other vise not meanino
 to be impolite I say
 the no tice is for
 all parties to appear at
 a given time and place
 When those parties who choose
 corne there they look at
 the evidence which the law
 requires to be fled at
 that time The law speci
 Reg a great portion of
 it They may think that
 evidence such that it is
 not necessary for them to
 contradict it and may go
 their way in peace Now
 we come in and we
 give the opponents of McCormick
 a chance to take testimony
 The queStion is then put
 to the Senator from Maine
 whether Mr McCormick may now
 take further testimony Ho says
 the Commissioner mav give him
 that privilege under this law
 I say if the Commissioner
 does hc setsttside theeffect of
 his notice to these other
 parties all of them He
 gave iOtice to the parties
 to appear at a time
 aud place and they appeared
 and ft l aught we
 know they were satisfied with
 the case as it then
 stood he allows other evidence
 to be taken for IV
 IcCor mick and upon that
 other evidence grants a re
 newal of the patent he
 has misled and deceived other
 persons by the false notice
 which hc gave them and
 according to the decision to
 which I have alluded I
 have not examined the case
 L only saw the note
 of it the patent would
 be of no validity against
 them That is where we
 have landed Mr WADE I
 am not going to prolong
 this debate my object is
 to get a decision as
 soon as possible A great
 deal has been said about
 out ward pressure here Now
 I will state my con
 nection with this matter and
 all I know about it
 Nobody has been near me
 in regard to it 1
 did not know there was
 such a case pending till
 I saw the joint resolution
 come from the House of
 Rep resentatives The moment that
 I heard it read I
 did not fail to it
 must involve a question dee
 ply interesting to the farmers
 of the whole cou n
 try and to none more
 than those in the State
 which i in part represent
 It v zas not necessary
 for me to have any
 other pressure than that and
 I thought it incumbent on
 me to look into it
 As I inquired a little
 into it I found that
 the rights of the public
 were about to be foreclosed
 forever on diis important subject
 unless this joint resolu tion
 was brought up and disposed
 of to day and I
 asked the Senate to takc
 it up The great in
 terest which the public have
 in the question was seen
 and apprehended by a large
 majority of the 12 Senate
 in a moment There may
 have been out has satisfied
 me of nöthing else it
 has satisfied THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 8 II me that
 the law is a chameleon
 profession which side pressure upon
 the other side prompting gen
 tlemen to make motions that
 tended to delay Mr PUGH
 The only pressure I spoke
 of was the majority of
 the Senate pressinc a resolution
 to a vote without reference
 to the committee That I
 think was certainly unfair What
 said was no imputation on
 the Senator or any one
 else Mr WADE P care
 nothing about it I have
 stated all the connection have
 had with the matter and
 it has been because of
 the interest which the public
 at large and my constituents
 have in this great question
 On looking into it I
 found a paper I do
 not know how authentic it
 may be containing what purported
 to be the affidavits of
 the contestants here and those
 aff davits showed the clearest
 ground for delay in order
 that testimony might be taken
 so that the I found
 the controversy might be ended
 right Commissioner pressing these parties
 right up to a decision
 before the testimony had beön
 closed one week and testimony
 taken all over the United
 States and the attorneys for
 the contestants swearing that they
 have had no time yet
 to takc their testimony and
 that it too is scattered
 over the several States and
 on their application to the
 Commissioner he refused to give
 them any longer time than
 until next Monday which will
 be per fectly nugatory I
 thought it necessary for me
 under these circumstances to press
 this resolu tion upon the
 attention of the Senate Now
 sir the motions for delay
 to refer to a committee
 to grant instructions and all
 these havincr failed as a
 kind of after thought the
 res olution itself is criticised
 and it is said to
 be im perfect in some
 particulars I hese men ask
 and they alone ask delay
 so as to be able
 to take their testimony The
 other party has taken his
 and is ready prompt ea
 Y u pressing for a
 decision Gentlemen find that this
 resolution does not pro vide
 that the otl et party
 the patentee may take testimony
 Well sir I would as
 lief it read that way
 as any other but as
 a lawyer know it is
 unnecessary that it should be
 so and I think any
 body can kno v that
 The Comtnissioner has full and
 perfect jurisdiction over this question
 of extending the time for
 taking testimony in the same
 way that any court would
 have I ycnce the patentee
 need not come here for
 an Extension of time but
 if he should I will
 promise him this if he
 applies to the Commissioner after
 we have got our testimony
 scattered all over the country
 and that ofiicer puts him
 on three days notice to
 take it and he then
 applies here for time to
 rebut that testimony he Shull
 have rny vote to do
 it The rnent is unnecessary
 because you cannot presume that
 the Comrnissloner will make any
 such decision The subject is
 in his power and no
 doubt he will lend a
 willing ear to this party
 when he applies to him
 That he has full power
 over it there is no
 doubt Now my ob jection
 to this amendment is solely
 that if you fasten it
 to the resolution it is
 fatal to the whole case
 I here is no probability
 that we can fasten an
 amendment to this resolution send
 it back to the House
 or Representati ves have it
 passed there accommodates its principles
 to the varvin views and
 interests of individuals It is
 not a science it appears
 any more than is medicine
 but if we are to
 judge of it by the
 opinions expressed by the Senator
 from Maine Mr FESSENDEN and
 the Senator from Ohio Mr
 WADE unlike the pro fession
 of medicine it conflicts at
 times with com think the
 amendment of the Sena mon
 sense tor from Illinois Mr
 DOUGLAS eminently proper and the
 views of those who have
 opposed it cer tainly erroneous
 I do not advance this
 opinion however as a legal
 one but you may take
 it if you choose as
 a medical laughter that is
 a common sense view of
 the question Mr BAKER I
 did not quite hear the
 honor able Senator Did he
 say that the profession of
 medicine conflicted with common sense
 Mr FITCH No but the
 Senator s profes sion I
 believe he is a lawyer
 Mr BAYARD Will from Indiana
 allow me to ask him
 if doctors do not sometimes
 disagree Laugh ter Mr BAKER
 understand that the Senator from
 Indiana says that the legal
 profession The PRESIDING OFFICER Does
 the Sen ator from Indiana
 give way Mr BAKER I
 want to hear him Mr
 FITCH 1 cannot repeat Mr
 BAKER Does the honorable gentleman
 say that the legal profession
 conflicts with com mon Mr
 Fi YCH I presume the
 reporter caught my language and
 the Senator from Oregon can
 I will say however that
 read it in the morninc
 if the profession does no_t
 conflict with common sense some
 of what they would have
 us receive as law does
 an example of which is
 found in the construction of
 this joint resolution by the
 Senator from Ohio and the
 Senator from Maine We are
 called upon to legislate on
 the assump tion that an
 oflicer of the Goverurnent a
 sworn officer sworn to discharge
 his duty legally con stit
 utionally faithfully impartially will not
 thus perform it will disregard
 his official oath and de
 It is proposed to cide
 in a prejudiced manner counteract
 this prejudice by enacting a
 law de signed at jparently
 no will not say designed
 but certainly a law which
 will have the effect to
 call forth the prejudices of
 the successor of this officer
 in the event of that
 successor having any latent prejudice
 in the case You say
 to him that he need
 not take testimony for the
 applicant but I shall for
 the con testant Granted as
 the Senator from Maine says
 that he may have under
 the old law the right
 to take testimony for the
 applicant you do not call
 upon him to exercise that
 right and if he has
 the slightest prejudice in the
 case he will never exercise
 it bul will actin strict
 con formity to the letter
 of your new law and
 the Senator from Ohio virtually
 admitted that such would be
 his action He says that
 the applicant does not desire
 any more testimony True hp
 is willing to rest the
 case as it is as
 I understand but he does
 not know what kind of
 testimony the an l in
 the hail ds ofthe Commissioner
 soon enough contestants may bring
 out under this resolution to
 stop the disastrous decision that
 he is about to make
 Therefore I ccnnpelled to urge
 that the ques tion shall
 be decided now arid here
 and that the amendment shall
 be refused and I am
 glad to find i that
 there is no color of
 right there is no neces
 sity for the amendment beino
 made The Com missioner having
 full power and authority over
 I the whole subject we
 are not to presume that
 hc will refuse the other
 side time to take their
 testi mony if indeed any
 should be necessary to rebut
 the testimony that we may
 bring in Sir I have
 no doubt he will give
 that time if they want
 it Probably they do not
 want it they have taken
 apparently all the testimony they
 want but if they should
 want more no doubt E
 le witl give them I
 say again my only objection
 to the time amendment is
 that it will probably prove
 destruc tive of the whole
 object of the resolution The
 PRESIDING OFFICER the Senate ready
 for the question on the
 amendment offered by the Senator
 from Illinois Mr PUGH I
 ask for the yeas and
 nays on that amendment The
 yeas and nays were ordered
 have listened with consider Mr
 FITCH able curiosity to this
 legal discussion and if it
 They may possibly adduce testilXIQny
 which may render it absolutely
 essential for the proper pro
 tection of his rights that
 he should have the priv
 ilege of introducing rebutting testimony
 but he is excluded from
 that privilege by this resolution
 That is my opinion Do
 you call it only a
 law opinion by a medical
 man Well sir if it
 be an 1M D s
 opinion I have morc confidence
 in it than in that
 of any prejudiced LL D
 Laughter The Senator from Ohio
 dwelt x vith some force
 upon the statements of the
 attorneys in this case alleging
 the absolute necessity of additional
 testi mony One of those
 attorneys it will appear by
 the report in the case
 on the part of the
 acting Commissioner of Patents has
 already involved himself in a
 self contradiction One of them
 states that he has only
 been attorney in this case
 for certain limited time and
 that Is one of the
 reasons he adduces in favor
 of the extension of the
 period for taking testitnony alleging
 that having been attorney for
 but a short period he
 has not had sufficient time
 within which to take testimony
 It appears however by the
 report of the acting Commissioner
 that this gentEeman bas pro
 fessed to be the attorney
 for those protestants a much
 longer time than he states
 in his application for an
 extension I leave him and
 his friends to I reconcile
 this discrepancy in his statements
 1861 The Senator intimated that
 there might be an outside
 pressure operating upon gentlemen on
 this side induc ing them
 to delay this question 1
 Mr WADE Oh no I
 did not say that said
 that my colleague had stated
 that there was an outside
 pressure and I replied to
 it I did not say
 there was any Mr FITCH
 Ifthe Senator simply disclaimed it
 for himself it was his
 right for him to do
 so I have no right
 to su ose any outside
 pressure am sure none did
 on me operated on him
 an Mr WADE I did
 not say that there was
 any such pressure operatinT Mr
 FITCH The debate so far
 if anything was wantilP to
 convince us of the impropriety
 of hastily adopting this resolution
 I should think had supplied
 the wrant Here are grave
 legal ques tions involved and
 yet you propose to pass
 the resolution without permitting it
 to go through the usual
 routine of reference to a
 committee and a report from
 that committee when you have
 thé pledge of the committee
 and accompanied with a motion
 to instruct it even if
 the pledge was not given
 to report back the resolution
 to morrow If therefore there
 is delay in its passage
 that delay is properly chargeable
 to those who have refused
 to permit the resolution to
 take the ordi nary course
 of legislation a refusal which
 I ap prehend they will
 ultimately find will not hasten
 Its passage Mr GREEN I
 am very sorry to see
 the whole day appropriated for
 private bills consumed with one
 question and I do hopé
 we shall take the vote
 1 desire thc pas after
 i makea single remark sage
 of this resolut ion in
 order to postpone the decision
 and I will state frankly
 why I desire it The
 present acting Commissioner was clerk
 when the present attorney for
 McCormick was Conl missioner of
 Patents This fact gives him
 al though a high toned
 gentlcnnan an undue influ ence
 over him This is my
 information it may I want
 the decision postponed not be
 correct Every farmer in the
 State of Missouri who buys
 a reaper is taxed at
 least fifteen dollars for the
 benefit of this patentee He
 has made millions of dollars
 The object of the patent
 law has been fall y
 accomplished and I am opposed
 to giving him money at
 the expense of the farmers
 and hence I shan go
 for the resolution Mr GRUMES
 am going with the Senator
 from Missouri in favor of
 the passage of this res
 olution but the former Commissioner
 of Patents to whom he
 alludes as having been Commissioner
 when the present offcer in
 charge of that bureau was
 chief clerk I think was
 a citizen of my own
 State and I desire to
 say here and noswv that
 I do not believe that
 gentlernan has at this time
 ut tempted or that he
 will ever at ternpl to
 exercise anv undue influence over
 that chief clerk or over
 I believe that he is
 a man entirely anybody else

 Mr The PRESIDING OFFICER Sen
 ator from Rhode Island yield
 to the Senator from Oregon
 IVIr LANE I only rise
 o inquire whether we should
 not now proceed to the
 consideratiöffdfthe special order set for
 this day the Private Calen
 I desire to say that
 I believe no constituent dap
 of mine has any interest
 in any private bill now
 pending I have not presented
 8 private bill l know
 of no person living in
 Oregon who has any interest
 in any private bill pending
 before Ehe Senate but there
 are many private billS which
 have passed the House of
 Representatives ahd are on your
 Calendar that require the considera
 tion of this body and
 with the view of doing
 jus tice to those who
 have just claims upon the
 Gov ernment a week ago
 I asked that this day
 bé Set apart for the
 consideration of private bills The
 whole day up to this
 time has been consumed and
 the Private Calendar neglected I
 ask now that the remainder
 of the day be appropriated
 to the consideration of private
 bills The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will suggest to the
 Senator from Oregon that th
 e Sen ate have already
 by a vote suspended the
 order assicning to day for
 the consideration of the Pn
 vale Calendar Mr LANE That
 was as 1 understood for
 the consideration ofa special bill
 The PRESIDING OFFICER It was
 a sus pension of the
 order assigning this day for
 the consideration of that subject
 Mr LANE Then 1 ask
 the Senate Mr SIMMONS have
 the floor 1 did not
 give way for a speech
 Mr BRAGG I thought the
 o rder was sUs pended
 for the special purpose of
 going on with the matter
 then before the Senate at
 the instance of the Senator
 from Ohio Mr WADE The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The motion was
 a general one without qualification
 or limita tion to suspend
 that order Mr LANE Then
 is it not in order
 for me to movc to
 take up the Private Calendar
 Mr SIMMONS Not while I
 have the floor The PRESIDING
 OFFICER If the from Rhode
 Islarld yields for that purpose
 the Chair wilt receive the
 motion Mr LANE I shall
 be obliged to him if
 he will do so Mr
 SIMMONS 1 cannot do it
 I move to take up
 House bill No 338 to
 provide for the payment of
 outstanding Treasury notes to au
 thorize a loan to regulate
 and fix the duties on
 imports and for other purposes
 Mr GREEN Is that the
 tariffbill Yes Jt is too
 late in the day to
 take that up now M
 1 POLK I should like
 to know from the Senator
 from Rhode Island whether he
 means to take up that
 bill in order to go
 into the cOnsiåer out the
 svhole a xnendrnent and insert
 in lieu thereof the ation
 of it now or for
 the purpose of making it
 a special order for some
 future day I have no
 followin SEC 5 sand be
 it further enacted l hat
 the residue of the loan
 authorized by the act of2
 2d of unc 1860 objection
 to taking up the bill
 if the latter is his
 thereof as is necessary shall
 be applied to the redenxption
 I object but I have
 if the former is This
 day was specially set aside
 for primte billS Private Of
 the I reasury notes issued
 under the act of 17th
 of De cember 1860 and
 for no other purpose and
 the secretary bills have had
 but one day this session
 and we exchange at par
 bonds of the United States
 authorized by adjourned very eavly
 that day and I think
 it is THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 8 due torthe claimants
 whose bills are on the
 Cal I endar that the
 order deliberately made by the
 Senate a few days ago
 suspended as it was by
 the understanding of some of
 the Senators cer tainly by
 my understanding only for the
 purpose of disposingof the joint
 resolution that was called up
 by the Senator from Ohio
 should now be ex ecuted
 as far as is in
 our power for the remainder
 of this day I for
 one will not vote to
 take up any other bill
 in the place of the
 Private Calendar I should like
 to know from the Senator
 whether his intention is to
 take up the tariff bill
 for the purpose of going
 on with its present considera
 tion or fixing it for
 consideration at some future da
 SIMMONS 1 will cheerfully state
 in reply to the Senator
 that my purpose is to
 take thys bill up and
 proceed with its consideration if
 I think it much more
 im the Senate so agree
 portant for us to provide
 some means of paying debts
 now lying on the table
 of the Secretary of the
 Treasury for which warrants have
 been drawn upon him than
 it is to vote money
 out of the Treasury to
 private claimants to day That
 is tny opinion but if
 the Senate wish otherwise of
 course they will refuse to
 take up the bill I
 voted to postpone feel it
 my duty to urge it
 the Private Cakendar to day
 for the purpose of taking
 up this bill and I
 had hoped It would be
 taken up two hours ago
 Mr POLK We h vejustpassed
 a loan bill for some
 twenty five million dollars which
 I think oughtQ enable us
 to stay our hund long
 enough to proceed in the
 execution of the special order
 or to resume it that
 was made by the Senate
 a few days ago I
 hope the Senatc will not
 take up that bill but
 will go on and devote
 at least the residue of
 this day to the consideration
 of the Private Calendar The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is

 ordered to be printed Mr
 SIMMONS There may be some
 slight amendments but they are
 of no consequence They will

 upon Mr POWELL I was
 going to ask that these

 we do ad journ now
 The motion was not agreed

 I take it for granted
 Senators on either side will
 not insist on the reading
 of the bill provided it
 is understood that when the
 con sideration of it is
 resumed to morrow or When
 ever it may be the
 reading will be dispensed with
 That I think will be
 understood on our side with
 a view to adjourning We
 cannot act upon it to
 night Mr SIMMONS 1 would
 be perfectly content witli that
 if the reading will not
 be resumed again to morrow
 so as to waste another
 day Mr MASON With the
 general understand ing that when
 the bill is resumed again
 Senators will not insist upon
 the reading Mr GREEN I
 agree on a condition if
 the Senate will give us
 to morrow for the considera
 tion of private claims I
 will do it not otherwise
 Several SENATORS Go on with
 the reading Mr MASON Ehen
 the effect will be to
 con sume time and adjourn
 when the reading is over
 That is all Mr GREEN
 very well 1 cannot help
 it Mr MASON I hope
 the Senator will not persist
 Mr GREEN I think there
 are a great many discrepancies
 in the bill which will
 have to be co rrecte
 d I Mr FESSENDEN we
 shall claim row for the
 appropriation bills Mr PEARCE 1
 shall ask the Senate to
 take up an appropriation bill
 to morrow Mr CAMERON 1
 desire to say in regard
 to this bill that it
 has been put off for
 three years by this sort
 of motions Ifgcntlemcn on the
 other side will say they
 are willing to let it
 be discussed and voted upon
 will agree to anything they
 propose but if this is
 done only for the purpose
 of wasting time and preventing
 the passage of this bill
 I will not Mr LANE
 Let the Secretary proceed with
 the reading of the bill
 The Secretary continued the reading
 of the bill Mr POWELL
 I move that the Senate
 do now adjourn The motion
 was not agreed to The
 Secretary resumed the reading of
 the bill when hc was
 interrupted by Mr PUGH As
 the Secretary is now reading
 the frec list I do
 not suppose it is necessary
 to read that W c
 cannot make anything by it
 move that the further reading
 of the bill be dis
 pensed with Mr SiB IlVIONS
 I here are some sections
 after that that might be
 read N lr GREEN I
 think this is the most
 import ant section there is
 in the bill and I
 wish to have it read
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr HALE
 in It requires unanirnous consent
 to the chair dispense with
 the reading I Mr GREEN
 1 ask for the reading
 of that i portion of
 the bill The Secretary concluded
 the reading of the IVIr
 TEN EYCK Wili it be
 in ordertohave the bill read

 on the Department äséeitaining that
 the money bad been distributed

 plac ing it beyond the

 JOHN A Secretary of the

 Committee on Conmerce House of
 Representatives Mr SPINNER I ask
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania whether
 half the fine was not
 paid to the officers of
 the vessel Mr MOORHEAD 1
 presume it paid under the
 law half to the Government
 and half to the informer
 The mistake occurred in this
 way the article was included
 in the invoice of a
 particular vessel But it appears
 that it was ncvcr on
 board that vessel at all
 As soon as the Treasury
 Department ascertained the facts the
 order was issued that the
 fine be remitted l ut
 before the order was received
 the finc had becn distributed
 under the law one half
 to the Gov ernment and
 one halfto the informants as

 fine whiclt was exacted I

 President fbr a days or
 until you and he have
 considered the suggestions which bcg
 leave to subrnit VVe that
 the possession of Fort Sumter
 by troops of the United
 States coupled with the eircqnnstances
 under whicli it vvas taken
 is the chief if not
 only source of diffi culty
 benveen the government of South
 ina arid that of the
 United States VVe would add
 that we too think it
 a just causc of irritation
 and of apprehension on the
 part of your State But
 we have also assurances notwith
 standing the circumstances under which
 Major Anderson ief t Fort
 Mouttrie and entered Fort Sun
 t er with the forces
 under his cornmand that it
 was not is not held
 with any hostile or unfriendly
 purpose towards your State but
 merely as property of the
 United States which the President
 deems it his duty to
 protect and preserve VVe wili
 not discuss the question of
 right or duty the part
 of either Governrnent touching that
 property or the late acts
 of either in relation thereto
 but we think that without
 any comprcnnisc of right or
 breach of duty on either
 side an arnicable adjustment of
 the matter of may and
 should be adopted VVc desire
 to sec such an ad
 ju nnent and to prevent
 ivar or the shedding fblood
 We represent States which have
 already seceded from the Uni
 ted States or have done
 so be Ore the 1st
 ot February next and whioil
 wili your State in convention
 ou or betin c of
 that month Our people feel
 that they have a conunon

 with you the evils of

 the blessings of peace 52
 MONDAY FEBRUARY 11 1861 if
 it can be preserved We
 thereiOre think it especially due
 from South Carolina to our
 States to say nothing of
 other slaveholding States that she
 should as2fhr as she can
 consistently with her honor avoid
 initiating hostilities be tween her
 and the United States or
 any other Power We have
 the public declaration of the
 President that he has not
 the constitutional power or the
 will to make war on
 South Carolina and that the
 public peace shall not be
 disturbed by any act of
 hostility your State We therefore
 see no reason why there
 may not be a set
 Mement of existing diflicutties if
 time be given för calm
 and dekiberate counsel with those
 States which are equally involved
 with South Caroiina W c
 thereföre trust that an arranaement
 will be agreed on between
 you and the Pres ident
 at least till the 15th
 Febnmry next by which time
 your and our States may
 in convention devise a wise
 just and peaceable solution ot
 existing lifhe ullies In the
 mean time we think your
 State should suffer Major Anderson
 to obtain necessary supplies of
 food fuel or wzuet aud
 enjoy free conununication by post
 or spe ciai tnessenaer with
 the P cesidellt upon tile
 understand ing that the President
 will not send hinl reinlbrcernents
 We propose to submit this

 that you will submit our
 suggestions to the Gover or
 of your State turhisinst ructions
 Until you have received and
 co mnunieated his response to
 the President of course your
 State will not attack Fort

 not otrer to rciniörce it

 the delivery of a Governor
 of South Carolina to the
 President he has been intrusted
 fora few days or until
 the Presideot and Colonel Hayne
 have considered the sitggestidns which
 yOujsubmit It is unnecessary to
 refer specially to these suggestions
 because the letter addressed to
 you by Colonel Hayne of
 the 17th inspgpt presents a
 clear aud specific answer_tothem In
 thiy lie says I am
 notelptheci with power tp make
 thean angenieut you suggest ibut
 pto vided you can get
 assurances wicl which yon are
 entirely satisfied that no reinforcements
 will be sent to Fort

 and that public pcgcetwjll not

 your coznmunication to the authorities
 of Söut_li olina and withholding
 the which I am at

 instructions Frmu the beginning of
 the prescnt unhappy tgoubiqs t
 he President has endeavored to
 perforlll his executive duties in
 such a rnanner as to
 prescrve the peace of the
 country and to prevent bloodshed
 This is stilf his fixed
 parpösp You therefore do him
 no more than justice in
 stating that you have assurances
 from his public messages I
 pre notwithstanding the circumstances under
 which sntne Major Anderson Icil
 Fort Moultrie and entered Fon
 Sum ter with the forces
 under his command that it
 was not taken and is
 not beld pith any hostile
 or unfriendly pur pose towards
 your State but merely as
 property of the Uni ted
 States which the President deems
 it his duty to protect
 and preserve You have correctly
 stated what the Presi dent
 deerns to be his duty
 His sole object now is
 and has been to act
 strictly on the defensive and
 to authorize no movement against
 the people ot South Carpiina
 unless clearly justified by a
 hostile Inpvemen_t on tlléir part
 He could not well have
 given a better prooi of
 his desire to vent the
 effusion of blood than by
 forbearing to resort tothe usc
 of torcc under the strong
 provocation of an attack hap
 pily without a fatal result
 on an unarmed vesSel beating
 the flag of the United
 Slates L ann happy _to
 observe that in your letter
 qto Colonel Hayne you express
 the opinion that it is
 es peeiaflyflue South Carolina to
 our States to say nothing
 of other Slaveholding States that
 she should as as she
 eau con sistently witli her
 honor avoid initiating hostilities between
 her and the United States
 or any other Power iliate
 sucti hostilities against Fort Sunn
 er would beyond be an
 act of war against the
 it ed States question In
 regard to the propositioil of
 Hayne that no rein Orcements
 will be sent to Fort
 Stunt er in the interval
 not be disturbed by amv
 act of and that public
 pcacc will hostility towards South
 Cnrolina it is itnpossibie Ibr
 kne I hc President has
 no to give you any
 such assurances authority to enter
 in to such an arrreernent
 or understand ing As an
 executive oflicer he is simply
 bonnd to protect the public
 property so far as this
 rnay be practicable and it
 would be a nanitOst violation
 of his duty to place
 him self under entragetnents that
 be would not perform his
 duty either för an indefinite
 or a lilnited period At
 the present moment it is
 not deemed necessary to reinforce
 Major An because he ruake
 s 10 such request and
 feels quite secure in his
 position Should his sai ty
 hosvver require reinü n cernents
 every effort will be made
 _to supply them In regard
 to an assuraoce f rorn
 the President tnat pub lic
 peace will not be disturbed
 by any act of I
 ostilir y to wards South
 Carolina the answer wili readily
 occur to yourselves To Congress
 aud to Congress alone belongs
 the power to make war
 and it would be an
 act of usurpa _ tion
 for the Executive to give
 any assurance that Congress would
 not exercise this bower however
 strongly l e may be
 convinced that no such intention
 exists I anl glad to
 be assured from the Icttcr
 of Colonel Hayne that Major
 Anderson and his cornmand do
 now obtain alå necessary supplies
 including fiesh meat aud vegetables
 and I believe fuel and
 water from the city of
 Char leston and do now
 enjoy comnn unication by post
 and special mes senger Witb
 the President and will continue
 to do so cer tainly
 until the door to negotiation
 has been closed trust that
 these facilities may Stili be
 afforded to Major An derson
 This is as it should
 be Major Anderson is not
 menacing Charleston nud I am
 eon vinced that the hap
 piest result which can be
 attained is that both _hc
 and the authorities of South
 Carolina shall remain on their
 present amicable iOoting neither party

 the Secretary of We r

 from the Secretary is far
 from being satisfactory to me
 But inasmuch as vou stau
 that we no hesita tion
 in expressing an entire confidence
 hat no reinforce ment win
 be genr t to Fort_Sumter
 nor witl the public pgaee
 be disturbed Within the p
 riod eequisite ft t fuil
 conununi cation between yourself myself
 and your govern in compliance
 with our previous understanding I
 818 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 8 withhold the communieation with
 Which l am at present
 eharggd and refer the whole
 matter to the authorities of
 SOutti Carolina and will await
 their reply Mr Gourdin of
 South Carolina now in this
 city will leave here by
 the evening s train and
 will lay before the Governor
 or South Carolina and his
 Council the whole correspondence between
 yourselves and myself and be
 tween you and the Government
 of the United States with
 aeommunication from me askingTor further
 instructiöns cannOt in closing but
 express my deep regret that
 the President should deem it
 necessary to keep a garrison
 of troops at Fort Sumter
 for the protection of the
 property o the United States
 South Carolina scorns the idea
 of appropriating to herself the
 property of another whether of
 a Government or an individual
 without accounting to the last
 dollar for everything which for
 the protection of heréitizens orin
 vindication of her own honor
 and dignity she may deem
 it necessary to take into
 her own posses 6ion AS
 property Fort Sumter is in
 far greater jeopardy nectioied by
 a garrison of United States
 troops than it Would be
 if delivered over to the
 State authorities with the ptedgd
 that in regard to that
 and ali other property within
 her jurisdiction claimed by the
 Unite a States South Caro
 lina would ftilly account on
 a fair adjustment Upon the
 Other point of the preservation
 of the peace and the
 avoidance of bloodshed is It
 supposed that the oc eupation
 ofa Itu t by armed
 men in the midst ofa
 harbor with guns bearing on
 every part of it under
 the orders of a Govermnent
 no longer acknowledged can be
 other than the occasion ofconstant
 irritation excitement and indignation It
 creates a condition of things
 which 1 is but little
 calculated to advance the observance
 of the high Chris tian
 and moral duty to kecp
 the peace and to avoid
 all I causes of mutual
 irritation recommended by the Secre
 tary of War in his
 communication In my judgment to
 continue to hold Fort Sumter
 by United States troops is
 tho w0rst possib e means
 of secur ing its protection
 and preservation as property as
 it eer tailily is the
 worst possible means of effecting
 a peaceful solution of existing
 difficulties short of war itself
 I beg leave in conclusion
 to say that it is
 in deference to the unanimous
 opinion expressed by the Senators
 pres ent in Washington representing
 Stat es which have al
 ready seceded from the United
 States orwill have done so
 before the 1st February next
 that I comply with your
 sug gestions And feel assured
 that suggestions from such a
 quarter will be considered with
 proiöund respect by the authorities
 of South Carolina and Will
 have great weight in determining
 their action With high consideration

 President of the Umted States
 WASHINGTON January 31 1861 SIR
 f htid the honor to
 hold it short interview with
 you ou the l itlJ
 instant intormal and unottieial Having
 pre viously been intörtncd that
 you desired that whatever was
 official StiOUI I be on
 both sides conducted by written
 com tnunications I did not
 at that time present lily
 credentials but verbally informed you
 that bore a letter roll
 the Gov ernor of South
 Carolina in regard to the
 oeenpation ot Fort Sutnter which
 would deliver the next day
 under cover of a written
 communication f t oni tuysolf
 rl li next day before
 such conunnnie at ion could
 be luade I was svaited
 upon hy a Senator from
 Alabama who stated that 110
 eatne on the part all
 the Senators then in WV
 ash ington the States which
 had already seceded frolik the
 United States or would certainly
 have done so belöre the
 first day ot February next
 Senator Alalnuna urged that he
 aud they were interested in
 tl o subject of Iny
 in almost an equal degree
 with the authorities of Sontll
 Carolina Ile said that hostilitiek
 cornmeneed between South Carolina tnd
 your Goverutnent would necessarily involve
 the States represented by then
 selves in civil stri k
 and toaring that the action
 of South Carolina might com
 pliéate the relations of your
 Govermnent to the seceded and
 seceding States and thereby interfere
 with a peace fill SOItt
 tion of existing difficulties these
 Senators requested that I would
 withhold my message to yourself
 until a consulta tion tunong
 themselves could be had To
 this f agreed and the
 result of the consultation was
 the letter of the Sena
 tors addressed to me dated
 the 15th January a copy
 of which is in your
 possession To this letter I
 replied on the 17th and
 a copy of that reply
 is likewise in your pos
 session This correspondence ag am
 inf orxued was made the
 subjeet of communication from Senators
 Fltrz PATRICK MALLORY and SLIDELL
 addressed to you and your
 attention called to the contents
 These gentlelnen received on the
 day of January a reply
 to their appli cation conveyed
 in a letter addressed to
 them dated signed by Hon
 J Holt Secretary of War
 ad interim Of this letter
 you of course have a
 copy This letter from Mr
 Holt was communicated to me
 under cover of a letter
 frozn all the Senators of
 the seceded und seceding States
 who sti l remained in
 Washington and of thig letter
 too I am informed you
 have been furnished with a
 copy This reply of yours
 through the Secretary of War
 ad interim to the applicatiou
 made by Lhe Senators was
 cn tirely ttns tisfhetory to
 me It appeared to me
 to be not only a
 rejection in advance of the
 main proposition made by these
 Senators to wit that an
 arrangement should be agreed between
 the authorities of Souui Carolina
 and your Govermneut at least
 until the 15m of February
 which time South Carolina and
 the States rep next resented
 by the Senators migrht in
 convcntion devise u wise just
 and peaceable solution of existing
 difliculties In the mean time
 they say we think that
 is these Senators that your
 State South Carolina should sumn
 Major Anderson to obtain necessary
 supplies of food fuel or
 water and enjoy free communication
 by post or special messenger
 With the President upon the
 understanding that the President will
 not send him reinforcements during
 the same besides this rejection
 of the maiu prop osition
 there was in Mr Holt
 s letter a distinct retUsal
 to make any stipulation on
 the subject of reinforcement even
 för the short time that
 might be required to communicate
 with Iny government This reply
 to the Senators was as
 I have stated altogether unsatisfactory
 to me and I sure
 would be so to the
 authorities whom I represented It
 was not however addressed to
 me or to the authorities
 of South Carolina and as
 South Carolina bad addressed noth
 ing to your Government and
 had asked nothing at your
 hands looked not to Mr
 Holt s letter but to
 the note ad dresscd to
 me by tho Senators of
 the seceded aud seceding States
 I had consented to withhold
 my messagc at their instance
 provided they could get assurances
 sati factory to them that
 no reinforce nents ivould be
 sent to Fort Sumter in
 the interval and that the
 peace should not bc disturbed
 I he Scnators expressed in
 their by any act ot
 hostility note to me of
 the 23d instant thciT entire
 confidence that no reinforcements will
 be sent to Fort Surnter
 nor will the public peace
 bc disturbed withiu the period
 requisite ibr full connnunicatjon between
 you Inyself and your rny
 governmenti and renewed their request
 that I would wilil hold
 the cotmnunication with which I
 stood charged and await further
 instructions This I have done
 The fUrther instructions arrived on
 the 30th instant and bear
 date the 26th I now
 have the Ilonor to make
 to you my first communication
 as special envoy frozn the
 govormnent of South Carolina Yau
 will find inclosed the original
 communication to the I r
 ident of the United States
 from the Governor of South
 Carolina with which I was
 charged in Charleston on the
 12th day of January instant
 the day on which it
 bears date I arn now
 instructed by the Governor of
 South Carolina to say that
 his opinion as to the
 propriety of the demand which
 is contained in this letter
 has not onty been confinned
 by the circtunstances which your
 my Inission has developed but
 is now increased to conviction
 of its necessity I lle
 satoty Of the State requires
 that the position of the
 Presi dent should be distinctly
 understood Phe safety of all
 seceding States requires it as
 rnnch as the safety of
 South Carolina If it be
 so that Fort Sumter is
 held as property then as
 property the rights whatever t
 hey may be of t
 he United States can bc
 ascertained and Ibr the satisfaction
 ot these rights the pledge
 of the State ot South
 Caroiiua you are I am
 authorized to give If Fort
 Stuuter is not held ns
 property it is held say
 my instructions as a Inili
 ary post and such a
 post within the limits of
 Soutil Carolina will 110t be
 tolerated You will perceive that
 it is u pon the
 presu jnption that it is
 golely as property that you
 continue to hold Fort Stunter
 that I have been selected
 tur the of the duty
 upon which I have cntered
 10 not come as a
 ntilitary man to letnand thc
 surrender of a Ik rtress
 but as the legal officer
 Of the State its attor
 ney general to claim iör
 the St ate the excrcise
 of its un doubted right
 of entinent domain and to
 pledge the State to make
 good all injury to the
 rights of property which arise
 frotn the exercise of tho
 clailn South Carolina as a
 separate independent sovereign as stones
 the right take into lucr
 own possessiou everything within hcr
 limits essential to rnaintain her
 honor or her safety irrespecti
 ve of the question of
 property subject Olliy to tite
 Inora Illt v requiring that
 conupensation should be Inade to
 the owner This right she
 cannot perenit to be drawn
 into discussion to compensation tor
 any prop ert y whether
 t an indi vidual or
 a Governnw nt which sile
 rnay deeni it necessary her
 honor or sa Oty to
 take Linto her possession her
 past history ives atnple guarantee
 that upon a thir accounting
 to the last dollar it
 Will be made I he
 proposition NOW is that her
 law officer should under authority
 of t he Governor and
 his council distinctly pledge the
 thith of South Carolina to
 rnake such olnpe nsation in
 regard to Fort Sillilt er
 and its appurtenances and contents
 to the extent of the
 money value of the property
 01 the t nited States
 delivered over to the autliorit
 ies of South Carolina by
 your counnaud I will not
 suppose that a pledge like
 u is can be considered
 insuflie ient security Is not
 the Iliouey value ot thc
 property or the United States
 in this fbrt situated w
 here it eannot be Inade
 available to the United States
 for any one purpose for
 which it was originally con
 to tbe proposition of thc
 Senators that no reinforcements should
 be sent to Fort Sumter
 provided South Carolina agrees that
 during the same period no
 attack should be made you
 say It is impossible for
 me your Secretary to give
 you the genatorsJ any such
 assurance that it would be
 a manifest violation of his
 your duty to place himself
 yourself under engagements that he
 you would not per torm
 the duty either tor an
 indefinite or a limited period
 In your message of the
 28th instant in expressing yourself
 in regard to a similar
 proposition you say However strong
 may be my desire to
 enter into such an agreernent
 I am convinced that r
 do not possess the power
 Congress and Congress alone under
 the war making power can
 ex ercise the discretion of
 agreeing to abstain from any
 and all acts calculated to
 produce a eollision of arms
 between this and any other
 Govermnent It would therefore be
 a usurpation for the Executive
 to attempt to restrain their
 hands by an agreernent fn
 regard to matters over which
 he has no constitutional control
 If he were thus to
 act they might pass laws
 which he should be bound
 to obey though in conflict
 with his agreement The proposition
 it is suggested was addressed
 to you under the laws
 as they now are and
 was not intended to refer
 to a new condition of
 things arising under new legislation
 Jt was addressed to the
 F xécutive discretion acting under
 cxisung laws If Congress should
 under the war making power
 or in any other way
 legislate in a manner to
 affect the peace of South
 Carolina her interests or her
 rights it would not be
 ae complished in secret SOUt11
 Carolina would have timely notice
 and she would I trust
 endeavor to neet the emer
 genCY It is added in
 the letter of Mr Ilolt
 that at the present moment
 it is not deemed necessary
 to reinforce Major All dersoll
 because he Tnakes no such
 requcst and fOe s quite
 secure in his position But
 should his saföty require it
 every cflört wili be made
 to supply reinförcelnellts This would
 seem to ignore the other
 branch of the propo sition
 made by the Senators namely
 that no attack was to
 be made on Fort Sumter
 during the period sugucsted and
 that Major Anderson should enjoy
 the facilities ofcom munication e
 I advert to this point
 however for the purpose of
 saying that to send reinförce
 nents to Fort Sumter could
 not serve as a means
 of protecting and pre serving
 property for as must be
 known to your Govern ment
 it would inevitably lead to
 immediate hostilities in whic property
 on all sides would necessarily
 suffer South Carolina has every
 disposition to preserve the public
 pcaee and feels I mn
 sure in fuli torce those
 high Christian and moral duties
 refOrred to by your Secretary
 and it is submitted that
 on her part there is
 scarcely any consider ation of
 Inerc property apart from honor
 and safety which could induce
 her to do aught to
 jeopard that peace still less
 to inaugurate a protracted and
 bloody civil war She rests
 her position on somethintr higher
 than mere property It is
 a consideration of her own
 dignity as a sovereign and
 the safety of her people
 which prompts her to demand
 that II this property should
 not longer be used as
 a xnilitary post by a
 Governcnent she no longer acknowledges
 She fuels II this to
 be an inrperative duty It
 has in fact become an
 absolute necessity of her condition
 Repudiating as you do thO
 idea of coercion avowing peaceful
 intentions and expressing a patriot
 s horror for civil war
 and bloody strifO among those
 who once were rethren it
 is hoped that on further
 consideration you will not on
 a mere question of property
 refuse the reasonable tmnandof South
 Carolina which honor and necessity
 alike compel her to vindicate
 Should you dissappoint this Ilope
 the responsibility for the result
 surely does not rest with
 I her If the evils
 of war are to be
 eneountered especially the calamities ofeivil
 war an elevated statesmanship would
 seem to require that it
 should be accepted as the
 unavoid able alternative of smncthing
 still Inore disastrous such as
 I uational dishonor or measures
 materially affecting the I or
 permanent interests of a people
 that it should be a
 choice deliberately made and entered
 upon as war II and
 of set purpose But that
 war should be the incident
 or accident attendant on a
 policy professedly peaceful and II
 not required to effect the
 object which is avowed as
 the only end intended can
 only be excused where there
 has been no warning given
 as to the consequences I
 arn fin ther instructed to
 say that South Carolina cannot
 her silence appear to acquiesce
 in the imputation that on
 the Star of the West
 Though an unarmed vessel she
 i was filled with anned
 men cntering her territory against
 II her wit with the
 purpose of reintorcing a garrison
 held structed wortli n tore
 to the United States than
 tlie property within her lililits
 against her protest She forbears
 to re itself IVIEY then
 as property insist on holding
 it by an armed garrison
 Vet such has been tine
 ground upon which you have
 invariably placed your occupancy of
 this fort by troops beginning
 prospecti vely with your annual
 messaae of the I eecuiber
 again in your special Inessage
 of the 9th January and
 still more emphatically in your
 message of the 28th January
 The same position is set
 torth in your reply to
 the Senators through the Secretary
 of War ad in ft
 is there virtually conceded that
 Fort Stunter is terim held
 Inerely as property of the
 United States ivilich you deem
 it your duty to protect
 aud preserve Again it is
 sub mitted that the continuance
 of an artned possession actu
 ally jeopards the property you
 desire to protect It is
 impos Sible but that such
 a possession if continued long
 enough must lead to collision
 No people not completely abject
 and pusillanimous could submit indefinitely
 to the armed occupation ot
 a Éörtress in the midst
 of the harbor of its
 criminate by discussing the question
 of the propriety of I
 i atten pting such a
 reintöreemcnt at all as well
 as of the disguised and
 secret manner in which jt
 was intended to be etüEtcd
 And on this occasion she
 wili say notlling as to
 I the manner in which
 Fort Sumter was taken into
 the pos session of its
 present orcupants The interposition Of
 the Senators who have addressed
 you was a circumstance un
 expected by nw government and
 unsolicited certainly by me Tho
 Governor while he appreciates the
 high and generous motives by
 which they were prompted and
 while he approves the delay
 which in deference to them
 has taken place in the
 presentation of this demand frels
 that jt cannot longer be
 withheld conclude with an extract
 from the instructions just rc
 ceived by me frotn the
 government of South Carolina I
 The letter of the President
 through Mr Holt may be
 rc eeived as the reply
 to the question you were
 instructed to prineipal city and
 commanding the ingress and egress
 of ii ask as to
 his assertion of his right
 to send reinforcernents every ship
 that enters the port tbc
 dally ferry boats that ply
 upon its waters moving but
 at the sufferance of aliens
 An attack upon this would
 ecarcely nnpröve it as prop
 erty whatever the result and
 if captured it would no
 longer be the subject of
 aecount To protect Fort Surnter
 merely as property it is
 submitted that an armed oecu
 pancy is not only unnecessary
 but that it is Inanift
 stly the worst possible meaus
 which eart be resorted to
 for such an object Your
 reply to the Senators through
 Mr Ilo t declares it
 to be your sole object
 to act strictly on the
 defensive and to authorize no
 movement against South Carolina unless
 justified by a hostile movelnent
 on their part yet in
 reply to Fort Sumter You
 were instructed to say to
 him if he asserted that
 right that the State of
 South Carolina re garded such
 a right when asserted or
 with an attetnpt at its
 exercise as a declaration of
 war If the President in
 tends it shall not be
 so understood it is proper
 to avoid any misconception hereafter
 that he hould be informed
 o the i manner in
 which the Governor wilk feel
 bound to regard it If
 the President when you have
 stated the reasons wbieh prompt
 the Governor in making the
 demand for the deliv I
 cry of Fort Sumter shall
 refuse to deliver the Fort
 upon the pledge you have
 Ijeen authorized to make you
 will i communicate that refusal
 without delay to the Governor

 CHARLESTON January 12 1861 SIR
 At the tirne ot the
 separation 01 the State ot
 South Carolina fi orn the
 United States Fort Sumter was
 and still is in the
 possession of troops of the
 United States under the connnand
 of Major Anderson I regard
 that pos session as not
 consistent with the dignity or
 safety of the State ot
 South Carolina and have this
 day addressed to Major Anderson
 a communication to obtain fi
 on bim the possession of
 that fört by the autuorities
 of this State The reply
 of Major Anderson jnförtns me
 that he has no aut
 hor ity to do what
 I required but he desires
 a relOrence of the demand

 F W PICKENS To the
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 WAR DEPARTMENT February 6 1861
 SIR The President of the
 United States has received your
 letter of the 31st ultimo
 and has charged me witli
 the duty of replying thereto
 in the addressed to he
 President by Gov ernor Pickens
 under date ofthe 12th of
 January aud which accornpanies yours
 Flow betore nw his Excellency
 says I have decerrnined to
 send to you Hon t
 WV llaync the attorney generat
 of the State or South
 Carolina and have instructed hiln
 to demand thc surrender of
 Fort Surnter in the harbor
 of Charleston to the constituted
 authorities of the State or
 South C arolina l hc
 detnand havc Inade of Major
 AnderSon and which I now
 tnakc of you is sua
 gested because of my earnest
 desire to avoid the which
 a persistence in your atternpt
 to retain the posses Sion
 of that fort wili cause
 and which will be unavailing
 to secure to you that
 possession but induce u calanli
 ty deeply to be deplored
 I he character of the
 Lhus authorized to be made
 appears under the influence PIC
 stune ott the correspondence with
 the Senators to H hieh
 you refer to have been
 rnodified by subsequent instruc tions
 of his Excellency dated thc
 26th and received by your
 If it be so selt
 on the 00th of January
 in which he says that
 Fort Sujnter i hei l
 ns property then as property
 the rights whatever they rnay
 be of the United States
 can be and Or the
 satisfaction of thesc rights the
 ascertained pledge of tbc State
 of South Carolina you are
 authorized to give T lie
 full scope and precise purport
 of your in structions as
 thus modified you have expressed
 jn the fol lowing words
 I do notco ne as
 a military man to demand
 the surrender of a fortress
 but as the legal offcer
 of the State its attorney
 eneral to clailll Or thc
 State the c xer cise
 of its undoubted of mnincnt
 domain aud LO pledge thc
 State to Inake good aki
 injury to the rif rllts
 of property which arisc from
 the exercise of the claini
 And lest Q ig explicit
 languaae should not suflieiently define
 your posi tion you add
 I l e proposition is
 that her South _ atolina
 s law officer should under
 authority of the Gov ernor
 and his Council distinctly pledge
 the faith of South Carolina
 to Inake such cornpensation in
 regard to Fort Eumter and
 its appuptbnanccs and cc ntents
 to the full extent of
 the Inoney value of the
 properly of the United States
 deiivcred over to the authorities
 of South Carolina by your
 conunand You then ado pc
 his Excellency s train of
 thought upon the subject so
 far as to suggest that
 the possession of Fort Sumter
 by the Unjted States if
 con tinued long cnouzh must
 lead to collision and that
 attack upon it would scarcely
 improvc it as property what
 ever the result and if
 captured it would longer be
 the subject of account Tl
 he proposal then now presented
 to the President is simpls
 an offer on the pact
 ot South Caroiina to buy
 Fort Stnntcr and contents as
 property of the U lifted
 State s sus taiue d
 hy a declaration in eflQet
 that if she is not
 peril i ted seize 1
 ne iOrt bv force of
 to unalit tile purchase she
 anns As mhe of a
 negotial ion for the transiQr
 of this proposal property between
 friendly presses the Prcsidcnt as
 having assumed a however investigated
 the claim ort which fortn
 it professes to be based
 apart from the deciarati01i that
 accrnnpallics it And it may
 be here remarked Lhat stress
 has been laid upon the
 employment of the property and
 pubiic property by tlie President
 in his Ellhese are the
 niost comprehensive Inesss igres terms
 which can be used in
 such a connection and surely
 when re Urring to a
 tort or any other public
 establishment they einbraced the entire
 and undivided interest of the
 l he title of the
 United States to Fort Governnwntthcreiu
 Sunlter is coznpicte and incontestable
 Were its inteæst I in
 this property purely proprietary in
 t he ordinary accepta tion
 of the tcrln it tnigi
 t probably be subjected to
 the exer cise of the
 right of enliitent it unain
 but it has also politi
 eal relations to it of
 a inueh Ili Uer and
 more imposina etiae acter thar
 those of Inere proprietorship It
 his abso lute jurisdiction over
 ibe tort and the soil
 on which it stands l
 his jurisdiction consists in the
 authority to exercise exclusive legislation
 over the property referred to
 and is therefore clearly ineo
 npatihle with the claim of
 eminent domain insisted upon by
 South Carolina J his author
 ity was not derived from
 any questionable revolutionary sol n
 ce but frorn the peaceful
 cession of South Carolina herself
 acting through her Legislature under
 a provision of the Constitution
 ot the United States South
 Carolina can no Inore assert
 the right of eluine11L domain
 over Fort Sumter than Maryland
 can assert it over the
 District of The political and
 propriétary rights of the Coltunbia
 United Statcs in either case
 rest upon precisely the same
 ground Prcsident however is relieved
 from the necessity of further
 pursuing this inquiry bythc fact
 that whatever gnay be the
 clann of South Carolina to
 this fort he has no
 constitutional power to cede or
 surrender it I he property
 of the United States has
 been acquired by force of
 public law and can only
 be disposed of under the
 saine solernn Rhe President as
 the head of the sanctions
 hranchni the Governrnent only can
 no inore sell and trans
 Fort Su nter to South
 Carolina than he can sell
 and convey the Capitol of
 the United States to Maryland
 or to anv other State
 or individual seeking to possess
 it Excelleucv the is too
 Paniiliar with the Consti tution
 ot tike Unilctl States a
 nd with the limitations upon
 the powers of the Cilicf
 Magist rate of the Gover

 to appreciate at once the
 soundness this legal proposition I

 acting under orders to staud
 strictly on the defensive and

 of South Carolina must well
 kniv that they can never
 receive aught but shelter frorn
 its guns unless in the
 absence of all provocation they
 should assault it an d

 we mayhave them read and
 voted Or particular form in
 what language of prayer u
 on at the same time
 with the resolutions from in
 what language of petition in
 what language of supplication the
 people are to come before
 the The VICE PRESIDENT The
 question now legislative body of
 the country Sir they may
 come in any form that
 they choose They are is
 on receiving the other resolutions
 but by unan imous consent
 the resolutions just submitted by
 not very stylish people many
 of our constitu ents they
 are not versed in the
 ceremonies and the Senator from
 Iowa may be read forms
 and etiquette by which greai
 bodies are to Mr MASON
 One will dispose of the
 other I object to the
 reception of the paper be
 approached but in whatéver language
 they I presume express their
 free will on these subjects
 they have offered by the
 Senator from Iowa while the
 other It is confined to
 no form re a ricrht
 to do it question is
 pending Mr CRITTENDEN Let us
 decide tion whiOh is before
 us now Thé VICE SPRESIDENT
 The question is will the
 Senate receive the re oluti
 s presented by the Chair
 Mr HALE I had hoped
 ever to be called upon
 to vote on this question
 but 1 simply want to
 say a single word not
 to be misunder stood It
 seems that some gentlemen misunder
 stand the position of the
 Senate There is no want
 of respect to the party
 that passes these resolutions the
 Democratic party or anybody else
 but they are not appropriate
 to the business of the
 Senate they arc not addressed
 to the Sen ate they
 are not petitions they are
 the proceed ings ofa party
 convention and they have passed
 a vote requesting that they
 be sent here Now sir
 notwithstanding what has been said
 I under take to say
 that since I have been
 a member of the Senate
 which is more than twelve
 years the practice of the
 Senate has been uniform whenever
 this question has been raised
 It was raised during the
 great discussion of 1850 over
 and over again By the
 advice of the great men
 who then consti tuted this
 Senate such men as Mr
 Webster Mr Calhoun and Mr
 Clay resolutions like these not
 pertaining to the business of
 the Sen ate not addressed
 as a petition to the
 Senate were without exception refused
 and such has been the
 uniform position of the Senate
 and i hope the Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 think thatwe should
 not receive any applications or
 declarations of opinion on any
 subject that are not addressed
 substantially or iri form to
 the Senate of the Uni
 If the gentleman from Iowa
 for in ted States stance
 is requested by resolution to
 present to the Senate the
 proceedings to which he has
 referred then I consider them
 substantially an appeal or If
 not of course they do
 petition to the Senate not
 belong to us This question
 now is depending before the
 Senate on the resolutions which
 presented here which I was
 desired to lay before the
 Senate evi strained by no
 law The Constitution says it
 shall not be but they
 shall have an open free
 highway to come before the
 legislative body and to express
 their opinions I am glad
 that the yeas and nays
 are called for It is
 a question of more importance
 generally than we maybe led
 to believe on this occasion
 It may not be of
 such importance in this particuiarcase
 though I can scarcely imatyine
 a more important question When
 their Government is tottering to
 its fall when not only
 Government but soci ety is
 in danger of subversion when
 not only peace is in
 danger but when war stands
 frown Ing and confronting us
 shall the people be re
 strained as to any form
 in which they may express
 themselves and beg to be
 rescued frorn these im I
 would have demanded minent perils
 No sir the yeas and
 nays myself if it had
 not been done The people
 are using their privilege Most
 pa triotically are they using
 it Mormng after morn inp
 is consumed in the mere
 presentation of their petitions They
 have an interest a deep
 interest They think upon this
 subject they feel upon this
 subject and they have a
 right to make their thoughts
 and their feelings known without
 tram mel or restraint provided
 only that it is shown
 that they intend that their
 proceedings that their addresses should
 be laid before the Senate
 of the United States I
 hat is all that is
 necessary and where they have
 expressed that desire I shall
 un questionably vote for receiving
 their resolutions Mr TRUMBULL understand
 it was the colleague of
 the Senator frotn Kentucky that
 offered rcsolutions some days ago
 which the Sen ate declined
 to receive I do not
 wish myself to be misunderstood
 in regard to this question
 I am as much for
 the rightof petition in Its
 largest sense as the i
 nator from Kentucky but we
 should not confound things which
 are unlike These are thc
 proceedings of a party convention
 and the objection I suppose
 that is naade to receiving
 such proceedings is that they
 encumber the rcc ord and
 are not petitions but resolutions
 arrived at by party meetings
 in different portions of the
 dently intended to be addressed
 to the body and country
 If one is presented another
 may be and we shall
 have all the long resolutions
 adopted to influence as far
 as the opinion of the
 petition ers Could influence the
 proceedings of Congress by various
 parties in all sections of
 the country The question is
 now depending on them and
 they I presented here taking
 up our time without ac
 were not rejected as my
 friend from Illinois seems complishing
 any object and as it
 seems to me they do
 not come within the rule
 for the reception to suppose
 If they do they certainly
 ought to of petitions Mr
 TRUMBULL It was another one
 per haps that had in
 my mind The Senate on
 one occasion refused I think
 to receive the proceed I
 ings of some meeting I
 do not remember what it
 was I am indifferent about
 this I merely want the
 rule uniform Mr CRITTENDEN 1
 desire as the ques tion
 has been for some time
 pending before the Senatc upon
 the petition I presented that
 that may now be allowed
 to supersede the present question
 It is identical to be
 sure with and be decided
 the question now presented but
 it is violating the priority
 in point of time in
 which the petitions are presented
 and the question made to
 consider this I am clearly
 of opinion that wherever such
 papers are directly or Indirectly
 by plain inten be received
 I do not desire however
 to take up any time
 in regard to it and
 I think the easiest way
 to bring the Senate to
 a vote at once is
 to move to lay the
 question of reception on the
 table and I make that
 motion Mr COLLAMER What is
 the The VICE PRESIDENT Phe
 question is whether the Senate
 will receive the resolution on
 which the yeas and nays
 have been ordered The Senator
 from Illinois moves to lay
 that question on thc table
 Mr TRUMBULL 1 will my
 mo tion if the Senator
 desires to speak Mr COLLAMER
 For one moment tion if
 not by word intended to
 be addressed to Mr TRUMBULL
 I withdraw it the Senate
 of the States they come
 within II Mr COLLAMER I
 merely wish to call at
 WILSON that withdrawn and that
 we shall take a d_iF
 ect rote on this question
 of reception and settle the
 quesa tion once for all
 and spend aböutit Mr TRUMBULL
 we can take a vote
 1 have no objection Mr
 PUGH I only wish to
 say Senator will withdraw the
 motiom I w s about
 to make the remark which
 the Seoutorfrom mont has made
 that the don yen tion
 itself that proceed be pr
 e sented by the Vice
 President to the tainly a
 petition r know we run
 some trisksi in this matter
 but I take it that
 ordinary conven tions of political
 parties to nominate candidates and
 pass their resolutions do not
 gareabout have ing them presented
 to the Senate This was
 no such convention It was
 a convention of dele gates
 representing tbc entireState and both
 frug ments into which the
 party was lately separated and
 I have reason to believe
 that their sentiment9 in this
 respect expressed in the resolutions
 are the sentiments also of
 the party in Ohio which
 supported Mr Bell in the
 last campaign They do speak
 to a question now beforethe
 Senateand I before Congress and
 they in their character as
 I citizens through their delegates
 fairly chosen express their wishes
 and so far as they
 qan have anv influence they
 ought to be propcrly weighed
 do not know that I
 can say anything more I
 have withheld a number of
 FÉOceOdings of meetings where there
 was no requést to present
 them to the Senate and
 in some cases have re
 turned them But until the
 case which my friend from
 Kentucky Mr CRITTENDEN had here
 the other day Ldid not
 recollect any case of proceed
 ings where they asked to
 be laid before us j
 where we had rejected them
 Still if the precedent is
 made i shall certainly not
 understand that we are doing
 more than settling a general
 rule arid if my constituents
 are treated as everybody else
 I make no complaint Mr
 CAMERON I desire to say
 only Mr President tl lat
 I acknowledge the right of
 peti listen to everything which
 our constituents the people of
 this country think proper to
 gend to In this special
 case it is more than
 ordina us rilv proper to
 receive this petition It is
 on subject on which the
 whole country iB now a
 i tated Why should we
 refuse to hear it sides
 in discussing the propriety of
 receiving these things we shall
 waste more time than in
 I am anxious to hear
 the public hearing them voice
 throughout the whole country I
 have no doubt it is
 more important for the representatives
 of States arid the people
 to get the views of
 the masses than any information
 we can get I hope
 ve shall receive this paper
 and as this is to
 be a test vote I
 hope all those who are
 in favor of the right
 of petition will vote to
 receive it I Mr ANTHONY
 I shall vote to receive
 peti tions both from Democrats
 and Republicans Whatever resolutions like
 these may be in their
 letter certainly in their spirit
 and intention they are petitions
 and any petition or any
 memo rial sent here in
 respectful terms by persons who
 interest in the subject memorialized
 on feel an and who
 have a right to feel
 an interest in it am
 in favor of receiving I
 do not thereby com mit
 myself to what they pray
 for or suggest I The

 I There was The VICE
 PRESIDENT The resolutions passed to
 abridge the right of petition
 That is Its framers in
 nothing in the resolutions presented
 by him in are received
 and if no motion be
 made they wjjl the language
 of the Constitution any part
 of them which implied that
 they were to lie on
 the table The reception of
 these resolu tended to leave
 it broad and open a
 plain high way that all
 the people might travel not
 to be t be laid
 before this body They were
 not addressed tians having been
 ordered by the Senate the
 contracted or interrupted by hedges
 aud fences to this body
 nor was any such request
 contained Chair wiil also lay
 before the Senate the resolu

 request to present them here

 questions about the form in

 It is in my judgment
 Now I have no objection
 to the motion of the

 vote of the Senate disposing
 of it abridging that right

 will renew it because The

 for fixing a day for

 to the Senate that I
 do not propose putting the

 merely want to take it
 up and set it down
 for some day next week

 may be then considered It

 me to do so I
 object to his motion until

 VICE PRESIDENT The motion is
 in order Mr SEWARD Ido
 not 01 ject to it
 in point of order but
 I say I object for
 the reason that I think
 petitions are cnt itled in

 and ought to roceivo it

 PRESIDENT The question is on
 the motion the Senator f
 rmn California to take up

 in suppression of Indian hostilities
 in the State of California
 so many special orders as
 sve have I think he
 will be quite as likely
 to attain his object without
 pressing it just yet until
 we dispose of some other
 business of a public character
 which is more press ingu

 PRESIDENT The Chair pre sented
 them to the Senate this
 morning and they were received

 of thirteen together with the
 other resolutions Docs the Senator
 desire to have them read
 Mr CRITTENDEN No sir if
 they have been read 1Mr
 MASON They have been referred
 I think Mr CIUT PENDEN
 1 wish only to say
 in respect to these gentlemen
 that from the very character
 of their employment théy hold
 inter course 0 a great
 extent with the people of
 the United States in every
 quarter and section They represent
 as they state 300 000
 000 invested in railroads and
 railroad stocks We may judge
 from that what is the
 extent and aracter of their
 intercourse with the people They
 say as far as they
 themselves believe and from their
 in tercourse with the people
 they think their opinions corre
 spond and they think the
 people are in favor of
 the adjustment which they themselves
 are for of the great
 national questions which now disturb
 us These arc petitions of
 no ordinary character and I
 t rust will have a
 proper consideration froni the Scnato
 I wish to say onc
 word morc I have not
 abated anything in my anxiety
 and zeal for the act
 ion of this body on
 the resolutions which I have
 offered but I have for
 some days past de clined
 to urge upon the Senate
 the consideration of those resolutions
 out of respect to the
 conven tion of delegates appoii
 ted by the several States
 to rneet here on this
 samegreat question I thouffilt it
 was more deferential and more
 respectful to thcm to leave
 the subject for their action
 as that would bc entitled
 to a much more controlling
 in fluence than anything I
 could do It is fbr
 that reason and that only
 and not from any abate
 ment in ray zeal and
 anxiety on the subject that
 I have not pressed them
 recently and I wish it
 to be understood thut at
 as ear y a period
 as can consistently with respect
 for that convention resume my
 attempts in this IZIouse to
 call them befin e this

 Democratic proceedings and ds this
 does not come within that
 precedent I object to it
 Laughter Mr TEN EYCK As
 the Senate has pro nounced
 its decision on thisquestion and
 partic ularly as I voted
 in favor of tho reception
 of the resolutions frozn Ohio
 I feel mysclf called upon
 to insist that the same
 course shall be taken in
 respect to these resolutions that
 was taken in 2 and
 be it resolved That while
 the people of New Jersey
 can make no concessions to
 or compromise with traitors levying
 war against the Govennneut seizing
 its admire the patriotic fidelity
 of those true friends of
 the Union who are fighting
 an unequal battle in the
 southern States and they pledge
 them their coöperation in all
 meas ures needful for their
 wel arc security and happiness

 under the Constitütion that they
 cannot surrender their love of
 liberty and their cherished princi
 pies yet they are willing
 if acceotabie to them to
 unite in tablishing a policy
 which Shail be final and
 conclusive in its settlement of
 existing difficulties upon the basis
 of the following propositions I
 A sacred guarantee that neither
 Congress nor any branch ot
 the Federal Government shall interfere
 in any manner with the
 peculiar systems of labor or
 domestic institutions of any of
 the States II A prompt
 repression of all armed invasions
 of any State or Territory

 the Senator be chmged with
 the duty about which he
 felt great interest I believeitwas
 The VICE PRESIDENT moved that
 all prior orders be suspended

 that that willnot be done
 hope the Senate will feel
 it their duty after eg

 Senator from New Hampshire that
 he cannot receive any petitions

 is disposed of Mr HALE
 I was going to state
 the reason why I was
 opposed to this motiön I
 was about to say that
 I held in my hands
 the ptoceedings of a meeting
 of Republicans holden at Des
 Momes in the State of
 Iowa iti which they give
 i easons for the course
 they recommend and hope that
 the trifling business of taking
 up appropriation bills will not
 be allowed to interfere with
 the presentation of the proceedings
 of these public meetings that
 are being holden over thé
 count y Laughter Mr FESSENDEN
 Is there a request Lopre
 sent it Mr HALE Yes
 though not exactly in those
 words but when we are
 entering on a great prin
 ciple we are not going
 to stick at little trifling
 things of that sort Laughter
 These proceed ings afe directed
 to be sent to the
 delegation in Congress and it
 was evidently their intention that
 through those delegates they should
 find their way to the
 Senate and I hope the
 time of the Senate wilf
 be devoted to reading a
 few more proceed ings both
 from Democrats and Republicans Mr
 SUMNER How is it Mr
 HALE Not very long I
 suppose it can be read
 in fifteen or twenty minutes
 and for that reason I
 oppose the motion of the
 Senator from Maryland The question
 being put The VICE PRESIDENT
 declared the ayes seemed to
 have it Mr CAMERON I
 am surprised that there should
 be a motion of this
 kind After a great deal
 of diffculty we got the
 important bill of the session
 the tariff bill up yesterday
 and Ido not see why
 iL should be displaced I
 think it ought to be
 permitted to take the regular
 course and I must Insist
 upon the yeas afid nays
 pn this ques The ycas
 and nays were ordered Mr
 SIMMONS Previous to calling up
 the tariff bill as it
 is commonly called I had
 a con versation with the
 chairman of the Committee on

 him that when it came
 up if any of his
 appropriation bills were ready I
 would waive its consideration in
 order that they might be
 passed particularly one or two
 of them from New Hampshire
 insist on his objection Mr
 HALE I do not want
 the yea s and nays
 i on it Laughter The
 resolutions were received Mr BINGHAM
 Let them be read no

 is important that we should
 proceed with the bill at

 and take up the ln

 the blessings of liberty to

 three weeks of the the

 Mr HUNTER hope the chairman

 the suuject should not be

 It wasa sort of un
 sympathize but can never be
 charged with hav derstanding for
 the convenience of public busi

 ago with the chairman of
 the Committee on Finance that
 when he had his appropriation
 bills ready would lay the
 tariff bill aside informally fomhe

 is ivhat l X vish
 to do now if it
 is practicable Mr CAMERON will

 the future decision ot the
 Senate Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 This has been a matter
 of contest fbr a great
 many years IN lic case
 was beforc us think this
 day week there was then
 evidently very little disposition in
 the Senate to consider it
 It was at instance as
 the Senator fi orn thc
 chairnlan of the on Finance
 5 has the rcconsidcration was
 moved and it has consc
 quently fallcn upon in order
 to show tho truth and
 the strength of the convictions
 which I then entertained to
 explain the rnattm in sorne
 nu as urc to the
 Senate I have never addressed
 this body on any subject
 with a single of pleasure
 I have nevor consumed much
 of the time of this
 body in any instance or
 on any sub jeet as
 every one here is perfectly
 aware R That this to
 me is no labor of
 love so tar as the
 enjoy ment of an opportunity
 to address the Senate is
 concerned every one I think
 will recocrnize Whchever I have
 addressed the Senate it has
 been only from a sense
 of duty and with that
 con sciousness I now proceed
 the taslc before Sir I
 believe I understand the subject
 matter that is now before
 us and I shall endeavor
 to sim In doing so
 I may find it necessary
 to plify it enter into
 some detail for fr has
 been compiicated by the skill
 of adversaries and the ignorance
 of oihers and if upon
 an examination of the sub
 ject it does not become
 palpable to every one that
 the opposition to it is
 utterly intolerable i shall be
 very mueh mistaken Jf such
 should not be the case
 I shall ascribe it to
 its true cause my I
 inability to explain it as
 it ought to be explained
 I even where my constituents
 were most deeply to be
 affected by the action of
 this body In presenting this
 case MI President I shall
 address myself to the facts
 as they are and shall
 attempt to reduce them to
 some order incr around to
 find the opposition that has
 been made to this claim
 cannot repeat with justice what
 I said the other day
 that have found the opposition
 to come exclusively from the
 Senators In looking or Representatives
 of the North through the
 history of the matter I
 believe I was not just
 in that statement and I
 therefore beg leave at once
 to retract it I find
 that the opposi tion cmnps
 from the Committee on Finance
 and I think from no
 other quarter In no part
 of the debates that have
 taken place fora number of
 years on the subject do
 I find that the opposition
 If the gen to it
 has come from anywhere else
 t lemen of the Finance
 Committee would state frankly what
 their objections are I am
 sure it would prove to
 the Senate one of two
 things either the fact that
 those objections could easily be
 an swered or the fact
 that thev know nothing of
 the subject matter of the
 claim That is the condi
 tion in which that committee
 must stand before If they
 ahemselves would go into an
 the Senate examination of it
 I believe they would admit
 the fact I do not
 believe that they have from
 the beginning taken up this
 subject and investigated it but
 1 can assure them if
 they would earnestly address themselves
 to an investigation of the
 sub ject it would not
 take them more t han
 forty eight hours to master
 it This is the situation
 of this matter which I
 now propose to present to
 the Senate and in doing
 so shall endeavor to use
 no unnecessary words and to
 repeat in no in stance
 if possible those facts which
 I shall lay before them
 Mr PEARCE Will the Senator
 from Ark ansas alkow roe
 to interrupt him one rnmnent
 Mr JO INSON of Arkansas
 Yes sir Mr By way
 of vindication of thc Cormnit
 t ee oti Finance I
 beg leave to say that
 this subject was 110t confided
 to their charge The Conunittee
 h ave always had it
 in charge The Committee on
 Finance reported the bill of
 course with no provision on
 this subject When they found
 that arnendment cornil g from
 the Committee on Indian Afüiirs
 tl lcy felt bound to
 call for sufficient and satisfactory
 explanations They thought they were
 not afforded by the ln
 dian Comniittee and they would
 be very happy to hear
 such from the Senator from
 Arkansas who is now addressing
 the Chair the Choctaw Indians
 who then owned almost the
 whole of the Stale of
 Mississippi sold a part or
 as the treaty of 1820
 says a small part of
 their United States in consideration
 of that smalt part o
 the State of Mississippi ceded
 to them and gave them
 a perfect title to all
 that country west of A
 rkansas embracing aboutfifteen million acres
 In fact if you will
 go to the boundaries and
 ex amine them you will
 find that it embraced from
 twenty five to forty million
 acres and that this Government
 vent beyond their own bounds
 into the territory of the
 Republic of Mexico in defining
 what they ceded to the
 Choctaws as considera tion for
 this small part of the
 State of Mississippi I wish
 to relieve this treaty of
 1830 from any con nection
 whatever with any of the
 points of money or property
 consideration that affect the claims
 of these Choctaws 1 wish
 to relieve the whole subject
 at once of any connection
 with that and that is
 the reason why I take
 hold of that treaty and
 the Senate will themselves see
 by the plun language of
 it that that had not
 anything to do with this
 cession that the cession was
 complete and perfect under the
 treaty of 1820 The con
 sideration for which this cession
 was made by the United
 States west of the then
 Territory of Ark ansas was
 not alone the gift of
 all that wild and barren
 country There were other points
 in it but it is
 not necessary for me to
 refer to them M That
 was the character of the
 title in the first place
 of the Choctaws in 1820
 under the treaty to the
 country which they now occupy
 The second article of the
 treaty of 1820 is in
 these words For and in
 consideration of the foregoinrr cession
 Meaning the cession by the
 Choctaws ofa part of the
 State of Mississippi on the
 part of the Choctaw nation
 and in part satisfac tion
 for the saine the comrnissioners
 of the United States in
 behalf of said Stat es
 do hereby cede to said
 nation a tract of country
 west of the Mississippi river
 situate be tween the Arkansas
 and Red river and bounded
 as fol lows beginning on
 the Arkansas river where the
 lower boundary linc of the
 Cherokees strikes the same That
 is in the region of
 what is now Fort Smith
 thencc up the Arkansas to
 the Canadian Pork and up
 the same to its source
 thence duc south to the
 Red river thence down lied
 river three miles below the
 111012th of Little rivet empties
 itself into Red river on
 the north side thence in
 a direct line to thc
 beginning That was the cession
 of 1820 It is unneces
 sary to dilate upon it
 That cession ran far into
 the Territory of New Mexico
 to the sources of I
 the Canadian one of the
 longest rivers in Amer I
 ica and thence due south
 to Red river That vyyas
 afterwards taken away from them
 or at least was excluded
 in a subsequent treaty as
 a part of Mr TOHNSON
 ofArkansas Iam very glad the
 cession without any consideration or
 anycom then Mr President to
 hoar the statement of the
 pensation to them and without
 any attention be grournds of
 the opposition and the Senate
 will ing paid to the
 subject The United States in
 I see at once from
 the statement how little they
 i rny judgment made themselve
 liable in damages have to
 rely upon in sustaining the
 views which f or not
 making good the title which
 they gave are presented by
 the on Finance in But
 sir I wish now to
 direct the attention of Sen
 opposition to the long series
 of years of labor ot
 at ors to the character
 of the title The language
 Committee on Indian Affairs I
 do not hesi of the
 treaty is that ghe United
 States do hereby tate to
 say to Senators for one
 that if i had de
 i cede to said nation
 a tract of country west
 of the voted myself t
 the labor upon this one
 single Mississippi river the bounds
 question w Lich the Committee
 on Indian Affairs i I
 of the country The word
 cede is used in that
 have devoted to it and
 it were treated in this
 way treaty without any qualification
 whatever and it by the
 Senate twice even onc o
 I think f should is
 the same language which is
 used in all treaties return
 to the Senate at once
 the commission that when there
 is a transfbr of a
 section of country I held
 from them to snrve on
 that committee and from one
 nation to another There is
 throughout i would discharge myself
 fron further connection the treaty
 no qualification as to the
 character of I wouid do
 so not from disrespect to
 the title with it It
 is a fee simple title
 It is a complete the
 Senate but from a conviction
 that I had lost cession
 förever and the possession was
 delivered confidence and I would
 not consent to to them
 of the whole of that
 country so far as the
 hold position here when that
 wus made rnani United States
 themselves had possession of it
 as fest That is the
 fee ing with which I
 look at long back as
 the year 1820 When they
 have a this subject and
 with which I now address
 my title which is perTect
 within itself is it possible
 self to the Senate upon
 it but at tho satne
 tirne when therc is nothing
 in any after treaty to
 jus in what I have
 snid 1 do not desire
 to wound the tify the
 supposition that It is to
 be construed that sensitiveness of
 any Senator I mean no
 other their title is so
 imperfect that they have to
 pur reflection than that in
 trying to protect the Treas
 chase it again and pay
 another consideration for ury in
 resisting this claim they have
 demanded ii it In the
 second article we find the
 character of explanations which they
 should have sought in their
 title which is a fee
 simple title a perfect the
 books papers and offcial reports
 to which cession In the
 fifth section the same language
 they have ready access is
 used and in the sixth
 article of the same treaty
 These are clailns orif inatcd
 as far back as the
 same langu ve is employed
 under the Choctaw treaty of
 1830 The whole Again i
 would ask what is the
 character of of the claim
 against the United States I
 believe the title which the
 United States acquired from originates
 there but it has been
 complicated here the Indians to
 that portion of the State
 of Missis and of that
 complication I wish to get
 rid of in I sippi
 which was ceded by the
 latter under the the first
 instance with the treaty of
 1820 by which treaty of
 1820 That title is nothing
 more and 1861 nothing the
 same title which the Indians
 themselves acquired from the United
 States to the coufitry that
 lies west of the State
 of Arkansas for they expressly
 say and in order that
 the parallel may be seen
 plainly by the Senate will
 read the passa re To
 enable the President of the
 Unitéd States t o carry
 into effect the above grand
 and humane objects Reciting the
 objects for W hich this
 treaty was made the Mingoes
 warriors and headmen of the
 Choctaw na tion in full
 council assembled in behalf of
 themseives and said nation do
 by these presents cede to
 the United States of America
 all the land lying and
 being within the bound aries
 iöllowing The same words are
 used in the conveyance by
 the Choctaws to the United
 States that are used by
 the United States in the
 conveyance to the Choctaws of
 the country which lies west
 of the State of Arkansas
 and the character of the
 titles is identically the same
 If the Choctaws have not
 a good and perfbct title
 to their counlry the Uni
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE There the limits
 are cut down some fifteen
 0k twenty million acres by
 this treaty for there for
 the first time in the
 course of these transactions is
 it found anywhere in any
 of the treaties be tween
 the United States and the
 Choctaws that anything is said
 in regard to the limits
 of the United States or
 to the restrictions upon the
 west ern boundary of the
 Choctaw cession othe r than
 that the source of the
 Canadian should constitute that boundary
 I continue the quotation the
 limits of the United States
 or to those limits We
 subsequently acquired that country and
 1 will not raise a
 question as to what might
 be claimed as the rights
 of the Choctaw in t
 hat re spect for they
 have not raised it themselves
 and 1 consider it unnecessary
 When you sell land which
 you do not own at
 the time but you after
 wards acquire the title to
 it yourself I believe there
 is no better established principle
 of law than that the
 property at once goes to
 your grantee I do not
 and the acquired title becomes
 his II however raise that
 question here You can see
 ted Slates had not a
 good and perfect title to
 the li in this treaty
 t hc restriction which was
 imposed Territory of Mississippi which
 they purchased I wikl read
 it again from the Choctaws
 i do not think it
 is possible Phe United Statcs
 under a grant specially to
 he made by the President
 of the United States shall
 cause to be con that
 any onc after examining the
 treaty will for one instant
 controvert the fact that the
 purchase i veyed to the
 Choctaw Nation a tract of
 country westofthe Mississippi river in
 fee silnple to thern and
 their descend was complete that
 the title acquired wos perfect
 ants to inure to the
 n while they shali exist
 as a nation and that
 the whole transaction after that
 treaty and live on it
 In the first instance in
 vas complete x vithin itself
 needed no after nego There
 is a restriction 1820 there
 was made to the Choctaw
 nation a lis tiation and
 no after construction to procure
 for tinct cession which had
 no limitation and which these
 Indians any better character of
 title than was a perfect
 fee simple tithe This was
 recUnized they had under that
 treaty I in 1825 but
 here in this treaty of
 1830 ignorantly This fact is
 not confined to the treaty
 of 1820 alone it applies
 to the treaty of 1825
 The United and deceptively asto
 the Indians as you Will

 wish to inquire whether it
 will be in order to
 move that the Senate recede

 own and to the first
 article of said treaty There
 is a recitation of the
 fact of that cession possess
 east of the Mississippi river
 which con stituted the remainder
 of the State of Mississippi
 Again in other parts of
 this treaty of 1825 allu
 Sion is made to it
 and it is always spoken
 of and in fact about
 one half of that State
 and it is esti a
 term well known to the
 mated by the Land Office
 to be ten million five
 treated as a cession hundred

 known to all diplomatic cor

 and arrangements as to the
 transfer as early as practicable
 and will so arrange their
 removal of territory from one
 nation to another a term
 that as rnauy as possible
 invariably used on such occasions
 a tenn that I t
 will be seen from this
 statement that the Choc has
 a technical meaning and one
 that I presume taws ceded
 first a part of the
 State of Mississippi will not
 be disputed by any of
 the very intelligent and then
 all the residue For the
 first part which gentlemen who
 are on the Committee on
 they ceded they received all
 the country west of sanoe
 point except that the subject
 there is coupled Arkansas and
 for the second part they
 received with what rnay be
 very well termed a fraud
 prac nothing but what is
 contained in the other arti
 ticed by tho United States
 upon the ignorance of cles
 Of that treaty and that
 which is contained in a
 tribe of Indians famed for
 their friendship and those other
 articles will be found to
 consistelmost In other words they
 devotion and good faith to
 all the white people of
 entitle y of reservations are
 paid for the w of
 their land by consent upon

 will be in oi der

 necessity of another conference if

 APPROPRIATION BILL The consideration of
 the Indian appropriation Sill wasrresume
 d Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 Now Mr Presidentj I have
 shown I think very plainly
 although can take no credit
 to myself for doing it
 half as well as many
 others on this floor could
 do it but still plainly
 enough for any of the
 mem bers of this body
 distinctly to understand it that
 the cession of the lands
 west of the Mississippi had
 nothing to do with our
 legislation even if we go
 all theway back to investigate
 all the subjects connected with
 the Choctaws It has noihing
 whateverto do with the accounts
 that are before us I
 cannot however pass the su12ject
 over without calling attention to
 a fcw remarks which were
 made the other day by
 the Senator from houses and
 in the education of their
 people and their internal improvement
 but there will be seen
 throughout the vhole of that
 country no palaces no fine
 houses There Vlill be seen
 nothing else than humble cabins
 or the very plainest dwell
 ings And yet theSenator says
 that they are the very
 richest peoplc on the face
 of the globe as he
 understands How is it that
 they have their riches I
 know I once had well
 how that calculation is made
 the honor of servine on
 the Committee on Indian Affairs
 in the other House and
 these subjects and the manner
 in which these tribes were
 treated then became familiar to
 me and they never can
 be torn from my memory
 because I know the very
 exasperating and almost infamous injus
 tice which they have often
 received at the hands of
 the United States A most
 melancholy and shameful instance of
 that injustice is that which
 was practiced upon the Creeks
 which was even Maine Mr
 FESSENDEN who is one Of
 the mem a worse one
 than the present instance at
 Fort I do not see
 Jackson where in capitulating enemies
 we ca bers of the
 Committee on Finance him in
 his seat and I can
 only regret that he is
 pitulated friends and took from
 them the whole In the
 course of his remarks speaking
 not here of the very
 great amount of the claim
 of the Choc taws the
 Senator went on to say
 that the territory which they
 received from the United States
 was an immense empire that
 was his expression He said
 they had received that great
 empire im mensely more than
 they were entitled to receive
 I will say to the
 Senator that what they received
 there was for a very
 small part of what they
 had ceded to the United
 States in the State of
 Missis sippi In order to
 make the absurdity of the
 remark with regard to the
 Choctaws more palpable still let
 me ask at the time
 the cession was made of
 the country west of Arkansas
 what was its con dition
 The cession was made in
 1820 In 1820 that country
 lay west of the I
 erritory which was then organized
 and the whole Territory had
 but I one county in
 it and that was the
 county of Ar kansas as
 a part of the Territory
 of Mis souri previous to
 her admission into the Uni02
 i What population was therc
 There could not have been
 within the limits of the
 Territory of Arkansas at the
 time it was detached from
 Missouri more than Ren or
 twelve thousand people if indeed
 there I think the num
 were more than five thousand
 ber of persons inside of
 the rrcrritory was about five
 thousand according to such statements
 as I have seen in
 regard to it Then what
 was the character of the
 territory which was ceded to
 the Choctaws that lay west
 of that That territory was
 then a wilderness utter and
 entire and there was no
 human being that ever madc
 a track upon it except
 the wild and rofing Indians
 whose hunting grounds those constituted
 That wilderness was utterly It
 was n small part of
 the country unbroken of their
 country But speaking of the
 wealth of the Choctaws and
 the manner in which they
 are estimated to be the
 wealthiest people on the face
 of the earth it is
 because that country of fiftcen
 million acres is divided out
 in proportion to their numbers
 by the imagination of the
 person who makes the estimate
 and ea ch citizen or
 member of that tribe of
 Indians would have so many
 acres of land The truth
 is there is not one
 of them that owns a
 foot of this land except
 in common They are so
 restricted by the treaty of
 1830 which is a wrong
 upon them that they asa
 nation can not dispose of
 their territory nor of their
 lands They hold them subject
 to that condition and that
 is done by what to
 characterize it as it ought
 to bc characterized and which
 I shall not scruple to
 characterize as a fraud that
 was practiced upon the ignorant
 T hat fraud is the
 more pal pablc if you
 will go behind the treaty
 itself and examine the notes
 and tbc memoranda that were
 taken at the time showing
 what the true intent and
 meaning of the treaty of
 1830 was These fåcts are
 familiar to the Committee on
 Indian Affairs There is not
 and there never has been
 one single solitary rnember of
 the Commit tee on Indian
 Affairs who isnot familiar as
 I un derstand with thc
 facts they having studied them
 that does not indorse the
 character of tho rights of
 the Choctaws and the obligation
 of the Gov ernment of
 the United States to make
 vvrith them fair and honest
 settlement and particularly to pay
 to them all that is
 claimed under this report of
 1859 The Senator says that
 they are the richest peo
 ple on thc face of
 the earth How does he
 that out By first eslimating
 those lands They constitute no
 wealth t hat they can
 avail them selves of to
 secure bread or clothino They
 con which the TJnited States
 obtained from France the whole
 price of which was but
 slit ute nothing Inot e
 than naked land and if
 it be Fifteen million acres
 is what is now estimated
 to loncred to us and
 we were compelled to use
 it in have been that
 cession It is not onc
 third the the sarne way
 it would destroy a man
 to pay the size of
 the then Territory of Arkansas
 It is not taxes upon
 it one third the size
 of the State of Arkansas
 It is The next point
 which he makes to show
 that they are a people
 of wealth is in refi
 n ence to the nothalfthe
 size of the State of
 Mississippi It was It was
 along funds that have been
 secured by them They then
 an unbroken wilderness have been
 ousted and driven from their
 own na ways beyond any
 white settlement alid these I
 ask of any live coutitry
 east of the Mississippi and
 he speaks Choctaws were consigned
 to that Senator whether he
 would not consider that t
 he i of the sums
 of that have been invested
 for them upon which they
 are entitled to an annuity
 grant at that day made
 by the Government of the
 United States was rather a
 hardship forced upon or in
 other words upon which they
 are entitled to the payment
 of interest Those sums they
 re the necessities the feebleness
 and wants of the tribe
 than anything else They never
 accept ed ceive but the
 wealth you not v reproach
 them with it willingly They
 were compelled to give up
 possessing is wealth invested in
 your own hands Other land
 and had to take that
 rather than get and which
 being so invested you refuse
 and you will continue 1
 presume to refuse to pay
 to them nothing at all
 The Senator then went on
 and it is by that
 ii any part of II
 Now that is the condition
 of things Is it right
 general course of reasoning that
 suspicion is I know it
 is not no man can
 study this question thrown upon
 everything connected with these undians
 that if he understood rightly
 the Choc and understand it
 for himself and have the
 hardi taw nation were the
 wealthiest people on tho face
 hood to get up and
 assert that it is just
 They of the globe I
 have heard that often Whenever
 are rich in hands that
 are wordl nothing They are
 rich in Inoney that is
 in your hands They we
 come to speak of the
 tribe of Choctaw Indians that
 charge is made What are
 the manifesta are poor and
 miserable On your tables here
 Zions of that wealth Those
 manifestations will this session you
 have a report of the
 Commis sioner of Indian Affairs
 showing that they like show
 to you it is true
 some cultivated fields which they
 have retrieved from the wilderness
 the whites in the western
 and southern part of they
 will show to you some
 few roads through Arkansas and
 throughout the whole of Texas
 have been visited this summer
 by constant inces that country
 and families living in peace
 and con tentment they will
 show to you that the
 moneys I sant and destructive
 drouths which have stricken paid
 to hem for annuities have
 been expended in I Kansas
 also until one of the
 northern States has the building
 of churches and erection of
 school appropriated I believe as
 much as 500 000 for
 their relief These Choctaws are
 stricken down i paralyzed by
 these drouths They hold worth
 less lands and you hold
 their money and will not
 pay them They have been
 stricken down by the same
 drouth which has afficted Texas
 as vell as other portions
 of the country which leaves
 them now almost entirely without
 bread and they have to
 depend upon the destruction of
 their cattle for meat and
 to send their delegations here
 and pay their expenses out
 of a portion of the
 pittance they have left to
 implore you after thirty years
 for God s sake to
 give them a small part
 of that which is justly
 their own Can you reproach
 them for their wealth and
 for their riches I do
 not believe that the Senator
 from Maine is so hard
 hearted I only believe that
 he did not understand the
 subject Neither do I believe
 he is so callous that
 he does not care what
 may be said in their
 behalf as his appearance would
 in dicate I have no
 conception that that is so
 1 know it must be
 that he does not understand
 the nature and character of
 the question and perhaps he
 feels disinclined to look into
 the subject I believe him
 to be one of the
 know his skill ablest lawyers
 upon the floor of this
 body and I regret the
 want of ability to attract
 his mind to a full
 examination of this subject and
 the elo quence to hold
 the ear of the Senate
 to the cry of distress
 that comes up from that
 country I ask the Senate
 to do justice You have
 denied it so long that
 you have sanctified the denial
 you have thrown a taint
 and a stain upon the
 truth and have thus far
 condemned and driven out the
 peo ple that have just
 claims upon you Talk of
 com promise Gentlemen the Choctaws
 can compro mise further they
 can yield all their rights
 They may say they will
 take two and three pence
 in God s name if
 you will only give it
 and let them go and
 cease to beg but for
 my part as a Sena
 tor upon this floor I
 never will be a party
 to any com promise that
 is simply palpable and bare
 faced robbery inflicted on the
 weak by the strong by
 the guardian on the ward
 through a Series of skillful
 maneuvers in which talent and
 reputation and high position in
 this body are effective weap
 1 want Senators to wake
 up to this thing ons
 It is very plain It
 does not require forty eight
 hours investigation to satisfy the
 mind of any one So
 much then for the wealth
 of that coun try and
 for the character of that
 treaty and for the character
 of the title of those
 Indians to those lands The
 next question which arises here
 and to which ask the
 attention of the Senate is
 as to the credits or
 sums which arise under the
 treaty of 1855 which declared
 that all these things should
 now finally and at last
 be settled in regard to
 the I sums claimed by
 the Choctaws under the treaty
 of 1830 What arc thosc
 sums have before I us
 the propositions submitted to the
 Senate They I vere submitted
 to every Department An award
 was to be made and
 a principle was adopted on
 which you would settle with
 them I discover in looking
 through it one very great
 injustice that f is practiced
 in the statement of the
 account which would make a
 million or a million and
 a half more but according
 to the account of the
 Choctaws the correctness of which
 is udmitted by the De
 partment their claims against the
 United States under the treaty
 of 1855 not originating under
 that treaty but originating under
 the treaty of 1830 amount
 to 3 574 000 For
 that sum they state their
 account but in the statement
 of the account it will
 be discovered that although under
 the fourteenth article of the
 treaty there were re served
 one million nine hundred and
 ten thousand and fourhundred acres
 of reservations of the very
 best lands in the State
 of Mississippi those reser vations
 were never suffered to be
 perfected and much the greater
 part of them never were
 per fected to those Indians
 They were driven out They
 claimed damages for them The
 damages are allowed at the
 rate of 1 25 an
 acre Those reservations were the
 best lands in Mississippi and
 I believe almost every one
 had more or less improvement
 upon them Those lands were
 worth an average of ten
 dollars an acre but no
 one could deny under any
 estimate whatever that they were
 worth five dollars an acre
 That alone in a statement
 of the account due to
 them would have brought in
 an amount of from five
 to ten million more to
 be added to their account
 But putting all that aside
 what they claim and what
 was stated amount ed to
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE The
 Government ofthe United States in
 making the treaty of 1855
 was uncertain as to what
 was the best method to
 settle It was a very
 shrewd and intelligent man Mr
 Manypenny I believe who made
 the treaty Weall know him
 Every one who has had
 business to settle with him
 knows well the rigidity with
 which be searched every thing
 and the earnestness with which
 he at tempted to protect
 the interests of the United
 States He made the treaty
 in 1855 and he con
 claded that it was best
 to settle and get clear
 of these matters upon this
 principle to leave to the
 Government of the United States
 an alternative in making the
 settlement to allow the United
 States to settle either by
 paying the net proceeds of
 all the lands that the
 Indians sold in Mississippi or
 pay ing up those obligations
 which originated under the treaty
 of 1830 after deducting all
 expenses paid by the United
 States Upon that examina tion
 he was pretty well satisfied
 in his own mind that
 if we paid the net
 proceeds of those lands the
 Government of the United States
 would pay less than if
 it paid the sum in
 gross which would make the
 just obligation of the United
 States to the Choctaw nation
 He therefore framed that treaty
 leaving it to the Senate
 of the United States to
 which the Indians themselves readily
 as sented to become the
 arbiter as between them a
 point to which I wish
 to direct my attention specifically
 The Senate or rather the
 Senate s committee took u
 p subject and laborixw to
 reach justice but the same
 time by the most rigid
 and strict r wues to
 protect the Treasury of the
 United States hnv brought in
 their method method of settlement
 pre of settlement scribed that
 thev _d take the rule
 of the net proceeds as
 the clearer and easier method
 of ascertaining was due Upon
 the passage of that award
 which was passed here determin
 ing that that should be
 the course of settlement the
 Senate adopted resolutio_n which I
 will read This award was
 passed after four years of
 study in the Department and
 in the committee of the
 Senate and on the conclusion
 of the investigation of this
 award the Senate adopted the
 following principles on Z hich
 the accounts of the Choctaws
 should be setued Whereas the
 eleventh article ofthe treaty of
 June 22 1855 with the
 Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians provides
 that tile questions be subiüitted
 decision to the Senafe of
 the United States first whether
 tbe Choc taws are entitled
 to or shall be allowed
 the proceeds of the sale
 of the lands ceded by
 them to the United States
 by the treaty of September
 27 1830 deducting therefrom the
 costs of their survey and
 sale and all just and
 proper expend itures under the
 provisions thereof and if so
 what price per acre shall
 be allowed to the Choctaws
 for the lands retnaiuinq unsold
 in order that a final
 settle and the Government of
 the United States to de
 Inent with hein nray effected
 or termine what should be
 paid to the Choctaws and
 As an alternativ the principle
 upon which it should be
 settled Second whether Choctaws shall
 he allowed a gross Whatever
 they should determine the Choctaws
 sum in further and full
 satisfaction of all their clairns
 na and individual agaiust thc
 United States and i were
 willing to abide by and
 they had no ques i
 so how much tion not
 only of the integrity but
 of the magna Resolved That
 the Choctaws be allowed the
 proceeds nimity of this body
 in making a proper settlement
 with them a feeble tribe
 of Indians as they were
 This statement of items has
 passed through the Interior Department
 It was made up long
 since The items were established
 there up to some three
 million five hundred and seventy
 föur thousand dollars All those
 items arising under the treaty
 of 1830 are distinctly and
 correctly stated That will not
 be disputed The rigidity of
 the statement is only to
 be found where it marks
 the right of the Indian
 and strikes it down alto
 gether or limits itin amount
 That is the way in
 which that settlement was made
 They then had to determine
 whether they would take up
 this matter under the treaty
 of 1855 and make a
 set tlement by the payment
 ofa sum in gross by
 the United States to those
 Indians or whether they would
 consent at once to get
 clear of all the mi
 nutiæ and all the complications
 and say We treat you
 as we treated the Chickasaw
 nation when we purchased them
 out and their rights we
 will give you simply the
 net proceeds of your lands
 and have done with the
 difficulty and the complicated treaty
 in which you were defrauded
 in the first place or
 by which you have suffered
 ever since and which has
 existed from 1830 up I
 to 1855 Then it was
 agreed to leave it to
 the mvnanimity of the Senate
 and the macnanimity of the
 Senate has lx veltupon it
 here fbr five years and
 what is now the condition
 of the case I beg
 the attention of the Senate
 a little while onger just
 to show what they have
 brought it to This treaty
 had been made it had
 been con firmed Every member
 of the United States Sen
 ate after a full discussion
 voted for it with the
 exception of two The list
 I have before me I
 do not regard that in
 speaking thus there is any
 violence to the spirit Ots
 the rule which deprives us
 of the power to speak
 of proceedings in execu tive
 session It was confirmed and
 then after a four years
 investigation the Senate under and
 by virtue of that treaty
 took up the subject of
 the award It referred the
 question to the Committee on
 Indian Affairs to determine whether
 we should adopt the rule
 of paying a sum in
 gross or take as our
 rule of settlement the net
 proceeds of their of the
 sale of such lands as
 have been sold by the
 Uni States on the 1st
 day of January last 1859
 de dLG therefrom the costs
 their survey and sale and
 all expenditures and nts under
 said treaty excludin reserva tions
 alb nved zud secured and
 estilnating the issued in lieu
 esp rvations at the rate
 of 1 25 per acre
 arid further that they bc
 also allovved twelve and a
 hall cent per acre for
 flie residue of said lands
 and further that it is
 the judgment of the Senate
 that the lands remainin unsold
 atter said period are worth
 nothing after dedueting expenses of
 sale And thus at once
 we confiscated all the residue
 of the lands that remained
 unsold and we agreed to
 pay them the net proceeds
 of the lands as the
 best way and I can
 say to the Senate in
 the con viction of the
 Government I have no question
 it was deemed decidedly the
 cheapest way in which the
 Government could proceed to settle
 The Senate of the United
 States adopted that course notwithstanding
 the lang uaffe which is
 to be found in our
 treaties in expr ss terms
 that wherever appropriated and in
 considemtiomof the condi tron of
 our finances they do not
 ask for the eon sideration
 of any o ther portion
 oftbe amount wh ich constituted
 the award upon the principlqxofigin
 ally established by the Senate
 That award upon the principles
 which were established a mounted
 to nearly three million dollars
 After the award was made
 by the Senate of the
 Unitéd States and the matter
 was referred to the Interior
 Depart ment fora statement of
 the accou n t it
 was referred to the Committee
 on Indian Affairs and thatcom
 mittee then attempted to try
 their hand upon the reduction
 1 shall not go into
 the particulars of the manner
 of reduction except upon two
 points where they brought in
 objections to two Items The
 committee after investigating the matter
 re duced the amount of
 2 981 247 30 by
 deducting from the net proceeds
 of the ceded lands which
 it was decided should be
 paid to the Choctaws the
 five per cent fund of
 the gross proceeds of the
 public lands which by our
 own laws we give to
 every land State That deduction
 was made by the committee
 earnestly desirous to allow nothing
 to the Indians which could
 possibly be escaped with any
 semblance of justice Now with
 what justice could that five
 per cent fund which comes
 10 362 100 have been
 deducted I shall go into
 no argument but shall satisfy
 myself simply by saying that
 it was without semblance of
 justice and Mr TOOMBS hirnself
 who attacked the re port
 of the committee here did
 not dwell upon t 2K1t
 and seemed not to have
 supported that con sideration of
 the subject The committee then
 after what have been well
 termed a hard hearted set
 of officers in the Government
 had cut down the claim
 of the Choctaws to 2
 900 000 struck out the
 five per cent fund which
 this Government owed to the
 State of Mississippi and compelled
 the Choctaw Indians to pay_it
 without the Choc taw Indians
 having any transactions with the
 State of Mississippi The committee
 then go to another item
 which had been allowed in
 the account stated by the
 Departmentunder the treaty of 1855
 tnd the treaty of 1830
 The Committeeon Indian Affairs which
 now report s the amendment
 before you deducted from the
 Indian lands all such lands
 as Congress had donated as
 swamp lands and for school
 pur poses and railroad purposes
 to the Slate of Mis
 sissippi Their value amou nts
 to 286 560 Under this
 award it was expressly agreed
 that the net proceeds of
 those lands should be allowed
 to the Indians in satisfaction
 of their claims against the
 there is a subject matter
 of doubt in the treaty
 Government Of the United States
 and in inter that subiect
 matter shall be construed in
 the most preting the treaty
 and obeying the resolution of
 favorable manner to the Indians
 We entered the Senate requiring
 the accounts to be stated
 by into that distinct stipulation
 for the interests of the
 rl he n comes the
 resolution afterwards Indians upon which
 these occounts are stated After
 hav It proceeds as the
 ing adopted the principle of
 mannm in which we should
 proceed with the set tiement
 of the Choctaws we resolved
 That the Secretary of Ehe
 Interior cause an account to
 be stated with the Choctaws
 showing what amount is due
 thern according to the above
 proscribed principles of settle xuent
 and report the san nc
 to Congress This was passed
 in 1859 Since that time
 I think about fourteen months
 have been taken to make
 up these accounts upon which
 I wish to comment fora
 little while The award being
 made I in March 1859
 it required the Interior Depart
 the Interior Department by the
 General Land Office by the
 Commissioner of Indian Affairs and
 by the Secor d Auditorof
 the Treasury those officers returned
 the amount of 2 900
 000 but the committee took
 these two items which were
 allowed distinctly by all these
 officers as unob jectionable amounting
 in the aggregate to over
 648 000 and struck them
 out gnd reported back the
 award and the statedaccounl which
 was made by the Department
 and recommended thé pay mentat
 the lastsession ofCongress of 2
 332 000 Upon that proposition
 of the Committee on ln
 dian Affairs we had then
 a very considerable de In
 the course of that debate
 some parties bate who took
 exception to what the committee
 did ment to report an
 account showing the amount to
 sustained the committee expressly in
 objecting to be paid The
 Land Office then investigated that
 those 648 000 ilhe result
 of that and of the
 course pursued by the Committee
 on Indian Af account with
 regard to the net proceeds
 The In fairs was that
 the Choctaw delegation gave up
 dian Office also in vestigated
 these accounts to dis cover
 all the charges that could
 be made against all hope
 of obtaining the five per
 cent fund and v the
 vuiue of the railroad and
 school and swamp the Indians
 under the treaty of 1830
 for expenül lands the Government
 had taken from them tures
 and payments of n i0ür
 y of every character I
 The Second Auditor s also
 did the same and given
 to the State of Mississippi
 The Choc taws seeing the
 spirit that actuated the minds
 and The Secretarv of the
 interior himself then took the
 hearts of the arbitrators of
 their rights here t he
 pains to maxe a exarmnation
 through lands deducting those parts
 which constituted reservations then deducting
 thecostof urveyand II out of
 these accounts A long time
 was taken gave up all
 thought then of recovering that
 and of sale charging against
 them all the expenses of
 and all the charges arrayed
 that could be consented that
 the Commiltee on Indian Affairs
 their removal alid every annuity
 and everything against the sum
 to She credit of the
 Indians and should report the
 proposition as they did and
 they said they would be
 contentifCongress would that has over
 been paid to them or
 for them éharg all the

 were re ing thein with
 everything we could array on

 manner as much as it
 was allow them 2 332

 were dealing with hard masters
 they were dealing with face
 of the earth against their

 them to be reduced and
 the Commis sharp men they

 who were a credit of

 the act for both sides
 They gave up what was

 residue pated and then there
 remained 2 332 000 as

 carne before the Commissioner calls
 the attention of the Senate
 of tho Ul ited States
 to the fact that the
 Choctaws Senate last year upon
 the amendment offered by i
 after having bought this land
 in 1820 after its the
 Committee on Indian Affairs for
 the 2 332 000 having
 been confirmed to them in
 1825 after their The Senate
 at once seemed to sustain
 the report tille to it
 had been acknowledged ill 1830
 sold a of the committee
 which struck out the 648
 000 but gentlemen seemed to
 sustain it no further than
 partofit in 1837 to theChickasaws
 and theChick asaws paid thern
 but paid them with money
 it struck down the rights
 and what are consid I
 hey which the Chickasaws had
 in the possession of ered
 to be the just dues
 of the Indians These Indians
 come before you at this
 moment an impoverished and suffering
 race of people notsufferingin the
 poetical style in which Indians
 are spoken of generally in
 order to excite sym path
 y but they are a
 people who are suffering at
 this time from the drouths
 under which Kansas and Texas
 and the other States in
 that vicinity are suffering T
 bey are a people but
 little able themselves to provide
 against misfortunes and contingencies Df
 that character a people without
 trade ccnnmerce or means They
 have asked I believe that
 the Committee on Indian Affairs
 should report their business fin
 action at this time and
 on account of the stringency
 of the Treasury for only
 that part which rernains ufler
 you take rl hat is
 all thc United States off
 all that anybody has ever
 objected to and that sustained
 the report just so far
 as it struck down the
 United States had to do
 with the naoncy They merely
 acted is 1 200 000
 the rights of the Indians
 and so far as it
 repudi Now after you have
 taken off the amount of
 ated the 648 000 and
 they then turn upon the
 as an agent of the
 Chickasaws in paying their the
 Chickasaw sale and the after
 purchase by the report itself
 and attack it and why
 Because mon sy to the
 Choctaws lyoes on the same
 United States of the country
 that lies west of the
 nder the treaty of 1855
 they do not wish to
 pay that which by their
 ninety eighth parallel of longitude
 after you have treaties they
 have eXpressly obligated themselves E
 suggestion 6 the Choctaws relinquished
 all their taken off the
 five per cent fund given
 to Missis right to that
 portion of said tract west
 of the one to pay
 and that in the manner
 in which it is sim
 sippi after you have taken
 off he swamp lands plified
 as they themselves have simplified
 it by I hundredth meridian
 and leased that portion be
 the school lands and the
 railroad lands after tween the
 ninety eighthandonchundredth degrees the asvafd
 which they have voted Charges
 were made based upon a

 you have deducted every item
 which the commit tee have
 withheld and deducted every item

 600 000 Now mind you
 in 1 1820 the United
 States sold all this country
 to the regurd to which
 a doubt is suggested in
 the note counts of the
 Choctaws as it came to
 us from the of thc
 Department you bring the claim
 down to office of Indian
 All airs and frorn the

 by the terms of the

 is now before you After
 all partmcnt The tables are

 taken off this simple proposition
 through which I have tttining
 a full statement is left
 Not one particle of dispute

 and after getting through the
 statement there Iniles wide by
 thé whole length of the
 discrerion in Inore prosperous tirncs
 to the Theas that nation
 and they purchased thenl the
 pu is to be fbund
 at the bottom the note
 whicl l I shall the
 first time say read It
 is lillle peculiar The Departinent
 posc of securing a place
 for the location of wild
 ury I heard that Senator
 tribes of Indians rl hey
 made this purchase under states
 the whole amount due upon
 the name of u lease
 and paid the Choctaws struction
 of the treaties to be
 2 981 24 30 In
 obedience to the resolution of
 the Senate which for it
 Tho whole Of that transaction
 called upon the Department for
 a statement of i amc
 unted siruply to this nothing
 the account that is sent
 here Then comes a note
 which would be somewhat of
 an irresponsible affair if it
 were not that we find
 the sarne words in report
 made by the Commissioner of
 Indian Affairs If a morc
 perfidious passage was ever attached
 to obligation sought to be
 truly and iustly solved I
 have never met with it
 nor known It nor heard
 of it I will read
 the note for have no
 question hat the Seriate will
 see the impudence l he
 rnen who con of its
 propositi01 f at coivcd them
 wou ld not syt vre
 ost t hint such but
 it atuout ts tn n
 sum things should 100 iono
 gestiofalsi puttinsr evil into the
 minds of others and some
 members of the Commit tpe
 011 Finance who were but
 little infonned on the subject
 were not able to escape
 falling into this trap it
 were a transaction ill which
 private individ uals were concerned
 it would be enough to
 rnake the cheek of any
 man whether he was an
 honorable gentleman or not man
 with shame in the face
 of any other of his
 fellow men That is the
 truth the Govcn ntnent of
 tho United States having first
 sold all that country to
 the Choctaws afterwards wanted part
 of it back but having
 received as n consideration the
 lands in Mississippi and ail
 being settled us far as
 the lands were concerned the
 Unit ed States gave 600
 000 in order to have
 a part of these lands
 returned under an arrange rncnt
 in t he form of
 a lease which is nothing
 more than a sale for
 it is a lease in
 express terms to the Jnitcd
 States forever and constitutes a
 fee sienpie Now goes on
 this as tenn it perfidious
 sucr restiou if these sums
 are to bc regarded as
 pay treaty of 1830 the
 arnount due tnents under the
 the Choctaws will be 1
 851 247 30 thus rc
 ducing it in reading the
 de bate at the last
 session in which IVIr took
 yn trt t chief part
 of his objection in to
 this matter that he disputed
 the whole account and in
 the next breath when he
 u reed that he would
 not vote for such a
 thing without examination and he
 that he had not ex
 investigation amined and in vestigated
 it Is not that so
 Is there one Senator here
 who has looked into the
 casc at all or who
 has consented to make an
 effort to do justice which
 would require of him to
 listen to attend to the
 discussion of this sub iect
 who does not recoo nize
 that as the state of
 i facts and that as
 the opposition of the Senator
 from N iaine and that
 as the character and class
 of oppr sit ion which
 has been made to the
 pay nqpnt of a just
 obligation of the Government of
 the United Slates which has
 stood unpaid although justly due
 from 1830 until 1861 It
 is clear that there is
 an amount of F rfect
 v evident due to these
 Indians which cannot be disputed
 There can be no exception
 taken to II any part
 of this amount under the
 terms of all t he
 treaties you have nntde under
 the awards under the minute
 the tedious the rigid the
 eus picious investWation with which
 the whole sub on the
 fact that the Committee on
 Indian Affairs ject has been
 pursued through every branch of
 the departments through its inferior
 officers and had not explained
 the account so that he

 bureaus and then in regard
 to it and I will
 characterize it as it de

 Secretary of the Interior and

 Hampshire Mr serves in the
 report of the Department stating

 he was not witling count

 everything that not one voice

 if it were necessary ilyey
 the Senate If I had
 had anything to do with
 the reduced it to 3
 They transmit that matter then
 I should certainly have objected
 to hitherto except the solitary
 Senator from Maine his pursuing
 that course and should have
 asked who more I think
 in a feeling of passion
 than to the Committee on
 Indian Affairs and as I
 stated the committee reduced it
 by deductincr an adjournment that
 he rnight be pernlitted to
 read anything else said he
 objected to and disputed the
 proofs if after the efforts
 that were made by i
 the whole of it and
 yet he admitted that he
 had In looking at the
 stated account as fur he
 could not the Senator from
 New Hanuoshire never examined it
 and I think went so
 far as to nished from
 the Indian offce I find
 this note say that he
 never would ft is to
 be observed that under the
 second article of the understand
 the question h Take the
 amount of the claim as
 it would be VvThat is
 the distress now upon this
 Govern treaty of 1830 a
 patent was issued to the
 Choctaws for the country west
 of Arkansas estimated to contain
 fifteen mik if the deducti01
 suggested in this note were
 made ment that we cannot
 as well recoønize these cred
 and then deduct the 648
 000 stricken off by the
 itors asany others There are
 Senators I under stand who
 make the objection that in
 a hard That is very
 good so far as that
 goes Sub I committee und
 it leaves The mem bors
 of the Committee on Finance
 at the last ses I
 i time like this we
 have a right to distinguish
 sequeÜtly the Chickasaws with the
 consent of purchased si0D seemed
 to rest on the fact
 that they would between our
 creditors they say that a
 breaking the United States mark
 it vote no part of
 this appropriation because of thc
 man a man in failing
 circumstances has that lion Of
 this tract that is of
 the Choctaw coun rieht but
 as has been suggested to
 me and as try west
 of Arkansas at sum W
 suggestion contained in the note
 and the belief of 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE will be
 readily recognized by every well
 read man in the law
 in this body that right
 extends not to the case
 of a trust fund in
 the possession of a person
 You cannot make a distinction
 between your ct cditots so
 as to disregard the rights
 of your cestuis que trust
 to the funds that are
 in your hands I call
 the attention of Sen Yet
 such is the effort ators
 to the fact that this
 is among the oldest obli
 gations that it has been
 worked laboriouslyo and worked through
 such channels that it is
 wonder ful there has been
 left due to these people
 anything at all but when
 it has been manifested how
 much is due to them
 and but little morc than
 one third is asked for
 here and that one third
 consisting of items which the
 most suspicious mind has never
 been able to utter a
 suspicion against and the strictest
 economist can find no grounds
 to object to why should
 there be opposition to this
 allow ance Senators say we
 may distinguish between our creditors
 in a time like this
 I say they can not
 when they stand here as
 trustees for these Indians with
 these funds in their hands
 corifided to thern and the
 Senate the arbitrator having de
 It is morally decided by
 them cided the matter It
 was decided when the account
 wyas stated and stated truly
 by their own offccrs and
 particularly when it was reported
 by their own committee and
 especially as to that part
 which they them selves do
 not pretend to question It
 is morally decided They have
 no right to distinguish be
 r i hey sland tween
 creditors and cast these out
 to these Indians in the
 relation of guardian and ward
 These funds are in their
 hands and they are bound
 to apply them according to
 the purposes of the trust
 But suppose you could treat
 this as any other debt
 and push it off why
 should you do so If
 you would consent to treatevery
 other obligation in the sat
 ne way in which bhis
 is now proposed to be
 treated if other claimants would
 bc satisfied with one third
 of the amounts for here
 it is proposcd only to
 allow out of you ment
 of the United States is
 their guardian It is a
 Government too strong for them
 to coerce or resist rllhey
 can be sent home by
 it objects of scorn and
 contempt as they are of
 injustice and oppression without one
 cent while the United States
 can claim honor in the
 eyes of other na tions
 for the manner in which
 she fulfills her en gacrements
 with then where she is
 fearful to do the contrary
 while behind there lies a
 load of crime in the
 shape of blighted faith that
 ought to damn any people
 on the face of the
 earth This is the way
 I look at it and
 yet Senators here it is
 said will not vote for
 this amendment I I hope
 they will not persist in
 opposing it when It cannot
 be possible they come to
 understand it thal they will
 so dishonor themselves The man
 in pråvate life who is
 capable of transactions of this
 character is marked and if
 he is known he is
 nowhere in decent society he
 is not pcrrnitted for one
 moment to receive the hand
 of fellowship from any honorable
 rnan Senators here in utter
 if norance vote on the
 rights of these people I
 had some feeling on this
 matter the other day and
 if in what I said
 I inflicted a wound on
 I the feelings of any
 individuals it was no intcntof
 I have sought to day
 to avoid every possi nune
 bility of a personal allusion
 that could be offensive I
 should be sorry if in
 ad vocating a to anv
 one cause which is so
 strictly and entirely just I
 could I be guilty of
 the folly to say nothing
 of the fact that it
 would wound myself as an
 individual to do it of
 giving offense and building up
 opposition to the proposition by
 the intolerance of my own
 advocacy of it These Indians
 ask for that which is
 undisputed They ask for bonds
 wl ich are below par
 They ask only for a
 small part of what is
 due them They present you
 tlmcir memorial and the truths
 II contained in tho memorial
 are set forth in the
 re ports that arc before
 you The facts are undis
 putcd the v plead their
 sufferings and their case in
 that respect is verv much
 the same as only could
 put off your other creditors
 With one third i presun

 that of the people of

 Here is their which sots

 Indians that at once by

 to strike to shame thc

 money They have to refuse
 to pay and particularly when
 we look assumed by the
 terms of the treaty of
 f855 to ay certain claims
 to individuals of their nation
 at the ground on which
 as it seems to me
 it must be advocated for
 I can see no other
 They meet i and out
 of the nation for which
 the Government the proposition that
 you have no money the
 of the United States was
 liable before that treaty was
 made By that treaty they

 in the consideration of this
 If I have received the
 attention from credil is not
 a matter of wonder in
 such cases If I question
 t hc same species of
 broken faith existed on the
 the Senate which the question
 itself deserves I believe I
 havo madc it plain to
 satisfy i part of this
 Government to its other creditors
 the mind of any one
 provided always he will be
 white men it could not
 borrow one cent kieve that
 what I have said has
 not becn a mis Government
 should act so faithlessly in

 it inflicted such wrongs upon

 Scarcely any die believe he

 single question äsked of him
 by the Senator from New

 money there was under that
 resolution The Senator from Arkansas
 replied that he could not
 tell but it was arvery
 EClarge amount probably he thought
 between eighthun dred thousand and
 a million dollars With that
 answer the Senate béing I
 Suppose impa tiéht to get
 away it Was at an
 extra session seemed to be
 contented and without any hesitation
 they adopted the resolution or
 the awdrd That some what
 embarrassed me It was a
 pretty solemn act a resolution
 of the Séfiate passed znn
 pursu ance ofa treaty stipulation
 with the Choctaw In dians
 but it was suggested Oy
 gentlemen whose experience is very
 great whose knowledge is entitled
 to the highest respect that
 if Sve were surprised into
 such an award as that
 we were not so imperatively
 bound but thatve might look
 back to all the facts
 in the early history of
 the transaction Mr SEBASTIAN I
 hope the Senator from Maryland
 will allow me an opportunity
 here to explain Mr PEARCE
 It is unnecessary I not
 utter a word of complaint
 Mr SEBASTIAN It is think
 that I should say now
 what it is proper for
 me to say on some
 occasion tind I do not
 know of any occasion more
 appropriate qhan to interlard the
 Senator s remarks right at
 the point where the suggestion
 occurs with an explanation Which
 I feel due to myself
 rather of a personal character
 Mr PEARCE well make it
 Mr SEBASTIAN Not on account
 of what the Senator from
 Maryland rhas said but think
 it an appropriate time now
 once for all to reply
 to a species of argument
 which was addressed to the
 Senate the other day by
 the Senator from Maine It
 was in reference to the
 very idea now suggested of
 the inconclusiveness of this award
 of the Senate and to
 the alleged fact that the
 Sen ate inflicted upon itself
 the imputation that it bad
 done that about which it
 understood nothing Phe allegation was
 made in a manner whidh
 seemed to reflect upon the
 Committee on Indian Affairs something
 like a disposition to harry
 or press through an award
 as a species of surprise
 on the Senate when the
 fact was that it had
 been deliberately matured by that
 committee for two long years
 remember Mr President the circumstances
 under which that award was
 brought forward It v ras
 lute in the evening when
 there was a pretty full
 attendance of the Senate and
 when I brought it up
 as Senators will bear in
 mind I always bring up
 Indian business probably wiih too
 much diffidence and too much
 hesitation because of the generally
 uninteresting character of that kind
 of business before the Senate
 I souxht a time at
 which thought I could obtain
 the favoi able con l
 brought sidcration and the ear
 of the Senate it forward
 in my place in regular
 order There was no kind
 of surprise and it was
 passed with all the discussion
 that usually follows anything that
 is rcpn ted from the
 Committee on Indian I take
 the liberty here to say
 that it Affairs is not
 the custom of this body
 to debate or to discuss
 at length or to investigate
 here what comes from that
 committee The character of the
 business is such that it
 interests no one it enlists
 the sympathies of no orié
 It is rather a labor
 of love for that committee
 to take upon itself the
 rnembers of the Senate on
 the other side of the
 at fifty per cent discount
 This is the proposition which
 the Choctaws Chamber who have
 investigated the subject as duty
 of acting and thinking about
 uninteresting Its reports have gen
 rive us bonds now for
 the members of the Conomitt
 ce on Indian Affairs and
 matters for the Senate make
 They say b epally been
 passed here evithoub investigation that
 there arc several more 01
 this side i vho arc
 amount of and we will
 take them and rl he
 Committee on Indian Af familiar
 with all the facts who
 can readily set me I
 and in that respect i
 think the committee has sustain
 the lass right or set
 right any one else who
 may choose to enjoyed heretoföre
 an enviable confidence on the
 fairs report that to you
 and that is the amend
 ment Now will the Senate
 consent or will the sucrgcst
 any difficulty in his own
 mind as to what part
 of the Senate in trusting
 to the correctness Senate refuse
 that they shall have this
 arnount arc the relative obligations
 to the parties in this
 II of its conclusions in
 matters which it is utterly
 which is undisputed by every
 one paid tb them matter
 all v to investigate for
 themselves and will the Senate
 farther consent to issue it
 to II Mr PEARCE M
 t President when this ques
 Mv attention was called to
 the fact that t his
 them in the depreciated paper
 which I hey a rree
 tion was before the Senate
 sornc week ago be iicve
 1 voted this appropriation I
 did so was large by
 the Senatorfrom New to take
 Can any claimants present to
 you their rights in more
 humble terms than they have
 in because 1 v as
 not satisfied of the propriety
 of the York Mr KING
 who is not now in
 his seat any morc submissive
 langua e or can they
 be arranøement made on the
 9th of March 1859 II
 I then told him that
 the appropriation was a large
 more forbearing They may be
 kick ed otit they which
 seemed to have taken the
 Senate by sur one and
 probably in language nötguardedsufii may
 bo sent home with nothing
 The Govern prise I observed
 by turning to the reeord
 of our ciently not accurateenough
 to make myself pre 830
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 9
 giseiy understood I said something
 akin to that treaty that
 the Choctaws had ceded to
 the United which has been
 ascribed to me by the
 Senator States all the remainder
 of their lands within the
 from Maipe that no human
 being could tell pre ing
 to the treaty the United
 States had ceded to the
 the ultimate right of the
 Choctaws under this Choctaws a
 tract of country wost of
 the Missis award I did
 not pretend to be an
 auditing oran sippi river and
 of the present State of
 Arkansas accounting officer here It
 was tho duty of that
 I naturally enough supposed that
 the grant of this committee
 to ascertain the principles and
 rules by large tract of
 land fifteen million acres it
 is said which a simple
 measure of iustice should be
 as which was not ceded
 in the usual terms but
 certained between these Indians and
 the United which it was
 provided should bo granted by
 spe States Government As to
 what sum the account Cial
 grant to these Indians to
 be held in fee snu
 might reach to what magnitude
 it might attain ple by
 them was a full consideration
 for the ces no one
 did know and I can
 cite here numerous i Sion
 made by the Jüdians to
 the United States of illustrations
 ofthe fact that when the
 Senate settle the remainder of
 their lands in Mississippi 1
 principles and settle laws they
 know not t o what
 saw thatoutofthese lands thus ceded
 to us the ln expenditure
 ofdollars and cents itis going
 to lead had stipulated for
 the carving out of a
 great My guess on that
 occasion from an imperfect ii
 iiiany reservations large ones more
 than knowledge of that part
 of the case was that
 it two thousand acres to
 their head chiefs and wouldamount
 to between eight hundred thousand
 smaller ones to the heads
 of families to a limited
 4nd a million dollars That
 was a large sum and
 extent and stifl smaller ones
 to other heads of when
 I announcedEin my place that
 the claim families to tho
 amount of our hundred I
 found was for a large
 sum I supposed that the
 Senate there stipulations for the
 payment of somc annu must
 have had its attention called
 to the fact just il
 ities ond the United States
 bound themselves to as if
 I had announced that it
 had been be at the
 expense of emigrating these Indians
 to Hercy Mr President I
 must say for myself the
 territcry west of the Missiésippi
 that I was led into
 the error of placing the
 amount I confess I thought
 that the IJi2ited States were
 too small by crediting an
 unofficial preliminary making a full
 and fair bargain hat there
 was a report from the
 Land Office as to the
 quantity of I quid pro
 quo and I could not
 understand on that lands which
 had been sold by the
 Choctaws in Statement of facts
 what good foundation there stead
 Of that which turned out
 to be the case I
 could be for the resolution
 or the award of March
 have a memorandum now among
 the original 9 1859 Nor
 was I apprised until this
 morning papers on file in
 the Secretary s office which
 when I found from the
 remarks of the Senator It
 will appear that myguess in
 amount if ihat had from
 Arkansas Mr J011Nsox that there
 was an II beenmaterial to
 the Senate in a matter
 where prin important piece of
 the history of is transaction
 ciple was more important where
 a rule of right had
 never been brought to knowledge
 was necessary to be fixed
 and not the amount of
 dollars and cents to beobtained
 under it was very nearly
 right I expected as a
 matter of course that more
 would be charged to the
 account against the Choctaws than
 they had supposed and fulfillment
 of that very notion of
 mine and of th committee
 600 000 were afterwards charged
 to the Choctaws which probably
 was not witliin the literal
 award of the Senate But
 hen you look to the
 fact that there was a
 difference of tw o or
 three million acres bet ween
 the estimated an ountof land
 conveyed and that which a
 topographical survey afterwards ordered by
 the Land Office showed to
 be the absolute amount con
 veyed5 from the actual sales
 on the books of the
 Land Office the whole Of
 this disparity is accounted for
 and it shows that that
 committee was not only not
 ignorant of the whole basis
 of the settlement but that
 that error which led me
 into making an erroneous statement
 to the Senate was the
 fault of the Land scovered
 then that by the treaty
 of 1820 by these Choctaws
 ceded a part of their
 land lississippi to the Government
 of the United States they
 obtained in consideration of that
 ces Sion of theirs a
 cession by the United States
 of the identical lauds west
 of the Mississippi which wrere
 afterwards granted spc in fee
 simple to them by the
 United States therefore the I
 I nited States having o
 ivea this considera tion for
 the grant of 1820 in
 1830 obtain the cession of
 all the residue o i
 uu ls in Missis sippi
 for precisely the sam e
 o deration which had been
 exhausted by the cessiou of
 1820 That I confess presented
 to me a new phase
 of the affair It did
 not seem to me that
 the reservations made under the
 treaty of 1830 coub t
 be onstrucd as consideration for
 the great k In dians
 they vv ere part 0
 what was their own The
 annuities ore cc mpara t
 ively trifling the tino them
 it Offce and not my
 own But I never did
 conceal was of course proper
 and equitabie nt the United
 First Whether the Choctaws are
 entitled to or shall he
 allowed the proceeds of the
 sale of the lands ceded
 by them to the United
 States by the treaty of
 September Qi 1830 all just
 and proper expenditures and payments
 undec the provisions of said
 treaty and if so what
 price per acre shall be
 allowed to the Choctaws for
 the lands remaining unsold in
 order that a final settlement
 with them may be promptly
 effected or Secord VVhether the
 Choctaws shalW e allowed a
 gross in further and fun
 satisfaction of all their claims
 nationai and individual against the
 United States and if so
 hovv much These were the
 two questions submitted to the
 Senate of the United States
 whether the Choc taws should
 receive the net proceeds of
 the sales of the lands
 ceded by them or a
 gross sum should be allowed
 by the United States in
 consideration of all their claims
 The Senate adopted the reso
 lution submitted by the committee
 which pro posed a particular
 mode of settlement After re
 citing the article of the
 treaty the resolution goes on
 to provide That the Choctaws
 be allowed the proceeds of
 the sale of such lands
 as have been sold by
 the United States on the
 first day of January last
 dcdueting therefrom the costs of
 their survey and sale and
 all proper expenditures and pay
 ments under said treaty excluding
 the reservations allowed and secured
 and estinjating the scrip issued
 in lieu of res ervations
 at the rate of 1
 25 per acre and further
 that they bc also allowed
 twelve and a half cents
 per acre for the residue
 of said lands The question
 thus referred to us we
 have set tled for ourselves
 and for them We have
 de termined that they shall
 receive the net proceeds of
 the sales of then lands
 up to a given time
 that as to the residue
 of the lands they shall
 receive twelve and a half
 cents an acre and we
 have di rected the manner
 in which the account should
 be stated That account has
 been stated by the proper
 officers and upon their statement
 the Senator from Arkansas as
 chairman of the Com mittee
 on Indian Affairs reports this
 appropria tion He has excluded
 however from the sum total
 the items which were disputed
 so much at t he
 last session of Congress by
 the Senator from Georgia and
 others Perhaps that is well
 done I confess that while
 I am very unwilling to
 see the Treasury loaded with
 new burdens I cannot resist
 a demand of justice when
 it is madc to me
 perfectly clear I do not
 mean to say that if
 I had investigated this question
 when tho award was up
 before the Senate I should
 not have preferred a different
 mode of settlement from the
 one adopted that I should
 not have desired to give
 a sum in gross instead
 Ofa surn to be ascertained
 by a somewhat intricate method
 and which we could not
 tell the amount of in
 advance I think I should
 have pre ferred the former
 mode a sum in gross
 but we have agrced we
 have decided ourselves the arbi
 ter as well as the
 party in interest that this
 mode shall be adopted The
 accounting oßcers have made their
 estimates and there can be
 no doubt that under this
 view of the case the
 1 200 000 and never
 did misstate to the Senate
 that which concerned the right
 of the case I have
 only felt it necessary to
 say this much in justice
 to myself and to the
 committee and I wish now
 to repeat what I have
 said heretofore in lefense of
 the committee that I believe
 every rnernbcr of the committee
 understood the case as well
 as I did myself that
 I was ortunat c even
 I in bringing this large
 case before t lem and
 becr I ging of them
 as an act of justice
 to themselves and Of self
 vindication to make the argument
 and i statement of the
 case so plain that it
 should escape i all kinds
 of censurc or criticism afterwarcts
 I believe Mr President I
 have said that is necessary
 I only wanted to make
 this statement to show that
 the Senate were not taken
 by sur prise they were
 advertised that it was a
 large claim that if they
 passed it withoutconsideration it was
 no fault of the committee
 or mine that they passed
 it in the usual course
 of proceedings here that the
 committee gave to this subject
 cou I sideration during a
 term of two years before
 the award was finally made
 and when we called upon
 i the Land Offceforinformation in
 compliance with I this resolution
 they were fourteen months in
 making out the report upon
 which the Senate finally roposes
 to act Mr BEARCE I
 am sorry that the Senator
 thought it necessary just at
 that point of time to
 interject his remarks In truth
 if he had listened to
 me alittle longer I think
 he would have found that
 so far as anything I
 had said or might say
 was concerned it was not
 necessary for him to make
 any vindication of himself I
 certainly did not intend to
 throw the least imputation of
 any sortupon him butl was
 statingthe reasons which States should
 pay When I founa out
 all this it appeared to
 me evident that the Indians
 had con vcycd a large
 tract of land without sufficient
 con sideration such a conveyance
 as would be va cated
 by a chancelor I thought
 therefore as I think now
 that these Indians a good
 claim upon the United States
 in last cession of their
 lands claim thev had not
 a Clair of dollars or
 cents or a s sh
 ceeds the land sold or
 unsold at the time of
 that particular price It was
 incr deration of this Proposed
 in the amendment is due
 to these peo had no
 specific unless we mean to
 say that we can overturn
 our own award that we
 can adopt some new y
 given number rncthod and give
 them a sum in gross
 say the aun to the
 pro sum of 50 000
 100 000 or whatever you
 please lands remaining I do
 not think it will be
 very safe for the United
 valued at any te indeterminate
 States to set an example
 of that sort and upon
 J ustice and ec tiity
 of the whole the Senator
 from Arkansas Mr J0HN ed
 ner upon the the United
 States Government than upen any
 tn like a Ico al
 foundation That was the condition
 in wh ich Committee on
 Indian Affairs found it New
 sir I admit that it
 was perfectly proper in that
 committee to make an award
 of some sort against the
 United States in consideration of
 this cession which we had
 got apparently for consideration but
 really without any NiVhether we
 have agreed to give too
 much by the award of
 March 9 1859 is not
 a matter which I now
 choose to inquire into but
 here is a provision in
 the treuty under which that
 award was made under which
 it was the duty of
 the Senate to act and
 the duty of the Committce
 on Indian Affairs to whom
 had been referred to make
 their report ART II The
 Government of the United States
 not boing set up lilider
 the treaty oc 1830 and
 so earnestly contended for by
 the Chot taurs as o
 rueie settlement but justly appreeiating
 the sacrificcs Oithi ui services
 and general good conduct of
 tile Choctaw people and beinc
 desirous that their rights and
 claims against the United States
 shall receive a just had
 put me in opposition to
 this claim before l the
 followiugquestions he submitted for adjudication
 to the had fooked at
 the treaty of 1830 I
 found by that Senate of
 the United Btatee ON has
 satisfied me that it is
 my duty to vote for
 the present appropriation of leaving
 the other to be considered
 hereafter Mr PUGH In furtherance
 of what the Sen ator
 from Maryland has said I
 want to call his attention
 to the twelfth article of
 the same treaty It being
 expressly understood that the adjudication
 and decision of the Senate
 shall be final That is
 in the treaty I stated
 at the last ses Sion
 the fact that the cession
 which we claimed to have
 given these Indians west of
 the Missis sippi had been
 given to them in 1820as
 a hunting ground The object
 of the treaty of 1830
 was to get them to
 go from Mississippi to that
 land which was already their
 own I think with the
 Senator from Maryland I do
 not sec any mode to
 avoid the payment of the
 claim I wish it were
 not so Mr FESSENDEN 1
 no disposition to argue this
 matter over again or to
 make any fur ther debate
 upon it I never have
 disputed it I do not
 undertake to dispute now that
 there is cer tain money
 which ought to be paid
 to the Choc taw nation
 I have 110 doubt that
 it amounts to 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 831 a very
 considerable sum and Iam perfectly
 w ill i_ng that it
 shall be paid the moment
 it can be properly ascertained
 what it is My objection
 to this whole thing has
 been as I stated the
 other I have no faith
 day to the mode of
 proceeding I believe it is
 a total misap or confidence
 in it prehension in other
 words that the Senate has
 never passed understandingly upon the
 subject in any way That
 is my objection That objec
 tion is not removed Ido
 not include the binding powers
 of what is called the
 award Therefore I say to
 gentlemen that while the amendment
 stands in its present shape
 as acknowledging the force and
 effect of that asan award
 binding upon I do not
 want them postponed for another
 year They have been postponed
 now two years and I
 think it a case of
 very great hardship They ought
 to have their just dues
 and I hope there fore
 the Senate will vote this
 appropriation It will be seen
 that it is guarded so
 that no loss can possibly
 happen to the Government and
 the money IS only to
 be paid under such circumstances
 that every man would say
 it ought to be paid

 So the amendment was rejected
 The bill vas reported to
 the Senate as amended Mr
 SEBASTIAN 1 have an amendment
 to offer to an amendment
 which has already been adopted
 which I will send to
 the Chair It is to
 the amendment relating to the
 exchange of the It contains
 a nomi I funds of
 the Creek Indians nal appropriation
 of 200 000 I ask
 that this may be inserted
 at the end of that
 amendment The Secretary read it
 as follows Provided Phat the
 amount herein provided fbr shall
 be expended within the proscnt
 fiscal year Mr SEBASTIAN If
 this languve is not in
 serted the appropriation cannot be
 used until after the 30th
 of Junc of thc next
 fiscal year This is to
 enable tho Depart rnent to
 use it now The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FITcH in the
 chair The Senator can offer
 the amend i mentwhen the
 amendment he proposes to amend
 comes up for concurrence in
 the Senate Mr SEBASTIAN very
 well The PRESIDING OFFICER Shall
 the ques tion be taken
 on all the amendments with
 the ex ception of the
 one indicated by the Senator
 from Arkansas All together That
 will be un derstood as
 the sense of the Senate
 unless ob jectcd to Mr
 GRIMES I move to nmend
 the amend ment in relation
 to the payment of the
 Choctaws by reducing the amount
 to 500 000 The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Does the Sen ator
 desire to except that amendment
 on the ques tion of
 concurrence Mr GRIMES Yes sir
 The PRESIDING OFFICER That amend
 ment will also be excepted
 T hc remainilv amendments were
 concurred in which I have
 not had ai opportunity _to
 examine If this amendment shotild
 be to that amount agreed
 to I think the amendment
 as amendéd will receive the
 almost unanimous co nsént Of
 the I shall go fol
 it Senate The PRESIDING OFFICER
 is on adopting the amendment
 öfere d Seri ator from
 IOwa Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 to make one remark witl
 say to Senatorion the other
 side who have offered this
 amendment that there is no
 disposition to assume thätthe vote
 upon tliis question shall determine
 the vote shall be hereafter
 upon the residde Of these
 claims Therefore so far as
 that goes I Spe nb
 good ground of objection to
 the Vropositidh of the Senator
 from Iowa but when it
 comes to the re duction
 of their claim to 500
 000 when theré are undisputed
 claims to the amoUnt of
 and that too after so
 distingta n expression Of the
 Senate as to carry fifteeh
 or Sixteen mvajörity it is
 hardly to be expected that
 we caQ agree tbit and
 I trust Senators will not
 attempt tQ have s it
 re duced Several Senators thin
 klhg ihåtlthis mat ter was
 entirely disposed of and that
 there woÜld be no pertinacity
 In the resistance to what
 was thc ascertained voicc of
 tbc Senate on this subjec
 t have gone away and
 if this thing should take
 such course that the amount
 is ikely to be re
 duced I shall really think
 it but just that I
 slioul d make further contest
 upon the mattet and the
 I rules of the Senate
 afford us a means by
 Which we can get a
 full vote upon it if
 it is likely to go
 against us The sense of
 the Senate evidently was to
 pay the undisputed part and
 to pay no more at
 present without further investigation Now
 I hope this proposition for
 a rcduction of the unount
 to 500 000 will not
 be adhered to I would
 be glad if other Senators
 here would express their opinion
 as to whether it ought
 to be done or not
 Mr PEARCE in the belief
 that the 1 200 000
 will have to be paid
 eventüaliy but as these Indians
 it is understood are in
 a present condition of want
 and stand very much need
 of this money I think
 it would be more judicious
 in their friends to allow
 the amendment of the Senator
 from Iowa to pass That
 at all events will relieve
 them It does not commit
 the Senate against the whole
 of their claim or any
 part of it at all
 but it seems to me
 it would be more judi
 cious to allow it to
 pass Mr GRIMES I desn
 e to say In answer
 to the suggestion of the
 Senator from Arkansas that I
 certainly have no disposition to
 take any advant I agc
 of the friends of this
 measure I believe now aid
 have always believed that the
 Choctaws have a just claim
 aøainst this Government und I
 am willing to pay it
 as we arc able to
 pay it believe the proposition
 as now submitted by me
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 I would pass Congress and
 become a thw and now
 is on concurring in the
 amendment to the Choctaws would
 get I esteem it some
 what doubtful whether it would
 pass as proposed Creek Indians
 which the Secretary will read
 by the Committee on Indian
 Affairs I have only Mr
 SEBASTIAN The Secretary can dis
 I pensewilh the reading of
 the original amendment I offered
 that amendment from an anxiety
 that they should receivea portionofthe
 möhey Which 1 con I
 now offer this amendment to
 the amendment Provided That the
 amount herein provided for shall

 Mr GRIMES I propose also
 to amend tl lat is
 an undisputed part of the

 that it shall not be

 Senator from Iowa proposes to
 put in 500 000 as
 the undisputed claim insert 500

 a clause de claring that

 Secretary please read amendment to

 in lines seven eight l
 It The Secretary read it
 Mr GRIMES It does not
 say anything about nine and
 ten of the amendment to
 strike out the being undisputed
 at all if I remember
 it correctly und insert 500
 000 words 85 The Secretary
 read it as follows to
 insert the words and after
 the word dollars For carrying
 into effect the eleventh article
 of the treaty the appropriation
 of which sum shah not
 be taken either as affirmino

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 9
 The Secretary continued the reading
 as fol lows Being t
 he undisputed balance due them
 Mr WILSON The object 1
 had in view was tostrikc
 out those words about its
 being the undis puted balance
 due them we should either
 say that is a tart
 of what is due them
 or strike out those words
 Mr GRIMES move to strike
 out the words being the
 undisputed balance due them The
 design wa S that t
 hatlatter part should be stricken
 It not designed to say
 ånything as to I out
 how much may be disputed
 or undisputed but to appropridté
 the sum of 500 000
 to the Choctaws leaving the
 matter open for the future
 action of Congress MT JOHNSON
 of Arkansas There is in
 that last alteration that was
 made in the amendment but
 I submit now in all
 do not wishi to be
 pertinacious about that there is
 an amount of 1 200
 000 this Inatter that iS
 conncctcd with no diffculty at
 all The parties propose to
 take bonds for it They
 pro pose to go into
 the market with them and
 get evhat they can It
 cannot be supposed that the
 issu ance of 1 200
 000 in bonds is going
 to impoverish or injure the
 credit of the United States
 wish to make one suggestion
 in addition to the remarks
 which I was glad to
 hear from the chairman of
 the Committee on Finance It
 is just as Well to
 pay what is not disputed
 and which will have to
 be paid hereafter and it
 is also ncccs saryto relieve
 the Choctaws as he remarked
 from théirpreéentneeessitiés There has befallen
 them in comtnön with everybody
 else in that region of
 country a failure ofthe crop
 But there is a fur
 ther suggestion that will address
 itself to the sense of
 justice of gentlemen who have
 considered this matter really with
 an earnest desire to do
 justice It is this by
 the treaty of 1855 the
 Choc to it taws have
 assumed all thc debts of
 the United Stales in connection
 with all these malters they
 have them on their hands
 to pay Now there are
 not only all their national
 necessities but there arc the
 necessities which we by lhc
 It is no treaty of
 1855 have thrown upon thern
 oppression of the Trcasury for
 the issuance of this amount
 of bonds could not injure
 the credit and sale of
 bonds of the United States
 I would earnestly ask that
 the whole amount may be
 If the House of Representat
 ives should voted cut it
 down hereafter it will be
 for us to consider whether
 it will havc to come
 down to 500 000 or
 not but if we now
 do so the probability is
 that it will be reduced
 to one hundred one hun
 dred and fifty or two
 hundred dollars I hope the
 Senate will sustain the as
 offered by the Cornmittcc on
 ndian Affairs The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question is on the
 adoption of the first atne
 ndtnerit offered by the Senator
 from Iowa striking out the
 Qld amount and inserting what
 has bcen read the ycus
 and nays Mr GRI MES
 for and the were ordered
 MI JLARK I hope thc
 Senate will pardon me for
 suggestion or two on this
 Inattcr at this time It
 be recollected t hat nt
 the last ses Sion I
 advocatcd the passage ot this
 clairn in be it will
 also be recollected half of
 the Choctaws that the Senator
 from Mississippi Mr I DAVIS
 during the last session tl
 lat we made a motion
 should pay the Choctaws this
 sum of 1 200 000
 l in behalf of the
 Choc and settle this claim
 I thought it was bet
 taws resisted that motion ter
 that the vhole claim should
 be settled at one time
 rather than to take a
 portion of it very little
 doubt from the temper of
 the Senate at that time
 that if the Choctaws Iliad
 consented then to take 1
 200 000 the Scnate vould
 have cheerfully accorded to them
 that sum They dc sired
 that the whole should be
 paid at one timc and
 settled forever It was not
 passed but now at tlais
 session df Congress l vhen
 the Choctaws under a misapprehension
 that this money was to
 I recommended to these Choctaws
 at this ses sion that
 they should not ask for
 this claim I go through
 the hands of Brigham Young
 That said to them such
 was the position of the
 Gov I is an entire
 mistako While Bfigham Younø emment
 that I was fearful they
 were endanger Governor of the
 i erritory and offcio superin
 ing their claim that they
 had better defer it to
 I another session of Congress
 and trust to thejustice of
 the Government and await their
 action The Choctaws said to
 me We are unable to
 exist we have no money
 to buy corn or procure
 bread and such is our
 siteation that we must ask
 the Govcrnmcnt to pay a
 portion of this claim question
 is will the Government in
 this situation of these perishing
 Indians pay this portion of
 the claim I would be
 glad if they would take
 500 000 but if they
 find it not sufficient for
 their necessities I hope the
 Government will respond in this
 emergency and pay them this
 amount if necessary to their
 subsistence I think the Choc
 taws havc been fair and
 just to the Governrnent If
 you will give us half
 the claim In saying which
 is undisput cd x ve
 will wait for the balance
 And now they appeal to
 your generosity to your justice
 Will you pay them that
 sum and pre vent starvation
 Mr FESSENDEN mean to savany
 thing more against this pioposition
 but I do pro test
 utterly against this reiterated statement
 that this amount is undisputed
 Nobody admits it except gentlemen
 who are in favor of
 it and have made up
 their minds about it Mr
 CLARK Mr President I have
 iterated and rcitcr ted nothing
 I have spoken but this
 once on the subject This
 is the only suggesfion I
 havo made about it Mr
 FESSENDEN one Senator on side
 iterated and another Senator on
 this side has reiterated That
 is what I mean Mr
 CLARK I understood at the
 last session that there was
 no dispute about that part
 of the claim I have
 since understood the Senator from
 Maine to have madc statement
 that he did dis pate
 the wholc claim Whatl say
 in regard to my of
 course express his own convictions
 does not I do not
 intend to express Iiis convictions
 Mr SINIMONS 1 have not
 examined this subject bat if
 the Senators who have examined
 can get along with and
 are in favor of it
 for the coniino ycar I
 think they should do so
 It will not a ffecb
 the balance of the claim
 I want to do for
 these Indians I think but
 I do think it ought
 wc owe thetn so Illet
 hing pay thetü so large
 to be investiqrated before an
 mnounl As to this notion
 of giving them 1 250
 000 of bonds in the
 yn esent condition of hawked
 about arid gold I fin
 a Y ees to be
 tendent of Indian Affairs he
 tiansacted sorne lu r l
 he funds were not transported
 dian business there but he
 had authority to draw on
 the Indian department and Messrs
 Little O cock of tbe
 city of St Louis who
 were doing business at Salt
 and took the Lake advanced
 49 000 actual cash drafts
 on the Indian department They
 sent the drafts on here
 but before they arrived the
 rebel lion broke out and
 in consequence the Indian department
 refused to pay any draft
 drawn by hirn They subsequently
 exhausted the appro priation Oli
 other accounts and it leaves
 these is not drafts unpaid
 for vant of appropriation to
 go to Brigham Young but
 it is simply to pay
 these outstand incy drafts T
 I herc is a condition
 annexed and i the Secretary
 will read it the Sen
 ate will understand that not
 one single ce nt of
 this The Indian appropriation can
 be misapplied bureau and the
 Interior Department which will be
 in the hands of the
 Republicans in a few days
 will have tlle whole investigation
 to make and it it
 is not right not a
 dollar is to be paid
 but if right ought it
 not to be paid I
 will ask the Seca retary
 to read it The Secretary
 read it as follows To
 enable the Corrnnissioner of Indian
 Affairs to adjust the accounts
 of Brigham Young late Governor
 of Utah I erritory and
 ec o icio superintendentof Indian
 affairs for disbursements al eged

 crritory 32 734 15 Pro
 cidcd I hat no portion
 of said accounts shall be
 paid until a full examination
 shall have been made in
 regard to the propriety of
 the disbursements and the result
 01 such ex atnination approved
 bv the Commissioner of Indian
 Affairs and the Secretary of
 the Interior Mr GREEN That
 has been recommended by the
 Interior Department for two years
 in suc cession It is
 recommended again this year these
 men who have made the
 advances are en titled to
 the money I think scnne
 provision ought to be made
 to enable them to get
 it through the Dopartrnent T
 i ey cannot get it
 by applying to the Treasury
 r I hcy cannot get
 it until the whole propriety
 of the transaction out of
 which the in debt ednc
 ss has arisen has been
 and approved Can there be
 an objection to this Will
 we keep these poor men
 who have ad vanced their
 dollars and taken these drafts
 in good faith and who
 would have been paid but
 for the acci dental breaking
 out of the Mormon diffculty
 out I do not say
 that Brigham of their money
 Younc s accounts are going
 to come out right but
 if they do not this
 money will not be paid
 should rather pay them in
 Inoney but I believe I
 an satisfied of this that
 the 9 000 that I
 am tnust be suflicient for
 the present year speaking for
 because it is the money
 of citizens and for that
 I will vote But 110M
 are of thc city of
 St Louis svas advanced in
 good we to pay all
 these debts at once I
 Icre is the faith without
 a dollar of discount They
 took it Oregon debt of
 or four million and then
 I for convenience rather than
 bring gold home and there
 is the Chiriqui debt We
 are not in a sit
 as he had written authority
 from the Interior De uation
 to pay everything just now
 I believe it parlrnenl to
 draw on the Indian Bureau

 If Senator could do that

 OFFICER The object of the
 Senator can only be reached
 by moving a re consideration
 of the vote concurring in
 the amend ment Mr TRUMBULL
 Cannot a portion of it
 be stricken out The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The amend ment must
 first be reconsidered Mr BIGLER
 The Senate having concurred in
 the amendment it cannot be
 amended It can only be
 done by a reconsideration Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 will state my
 object and if it strikes
 thc Scnatc With any force
 it may My purpose is
 this that is a recognition
 of the award as binding
 hereafter and x vill be
 so viewed when next year
 an appropriation shall be asked
 for the other 1 400
 000 We are now appropri
 ating 1 200 000 which
 is said to be undisputed
 In making this appropriation we
 shall make the balance of
 it undisputed That is the
 point be cause wre by
 recital here state that an
 award has been made in
 pursuance of a treaty The
 Senate to day has bccn
 cmbarrasscd in its action very
 much by what is understood
 to be an award which
 was inade some few years
 acro Some Senators say that
 it passed without consideration Now
 this will make the other
 1 400 000 just as
 much undisputed next year as
 the 1 200 000 is
 now That I do not
 suppose is designed I appre
 hend it is not intended
 when they say 1 200
 000 is undisputed to put
 in a clause that makes
 the balance undisputed I think
 those words have no effect
 in the law but if
 they were stricken out then
 it would bc the payment
 of 1 200 000 under
 this treaty If I am
 under qtood by the Senate
 that is all T desire
 to present that point for
 con sideration The PRESIDING OFFICER
 There is no question before
 the Senate Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas I will merely say
 in reply to the Senator
 from Illinois becausc the record
 of the remarks will show
 hereafter in regard to it
 that no such conclusion is
 authorized to be drawn as
 that the residue of the
 recommend ation of thc committee
 shall be regarded here as
 undisputed There is no such
 conclusion to be drawn The
 Senator from Maine has several
 times expressly stated his objection
 to io that he does
 dispute it so that it
 is our proceedings and this
 motion is superfluous on the
 part of the Sen ator
 from Illinois and i appeal
 to him as one of
 the friehds of the measure
 to withdraw it Mr TRUMBULL
 Allow me to suggest to
 the Senator from Arkansas if
 there was no ob ject
 in putting these words in
 why not strike them out
 I see no object Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas in putting
 them in but I see
 no use of openino this
 matter affain Mr TRUMBULL Ifthere
 is no special 0b ject
 in having them there itseems
 to me the effect might
 be to preclude the Senate
 hereafter and I think I
 voted they ought to be
 stricken out acainst the amendment
 and I suppose I cannot
 I forget whether the yeas
 move to reconsider and nays
 were taken on the proposition
 I be lieve they were
 Mr DOOLITTLE may be force
 in the suggestion of t
 he Senator from Illinois and
 I suggest that by unanimous
 consent the amend ment be
 amended in that respect The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The amend ment
 is not open to amendment
 Mr DOOLITTLE supposed it could
 be done by unanimous consent
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas This
 matter is to coine before
 the House of Representatives Those
 words I suppose svere the
 result of over I know
 there is no kind of
 obli wrought care gation or
 inference in the amendment as
 it now TUESDAY FEBRUARY 12

 was confirmed and tho award
 made We disclaim it now
 and the dis claimer can
 be read hereafter and will
 be seen as welf as
 the oE jections and II

 on that side repeatedly uttered
 I do not be lieve
 it is of any use

 have had no opportunity and
 no occasion to ask that
 any private bill shall pass
 since I have occupied a

 this is a case that
 calls so loudly upon Congress
 that it does seem to
 me that I ouglit to
 have a chance to state
 the facts m om April
 1814 to September 1815 the
 town of Castine was occupied
 by the British forces During
 that timcßhe British Governmentenforced J
 the collection of duties upon
 all goods which were imported
 into Castine Under the law
 regulating the importations at Nova
 Scotia a large amount of
 duties was compelled to be
 paid by shipping mer chants

 by unanimous consent sub 530
 834 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 9 the United States ought
 not to have been enforced
 and ought not to be
 collected or retained This petitioner
 was an importer himself and
 an agent for other importers
 A law was passed in
 1820 providing for the repayment
 of duties that had been
 paid by importing merchants during
 the period from April 1814
 to September 1815 but so
 happened that the provisions of
 the act of 1820 were
 confined to those who resided
 at Cas tine or who
 acted for merchants residing at
 Cas tine Mr Rice was
 not one of them in
 18242 a law was reported
 to Congress and passed to
 prövide for the repayment of
 other parties inter ested upon
 the ground that inasmuch as
 the Su preme Court had
 decided that these duties ought
 not to have been imposed
 the mere fact that the
 persons who had paid the
 duties did not reside at
 Castine ought nob to prevent
 them from having the benefitof
 that provision of law The
 Supreme Court unanimously decreed that
 no duties ought to have
 been i nposed But by
 inadvertence the name of Mr
 Rice was omitted in this
 bill and he derived no
 benefit from its provisions But
 in 1826 a bill was
 reported for the benefit of
 Mr Rice and it was
 I believe under discus si01
 1 in the House when
 Congress adjourned upon the 4th
 of March Since that time
 to the pres ent Mr
 Rice has pcrmilted the matter
 not to be pressed partly
 because he was at that
 time a young man in
 the full vigor of life
 and felt that It was
 better for hirn to pursue
 his own business and make
 more money than to call
 upon the Gov I ought
 to ernment for a return
 of the duties state that
 he gave four bonds two
 of them he paid and
 two of them were put
 in suit subsc quently and
 it was upon the bonds
 put in suit that the
 Supreme Court of the United
 States de cided that the
 Govcrnrnent ought not to have
 im posed or collected the
 duties This bill is for
 the reimbursement to him of
 the amount of the two
 bonds that he paid Forty
 five years ago this money
 was paid into tbc Fl
 reasury This bill only asks
 for thc principal not a
 dollar of interest is claimed
 although gentlemen will see at
 once that the United States
 have made thrcc times the
 amount of the principal in
 the interest upon the money
 But sir I was going
 on to say that in
 1826 when the bill for
 the relief of Mr Rice
 failed to pass ho was
 pursuing his business as a
 young He now comes before
 and enterprising man Congress over
 seventy one years of age
 and hav ing had the
 heavy hand of poverty laid
 upon him asking only that
 the Government shall pay back
 to him in money without
 interest that which the Attorney
 General and which the courts
 have said ourl t not
 originally to have been called
 for from him by the
 Government Everybody else who He
 stands was similarly situat ed
 hås been paid They show
 that the amount of money
 contained in this bill was
 paid by him then I
 have all the record information
 here and am prepared to
 an swer any questions the
 gentleman may propound If the
 matter is referred to the
 accounting offcers of the Treasury
 this must be the precise
 amount allowed because this is
 the exact amount paid by
 him to the custom house
 the principal x vith out
 any interest Mr THOMAS I
 do not doubt that the
 gen tleman from Massachusetts believes
 this claim to be just
 but I must object to
 the passage of the bill

 object to this debate The

 insist on his objec tion
 Mr THOMAS 1 do sir

 that even granting the facts

 Speaker s table and he
 cannot take I the floor
 u uder the ca ll
 of committees for reports arid
 call up the resolution upon

 and they have no power
 to report upon it and
 I ask the Chair to
 decide wbcther such a report
 can be received in this

 to the point which the

 ask that the following rule
 may be reat The Clerk

 Now sir this resolution is
 depen Jinff undetermined in the
 House and it is I
 the right and duty of
 the Cotnrnittec on Revisal of
 I Unfinished Business to report
 the fact to the House
 Mr BURNETT My recollection of
 this mat ter is this
 the resolution referred to in
 the gen tlemau s report
 was when t he Speaker
 announced that the hour had
 arrived when the Housc was
 to adjourn sine die The
 resolution under the rules then
 went to the Speaker s
 table Now I submit that

 the peculiar character of the

 ENROLLED DILLS Mr THEAKER from

 A joint resolution authorizing Lieut
 T A M Craven of

 tendered him by the Spanish
 Government I DLEGATFJ IDAHO Mr
 FARNSWORTH ing and introduced the
 certificate of election of Mr
 Morgan Delegate from Idaho which
 was ordered to be referred
 to the Committee of Elec
 tions but by a mistake
 it went to the Committee
 on Territories I ask that
 the reference may be changed
 and the paper sent to
 the Committee of Elections in
 accordance with the order Mr
 BRANCH I object sir to
 any change and for this
 rerson the certificate was only
 re ceived as a memorial
 I do not know what
 the Journal shows The point
 was made at the time
 that lhere was no such
 Territory as that of Idaho
 in extslence it was only
 received as a memorial which
 could under the rules be
 presented at any tilne Mr
 FARNSWORTH The orderoftheHouse was that
 it should be sent not
 to the Committee on Territories
 but to the Committee of
 Elections All that I ask
 is that the error made
 may be corrected Mr COX
 I think that the gentleman
 is mis taken There was
 no order of the House
 send ing it to any
 committee I objected at the
 time to thc reception of
 the certificate stating that it
 could only be received as
 a petition or merriorial It
 was receieed and referred as
 a memorial and not as
 a certificate Mr FARNSWORTH The
 matter is a plain one
 Under the rules of the
 House I could have introduced
 the referred it to what
 ever committee I pleased By
 mistake it was sent to
 the Committee on Territories instead
 of to the Committee of
 Elections for which I intended
 it All I now ask
 is that the mistake which
 has been made n ay
 be corrected Mr BRANCH What
 does the show I he
 SPEAKER The memorial was received
 under the rules of the
 House and the gentleman from
 Illinois Mr FARNSWORTH moved that
 it should be referred to
 the Connnittee of Elections but
 by some mistake it was
 sent to the Commit tee
 on Territories Hc asks now
 that the me morial should
 be withdrawn from the Committee
 on Territories and referred to
 the Committee of Elections for
 which it was designed That
 is the whole matter Mr
 BRANCH How does the Journal
 stand The SPEAKER A mistake
 has been made and the
 preset it motion is to
 correct it I understand that
 butwhen Mr BRANCH was this
 order made The SPEAKER There
 was no order made The
 memorial was presented under the
 rules of lation of the
 amendcd rules which provide that
 the I louse l Mr
 BRANCH What day was the
 paper the business shall be
 taken up at the close
 of a second session where
 it was left at the
 close of the first session
 Mr BABBITT This that does
 not go to the Speaker
 s table and it is
 the duty of the Committee
 on Revisal and Unfinished Business
 to report such a matter
 to the House for its
 action If it will not
 do so the Committee on
 Revisal and I Unfinished Business
 would have nothing to do
 ILaughter J Mr BURNETT 1
 ask the Chair to decide
 presented The SPEAKER Some day
 during the pres ent week
 Mr BRANCH The by the
 gentleman from Illinois if I
 remember rightly I recollect that
 at the time I in
 open House inquired whether there
 was any such Territory belonging
 to the United States The
 SPEAKER It was received under
 the rule The gentleman tried
 to introduce it in open
 l House but objecfion was
 made Then it was the
 of order The SPEAKER The
 Chair understands that presented under
 the rules and instead of
 to the undcr the practice
 of the I louse a
 simple resofll Commit toe of

 Sevas re ized and required
 to settle and adjust the
 clanns of any boys or
 pages after the of the

 is pendino at the close
 of a session of fZ
 rred to the Comrnittee on

 object to any altera Chair
 is of opimon there to
 the arrangerne nt of pazcs
 under the resolution of the
 Congress dies tion which should
 not have the effect of
 bringing fore that the resolution
 referred to by the gentle
 directed to adjtrst the Illittee
 ave fu rther au thc

 certainly object to ot the
 several piece book i ol

 is the result of the

 the contingent in House possessed
 by none other except I
 the House rl he Chair
 will therefore not re fund

 836 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 9 one ofreporting at anytime
 I object to the alter
 ation of the Journal referring
 that paper to the Committee
 of Elections instead of to
 the Com mittee on Territories
 because it would give this
 memorial the privilege of being
 reported at any time anything
 is to be done claim
 that the memorial shall come
 back to the House so
 that we may make whatever
 disposition of it we shall
 deem best Mr FARNSWORTH There
 no kind of question that
 I had the i ightto
 present the memo r al
 and have it referred under
 the rules to any committee
 I chose The SPEAKER The
 question of privilege refers rather
 to the matter than to
 the committee I presume if
 the question to which it
 is sent did not relate
 to the right of a
 member to a seat upon
 this floor the committce could
 not have it considered at
 any time A mistake has
 been made and thé Chair
 Iliopes that it will be
 corrected Mr BRANCH If it
 be a clerical error of
 the Speaker or the Clerk
 I will not object to
 the correction being made The
 SPEAKER That is it is
 The House then ordered the
 correction to be made SEIZURE

 Mr BRANCH I object to

 Departmern cnn come into posses

 Mr JOHN COCHRANE In this
 way the Secretåry of the

 is subjected to the ressure
 and presence of those laws
 Unless a State has so
 far withdrawn from the Union
 as to be antæronist ie
 t o it it is

 OF SELECT COMMITTEE Mr CORWIN
 Mr Speaker 1 have beeh
 very much pressed upon all
 sides of the House to
 post pone still further the
 time for taking the vote
 on the special order which
 has been under discus Sion
 for some time I believe
 that the public in terest
 would not be prejudiced by
 a postpone nent until next
 Thursday Mr BURNETT The gentleman
 from Ohio can under the
 rules at any time call
 the previous question and bring
 the House to a vote
 on the special order and
 if the gentleman will permit
 I will say in all
 deference to his ago and
 ex pcricnce that be country
 wants action more than speech
 making The sooner sir we
 have the vote the better
 it will be for the
 country Mr CORWIN 1 am
 fully impressed by the consideration
 rcferred to by the gentleman
 frorn Kentucky but sir it
 nmy bc that the convention
 now assembled in this city
 may soon do solne thing
 to throw light upon this
 subject and enable us better
 to coine to a conclusion
 than we now arc The
 S PEAKER It has bccn
 alrctldy stated that tho vote

 other day when the special
 order was called postponed it
 until Friday next IMr SHERMAN
 My colleacue rnoves now to
 postpone the special order FL
 he gentleman from North Carolina
 misunderstood him Mr CORWIN IVI
 y motion in efü xct

 Mr JOHN COCHRANE Igive notice

 that resolution next Monday STATE
 OF UNION Mr MARSTOLN by
 unanimous consent pre sented the
 memorial of citizens of Portsmouth
 New Hampshire praying that such
 measures rnay be speedily adopted
 by Congress for the pacific
 day Mr CRAIGE of North

 side of the House have
 been heard upon this question
 bilt gentlemen this side of
 the Yf ouse have 110t
 been heard at all There
 are gen tletnen w 110
 art anxious to debate it
 and I hope they will
 l e permitted to express
 their views 1 have no
 hope that anything will result
 from that It Inn y
 be that they will settle
 peace concrrcss this national difliculty
 but at all cvents after
 that side of the House
 have been allowed to de
 bate this yuatter they oucrht
 to bc willing to extend
 the samc privilege to us
 Mr BURNETT 1 did not
 understand the motione ef the
 gentleman at t he t
 in le he made it
 I thought it wras a
 to postpone the time at
 which hc proposed to ask
 a vote So far as
 I am concerned I am
 perfectly willing that he sett
 lement of our present difficulties
 as will etn il should
 postpone that motion until five
 minutes brace substantially such a
 l lan of comprolüise as
 before the time he desires
 to take a vote But
 I may be deemed expedient
 to restore tranquillity think if
 the consideration of the special
 order is and peace to
 our distracted country which to
 be postponed it would certainly
 be unjust to laid upon
 the table CRIMINALITY OF OFFICERS
 gentlernen upon this side who
 desire to rnake speeches but
 who undor such an order
 made at this time would
 bc cut off froin that
 privilegc Mr HINDMAN I ask
 the unanimous con Mr CORWIN
 1 certainly shall not call

 If we can go on
 now with this special order
 and also close up the
 public business in the mean
 tirne 1 would be glad
 10 go on and dispose
 of the matter Mr CRAIGE
 of North Carolina think it
 exceedingly unfair to postpone the
 special order at the present
 time Elections are progressimr in
 two or three States and
 I am informed that one
 or two of the Departments
 of this Government are employing
 their entire force in sending
 to those States thé speeches
 made upon that side of
 the House upon this subject
 and therefore I think it
 unfair to cut off debate
 now before this side of
 the House has had an
 opportunity to be heard The
 SPEAKER The Chairmust remind gen
 tlemen that this debate is
 all out of order as
 the House is acting under
 an order that thc special
 order should be postponed for
 the purpose of proceeding to
 business upon the Speaker s
 table Mr CRAIG E of
 North Carolina I am will
 ing to take the vote
 now or at any time
 but if the consideration of
 the matter is to be
 postponed for the purpose of
 shutting the mouths of those
 who are opposed to the
 report of thq committee I
 must object to that course
 If the gentleman from Ohio
 desires to come up to
 the scratch and take a
 vote now I am ready
 for it Mr PRYOR 1
 desire to inquire of the
 chair man of the committee
 of thirty th ree at
 what time he proposes to
 take a vote upon the
 report Mp conwnv 1 shall
 not be ready to com
 mit myself to such a
 question as that I have
 no disposition to press a
 vote upon any of these
 propositions at a time when
 the House not pre pared
 And I assure the gentleman
 from North Carolina that it
 is entirely foreign to my
 inten tion to so manage
 debate here as to do
 unfairness to anybody Mr Carolina
 Then why make any motion
 upon the subject inasmuch as
 understood the gentleman the other
 dav to have prolonged the
 time for debate until nexi
 Friday The SPEAKER The Chair
 must interfere and carry out
 the first order of the
 House which was to suspend
 the special order and proceed

 1861 Mr CORWIN The gentleman
 from Ohio has not commenced

 SIMMS I will state to
 the gentleman from Ohio that
 I have no particular desire
 to speak to day and
 if he desires to make
 his motion I am perfectly
 willing Mr CORWIN I only
 wish to postpone the special
 order after to day until
 next Thursday Mr HINDMAN am
 one of those long suf
 fering individuals who have had
 no opportunity to speak upon
 the special order I may
 well sac rifice my wishes
 in that behalf and propose
 as a compromise proposition that
 we shall take a vote
 now We might save the
 Union Mr BRABSON I would
 ask the gentleman from Ohio
 to postpone thc final vote
 upon this question until the
 peace convention has ac ted
 provided they act during the
 present session of Congress and
 fix no special day The
 SPEAKER The motion before the
 House is to postpone the
 special order after to day
 until Thursday next The motion
 was agreed to The House
 was addressed by Mr HUTCH
 INS His speech wili be
 published in the Ap pendix
 Mr S MMS obtained the
 floor Mr COX With the
 permission of my friend from
 Kentucky I desire to make
 a remark Mr CASE I
 rise to a point of
 order that the floor is
 assigned to the gentleman from
 Kentucky and I insist that
 he shall occupy it or
 yield it Mr COX appeal
 to my friend from Indiana
 whcthcr that is very great
 courtesy Mr CASE The gentleman
 from Ohio has oc cupied
 much more time upon this
 floor than the gentleman s
 colleague Mr COX I have
 made but one speech and
 my remarks by his consent
 will come out of the
 time of the gentleman from
 Kentucky Mr HIVCCHIINS If the
 gentleman makes an explanation I
 shall ask the privilege of
 replying Mr COX I do
 not desire to make an
 expla nation but only to
 put things right Mr CASE
 If I desired to put
 things right it would require
 two hours upon what thc
 gentle man himself has said
 Mr COX It may take
 the gentleman two hours to
 put himself right I can
 put myself right want to
 say a word only in
 in five minutes reply to
 my colleague from the Ashtabula
 district Dhe SPEAKER I he
 gentleman can only do so
 by unanimous consent or by
 the gentleman from Kentucky yielding
 the floor Mr SICKLES If
 it does not come out
 of the time of the
 gentleman from Kentucky I presume
 there will be no obiection
 Mr CASE 1 dbject Mr
 SICKLES Nothing throws so much
 light upon a discussion as
 to have a reply imme
 diately following the speech Mt
 LOGAN You are afraid to
 give him a hearing No
 wonder you are trying to
 district him out of Congress
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 837 Mr CAMPBELL
 obtained the floor Mr COX
 If the gentleman will give
 way I desire to occupy
 the floor until the recess
 Mr GROW With the permission
 of my col league I
 move that the House adjourn
 The SPEAKER The House will
 understand that the order now
 is to take o recess
 from four o clock until
 seven Ifthe motion to adjourn
 pre vails the recess will
 be lost and we shall
 not meet again till Monday
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE The gentleman
 from Ohio requests a hearing
 of the House and prom
 ises to occupy only five
 minutes I hope he will
 bc heard The SPEAKER Does
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania yield
 to the gentleman from Ohio
 i Mr CAMPBELL If there
 is no objection I will
 do so No objection was
 made Mr GROW Then my
 motion to adjourn will stand
 The SPEAKER Yes sir The
 gentleman from Ohio has five
 minutes and will proceed Mr
 COX That is all that
 is necessary forme in this
 debate was surprised that my
 colleague from the Ashtabula district
 at the conclusion of his
 attack upon my colleague Governor
 COR WIN should have attacked
 me Why he did so
 I knov r not unless
 it bc from the fact
 that I asked hitn a
 question in explanation of his
 artyumcnt about incendiary publications to
 provoke insur rection asked him
 the question whether or not
 he was in favor of
 suppressing all such publi cat
 ions as the Helper book
 and Theodore Par ker s
 programme published in the Tribune
 for the robbery and murder
 of Inasters by their slaves
 to obtain their freedom The
 gentleman did not answer the
 question He shirked it for
 he knew that he represented
 a constituency who are con
 tinually preaching and publishing that
 very sedi tion of which
 my colleague Mr CORWIN com
 plaincd and of which he
 Mr Hu rc111Ns is the
 defender and of which John
 Brown was the ex emplar
 The gentleman knew when he
 covered his attack upon Governor
 CORWIN by his attack upon
 me that he represented some
 of the very men who
 had been engaged in raids
 upon their neighbors lives and
 property I cannot sir fail
 to remcmber that his sensibility
 about certain dis closures that
 have transpired in relation to
 the Re publican executive of
 Ohio in refusing to deliver
 to Virginia such miscreants is
 no doubt caused by the
 fact that some of the
 renegades and rascals of Joh
 Brown s conspiracy had a
 protecting Offis in thc conspirinff
 treason of his own district
 1 state these facts openly
 and in my place because
 they are wrongs and with
 a view to their remedy
 by proper measures But sir
 I wanted to call attention
 cspecially to an ungenerous attack
 upon myself I did not
 expect it from the gentleman
 He said I was always
 very busy in thc House
 furnishing facts yes facts sir
 for southern members to attack
 I the North here I
 would like him to name
 the southern man to whom
 I furnished facts in the
 manner or for the purpose
 sta ted Name him if
 you can I will pause
 for you to name one
 Mr HUTCHINS 1 think the
 gen tleman from Virginia Mr
 LEAKE was discuss ing the
 conduct of Governor Dennison Mr
 COX Yes sir I was
 about to refer to I
 asked the privilege of Governor
 LEAKE to that take the
 floor and in my place
 I gave the facts to
 the House and the country
 and not to Governor LEAKE
 I gave them with a
 view to the proper I
 meet these remedy and f
 ronL no other onotite issues
 openly here and elsewhere I
 stand here I with a
 duty to the whole country
 I speak not alone for
 my own district and my
 own State But when I
 have information that the Constitution
 and laws have been violated
 anywhere and that gross wrongs
 have been done to our
 own mother State of Virginia
 and our own sister State
 of Ken i both here
 and at I tuck y
 I will never hesitat e
 Mr ASHLEY 1 shall object
 unless my league from the
 Ashtabula district has the same
 home to denounce the unfaithful
 men even though i they
 do disgrace the State af
 Ohio Applause time for reply
 Mr COX That would be
 very generous and in the
 galleries The gentleman undertakes to
 brave but I am not
 asking any fhvor from the
 acknowledge I am a tJnion
 man Good God gentleman from
 Ohio f M r A
 SHLEY My col What an
 admission to come from the
 successor Renewed applause league Mr
 HUTCHINS had an hour I
 only ask of Joshua R
 Giddings How refreshing from a
 man like my colleague five
 minutes he taught it here
 for twenty years He could
 or ganize conspiracies in the
 gentleman S district for the
 purpose of attacking the offcers
 of the and defeating its
 execution not stopping titm ura
 der to accomplish such designs
 He could advise the shooting
 down as pirates of offcers
 en gaged in executing the
 laws of the United States
 If Mr Giddings who had
 no scruples as to mur
 der in defeating was ldft
 at home how far woutd
 the gentleman go Whö supeiseded
 Mr Giddings because he was
 more ultra and reliable than
 Mr Giddings Here the hammer
 fell The SPEAKER The question
 on adjourn ment Mr HUTCHINS
 1 am sure the gentleman
 from Pennsylvania will allow me
 five minutes to reply to
 my colleague Mr COX I
 object to my colleague going
 on unless I have an
 opportunity to reply He would
 not give me an opportunity
 to answer his charges He
 had an hour and 1
 had only five minutes Mr
 SICKLES There has been one
 round on each sidei as
 was agreed The contest is
 closed Mr CAMPBELL I hope
 the gentleman from Ohio Mr
 Coxl does not intend to
 shut the door down amainst
 his colleague Give him five
 min utes Mr HUTCHINS The
 gentleman Penn sylvania has yielded
 me the floor The SPEAKER
 The question is on mo
 tion to adjourn Mr CAMPBELL
 1 hope that by unanimous
 consent the gentleman Mr HUTCHINS
 will be allowed five minutes
 to reply to his colleague
 Mr BARR I hope the
 House will adjourn The SPEAKER
 The question on adjourn ment
 must be ut Mr CAMPBELL
 Then hope the House will
 vote it down The question
 was taken and the House
 refused to adjourn The SPEAKER
 Unless otherwise ordered the Chair
 will order a recess when
 it comes to four o
 clock Mr BURNETT Let us
 agree by unanimous consent that
 the gentlemen Messrs Cox and
 HUTCHINS shall havefive minutes apiece
 on this interesting discussion Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 rise to
 point of order 1 he
 House gave its unanimous consent
 that in consideration of the
 gentleman having tim e to
 reply we should take an
 adjournment notwith standing the hour
 of four might in the
 mean time arrive so that
 although that time should pass
 the House would still by
 unanimous consent have avote on
 the motion to adjourn Mr
 SICKLES We have no objection
 to re newing the debate
 on equal terms five minutes
 to each gentleman The SPEAKER
 That being the understand ing
 there will be no difficulty
 in lettinæ each of tho
 gentlemen have five minutes IWI
 r BURNETT I want it
 understood they are to have
 five minutes each The SPEAKER
 Certainly Go on Laugh ter
 The Chair gives notice he
 will watch the time closely
 Laugh ter Mr HUTCHINS Toward
 my colleague per sonally entertain
 no other feeling than that
 of kindness Against his political
 acts I have had and
 now have some little criticism
 to make be cause on
 every possible occasion that he
 could get the ear of
 this House he has seen
 fit to de nounce my
 constituents as enemies to the
 Union and as abettors of
 the raid of John Brown
 He even brought against the
 judges of the State the
 charge of singing the Marseillaise
 on the bench and also
 amninst the citizens of the
 MT estern Re serve the
 same charge of singing the
 same patri otic song through
 their noses Laughter Now my
 constituents are a humane and
 Chris A tian people They
 are opposed to cruelty in
 any shape or to any
 sort of people and if
 they had known the sensitiveness
 of my colleague and the
 nervousness of his disposition they
 certainly never would have sung
 m his presence thatbeau tiful
 Marseillaise to which he objects
 with the nasal twang Laughter
 I found fault iVith my
 co league because hc un
 Mr SIMMS resumed the floor
 and addressed I who was
 nominated and elected because he
 was dertook to furnish the
 gentleman from Virginia the House
 for an hour His speech
 will be pub more radical
 than Mr Giddings himself Mr
 Mr is in good faith
 I believe ii Giddings could
 teach insurrection We know how
 in favor of secession as
 a remedy with materials lished
 in the Appendix 838 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 9 to
 prejudice him against the people
 and Governor of Ohio growing
 out of the controversy for
 the surrender of criminals on
 the application of the Governor
 of Virginia I thousrht that
 vvas unfair on the part
 of my colleague Mr LEAK
 E Will the gentleman permit
 me Criesof No P No
 and laughter The gen tleman
 stime can be extended Repeated
 shouts of l No Let
 him go on c l
 Mr SICKLES No interference from
 any out sider Mr CURTIS
 I object to any other
 interrup tions The SPEAKER The
 gentleman from Ohio must not
 be interrupted His five minutes
 are running fast Laughter Mr
 HUTCHINS 1 thought it hardly
 patriotic on his part thus
 farther to add fuel to
 the flame of southern excitement
 if the real ob ject
 of the gentleman was to
 preserve this Union instead of
 endeavoring to destroy it and
 there fore I said that
 I thought not from anything
 he said but from his
 conduct on this floor that
 he was willing to preserve
 the glorious Union if hc
 could do it by demoralizing
 and prejudicing the public mind
 against the Republican party so
 that he could aid in
 restoring his own party to
 power That was the reason
 I commented on his conduct
 I thought it was unfair
 I have made no attack
 on my other colleague Mr
 CORWIN and if I did
 he is abundantly competent to
 defend himself without the aid
 of the gentleman I criticized
 to be sure as I
 had a right to do
 some of the positions which
 he saw I have denounced
 no fit to take in
 his report body who may
 not agree with mc in
 regard to these matters W
 c have all a perfect
 right to differ and to
 differ as Republicans and fricndsot
 the Union Therefore the gentleman
 Mr Cox can make mo
 capital against Inc either in
 my dis trict or anywhere
 else by chargino me with
 an attack on Governor CORW
 N The gentleman has made
 an attack upon Mr Giddings
 He needs no defense from
 Ine acts in this House
 for twenty years will stand
 the test of criticism now
 and hereafter Attacks are frequently
 made upon him by members
 here and I Will only
 say that his name will
 be rcmcm bered with gratitude
 when tbc ntuncs of those
 who assail him are forgotten
 I deny that he has
 coun tenanced insurrection on this
 floor or elsewhere Now this
 is all that I desired
 to say 1 willi1V that
 my constituents shall stand by
 their recor f shall stand
 by their position I yvill
 stand That godless old man
 after spending a public life
 devoted to hate ill will
 and sedition retired because he
 did one thing that was
 right voted for the Crittenden
 Montgomery bill He has since
 been making up for his
 loss of office by the
 virulence of his spleen and
 tho outlawry of his conduct
 He has as I have
 once shown here in stigated
 servile insurrections and now at
 the end of a rnisspent
 life which is scarcely silvered
 by a ray of benignity
 he finds as the consequence
 of his teaching and conduct
 a disrupted Union a terrified
 people and the prospect of
 unending hate If there was
 xnercy for the and bloody
 stritkn thief upon the cross
 there may be mercy for
 him God grant him repentance
 before he fills his dis
 honored grave But what a
 life he has lived Mr
 COX I could state the
 very words of it if
 it were necessary and I
 have stated the mean ing
 and the substance of it
 It declared that the fugitive
 slave law was subversive of
 both the rights of the
 States and the liberties of
 the people and as contrary
 to the plainest duties of
 humanity and justice and abhorrent
 to the moral sense of
 Is the gentleman in favor
 the civilized world of executing
 an outrage u_pon the civilized
 world Yes sir his whole
 party are corrnnitted to the
 demoralization of the Federal authority
 not only by such resolutions
 but by judicial decision Why
 the gentleman himself LMr STANTON
 voted for thie chief justice
 of his State and he
 knew and they all knew
 that when he was nominated
 and elected the issue was
 made upon that judge s
 Ho talked the language of
 love to the black decision
 overruling the decision of the
 Supremo race only to hide
 his hate for the white
 race who Court of the
 United States in favor of
 the consti tutionality of the
 fugitive slave law Here is
 I people our sou thorn
 States He paraded human itarian
 phrases and took upon his
 profane lips the where disunion
 begins It begins at home
 sip in your own State
 and in your own party
 and in name of God
 only to cloak his malice
 and sanc tify his hate
 He has had in specific
 wicked your o svn breast
 Your party reelected a Inan
 l kess Inany rivals but
 if we measure men s
 guilt because hc had nullified
 the Constitution because by the
 objects upon which they are
 bent who he had broken
 the oath which he had
 taken before can tell the
 magnitude of that portentous crime
 God to support the Constitution
 of the United which causelessly
 dismelnbers to destroy the States
 The whole party in that
 vote including American Repubjic As
 such Republic has no my
 colleagues were guilty of moral
 treason parallel so such a
 criminal has no peer But
 my Applause in the galleries
 Here the hammer fell colleague
 praises him and commends him
 to im Mr STANTON 1
 should like very much to
 mortal honor Nero had a
 friend who placed have about
 five minutes to reply to
 my colleague immortelles upon his
 tomb and the worst fiends
 of the French revolution had
 their defenders after death but
 were this old man now
 dead and thus powerless in
 his party at home even
 my colleague would shrink from
 Ille task of embulming his
 bad rncrnory it will after
 leath only be remembered to
 be execrated His late letters
 to rny colleague Mr CORWIN
 and his compatriot Mr Ewing
 show that age which so
 often reclaims the most reprobate
 soul has not withered nor
 custom which so often tires
 of its baleful work has
 not staled I hc infinite
 varicty of his malice and
 his l nadncss istory in
 its record of this great
 anti slavery sedition and its
 consequent revolution will only picture
 the whiteness of his hair
 to con trast it Wilh

 which for years arid years
 has pursued crusade whose tcrril

 without the gentleman said in
 his speech a while ago
 that I class arc very
 brave in time of peace
 slightest chance of trial without
 a hearing before would be
 for the Union provided the
 Republican narue those who belong
 to this class Then there
 is another class composed of
 those who have a any
 court or any officer known
 to the law to be

 I do not know an
 outrage upon civilization I hold
 that doctrine leaven of patrioticfeelil

 class to day and hold

 those of my colleague party

 Every member of the and

 fugitive slave law we did
 not recognize the right of
 each man upon his own
 responsibility to nul lify and
 resist its execution or to
 question its con stitutionality We
 understand perfect well that that
 question is to be tested
 by the judicial tribu nals
 and I hold it to
 be the duty of every
 good citizen to acquiesce in
 the judgment of such tribu
 nal whatever it may be
 until it shall be reversed
 by a higher tribunal That
 is the position of the
 Republican party of Ohio But
 sir am told that I
 voted for a judge who
 held this fUgitive slave law
 to be unconstitutional I certainly
 did so vote and I
 certainly shall always vote for
 a judge with strict reference
 to his integ rity and
 his capacity wi thoutconsidering thc
 quos tion as to whether
 I concur with him upon
 every decision be makes upon
 the bench or not i
 will not take special demurrers

 with him when he claims
 that such independence should be
 sustained when it becomes nullification
 it may become those who
 think like myself but it
 does not become gentlemen who
 voted for this judge to
 find fault with southern men
 because they have nullified the
 Federal authority when by the
 confession of my colleague before

 and two hundred and twelve
 thousand other Ohio Republicans voted
 for a chief justice of

 being made whether or not
 the Constitution of the country
 should stand He voted by
 his own confession for a

 decided that the decision of

 Mr GREEN 1 object to
 the reading Mr BIGLER It
 is signed by a great
 many people The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Chair will submit the
 question to the Senate whether
 the paper shall be read
 Mr GREEN I object to
 the reading because it is
 not accOrding to the rule
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on reading the memorial
 Mr CRITTENDEN Is there any
 rule of the Senate against
 the reading of a petition
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The rule
 re quires that if the
 reading of a paper is
 objected to the Chair shall
 submit the question to thc
 Senate and the rnaiority shall
 determine Mr CRITTENDEN Is that
 applicable to petitions which are
 regulated by the Constitution of
 the United States in declaring
 that the right of petition
 shall not be abrid What
 is the right of petition
 Not to have their petition
 heard I respectfully sueo est
 that the Constitution of the
 United States makes a rule
 on this subject and that
 neither the Senate nor anybody
 else can vio late it
 but submit to the Chair
 whether it is not a
 const itutional right of the
 people to have their petition
 read I do not wish
 to oc cupy the time
 of the Senate l he
 PRESIDING OF FICER The Chair
 vv iil state the question
 and then the Senator can
 appeal if he thinks proper
 Ilhe uniform prac tice of
 the Senate is where the
 reading of a paper is
 objected to that the Chair
 Shail subrn_lt the question to
 thc Senate The Chair understands
 the Senator from Kentucky as
 objecting to his decision in
 this case Mr GREE N
 T herc is no appcal
 from the decision oc the
 Chair The PRESIDING OFFICER But
 the vote is not yct
 decided Mr GREEN 1 understand
 that Mr BIG TJER I
 desiro to say one word
 Mr GREEN 1 have the
 floor 1 desire to say
 my word first The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Missouri
 is entitled to the floor
 Mr GREEN The rule to
 which t11C Chair alludes is
 with reference to a collateral
 paper rc ferr ing to
 business pending before the Senate
 r his is a memorial
 or petition and the r
 a lc ex pressly says
 its purport shall be stated
 by thc member who presents
 it and that is the
 end of it It is
 not in order to read
 it hit of court esy
 to States when State Legislatures
 pass resolutions they are read
 and printed but any others
 arc never read When business
 is pending and the reading
 is called for of a
 papcr relatin to busi ness
 pending before the Senate and
 that paper is in the
 possession of the Senate then
 the Chair would be right
 but not in this case
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The decision
 of the Chair is in
 conformity with the established usage
 and practice of the Senate
 for the last sixtv years
 Mr GREEN It is not
 according to the rule nevertheless
 Mr CRITTENDEN The gentleman pro
 nounces very em iy that
 petitions are never read Sir
 it is very idle to
 enter into any con troversy
 of merc asscverations here My
 under standing is that they
 are often read For con
 venience it is commonly the
 casc that the person presenting
 thém does not desire it
 and it is more frequently
 the case therefore that they
 are not read But it
 is not a rule of
 the Senate that they shall
 not be read far from
 it The gentleman misapprehends entirely
 the rule which he reads
 The mover of a petition
 is required to state the
 purport of it and the
 petition must be in respect
 ful language in ordcr that
 the Senate may have a
 general understanding of it and
 that shall be done says
 the rule That is preliminary
 to the present ation of
 the petition but he whö
 supposes that that was intended
 as a substitute for the
 reading of the petition entirely
 misapprehends the rule You want
 to know beforehand what is
 the subject upon which persons
 are petitioning it may be
 one with which we have
 nothing to do and hence
 a statement is required Mr
 GREEN to a point of
 order There is no appeal
 taken I do not appeal
 the Senator from Kentucky aorecs
 with the Chair therefore there
 is nothing open to debate
 Mr CRITTENDEN 1 am entitled
 to the The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Senator from Kentucky has
 the floor Mr GREEN 1

 open to debate There is
 no appeal pending Mr CRITTENDEN

 will read the rule if
 the Sénator from Kentucky will
 allow it under which the
 Chair has acted The Secretary

 reading a paper is called
 for and the smne is
 objected to by any Incn

 by a vote of the

 by over six hundred miles
 of descrt and wilderness inhabited
 only by unfriendly Indians that
 it is impossible to enforce
 the laws of Utah on
 aecouut of the distance and
 country through which prisoners rnust
 be transported to the penitentiary
 and because of the un
 friendly legislation of the Mormon
 people who are enemies I
 to our prosperity and also
 because they deny us a
 just rep resentation and refuse
 to give us any voice
 in making the laws that

 officers of the law and
 your petitioners we are and
 must be until Congress shall
 grant relief in a deplora
 ble state of anarchy that
 our present population is not
 less than fifteen thousand although
 the census returns do not
 show that number from the
 fact that a large portion
 of our citizens were absent
 at the time tbc census
 was taken on account of
 the Indian war which existed
 in the early part of
 the stumncr and besides the
 emigcntion durin the last four
 months has nearly doubled the

 Mr BAYARD The Committee on
 the Judi ciary to whom
 was recommitted the bill H
 R No 554 to extend
 the right of appeal from
 decis ions of circuit courts
 to Supreme Court of the
 United States have instructed me
 to report it back with
 an alteration of the amendments
 adopted by the Senate which
 arc the same in substance
 but render the languaoe more
 precise I ask for the
 present consideration of it because
 it is a bill that
 affects the right ofa great
 rnany individuals and it witl
 not take tx vo minutes
 to pass it It is
 only an alteration of the
 phraseology as regards theamend ments
 which tho Senate have aheady
 adopted in substanc i If
 the Senate take it up
 I move to i reconsidVr
 the second and third amendinents
 in order to put them
 in another form Ehc first
 stands The Senate proceeded to
 consider the bill and the
 vote adopting the second and
 third amend ments was reconsidered
 Mr BAYARD I rnove the
 adoption of the amendments now
 reported The Secretary read the
 amendments r I he second
 was after the word writings
 in the tenth line to
 insert the words or to
 inventors the exclusive right to
 their in ventions or discoveries
 so that the clause will
 read I hat from all
 judgments and decrees of any
 circuit court rcndered in any
 action suit controversy or case
 at law or in equity
 arising under any law of
 the United States grant ing
 or confirming to authors the
 exclusive right to their re
 spective writings or to inventors
 the exclusive right to their
 inventions or discoverics The amendment
 was agreed to The next
 amendment was after the word
 lie in the twelfth line
 to insert the words at
 the instance of either party
 so that the clause wilt
 read A writ of error
 or appeal as the case
 may requite shall lie at
 the instance of either party
 The amendment was agreed to
 The next amendrnent was to
 strike out all after the
 word courts in thc fifteenth
 line and insert without regard
 to the sum or value
 in contro versy in the
 action so as to read
 In the same manner and
 under the sarne circumstances as
 is now provided by law
 in other judginents and decrees
 of such circuit courts without
 regard to the stun or
 value in controversy in the
 action The amendment was agreed
 to Mr BAYARD These are
 atl theamendments I will state
 that the only effect of
 the bill as n ow
 amended is to place applications
 apisin5 under the laws of
 copyright and the laws in
 reference to patents on the
 same footing in regard to
 the right of appeal and
 it gives no further right
 than this that it dispenses
 with the limitation of the
 amount or sum in controversy
 as regards the appeal to
 the Supreme Court That is
 the extent of it The
 bill was passed CASÉ Mr
 GREEN I offer the following
 resolution and ask for its
 present consideration I hope ghere
 will be no objection to
 it Resolved That the President
 of the United States be
 re quested if not incompatible
 with the public interest to
 communicate to the Senate a
 eopy of any correspondence which
 may have taken place between
 this Govehxnerit and that of
 her Britannie Majesty and of
 any dispatches which may have
 been received froni the United
 States Minister at London relative
 to the_extradition of one Anderson
 a man of color charged
 with the commission of the
 Crime Of mur der in
 the State of Missouri Mr
 SUMNER Let it lie over
 Mr GREEN 1 shall call
 it up at the earliest
 day possible and see who
 will then object Mr SUMNER
 subsequently withdrew his objection and
 the resolution was agreed to
 INDIANA AND ILLINOIS TWO PER
 CENT FUND Mr FITCH There
 is a bill on the
 Vice ident s desk from
 the House of Representatives No
 103 which I desire to
 call up with a view
 of having it referred with
 instructions It is a matter
 of some importance both to
 the Government and the State
 of Indiana There being no
 objection the bill H R
 tNo 103 authorizmg the payment
 of the two per cent
 Ian fund to which the
 States of Illinois and In
 diana are entitled br road
 purposes to said States was
 read the first and second
 times by its title Mr
 FITCH 1 desire to a
 brief ment of the reasons
 for the instructions which I
 shall presently move Ilhe two
 per cent fund due the
 State of Indiana has it
 appears been applied usually by
 the United States Government to
 the payment of interest on
 certain Indiana bonds which the
 Government holds in trust for
 Indians interest otherwise unpaid by
 the State A mis und_erstanding
 appears to exist between the
 State and the General Government
 in relation to the liability
 of the former on these
 bonds Some two or three
 years since the Department of
 the Interior called my attention
 to the condition in which
 these bonds then were and
 subsequently have been The State
 has neglected or refused to
 pay the in terest The
 Secretary of the Interior inclosed
 to me one of the
 bonds as a specimen of
 its class desirino me to
 open a correspondence with our
 State authorities on the subject
 of the why and wherefore
 of the non payment of
 the interest I inclosed either
 the bond or description of
 it the length of time
 which has intervened prevents me
 from now recollecting which to
 the Governor of Indiana asking
 the information desired by the
 I epartment The answer was
 as I had antici pated
 that the bonds were of
 a class which the State
 supposed it had retired by
 what is known in Indiana
 as the Butler bill a
 bill by which the State
 proposed to surrender the YVabash
 and Erie canal to the
 holders of these bohds that
 due notice having been given
 to the holders to come
 forward and surrender the bonds
 and take certificates of stock
 in the canal in part
 payment and Other bonds for
 the remainder and the United
 States had neglected to do
 this had no claim I
 de sire to move a
 reference of this bill to
 the Commit tee on the
 Judiciary with the instructions which
 If the State is liable
 send to the Clerk s
 desk I have no idea
 that it desires to repudiate
 that liability if it is
 not liable the want of
 liability should be acknowledged and
 the bonds surren dered The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The hour for
 the special order has arrived
 Mr FITCH i ask for
 a moment s suspen Sion
 of the special order that
 this bill may be referred
 with instructions The PRESIDING OFFICER
 By unanimous consent the special
 order will be passed over
 for the time being The
 Chair hears no objection The
 instructions proposed by the Senator
 from Indiana will bc read
 The Secretary read as follow

 the Interior Deoaz tmei lt
 in trust för certain Indians
 and if respousible to sn
 ainend the bill as to
 direct the Secretary of the
 interior to arrange with the
 State a settlement of tbe
 said bonds Mr FITCH Doubtless
 this arrangement would have been
 made at the time of
 the transfer of the canal
 but for the fact that
 no officer of the 842
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 11
 Government was authorized by Congress
 to make the arrangement and
 now the question is whether
 under the circumstances the State
 is liable or not desire
 a report upon thab question
 from the Ju diciary Committee
 Mr TRUMBULL rose Mr FITCH
 The Senator from Illinois will
 perceive that it does not
 affect the two per centum
 due his State one way
 or the other Mr TRUMBULL
 1 hope the Senator from
 Indiana will not persist in
 having that matter set tled
 upon this bill I am
 aware that it does not
 affect the two per cent
 fund so far as it
 applies to Illinois but it
 brings up a controversy about
 a disputed point that really
 ought not to be at
 lachcd to thiS bill I
 have no objection to a
 res Oh ition going to
 the Judiciary Committee instruct ing
 them to inquire and give
 their opinion as to the
 r liability of Indiana on
 the bonds which the gentleman
 has indicated but his present
 motion will evidently delay this
 bill and probably at H
 R No 864 making appropriations
 for thb consular and diplomatic
 expenses of the Govern ment
 for the year ending June
 30 1862 and had agreed
 to the seventh amendment of
 the Senate to the said
 bill with an amendment in
 which the concurrence of the
 Senate was requested ORDER OF
 BUSINESS The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 hour for the special order
 has arrived and it must
 be taken up unless the
 Senate direcp otherwise Mr PEARCE
 I ask the Senate to
 take up the special order
 Mr WILSON What is the
 special order The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The special order is the
 message of the President communi
 cating to the Senate a
 series of resolut ionsadopted by
 the Legislature of Virginia which
 was ap pointed for one
 o clock to day but
 the unfinished business of Saturday
 last takes precedence which is
 the bill H R No
 914 making appropria tions for
 the naval service for the
 year ending the this stage
 of the session will be
 the means of its 30th
 of June 1862 defeat If
 thc Senator will put in
 his instructions Mr YViLSON on
 the question of the mes
 as a resolution to the
 committee instead of tying sage
 I had the floor for
 one o clock to day
 but up this bill with
 it I shall have no
 sort of objec I fiave
 been urged to yield that
 point for the pur tion
 but the effect will be
 I very much appre i
 pose of allowing the appronriat
 ion bills and the hend
 to dcåay the bill in
 getting this investiga tariff bill
 to be considered These are
 important tion that we shall
 have no action upon it
 at and I suppose the
 country will survive a few
 days this session Mr FITCH
 The Senator will see if
 He reads the bill that
 any instruction of this kind
 to the Judiciary Committee will
 not prevent thc payment of
 this money on the part
 of the General Govern ment
 to the State of Illinois
 The directions of the I
 bill are imperative to pay
 the money over to the
 I States andof course the
 controversy that has been roilP
 on for years between the
 Indiana State au thorilies tic
 United Stat cs will be
 terminated somewhat summarily and perhaps
 t the preju dice of
 the latter as its authorities
 if t hcy respect the
 law will be compelled to
 pay the Inouey over to
 Indiana whether the State be
 liable in the bonds or
 not and without any locision
 of that question desire that
 question to be settled If
 Indiana IS liable on the
 bonds let us know it
 and if lia ble pay
 over this two per cont
 without further controversy The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question is on
 the motion of the Senator
 from Indiana to refer this
 bill to the Comunit tce
 on the Judiciary with the
 instructirn is proposed by him
 The motion was to Mr
 FITCH subsequently said unan imous
 consent to so amend my
 instructions as to permit the
 Judiciary Committee to either amend
 this bill or to report
 a new one requiring the
 Sec retary Of the Interior

 ALDRICH of Niinncsota manaffers at
 the same on the part
 of the House NAVAL APPROPRIATION
 BILL committee was to strike
 outfrom lines seventy five to
 seventy eight inclusive in the
 following words For the purchase
 of the right to use
 in the United States Navy
 on steamships and propellers a
 governor to a marine stea
 n engino provided the Sécretaryot
 the Navy may deem it
 expedient 25 000 And to
 insert in lieu thereof For
 the purchase of the right
 to use in the United
 States Navy on steamships and
 propellers in navy yards or
 oth erwise whenever the Government
 of the United States rnay
 choose to use the sazne
 Sargeant s steam engine gov
 ernor 15 000 Protided The
 Secretary of the Navy shall
 consider it expedient Mr HALE
 Before the vote is taken
 on that amendment I desire
 to say that the subject
 was considered in the Committee
 on Naval Affairs and they
 recommend the Senate to make
 the ap propriation 10 000
 instead of 15 000 I
 move to amend the amend
 unentby striking out 15 000
 and insertino 10 000 Mr
 PEARCE no objection to that
 It is a matter of
 opinion as to what it
 is worth The Committee on
 Finance have reduced the amount
 from 25 000 to 15
 000 and if the Com
 mittec Oh Naval Affairs recommend
 a reduction of that to
 have no objection Mr FESSENDEN
 1 should like to inquire
 of the Senator from New
 Hampshire whether the Committee on
 Naval Affairs have irwestigated the
 subject and satisfied themselves that
 that sum would be sumcient
 If so of course wo
 shall be glad to havb
 it stricken down Mr HALE
 I wish to say that
 this Inatter was considered in
 the Committee on Naval Af
 fairs and it was with
 very great reluctance that the
 committee agreed to the amendment
 at all because it was
 thought to be a departure
 from the common principle that
 has been adopted against inserting
 anybody s name in a
 proposition But they concluded to
 leave Mr Sargeant s name
 in upon the ground that
 he was a meritorious young
 man and had devoted a
 good deal of time to
 this invention and was more
 solicitous for its adop lion
 in thc Navy than tbe
 sum he should receive The
 committeewcreperfectly satisfied that 10 000
 would be urn ply sufficient
 Mr GRIMES several of these
 governors So fiu as the
 experiments have gone this governor
 of N lr Sargcant s
 is the best prob ably
 for sea croincr vessels But
 it has only been tried
 upon one vesscl belonging to
 the United Stntes and there
 is no evidence that it
 has been tried upon any
 other vessel than upon the
 Pow hatta n It may
 be that in a heavy
 sea wave it may not
 perform as well upon other
 vessels as it did upon
 that But the committee thought
 I vlr Sargcant could afford
 to take 10 000 for
 the ex periment of the
 invention he has made and
 it was possiblc that by
 another year another governor would
 come up that would be
 still more valuable thought at
 any rate that the experiments
 had not gone ftctr enough
 thus far to justify us
 in paying exorbitant sum for
 it for it has been
 only upon one vessel It
 is true it has been
 tried at the nnvv yard
 on a stationary encrine but
 it worked no better than
 Silver s governor II has
 been asccrtaincd however by the
 trial on the Powhattan that
 at sea it worked better
 than Sil ver s any
 of these other governors That
 is the reason that induced
 the Committee on Naval Affairs
 tn agree to this proposition
 L lr PEARCE This appropriation
 was in serted by the
 I louse of Representatives The
 Senatc Committee on Finance have
 amended it by making the
 phraseology better so that the
 Government will have the riffht
 to use this gov ernor
 not only on steam vessels
 belonging to the Navy but
 also on steam engines in
 navy yards and wheresoever the
 United States may have oc
 casioo to use it so
 that it covers a larger
 right than was ori2inally provided
 fop by the bill as
 it came from the House
 A reduction in the amount
 we thoueht was necessary for
 the amount in the bill
 origiualiy was entirely too larffe
 but we were satisfied from
 our observation that this governor
 was a very important improvement
 in addition to the steam
 er ffine I exarniued it
 for myself 1 saw the
 construction of it It is
 exceedingly silnple and the operation
 of it instantaneous The The
 Senate as in Committee of
 the Whole object of it
 is to keep the motion
 of the engine rpsumed the
 considcration of the bill H
 R No eqlnable in a
 heavy sea wave and that
 it does 914 Inakinsr appropriations
 for the naval service without
 any nossibi ity apparently of
 its getting for t hc
 year ending the 301h of
 June 1862 which out of
 order failing to perforrn the
 service had been repeorted from
 the on Finance The Secretary
 of the Navy referred to
 a Navy i he first
 zunendlnelkt of the Wilh anmcndmc
 nt board in December 1858
 the exannination It 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 843 three of
 these governors which had been
 urged upon the Department They
 made their reports and I
 find in the report made
 by Chief Engineers Hunt Whipple
 and Stewart that it was
 tried on board the Pocahontas
 and operated with great precision
 and relieved it from all
 danger of what is called
 racing By that engines are
 frequently broken and then the
 vessel is left at the
 mercy of the vv aves
 The operation of it is
 so simple and so instantaneous
 that it seems as if
 it answered the whole purpose
 desired and they state An
 engine supplied with Mr Sargeant
 s governor can be easily
 and quickly regulated to any
 desired speed by simply opening
 or shutting a small valve
 which admits steam to the
 oscillating cylinder For an engine
 of one thousand horse power
 a valve not over three
 quarters of an inch or
 one inch in diameter would
 be sufficient and can be
 opened or shut with the
 thumb and finger as easily
 as Indeed so sensitive is
 the instru shutting off a
 gas light mcnt that the
 rnain engine can be stopped
 instantly by clos ing this
 small valve Besides trying it
 on the Pocahontas the re
 port states It was tried
 on the saw mill engine
 where we had the chance
 of suddenly throwing on and
 off the load of two
 saw gates and so quick
 was the governor in its
 operation that ihcrc was no
 perceptible chock or increase in
 the speed of the engine
 which is a condition we
 have never been able to
 obtain flom the best ball
 governor ever used in this
 They give their opinion that
 it is the best of
 all that has been submitted
 to encrincers for examina tion
 We thought under these circumstances
 it xvvas well enough to
 make the appropriat ion There
 are about thirty seven steam
 ewines in the Navy and
 the cost of the part
 of the engines which is
 independent of the boilers is
 nearly two million dollars All
 this may be saved in
 a heavy sea wave by
 this governor for which they
 ask but the very small
 appropriation often or fifteen thou
 sand dollars The comrnittee are
 somewhat shy ment will be
 so modified unless objected to
 The Chair hears no objection
 The question is on the
 amendment as modified The amendment
 as modified was agreed to
 Mr THOMSON 1 have some
 amendments which I have been
 instructed to offex by the
 Com mittee on Naval Affairs
 The first is to insert
 I after line seventy eight
 For the purchase of the
 right to use in the
 Navy if in the opinion
 of the Secretary ofthe Navy
 it shall be deerned expedient
 Davidson s boat foweriog attaching
 and de taching apparatus a
 sum not exceeding 15 000
 This is an apparatus invented
 bv Lieutenant Hunter Davidson of
 the United Staies Navy for
 the purpose of lowering detaching
 and attaching ships boats at
 sea It appears from the
 report which was made in
 the House of Representatives and
 from the papers which are
 before me that the Secretary
 of the Navy directed the
 trial to be made at
 sea by vessels of theefiiciency
 of this ap I find
 here a report made by
 the Com paratus mander of
 the United States practice ship
 Preble in which hc says
 I he cry of man
 ovcrboard P was oncc given
 when the ship was going
 at the rate of eight
 knots tl e life buoy

 with which these operations have

 greatly indebted to the admirable

 of the same kind from
 George S Blake superintendent of

 The quest ion is on
 the amendment offered hy the
 Senator from New Hampshire to
 the amendment of the Committee
 on Finance The amendment to
 the amendment was agreed to
 and the amendment as amended
 was adopted The next amendment
 of the Committee on Fi
 nance was to insert after
 the appropriation for repairs in
 the Washington navy yard the
 fol lowing For wall on
 wost side of yard five
 hundred and forty feet long
 13 488 Mr PEARCE will
 merely state that we have
 reduced almost all the appropriations
 for navy yards very largely
 This was omitted in the
 House but upon examination of
 the supple men tal estimates
 ofthc Bureau of Yards and
 Docks we find that there
 is a portion of the
 navy yard at this city
 which is not properly inclosed
 which is merely inclosed by
 a fence and that very
 many depredations are committed on
 the property of the United
 States in the yard in
 conscqucnce of its exposed condition
 TV e thought it therefore
 ad visable to add this
 small appropriation which will complete
 the wall and be a
 defense against these inroads The
 amendment was agreed to The
 next amendment of the Committee
 on Fi nance was to
 add at the end of
 the first section the following
 For reducing and preparing for
 printincr and engraving Cut away
 tlic life buov sea rough
 l etached boat in 25
 Boat along side buoy in

 and hoisted up in 61
 Filled away and sail set
 in 7 20 Ali from
 the instant of the first
 alarm E SIMPSON Pirst Lieutenant
 and Ecccuti ve Odicer I
 think Mr President it is
 manifest from what I havc
 read that this is an
 invention of very great importance
 indeed on board our ships
 of war and on board
 our mercantile rnarine By it
 undoubt edly Inany valuable lives
 will be saved It is
 marvel that when a ship
 is going nt the rate
 of eicrht knots an hour
 ill seven minutes and twenty
 alarrn beino I seconds frotn
 the moment of an given
 the boat can be lowered
 down to pick up a
 man who is overboard and
 he be brought back and
 thc vessel under way again
 Mr FESSENDEN I think from
 the state d ment that
 this is a very valuable
 Inattcr but I should like
 to make an inquiry in
 regard to the Is it
 not rather large price Mr
 THOMSON I will say in
 rcsponsc to the SermLor frcnn
 Maine that it vv as
 at first esti mated at
 double the price but in
 the report which was made
 in the House of Represcntatives
 a very elaborate one they
 conclußed to fix the price
 at 15 000 Mr HALE
 It is left discretionary with
 the Secretary In regard to
 thi I wil l state
 thot before the in vention
 of Lieutenant Brooke we had
 no means of ascertaining with
 any kind of accuracy the
 deep sea soundings of the
 ocean By it the bot
 tom of the ocean has
 been complétely mapped out and
 we have saved for our
 mercantile marine by Lieutenant Brooke
 s apparatus and by his
 ob servations in detecting and
 exposing a great many errors
 on charts from supposed shoals
 and banks which interfered very
 n wch indeed with the
 nav igation of our vessels
 It has also been a
 mutter of very just pride
 to the country It has
 been adopted with very slight
 changes by all the Eu
 ropean Governments and in a
 report which I have in
 my hand now made on
 the deep sea soundings of
 the North Atlantic ocean between
 Ireland and Newfoundland by her
 Majesty s ship Cyclops Lieu
 tenant Commander Joseph Daymao he
 says In the choice of
 the means and appliances for
 obtaining the deep soundings I
 wras left in a great
 measure free by the hydrographer
 and r claim no originality
 in the process adopted the
 detached sounding apparatus whiC11 was
 used being a modification of
 that invented by Mr Brooke
 ag oflicer in the United
 States Navy I will take
 occasion also to say that
 the Gov ernment havc had
 the use of this for
 a number of years without
 paying anything whatevOr to Lieu
 tenantBrooke for it and when
 Lieutenant Brooke returned after a
 very long cruise and made
 appli cation at the Patent
 Office for a patent he
 was informed by the Commissioner
 that having given the use
 of It to others he
 was no longer entitled to
 a pa tent We have
 used his invention without compensation
 and prevented him from getting
 a It is simply proposed
 to give him 5 000
 patent r I hc amendment
 was agreed to Mr THOMSON
 1 have another amendment which
 wilk come in immediately after
 the amend ment which has
 just been adopted It is

 there was a deficiency in

 there will be any objeétion
 to that No objection The

 In reference to this amendment

 for the use the Navy
 of particular bran ls of

 these provisions were repealed by

 is reconnncnded that the repeal
 be repealed so as to

 itnpracticabie to provide fbr the
 Navy buttcr cheese and flour
 which ill bear exposure to

 also should be pennttt ed
 to have his fitvorite tobacco
 prepared specially tor his use
 Mr HALE The Secretary of
 the Navy has found that
 in regard to several of
 these articles supplied to the
 sailors of which he speaks
 it is utterly im no
 gsil le to procure the
 m by advertise ment A
 certain species of butter they
 must have in order to
 stand hot climates and so
 of flour and so of
 tobacco This provision is found
 to be inconvenient and inhumane
 to the sailors and the
 Secretary asks us to repeal
 the law that prevents him
 from buying these patented articles
 and also which Compels him
 to advertise for everything he
 wants to buy There are
 certain articles which he should
 be at liberty to buy
 without advertise ment which discretion
 is taken away by this
 act We propose now merely
 to repeal it Mr PEARCE
 It seems to me that
 probably it would be advisable
 to modify the law of
 the last session by allowing
 the Secretaries of the War
 and Navy Departments to purchase
 many of the articles which
 have been mentioned in the
 paper that has been read
 at the Secretary s table
 but I should like to
 sec the provision so far
 as it re gards the
 purchase of patented arms retained
 in the law I do
 not see that anything can
 be lost to the Government
 by compelling the heade of
 these Departments to come to
 Congress for au thority to
 purchase patented fire arms I
 believe that therc has been
 considerable abuse in that way
 Large contracts have been made
 for patented arms There are
 half a dozen different arms
 contesting for superiority anda Secretary
 may decide from favoritism to
 take one hundred or one
 hundred and fifty thousand dollars
 worth of arms in that
 particular way I should like
 to see him restrained In
 that particular and to require
 the assent of Congress to
 be given to every purchase
 of that In regard to
 other matters steam engines sort
 governors and provisions I admit
 that it is proper for
 the Secretary to purchase them
 without the restriction of this
 law and if this amendment
 can be modified so as
 to retain the provision prevent
 ing the purchase of patented
 arms without the consent of
 Congress I shduld consent to
 the rest but if not
 I shall vote against it
 Mr FESSENDEN Whynotmoveanamend ment to

 the same are hereby repealed
 I will make a short
 statement in regard to this
 amendment T herc have been
 various applica tions made to
 Congress fbr alterations of this
 pay At the last session
 of Congress the Naval Cono
 mittee thought that they had
 not time and were not
 competent to the examination but
 they had a resolution passed
 in the Senate on the
 16th Of June 1860 asking
 information of the Department upon
 those matters and the proposition
 that I have made is
 submitted agreeably to the schedule
 that is submitted by the
 Department It is not an
 increase of pay in the
 aggregate it is a de
 crease but it tends to
 equalize them TINhe pay as
 it now is is exceedingly
 unequal as I will show
 from the statement which is
 prepared For in stance the
 clerk of the yard in
 most of the yards receives
 1 200 In Philadelphia and
 Kittery Maine he receives 900
 In the city of Wash
 ington he receives than is
 paid in New York and
 Massachusetts At Mare Island California
 the clerk of the yard
 receives 3 000 while the
 clerk to the naval storekeeper
 receives only 900 This amendment
 has been prepared in accordance
 with the document that has
 been sent to us by
 the Departrnent in answer to
 a res olution of the
 Senate equalizes the pay and
 reduces the amount instead of
 increasinp it Mr HUNTER Does
 the Senator mean it reduces
 the entire amount or only
 the amount of some of
 the salaries Mr HALE It
 reduces the entire amount Mr
 HUNTER Does it reduce the
 entire amount of appropriation for
 salaries Mr HALE Yes sir
 the aggregate amount appropriated is
 decreased not largely I think
 between three and four thousand
 dollars but it equalizes them
 Mr GRIMES 1 have a
 proposition which 1 desire to
 offer as a substitute for
 that submitted by the Senator
 from New Hampshire That the
 pay of first clerks to
 connnandants at all the navy
 yards shall be at the
 rate of 1 200 per
 annum ex cept that at
 the California navy yard which
 shall be at the rate
 500 per annum and that
 the laws approved the 22d
 of April 1854 the 4th
 of August 1854 the 3d
 of March 1855 and the
 12th of June 1858 increasing
 the pay of clerks and
 others twenty per cent at
 the Washington navy yard be
 and the same are hereby
 repealed Mr President this proposition
 which I submit equalizes the
 pay of the clerks at
 all these navy yards and
 does not like the proposition
 of the Senator from New
 I ltunpshirc increase the pay
 in some cases to paymaster
 s and purser s clerks
 a_nd thereby by this nmendrnent
 which I now offer thcrc
 would be a much greater
 aggregate deduction it the expenses
 growmg out of the pay
 of these officers than there
 would bc by the amend
 ment offered by him The
 proposition submitted by the Senator
 from New Hampshire is open
 to precisely the same objection
 that he has assigned as
 existing against the law as
 it now stands or the
 same inequality between the paymasters
 clerks would exist if his
 amendment was adopted that now
 exists in the pay of
 tho commandants clerks If his
 amendment is adopted some of
 the paymasters clerks would receive
 750 and others would receive
 1 080 If my amendment
 to the an xendment be
 adopted it would stand that
 the paymasters clerks would remain
 at 750 and some ofthe
 com mandants clerks would be
 brouoht up to 1 200
 and others brought down to
 1 200 making then all
 equal and would save several
 thousand dollars to the Treasury
 r i hc amendment to
 tbc amendment was agreed to
 and the amendment as amended
 was adopted The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Chair is informed that
 the amendment that was withdrawn
 is now ready and will
 be read as modified T
 hc Secretary read it as
 follows and be it further
 enacted That the third section
 of an act entitled An
 act making appropriations for the
 legislative executive and judicial exponscs
 o the Governfllent for the
 year endizig 3 th of
 tine 1861 anrl approved June
 23 1860 be and the
 same is hereby repealed e
 s ept so far as
 the said section prohibits the
 purchase of patented fire arms
 as to which the said
 section shall still be in
 force Mr HALE As that
 amendment does not come in
 conflict with the recommendations of
 the Secre tar y of
 the Navy as they are
 stated in this letter I
 do not know that I
 shall oppose that exception I
 accept the amendment The amendment
 was agreed to Mr HALE
 Ts the amendment adopted as
 amended The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 ment was modified and in
 that form adopted Mr HALE
 I am instructed by the
 Committee on Naval Afiäirs to
 oflör another amendment to insert
 as an additional section and
 be it further enacted That
 the Secretary of the Navy
 bc and he is hereby
 authorized to cause to be
 con trueted for the United
 States Navy at as early
 a day as practicablc 1861
 having due regard to emciency
 and economy seven steam screw
 sloops of war of the
 second class as vessels are
 rated in the Navy with
 full steam power whose greatest
 draught of water shall not
 exceed foui teen teet which
 sloops shall combine thé heaviest
 armament and greatest speed com
 patibie with their character and
 tonnage and for the pur
 pose above specified the sum
 of 1 200 000 be
 and the same is hereby
 appropriated out of any money
 in the Treas ury not
 otherwise appropriated to be expended
 under the direction of the
 Secretary of the Navy Mr
 HUNTER should like to know
 the amount that is propösed
 to be appropriated and the
 reasons for it and why
 at this time it is
 pro posed to make this
 large addition to the Navy
 I should like to hear
 some explanation from the Senator
 from New Hampshire Mr HALE
 This is a matter that
 has been recommended by the
 Department and urged upon Congress
 for a number of years
 the increase of our stoam
 naval force and my impression
 is I am not entirely
 certain that the Senator from
 Virginia has been one of
 those who voted hitherto to
 sustain that recommendation I will
 not be cer tain upon
 that subject But I apprehend
 sir that the idea of
 another sailing vessel being built
 is an absurdity There never
 will be another The Navy
 henceforth is to be a
 steam Navy The com mittee
 were unanimous in the opinion
 that this addition to the
 Navy was a pertinent and
 proper one at the present
 time and rccommcndcd these sloops
 at once Mr HUNTER 1
 should like to hear the
 amendment read again I was
 out when the Sec retary
 commenced reading it and I
 only heard the conclusion of
 the amendment The Secretary again
 read it Mr HALE As
 our reading clerk is not
 at the desk 1 will
 read myself tl le recommendation
 of the Secretary of the
 Navy on this subject The
 constant appeal of American citizens
 coming to us from all
 quarters of the world asking
 for security and protection beyond
 what the Government with its
 present means can afford them
 speaks a langua ye to
 which we are not at
 liberty to turn a deaf
 ear l o bc able
 at any time at short
 notice to throw a powerful
 naval force upon any given
 point where our interests are
 threatened or the lives of
 American cjtizens are in jeopardy
 is not only a consti
 tutional duty but one of
 the safest most beneficent and
 salucary powers that can he
 intrusted to official hands under
 a rcpublican form of government
 and I cannot permit the
 present occasion to pass without
 Inost earnestly recom mending the
 policy of a gradual substantial
 and perma nent increase of
 the Navy accompanied by the
 universal introduction into it of
 the motive power of steam
 Such policy is essential to
 the protection of our coasts
 and com merce and of
 American citizens and their property
 on the ocean and in
 distant countries to the preservation
 of peace the efficiency of
 negotiation the general advancement of
 our counmercial interests the maintenance
 of our appro priate position
 among nations and the prompt
 vindication of our rights and
 of the honor of the
 country and should be subject
 to none Of the ordinary
 vacillations arising from the varicd
 success of political parties Mr
 HUNTER 1 think the Senator
 from New Hampshire will find
 if he thinks my votes
 a matter worthy of examination
 that I have not voted
 to increase the Navy for
 some years past especially since
 the Treasury has been in
 its pres It seems to
 me it is ent embarrassed
 condition peculiarly inappropriate to select
 the present pe riod for
 such an expenditure as is
 now proposed while it is
 known that the Treasury is
 in such a deeply embarrassed
 condition We cannot get along
 without borrowing money and we
 have not been able to
 borrow at less than ten
 eleven I know not why
 it is that and twelve
 per cent at such a
 time as this they should
 come forsyvat d and demand
 money for these vessels making
 a still further deficiency What
 seems to be a little
 suspicious is that they seem
 to be of that class
 which are designed for the
 southern ports that is the
 ports of those States that
 have seceded and withdrawn from
 this Union It seems to
 me that such a proposition
 at such a time as
 this must have some reference
 to some proposed ne cessity
 of that sort For myself
 I should be un willing
 in the present condition of
 tbe country no matter what
 was the condition of our
 domestic CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 845 recommended
 by the committee last yeav
 if I rec ollect aright
 of which the honorable Senator
 from Florida Mr MALLORY was
 chairman Mr HUNTER They were
 recommended by the Senator from
 Florida at a time when
 his own State had not
 seceded and they were recom
 mended on the ground that
 they were vessels for those
 ports that they were of
 such a draft as to
 get into them It was
 said that the ships which
 had been built with few
 exceptions drew too much water
 to enable them to be
 of any use for the
 protection of those ports That
 was the ground on which
 they were pushed and that
 is the ground on whichthey
 were advocated There is now
 no such necessity there is
 no such demand upon us
 there is no such duty
 required of us and I
 cannot help feeling that there
 is something more meant than
 is expressed on the face
 of the amendment Mr GRIMES
 I vote for this proposition
 as an economical measure myself
 and I think the Senator
 from Virginia will satisfy himself
 if he will look into
 the subject that it is
 an economical measure I apprehena
 in the first place that
 this Government will never build
 another sailing ves I think
 hazard nothing in saying that
 there sel is no Government
 on the face of tho
 earth that is building a
 sailing war vessel at this
 time In 1859 the British
 Govcrnmcnt had only eleven then
 on the stocks and nearly
 two hundred steam vessels and
 they have abandoned theidea of
 building any more sailing vessels
 as I understand This Gov
 ernment has eight screw sloops
 of war such as are
 proposed to be built now
 The whole of them carry
 forty onc guns The Govermnent
 of Great Britain has two
 hundred and seventy four of
 thc same class of vessels
 Mr POLK Will the Senator
 to ask him how much
 the eight we have cost
 Mr GRIMES The precise costl
 do not know but somewhere
 in the neighborhood of 300
 000 each Mr POLK Then
 that proposition only pro poses
 to appropriate 1 200 000
 It is not proposed Mr
 GRIMES Yes sir to appropriate
 the whole amount necessary to
 complete them but only such
 an amount as prob ably
 will bc uscd during the
 current year and at the
 next Congress enough will bc
 appropriated some t iree or
 four hundred thousand dollars to
 complete them We have some
 larger stear n ves sels
 than those that are proposed
 td be built that cost
 three times as much as
 each of these will cost
 Several of them arc now
 on duty one in the
 East Indies two in the
 Mediterranean one in the Gulf
 of Mexico antl one on
 the Pacific It costs this
 Government per year to navigate
 and man those vessels for
 the wear and tear of
 the hull the pay of
 the officers and men and
 for pro visions for twelve
 months The cost ing up
 the navak stablishment Ifi regatd
 to that I have to
 say that I do not
 think there Cin be any
 economy in the pr ent
 condition of the Treas ury
 in voting this amount to
 make additions to the Navy
 There is already a large
 appropria tion in this bill
 for repairs and additions to
 the I believe something million
 more than was appropriated last
 year and it seems to
 me that that ought to
 be suffcient In to the
 relative effcienc y of smallzand
 large steamers that is not
 a matter for me to
 de cide That is a
 professional question I do not
 profess to be able to
 determine between the rela tive
 effciency or the expediency of
 building the one or the
 other I suppose when we
 have money in the Treasury
 when we are enabled to
 go on regularly with keeping
 up the establishment we ought
 to have both large and
 small steamers apprehend they are
 building both in the services
 of England and France 1
 think it is a question
 in regard to which naval
 men aiffer Ate ny rate
 I know it I do
 not pretend to decide upon
 it costs less to man
 and navigate a small steamer
 than a large one but
 what 1 say is in
 the pres ent condition of
 the Treasury when we have
 been so largely adding to
 the debts of the Government
 when we find ourselves unable
 to meet the pres ent
 demands and pay the offcers
 salaries even it will be
 prudent not to add to
 the public expend iture by
 the amount that is here
 proposed I ap prehend that
 we will find it a
 very djmcult matter to meet
 the necessary expenditures of this
 Gov ernment and until we
 have secured the means for
 meeting them ve ought to
 avoid these large ex penditures
 especially those which are not
 imme diately and absolutely necessary
 Surely there is no immediate
 necessity forthese steamers which it
 is now proposed to build
 Mr PEARCE I beiieveit is
 a wise and eco nomical
 policy to build these small
 sloops oflwar They can be
 kept afloat at much less
 expense and they answer all
 the purposes in times of
 peace which large vessels do
 But I doubt Whether this
 is a propitious timc for
 making this appropriation The estimates
 for the naval service of
 this year are considerably over
 twelve million dollars The committees
 of both Houses have reduced
 them but the bill so
 far as it has passed
 appropriates about eleven million five
 hundred thousand dol lars and
 now in the condition of
 the Treasury is itatal possible
 that this other sum of
 1 200 000 now proposed
 to be added to the
 bill can be fur nished
 We have a large debt
 on our hands for the
 present and ensuing fiscal year
 and all the resources of
 the country cannot supply us
 under the prescnt condition of
 things even with the loans
 that we have made the
 amount of money neces sary
 to conduct the public service
 for the next It seems
 to me therefore to be
 un fiscal year of one
 of these small vessels mounting
 four guns ii wise to
 make this appropriation since it
 is impos sible I think
 to have the money to
 apply to this for the
 wear and tear of the
 hull interest on cost payment
 of officers and men and
 provisions for twelve months is
 73 000 The Senator from
 Virginia therefore will see that
 we can man and provision
 and navigate four of these
 vessels where we can man
 and provision and navigate one
 of the larger ones Now
 I ask him if he
 does not look upon this
 as an economical measure TV
 e can withdraw from tho
 Mediterranean two of the steam
 sloops of war that we
 have there and sub stit
 nt e in their place
 two or three of these
 small vessels that will be
 just as offcient to protect
 American commerce as those two
 are and we shall have
 saved several hundred thousand dol
 lars to the Government by
 doing so These are some
 of the reasons which induce
 rne 1 might go on
 and to vote for this
 proposition state others but I
 desire to say to the
 Senator that I do not
 vote for this proposition with
 any view to coerce anybody
 or for the purpose of
 entering the ports of any
 of the southern States except
 for some peaceful pul pose
 certainly not for tiny purpose
 I believe it is essential
 affairs to vote for any
 addition to the Navy call
 ing for such a sum
 of money as that but
 when I for the interests
 of the country without regard
 to I i the present
 uneasy and disturbed conditi0ki of
 the come to connect it
 with recent events and when
 southern States It is for
 the interest of the whole
 I come to look to
 thc class of steamers and
 to the country that we
 should increase the Navy sorne
 limitation in regard to draft
 it strikes me there purpose
 For that reason which I
 considef quite suffcient I shall
 oppose the amendment Undér other
 circumstances I would vote very
 readily for the increase of
 these steam sloops which are
 highly economical but I think
 with the appropriation of 11
 500 000 for the naval
 service already in the bill
 we had better postpone to
 another session I this appropriation
 of 1 200 000 Mr
 GRIMES One single word further
 and I will relieve the
 Senate from any further debate
 I do not propose on
 this subject on my part
 and I presume no sensible
 man in this country proposes
 to take the Brifish or
 French navy as any criterion
 by which to govern ourselves
 ex cept in regard to
 the proportions that may exist
 i between their large and
 small vessels Nobody proposes that
 we shall at ail approximate
 them But it would be
 the number of our vessels
 safe for us at any
 rate in passincr upon a
 ques tion of this kind
 to looka little info the
 condition of the navies of
 other countries and see what
 may be the proportion large
 vesSels bear to small ones
 If any one wili take
 the trouble to do that
 he will see that for
 the last few yearsythe proper
 i tion of srnall vessels
 to large ones has beeh
 mado to exceed greatly that
 which existed up to the
 timo of the Crimean war
 They havé now in the
 must be some such intention
 as that For one I
 what and increase it in
 this particular direction British Navy
 nearly three hundred small vessels
 I and hence I votc
 for it am unwilling to
 vote a dollar to make
 any add tion to the
 Navy which looks to the
 purpose of Mr HUNTER 1
 am very glad to hear
 the like such as we
 are proposing to build and
 the French Government has nearly
 two hundred small Senator from
 Iowa say that in voting
 for these coercing the States
 that are out Mr FESSENDEN
 I should like to suggest
 stearuer s hc does not
 do it with any purpose
 of vessels of this size
 whereas they have only about
 to the Senator from Virginia
 that precisely the I coercion
 in the States have seceded
 and Iam forty five or
 forty six sailing vessels of
 war of same class of
 vessels and the same number
 were glad to put it
 on the question of economy
 in keep about the same
 or sloops of war We
 have com 846 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 11 paratively no
 vessels that are steam vessels
 by the side of other
 nations nor do the steam
 vessels that weown any just
 cqmparison to our sail ing
 vess N A great many
 of our sailing vessels are
 utter y worthless and vvill
 never go to sea again
 and we must supply their
 places with some thing We
 must keep vessels afloat in
 order to show our flag
 in foreign countries and to
 protect our cornmerce in foreion
 seas and the question is
 what kind of Nessels shall
 wc have We cannot be
 influenced in our action here
 and we ought not to
 abandon the Navy because there
 happens to be dissatisfaction growing
 out of the slavery question
 or out of the tariff
 question I think Ne or
 out of any other local
 question ought to go on
 in our legislation exactly as
 though we were at peace
 with ail the world not
 will the view to coerce
 any portion of the country
 but to maintain the honor
 of our flag in foreign
 seas I think any one
 who will examinc the subject
 or any professional naval man
 will see that th is
 wouldäeally be an economical measure
 To take the case I
 have already put in answer
 to the Sen ator from
 Virginia we have in the
 Mediterra nean two sloops of
 war of the first class
 and one gun boat such
 as we propose to build
 Those two sloops of war
 cost us to man and
 equip and provision them for
 twelve months 604 000 Three
 gun boats of the size
 which we propose to build
 with one of these sloops
 would be pre cisely as
 emcient as the two large
 sloops of war are now
 You substitute therefore two gun
 boats in the place of
 one o these sloops and
 you save 302 000 a
 year to your Treasury It
 seems to me this is
 an argument that ought to
 commend uself to the Senator
 from Virginia and to the
 Sen ator from Maryland Mr
 POLK I have no doubt
 myself of the correctness of
 the position taken by the
 Senator from Iowa that the
 proportion of stnall vessels to
 It large ones in the
 Navy ought to be increased
 would be better if we
 had morc small ones and
 fewer largc ones but that
 does not reach the point
 of difhcukty in tny mind
 It is this w hother
 incr the large ones on
 hand we ought to go
 to If it were a
 work now to add the
 small ones question o exchange
 if we could exchange the
 large ones for a greater
 number of small ones I
 should think it good policy
 todo it but the ques
 tion is whether as we
 have not thc small ones
 we ought now in the
 condition of thc r liret
 tsl u y to go
 to work to build Lhen
 t when we have not
 the money to build then
 i Willi There iS one
 thing which strikes mc as
 very singular in connection with
 this arnendmcnt the Senator from
 New I lampshire reads a
 recom mendation from the Secretary
 of the Navy in favor
 of a gradual increase of
 this kind of vessels in
 the If seven at a
 dash at one session naval
 servie c is gradual in

 an Wigfall 18 So the
 amendment was agreed to Mr
 GRIMES am instructed by the
 Com mittee on Naval Affairs
 to propose the following amendment
 as an additional section und
 bc it further enacted That
 the President of the Uni
 tcd States shall by and
 with the advice and consent
 of the Senate appoint from
 the line of the Navy
 on the active list an
 assistant secretary of the navy
 whose salary shall be that
 of the shore duty pay
 o a captain and who
 acting under thc authority and
 directiou of the Secretary of
 the Navy shall bc charged
 with the discipline and efficiency
 of the naval service with
 the detailing of omeers and
 such other duties in rclation
 to the administration of its
 affairs as the Secretary of
 the Navy may designate Mr
 President the design of the
 committee was to create a
 nev r offcer who should
 hold precisely the same relations
 to the Secretary of the
 Navy that the prescnt Assistant
 Secretary of the Treas ury
 and thc Assistant Secretary of
 State hold to the chiefs
 of those two Departments that
 tl fis man should be
 professional man not taken fram
 political life or civil life
 but taken from the line
 ot his profession and thereforc
 supposed to bc familiar with
 the details of that profössion
 The friends of the Navy
 have always deplored the present
 organization and believed that it
 was ne cessary and very
 important to that branch of
 the service that somebody should
 be in confidential relations with
 the head ot the Department
 who knew somewhat more ofthc
 details of the Depart ment
 and of the personnel of
 the service than an ordinary
 Secretary of the Navy usually
 does and hence tn order
 10 obviate that objection which
 has always existed it is
 now proposed that an officer
 of the line shall be
 constituted the Assist ant Secretary
 of the Navy and perform
 the duties that are assigned
 to him in that amendment
 Mr SAULSBURY 1 would like
 to the Senator from Iowa
 a question whether there has
 been any suggestion from the
 Secretary of the Navy or
 the Department that such ari
 office is necessary or whether
 such an officer would be
 proper Mr GRIMES I am
 not aware that any sug
 gcstion has been made rom
 the Secretary of the Navy
 I have had no commullication
 with him and not acquainted
 with him but such a
 sug gestion has been made
 by every Ilian who has
 naval affairs for the last
 been connected with twenty years
 Such u proposition or something
 similar to it was submitted
 by Commodore Stock ton when
 a member of the Senate
 from New Jer sey and
 it has bcel before the
 Senate in various I shapes
 either as Assistant Secretary of
 the Navy or as head
 of bureau of personnel from
 that time I think those
 who are familiar until the
 present with this branch of
 tbc public service are almost
 if not quite unanimous in
 the opinion that such Mr
 POLK T hat would not
 be rapid iC so ven
 provision is essential to the
 good of tho service is
 gradual But it seerns to
 me Mr President I Mr
 FESSENDEN I an very apt
 to agree that any increase
 of any sacli amount as
 this Mr GRIMES I Will
 tell you what would bc
 with no y friend from
 rowa in most of his
 notions at this especially about
 naval matters because I think
 rapid The Frenc ll Go
 vernrnent have his attention bcil
 g drawn to that subject
 he is time ordered nine
 sloops of war ot the
 large class and onc hundred
 small ones all to be
 cased in rnore capable of
 jt ld rino of thc
 propriety of the bat sir
 I iZ iel exceedingly measures
 that I an iron and
 steel and all of which
 arc to be in sail
 ing by the 1st of
 May That would bc a
 averse to this proposition I
 do not know whether anybody
 elsc entertains the sarne opinions
 that I ra increase POLK
 That to be built do
 in relation to it but
 I arn unwilling to see
 I think the everything placed
 under discipline Mr GRIMES Yes
 Sit Mr POLK I hope
 the time will never c
 cnne Inilitary and naval arm
 have got power and influ
 when we shall measure our
 speed with the speed onco
 enor lgh in the Government
 now and that it of
 the French Emperor if he
 goes at that rate is
 hardly worth while to mix
 them up any more If
 we have anything to be
 because it would certainly exhaust
 resources Wilh the civil service
 But the dolle in relation
 to a building anywhere no
 mat of this country in
 less thran one year difficulty
 is we have not got
 the rnoney in the ter
 what it goes under the
 control of an Army of
 ficer The next step will
 be I suppose to put
 Ehe ques Treasury and how
 are we to get it
 an Army officer in as
 Secretary or chief clerk in
 tion now is whether we
 shall commence with an appropriation
 of when it is admitted
 the W tu Department and
 in this mode of pro
 that that will not be
 anything like enough to build
 cecding very soon we shali
 have hardly anybody these vessels
 and that with the Treasury
 empty in office except he
 be either a military or
 a naval man I have
 no belief that we should
 qni t and worse than
 empty It does seem to
 me that the measure is
 very injudicious and inexpedient any
 rnore in the Navy by
 putting the Navy De you
 I part pnent under the
 control of an offcer just
 at this mornont Mr HUNTER
 I call for the yeas
 and nays have the chief
 clerk there if he fills
 this position under the Secretary
 of the Navy everythine that
 on the amendment The yeas
 and nays were ordered and
 being is done with reference
 to the assiffnments of com
 mands c will be understood
 to be by his ad
 taken resulted yeas 30 nays
 18 as follows think tho
 appointment of a naval Qiiicer
 YEAS Messrs Anthony Baker Bigler
 Bingham Cam to this position
 will create difficulties heart burn
 ings jealousies and troubles of
 all sorts in the service
 which you wish to avoid
 I have very great confidence
 in the honor of oflicers
 both of the Army and
 Navy and I have no
 doubt they would discharge the
 duties of the offce that
 is pro posed very well
 to the best of their
 ability but my own belief
 is that you had better
 keep the two branches of
 the service distinct leave the
 De partment itself under the
 control of civilians and let
 the officers in the line
 of the service have noth
 ing more to do with
 it than may arise from
 the fact that their advice
 unquestionably will be asked on
 different occasions by those who
 are at the head of
 the Department My own impression
 is that you will create
 diffculty where none exists now
 and that we ought to
 discourage this continual creeping upon
 us of influence connected with
 the military and naval service
 large enough as it is
 at present and I am
 opposed to its increase Mr
 HALE I think the Senator
 from Maine is unnecessarily jealous
 in regard to this matter
 J sympathize eniirely all that
 he says about devolving everything
 on Army oflicers but it
 is a notorious fact that
 the Secretary of the Navy
 ordinarily speaking is not much
 of a sailor recollect seeirp
 an anecdote a great while
 ago of course that sotne
 Secretary of the Navy visit
 ing some of the navy
 yards inquired very earn est
 y where the oakum grew
 that they were using laughter
 and as long as you
 have such gentle men at
 the head of the Department
 who do not know where
 oakum grows it is well
 enouoh to have a practical
 offcer upon whom they can
 rely and I would rather
 have a responsible naval ofli
 cer than have an irresponsible
 chief clerk There has been
 good deat of faulb found
 with that sort Mnfluence which
 has prevailed on account of
 the duties devolved on the
 chief clerk upon whom the
 Secretary must neceesarily rely unless
 he has between him and
 the Department somebody who is
 intimately acquainted with the service
 This does not increase the
 expense because it requires the
 officer to be taken from
 the line and to receive
 If a captain is taken
 the shore pay of a
 captain therefore there is not
 a single additional dollar of
 expense The Navy stands in
 a different position in this
 respect than the Arny does
 l ecause the Secre tar
 y of War has in
 the adjutant general an offi
 cer that may give him
 all the information requisite in
 regard to everything that relates
 to the admin istration of
 that Department in tho selection
 of I officers and the
 assignment of their duties thc
 Navy there is nothing of
 that sort but the Secretary
 has to rely on the
 chief clerk who has had
 no naval education any more
 than him self and necessarily
 it is lial le to
 great abuse This amendrnent of
 lhc committee proposes to take
 and put in that place
 without any additional cxpcnsc un
 offccr who has been trained
 and ed ucatcd in the
 Navy who knows the character
 of the officers who knows
 the requirements of the service
 and it gives to the
 Secretary of the Navy a
 responsible officer placed there by
 law upon whose judgment and
 skill and acquirements he car
 rely arid I think it
 is not liable to the
 excep tian that the honorable
 Senator from Maine ur res
 arrainst it i CAMERON It
 me Mr Pres ident that
 the argument of the Senator
 frorn New would bc a
 very good one in favor
 of making the Secretary of
 the Navy always a naval
 I can see nothing else
 ill it Now Sir officer
 there are in t he
 Navy Department two or three
 old naval officers old captains
 who are the heads of
 bureaus and to whom the
 Secretary can apply every day
 at any hour or any
 minute for inform ation and
 if he be a man
 of ordinary sense he will
 go there and ask for
 information As to sav ing
 that he may be controlled
 by his clerk that is
 I ali A man of
 sense would select a proper
 clerk and if the clerk
 did not behave properly nd
 do his duty rightly he
 would turn him out and
 I think this is a
 wrong time get somebody else
 to make this sort of
 alteration The country is now
 in trouble do not know
 what is to hap I
 pen I would rather let
 everything be at present until
 we get through all our
 difficulties decidedly opposed to selecting
 ft om the Navy anybody
 who is to be an
 irresponsible head of the Navy
 Department for after all it
 is puuing an irresponsible person
 in this position it is
 making a head of the
 Department without any responsi 1861
 bility It leaves a man
 nominally holding all the responsibility
 before the country and then
 it puts a man in
 the Department who has all
 thc power because he holds
 a commission It is all
 wrong Me BAKER Mr President
 as far as 1 un
 derstand it it appears to
 me that to make an
 As sistant Secretary under the
 amendment is really to put
 a head to the Navy
 proper so far as discip
 line and management are concerned
 and the As sistant Secretary
 being an old captain or
 an old commodore will be
 somewhat in the position to
 the Navy that the commanding
 general is to the Army
 I think that it is
 well A Secretary of the
 Navy does not understand many
 things that a captain or
 a commodore does understand any
 rnore than a Secretary of
 War understands what General Scott
 does understand better than any
 So far as the objections
 yet rnade one e se
 livinc are concerned I am
 inclined to vote for the
 alter not feel any peculiar
 ation of the system jealousy
 of the Navy or e
 Army This amend ment does
 not increase the cost of
 the service as understand It
 makes an officer in some
 sensc at least responsible and
 it relieves the Secretary of
 the Navy from the task
 of determining many things as
 to detail which I know
 he cannot de termine The
 gentleman from Pennsylvania says that
 in these troublous times it
 is not worth while to
 alter the system I do
 not apprehend that the altera
 tion is proposed with reference
 to these times at but
 if there be trouble or
 if there is to be
 all trouble the Navy will
 not be any worse managed
 by having a little more
 experience at its head Besides
 as I understand it the
 Assistant Secre tat y of
 the Navy will have the
 same relations to the head
 of the Navy Department as
 the Assistant Secretary of the
 Treasury has to the I
 lead of the Treasury Department
 or as the Assistant Secre
 tary of State has to
 the head of the State
 Depart I understand it briefly
 to be to give to
 menl the Navy Department something
 like the sym metry there
 is in the Department As
 un fortunately as I think
 there is no head of
 the Navy as there is
 a head o the Army
 no admiral no senior commodore
 through whom all direc tions
 to the Navy go as
 to matters of detail at
 least the Assistant Secretary will
 in some sense supply that
 I should be willing to
 go further and to make
 an acknowledged head of the
 Navy as there is of
 the Army in the person
 of General Scott Mr PEARCE
 Mr President believe that the
 Navy Department is the least
 burdensome and the least diffeult
 of mana rement of any
 of the If the object
 Departments of the Government is
 to havo a gentleman at
 thc head of that Depart
 ment svhose business it shall
 be to enjoy all the
 emoluments to attend Cabinet meetings
 and to dispense the political
 patronage of his Depart ment
 but to transact none of
 the business then of course
 you want an Assistant Secretary
 But it seems to me
 it is only necessary to
 in truth have a man
 of good sense willino to
 labor in his Departinent at
 the head of it to
 secure its proper administraüon He
 has in the Depurtrnei t
 now subordinaæ officers competent to
 afford him in formation upon
 all points in which he
 requires professional advice He has
 an old captain at the
 head of the Bureau of
 Yards and Docks he has
 a captain also at the
 head of the Bureau of
 Hydrog raphy and Ordnance an
 old purser at the head
 of the Bureau of Provisions
 and Clothing and a competent
 person skilled in that busitjess
 at the head of the
 Bureau of Construction and Repairs
 If a Secretary cannot undértake
 to nanage the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 847 It is true the
 War Department confers I by
 it The cÖuntry Ilf the
 superior knowledge years with him
 sometimes but so the Secretary
 of the Navy may confer
 with those officers who hold
 the important bureaus of which
 I speak Nobody has yet
 designated any particular duty in
 precise specific terms which is
 to be performed by this
 Assistant Secretary of the Navy
 The in tention seems to
 me to be to let
 the Secretaryship be a sinecure
 and have some real head
 taken from the line to
 command the Navy I do
 not think this is necessary
 and I do not think
 il is proper I have
 some doubt whether if there
 is to be an Assistant
 Secretary he should be a
 captain in the Navy Unfortunately
 we know that honest as
 these gentlemen are and skillful
 as they are in their
 profession there is a great
 deal of jealousy a great
 deal of cliquism in the
 Navy and I be lieve
 you will contribute to more
 dissensions and quarrels if you
 have a captain of the
 line at the head of
 the Navy Departmentin fact but
 called an Assistant Secretary tl
 an you have now What
 you want is a competent
 man at the head of
 the Department a man of
 vigorous understanding and willingness to
 work and that is all
 Mr CfÜTTENDEN Mr President 1
 have long heard it as
 a subject of complaint that
 some such officer as that
 now proposed to be introduced
 into the naval department was
 not there I differ l
 on thissub ject with greatdiffdence
 from my friend the Senatorfi
 om Maryland Itseemstomestrange that the
 command and manaoement of the
 Navy the decision of questions
 ot discipline of the rela
 lions of onc ofiicer to
 another should be confided to
 u man who knows nothing
 at all about then I
 YVc arc told that he
 has offeers now around him
 of the subject which one
 man Chas gives him a
 natural ascendeney far as that
 aseendency is founded on his
 superior knowledge of course it
 is useful to the country
 and why should we not
 have iL This amendment strikes
 me as remedying a great
 defect which has long existed
 in the Navy and which
 has occasioned an irresponsible and
 unoffcial adviser the premier of
 the naval ser vice or
 if not so has given
 the control to some clerk
 who by force of long
 habit and long in tercourse
 with offcers of the Navy
 and with naval affairs has
 had some little smattering knowledge
 beyond any amount even that
 the Secretary has These have
 been constant complaints ever since
 I have heard of the
 Navy Department The De partment
 now it seems to me
 from all the accounts I
 have had of it requires
 the application ofa little sterner
 government than has heretofore been
 ap plied to it The
 governmept of it is not
 as stern as the commanders
 of your ships would require
 Offcers are not held to
 their proper places and their
 proper dutiesv quarrels have arisen
 These things I have heard
 of and some of them
 have It is not governed
 as it come to my
 knowledge ought to be and
 I hope that a remedy
 will be found for it
 in the appointment of the
 officer now I shall vote
 for the proposition proposed Mr
 FESSENDEN The whole argument Mt
 President proceeds upon the assumption
 that you cannot find man
 who is fit to be
 See I retary of the
 Navy and discharge the duties
 of the office It may
 be that our experience hitherto
 especially in recent times goes
 to confirm that employed in
 his department who are practical
 supposition but my idea is
 that there are men in
 the country who can take
 charge of that De naval
 Inen and that he can
 consult wit h thern l
 his would be an argmnent
 against the employ partment and
 discharge the duties of the
 offce well and faithfully and
 understandingly I should ment of
 assistants in any department of
 the Gov It might be
 said Why have an As
 I not think it was
 a great deal to learn
 what the ernment sistantSecretary ofthe
 Treasury Chere are men naval
 rules and regulations are and
 at any rate I all
 about the street and all
 about the hotels whcr could
 bc easily consulted by the
 Secretary That is not the
 thing The purpose is to
 have a respons I ible
 adviser and one in whose
 capacity to give advice the
 public has confidence It is
 to have not only tho
 ability but to have that
 ability signalized by the confidence
 of t he country that
 gives him confidence and authority
 everywhere Now sir there is
 a great difference between the
 organization of the Navy and
 of the X Var Dc
 partments I hcre is a
 great defect in the Navy
 when a man has the
 opportunity to consult with those
 who are familiar with those
 rules I should suppose that
 if disposed ho would soon
 be able to accomplish that
 amount Now sir I regard
 this as a mere scheme
 which will eventuate in making
 more division and trouble in
 the Navy than we have
 had hitherto A little while
 ago not many years since
 we had 8 certain number
 of commissioners who were culled
 I be lieve the Navy
 Board They administered certain naval
 matters to the best of
 their ability but being Department
 in providing that ofiicial advice
 and naval men they were
 finaiiy dispensed with and that
 official knowledge to assist the
 Secretary of we made bureaus
 in the Department four be
 the Navy which are provided
 for the Secretary of lieve
 They are all under the
 charge of naval I MT
 ar ri here is your
 adjutant general not 01 ly
 men and they are consulting
 and advising men to advise
 but to do under the
 direction of the De and
 there is not an officer
 in the Navy whose partment
 and of the general in
 chief You are experience is
 good for anything whose advice
 the Secretary may not have
 if he chooses to ask
 sure of giving military chara_cter
 you are sure for it
 and it is to be
 supposed that if he is
 a sensi of a military
 direction to everything the Secretary
 of YVar does whether he
 knows any ble man if
 we succeed in getting orre
 of that class he will
 ask it if he needs
 it thing about the Army
 or discipline or not under
 the advice of these bureaus
 through whom he Those of
 us who have had any
 occasion to in must offcially
 act Why does not the
 Navy quire as to naval
 matters or have had anything
 to do with naval oflicers
 must be aware that the
 W Department require the same
 thing I The jealousy of
 the gentlernan from Maine it
 service is full of trouble
 always that there are would
 seem to me ought to
 bc directed with great quarrcls
 differences of opin ion cliques
 animosi ties jealousies rivalries in
 the service continually force the
 military department as now con
 stituted The argument seems to
 noe to be to ex
 i Why sir not many
 years ago with a view
 to c üde from the
 Navy Department all knosvledge improve
 the Navy we passed a
 law creating a of naval
 discipline and naval affairs Can
 that be naval board who
 should have power to retire
 cer tain officers They discharged
 their duties do right Shall
 we catch up every six
 months or every year or
 two a new Secretary of
 the Navy not know how
 well but we all remember
 that for whose recommendations shall
 be 01 whose real years
 afterwards we had continual denunciations
 of the unfairness und favorilist
 n will which they character
 is whatever his generai intelligence
 that he knows nothing in
 particular about the ser had
 discharged those duties I believe
 they were Department with the
 advice he gees from these
 E vice He can know
 where navies ought to be
 I offcers of the hkghcst
 rank of the Navy We
 sources it is because he
 has no brains or no
 will employed hc may know
 the general principles heard more
 than one moving appeal from
 the hon upon which the
 Navy is regulated but there
 are orable Senator from Kentucky
 and the voice of ingness
 to labor Mr BAKER I
 desire to ask the gentleman
 a thousand minor considerations that
 enter iFIto the honorable Senator
 from New Hampshire was loud
 here day after day in
 denunciation of the Is the
 service and that are necessary
 to give it its from
 Maryland a question for information
 there anybody to advise the
 Secretary of the II practical
 effieiency Where are these to
 come wickedness of the whole
 proceeding and it took Navy
 offcially upon questions of discipline
 in from Not from the
 Secretary of the Navy whom
 us years to get rid
 of the diffculty and we
 only you do not presume
 to know anything about them
 got rid of it by
 puttino everybody back just where
 the Navv Mr PEARCE I
 do not know that there
 is and it is not
 desirable perhaps that he should

 of i show he was
 before any whose official business
 it is to advise him
 for he is a State
 offccr a civil flicer So
 let him ing most conclusively
 the want of good feeling
 the want of trust the
 want of everything that on
 that point but he has
 these old captains in je
 He ought to bc a
 man of ability He un
 two of the bureaus which
 I have narned who if
 doubtedly Will always be such
 and the appre I should
 be requited to make a
 service of8hat kind w bat
 it should be existing in

 they are cornpetent to anything

 that this assistant W ill
 usurp his pow I view
 this now officer as ers
 and that the man W

 advice Well novel what is
 proposed Here is the thc
 fifth wbecl to a coach
 There is no sort of
 the business to be done
 will of necessity by force
 It is under the control
 necessity for it in my
 judgment As to the com
 of circumstances obtain the ascendency
 over the civil arm of
 the service of a civilian
 The head of it ought
 to be a man manding
 general he is not usually
 stationed at man who knows
 nothing about it That will
 gen Washington and has not
 been for a number of

 I acknowledge but who profits
 of eminent ability He may

 11 ability if the President
 chooses to select such a
 person He may a chicf
 clerk undcr him Who iS
 able to aid him He
 häs four heads of bureaus
 about him who can advise
 him at any Yhoment In
 addition to this he may
 have the advice of any
 omcer of the Navy if
 he chooses to ask for
 it Now it is proposed
 instead of that iVith reference
 to the discipline with reference
 to the assignment of command
 with referenceto all that whiéh
 ereatés feeling and in the
 Navy to captain and put
 him there todirect the whole
 thing He will be héld
 respons iblé for it and
 it Will lead to innumerable
 quarrels and dim cult ies
 No man who valucd his
 peace would take the head
 Of that Department with such
 an Offeer about him He
 would ather take the xeÅp6néibility
 himself Therefore tho whole ar
 gument addresses itself to my
 mind with no force whätéver
 I maybe wronæ about it
 but it appears to me
 to be the very worst
 thing for the service itself
 that we could possibly do
 aud I sincerely hope that
 the amendment which is proposed
 will not be adopted We
 may as well carry it
 into the A rmy Mr
 GRIMES we do Mr FESSENDEN
 Whom do we have in
 the Depart ment of War
 occupying the same position Mr
 GRIMES The Adjutant General He
 is not Mr FESSENDEN Not
 at all connected with the
 Department in that shape Mr
 GRIMES Yes he is Heissues
 the orders he assions every
 man to his duty Mr
 frESSENDEN Oh do you propose
 to a new bureau Mt
 GRIM ES That is the
 duty imposed Mr FESSENDEN Then
 propose it in that shape
 but hore you propose to
 put him directly into the
 Depnrtnnent to manage its affairs
 If you want to make
 anot hcr bureau bring it
 up in that but not
 in the shape shape and
 we will discuss it in
 which it is now proposed
 I hope the I epart
 ment may continue as it
 is at present go far
 as I do not this
 matter is concerned Rt any
 rate care about it one
 way 01 the other except
 as I believe it will
 be highly injurious and produce
 difficulties alt nround Mr GRIMES
 The Senator from Maine savs
 that this proposition is predicated
 upon t he iden that
 we are going to have
 Secretary of the Navy who
 is incompetent to discharge duties
 Mr FESSENDEN we always have
 Mr GRIMES He might just
 as well say that the
 law which requircs that thm
 e shall be two post
 captainult the head of two
 bureaus IS predicated on the
 same state of things for
 you I have on your
 n law which requires that
 two post captains shall be
 at the hoad of two
 particular bure a us He
 might with the saine réason
 apply his tu gtunpnt to
 that law as to the
 have no doubt the Senator
 one now liroposetl is correct
 in saving that there are
 all sorts of rival ries
 and cliques and there will
 always be so long as
 Senators shall listen to the
 ad vice of 01 1
 water logcred captains who lie
 around the t ol We
 in this case to have
 official ofliccr cou I nected
 with tho Secretary of the
 Navy Who shap stand exactly
 in thc s mne relation
 to hirn that the Assistant
 Secretary of t he Trcasury
 occupies to the of the
 rrreasury MT as the suppo
 sition a legitimate one when
 that law was pro that
 the Secretary of the rrrcasury
 would not be co npetoul
 to discharge the duties of
 bis t office Was thc
 supposition a legitimate onc that
 t be Secretary of State
 would not be compo I
 tent to discharge tl 1
 B dut ies of his
 office when you enacted that
 tile President should have the
 power to select an Assistant
 Secretarv of State if that
 was not a sup iosition
 tbcn I should like to
 knosv by what it is
 that lecting an ASsistaht Secretary
 of State are you bound
 to take himTrom tiny special
 class of men or when
 you select an Assistant Secretary
 of the Treasury are you
 bound to take him from
 among the collectoi s or
 any other class You take
 him where you can find
 him you take a competent
 man Mr GRIMES I was
 going on to say that
 it is true we have
 two very worthy naval gentlemen
 at th e head Of
 bureaus of the Navy Department
 Their particülar specialties are one
 that of ord nance and
 the Other that of docks
 and yards If the Secretary
 of the Navy wants any
 information in regard to ordnance
 matters of course he ap
 peals to the gentleman who
 is at the head of
 that bureau He has devoted
 himself for years prob ably
 to that particular question and
 is able to give specific
 and correct information upon that
 subject So too when he
 wants information in regard to
 any particular dock or navy
 yard he appeals to the
 chief of that bureau and
 there he Bat suppose the
 Senator from Maine obtains it
 should be appointed Secretary of
 tho Navy under the incoming
 Administration a place which I
 should like to see him
 hold and I have no
 doubt would make an admirable
 Secretary of the Navy and
 suppose the first day after
 he entered on the discharge
 of that duty he should
 be re quired to fit
 out a ship to go
 to the Pacific ocean he
 has to assign offcers to
 that command to whom is
 he going to apply Who
 is roing to enlighten him
 as to the capabilities of
 particular officers to discharge the
 duties that may be as
 signed to them Who is
 going to tell him whether
 is the this man or
 that man is a competent
 man riRht man for the
 right place He has nobody
 Me appeals to the heads
 of these bureaus One of
 them can tell him about
 docks another can tell him
 about guns another can tell
 him about pro visions and
 clothing another can tell him
 about medical stores but none
 can tell him anything in
 reoard to the personnel of
 the service what may be
 the capacities of au y
 particular ofliccr to dis charge
 a particular duty Now we
 proposc to place there son
 e man who is familiar
 With the service who is
 familiar with the rnen in
 the sor vice and tl
 uat is the reason why
 we choose to take a
 man the line of the
 Navy a man who is
 familiar m vith the duty
 that any particular officer may
 be called upon to perform
 who is supposed to know
 the character of these officers
 and know what duties they
 tute particularly adapted to and
 he is the Ylan to
 wh01n the Secretary of the
 Navy I have no Y
 articular interest about can appeal
 this Inatt er I an
 on y actino upon the
 superintendent of the riaval astronomical
 expedition to entitled An act
 making appropriations for the ycar
 ending the 30th of June
 18 52 from the 17th
 of September 1855 and that
 the amount necessary to pay
 the same be and is
 hereby appropriated out of any
 money in the Treasury not
 otherwise appropriated The amendmént was
 agreed to Mr GRIMES 1
 am authorized by the com
 mittee on Naval Affairs to
 submit the following amendment to
 come in at the end
 of the first section For
 the completion of the charts
 of the survey of the
 La Plate 6 000 Mr
 FESSENDEN 1 should like to
 know what that is Mr
 GRIMES It isan appropriation of
 6 000 for the completion
 of the charts of the
 La Plata river the survey
 of which was made by
 Com mander Page of the
 Navy The charts have been
 partially completed At various times
 15 000 have been appropriated
 This will complete the chart
 as far as the La
 Plata and all its tributaries
 have been surveyed It is
 deemed to be necessary and
 very important to the commerce
 of the coun try which
 is being very much extended
 in that direction that these
 charts should be completed The
 amendment was agreed to Mr
 GRIMES I have anotheramendmentfrom the
 Committee on Naval Affairs to
 insert several additional sections which
 I ask the Secretary to
 read The Secretary read as
 follows and be it further
 enacted That the grade of

 a question ticularly to the

 I object to is tl
 lat i ing amendnrlent asan
 additional section to the bill
 you designate where he shall

 hnd be it further enacted
 l hat the compensation of
 tho Mr GRIMES I will
 very briefly explain the proposition
 that I arn authorized to
 submit by the Committee on
 Naval Affairs There are at
 this i time sixty four
 pursers or paymasters in the
 na val service of the
 United States of whom eight
 are entirely unfit for duty
 beincr in varl ous ways
 sorne of them insane leaving
 there fore only fifty six
 who are efficient active rncn
 capable of performing the duties
 that are required THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF
 CONGRESS PUBLISHED JOHN C RIVES
 WASHINGTON D C THIRTY SIXTH
 CONGRESS 2D SESSION of them
 The law of Congress passed
 in 1812 and afterwards confirmed
 by a subsequent law passed
 in 1817 declares that no
 person shall per form the
 duties of a purser unless
 he has first been appointed
 by the President of the
 United States and confirmed by
 the Senate and authorized therefore
 to act in that capacity
 Yet according to the naval
 register of the last year
 the last that has becn
 published there are fifteen omcers
 of the line thatare performing
 th is duty and therefore
 act ing in direct con
 travention of the law of
 Congress They were compelled to
 do it because there were
 Phis operates as a great
 injustice to no pursers the
 sailors because there is no
 umpire between the sailors and
 United States in which capacity
 the commander of the vessel
 ordinarily acts Whenever there is
 any conflict between the pur
 serand a person to whom
 money is paid or rations
 are delivered the commander acts
 as the umpire to decide
 those controversies but when the
 com mander acts in the
 capacity of purser or pay
 master there is nobody to
 perform that duty It is
 unjust to the Government likewise
 and unjust to the man
 who acts as purser because
 you com plicate his duties
 and disable him from perform
 mg as well as he
 otherwise vould either of these
 branches of duty x vhich
 will be required of him
 either as commander of the
 men and the naviga tor
 of the ship or as
 purser It is proposed by
 this amendment to gradually decrease
 the number of pursers from
 sixty four down to fifty
 and to gradually increase the
 whole number of pay offcers
 by adding assistant pur sers
 allowing five to be appointed
 in the course of every
 six months until you getup
 to the num ber of
 thirty five and thus you
 will stand at the end
 with fifty pursers and thirty
 five assistant pursers not making
 any very material difference so
 far as the expenses are
 concerned to the Gov crnmcnt
 but making a much more
 efficient corps for the performance
 of duty There is a
 proposition in the amendment which
 1 suppose will mect writh
 considerable opposition and which I
 am not particularly anxious should
 be adopted although believe that
 it is for the interest
 of the service that it
 should be adopted and that
 is that these a sistant
 pursers shall be between the
 ages of twenty one and
 thirty twen ty six was
 inserted in the amendment butit
 should be thirty which was
 thc affreement of the com
 mittee and that so long
 as there shall be appli
 cants from among the graduates
 of the Naval Academy they
 shall be taken from that
 corps be I fore going
 into civil life for their
 procurement wili give the reasons
 for this In the first
 place if you go to
 the line or go to
 the Academy for these officers
 it ceases to be a
 political office and is not
 to be bestowed upon anybody
 because he happens to have
 been an ac tive or
 influential partisan in a political
 campaign Then vain you get
 one who is conversant with
 the duties of the situation
 to which he is called
 and also acquainted with sea
 life and I believed it
 to be very important and
 think the committee concurred with
 me in that opinion if
 you desire to promote the
 esprit du corps of the
 service that you should have
 men somewhat familiar with sea
 life Besides you give to
 a purser in the Navy
 WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 13 1861 Academy
 you get one of perfect
 physique These young gentlemen vhen
 they go there are thor
 oughly examined upon that s
 ubicct and you take a
 man who is perfect in
 his development and take him
 in the prime of life
 when he is capable of
 performing important service to the
 country I know a purser
 recently appointed a man a
 little past the meridian of
 life appointed probably on account
 of his having been an
 active partisan and upon the
 first cruise before he had
 been twelve months in the
 service he was stricken down
 dis abled and always will
 remain disabled and he upon
 your hands a pensioner and
 if he liv to be
 seventy years of age you
 will have to pay him
 a salary amounting to leave
 pay But If you had
 taken that man at twenty
 one or at twenty five
 or twenty nine you would
 havc hud probably fifteen or
 twenty or twenty five years
 of good efficient active service
 out of him This amendment
 therefore limits the age at
 which these young men shall
 have arrived at the time
 that they receive their commissions
 as assistant pursers and limits
 it for the protection of
 the Gov crnment in order
 that we may have men
 who are not to be
 appointed bccause they are partisans
 or have been partisans because
 they have been bro ken
 down rnerchants are past the
 meridian of life and have
 families dependent upon them but
 young active thoroughgoing effcient men
 who can really perform effcicnt
 duty for the Govern ment
 Mr HUNTER Mr President 1
 think this is a very
 inappropriate time to be adding
 so largely to the number
 of omcers of the Navy
 Instead of sixty four pursers
 it seems we are to
 have now éighty five pursers
 and assistant pursers and I
 do not see any very
 marked dis tinction between the
 duties of the purser and
 the assistants I have no
 doubt the result if wc
 adopt I this amendment will
 be that after awhile the
 as sist ant pursers will
 say t hey discharge the
 same duties with the others
 that we want the eighty
 five pursers and that they
 ought to be raised to
 the same rate of pay
 Mr GRIMES The Senator will
 allow me 1 ought to
 have said before the Senator
 cmnmenced that seven years uro
 the Committee on Naval Affairs
 in the Senate through its
 chairman Mr MALLORY and the
 Committee on Naval Affairs of
 the House of Representatives through
 its chair I man Mr
 BococR proposed to Congress t
 o create this grade of
 assistant pursers and to create
 a number only one lcss
 than that proposed by this
 amendment and I desire to
 say to the Senator that
 that was in 1854 two
 years before the time when
 Congress increased the number of
 men in the Nåvy by
 one thousand which was done
 in 1856 and before we
 had built the eight sloops
 of war Mr HUNTER 1
 havc great respect for the
 authorities which the Senator cites
 but still I submit again
 that this is not the
 time to in I creasing
 the number of officers so
 largely as it is proposed
 to do here Ido not
 as I stated before see
 the distinction between the duties
 to be per formed by
 the one and the other
 class of offcers Both if
 I understand it have to
 discharge the same duties and
 yet they get different salaries
 a rank as an offcer
 and there will be some
 reason Mr GRIMES It is
 the design that the as
 sistant pursers shall be assigned
 to small vessels for giving
 this rank to him if
 you take him from the
 line or if you take
 him from among the grad
 They are to be young
 men in the prime of
 life uates of your Academy
 and therefore have a man
 I The idea is that
 they will be assigned to
 such ves who is competent
 to discharge sea duty at
 any sels as we have
 determined by the senatorial vote
 time There was another reason
 and that was to day
 to build and that men
 who have been in the
 service for twenty or thirty
 years if they go to
 because these pursers may be
 called upon to work 51
 the ship to command thc
 men In cases of con
 sea shall be assigned to
 other vessels and draw flict
 with a foreign Power it
 may be not only im
 a larger pay than these
 young gentlemen portant but very
 necessary to order a purser
 to I Mr FESSENDEN Allow
 me to ask the Sen
 command a prize 02 if
 the officers were mostly it
 might be very important that
 he shot down should command
 the very vessel on which
 he was If you take
 an offeer from the Iiile
 or take him from the
 Academy and put him in
 this position you have a
 man who is competent to
 discharge that duty If you
 take a man from the
 That not all Academy or
 one who has passed through
 the ator from Iowa one
 question before the Senator i
 from Virginia proceeds Will not
 their pay be I l
 predicated on the time of
 service and after they get
 in will it not be
 constantly increasing from time to
 time By oar last Navy
 bill the pay is in
 NEW SERIES NO 54 Mr
 HUNTER The result then stand
 will be that they will
 all be paid alike and
 the whole proposition is one
 for the creation of a
 new grade of officers and
 for the purpose of add
 ing to the number of
 pursers now in the Navy
 Mr GRIMES The Senator will
 observethat it does not increase
 the pay materially We only
 authorize the creation of five
 assistant pursers during the next
 six months and then during
 the next ensuing six months
 five more and so on
 so that there is no
 immediate increase Mr HUNTER The
 system which is pro posed
 requires that we shall have
 eighty five pursers and assistant
 pursers instead Of sixty four
 now allowed by law It
 is obvious that we shall
 thus increase the expenses of
 that branch of the service
 very much and as I
 said before it seems to
 me that this is surely
 not the time to be
 making thcse additions when the
 Treasury is in the condition
 in which we now find
 it Nor is this the
 bill upon which we should
 be making these radical changes
 changes which look to the
 reorganization of the naval service
 of the country The appropriation
 bills ought to be simple
 They ought to be bills
 for which anybody can vote
 who desires to keep up
 the Navy of the country
 vith out havincr to commit
 himself to schemes of re
 organization to experiment to anything
 that may be suggested by
 thc Committee on Naval Affairs
 in the way of reform
 These should be the sub
 jects of separate bills Perhaps
 if this proposi tion had
 corne up separately and been
 fully con sidered I might
 I hardly think I should
 though favor it There might
 be a majority for it
 but it is a suffcient
 reason to vote against it
 at pres ent because it
 ought not to be appended
 to this I think it
 is a still higher reason
 for voting affainst it because
 it is going to commit
 the coun try to a
 much larger expenditure than it
 would havo to encounter under
 the existing law Before we
 have done with t hesc
 schemes of reorgani zation on
 this appropriation bill we shall
 have it as large as
 one of Little Brown s
 volumes of the Statutes at
 Large Mr POWELL 1 move
 to strike out that pro
 vision of the amendment which
 requires these assistant paymasters to
 be taken from the gradu
 atcs of the Naval Academy
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr F00T
 The amendment to the amendment
 is to strike That no
 person shall be appointed an
 assistant pay master in the
 Navy excepting graduates of the
 Naval Acad emy if any
 such graduate shall at the
 time of such appoint ments
 be an applicant therefor and
 shall in other respects comply
 with the requirements of the
 act Mr POWELL 1 had
 supposed we edu cated the
 young gentlemen at the Naval
 Academy for the purpose of
 making them skilled in naval
 affairs for thc purpose of
 fighting This amend Inent proposes
 to make them mere accounting
 I think it is absolutely
 clerks and paymasters disgraceful to
 the naval service to put
 them in the pay department
 Any young gentleman who has
 been raised in a banking
 house or as a clerk
 in a store would be
 better qualified to perform this
 duty than young gentlernen educated
 at the Naval Academy Moreover
 I think it eminently proper
 that thcsc duties should be
 performed by gentle men taken
 from civil life Mr CHANDLER
 lam in favor oftheamend ment
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and I am opposed to
 the amendment increasing the number
 of clerks for that is
 what they amount to The
 captain of each of these
 small vessels I am in
 formed has clerk a captain
 s clerk perfectly competent to
 keep the accounts of forty
 or fifty or sixty men
 Now it is proposed to
 create a new offcer with
 a salary of one thousand
 or fif teen hundred dollars
 a year to keep the
 accounts of fifty men Sir
 I hope the whole thing
 will be voted down I
 am in favor of this
 amendment ot the Senator from
 Kentucky because as he justly
 creased gradually in a series
 of years After they remarked
 any merchant s clerk anywhere
 bet have been in the
 service a certain length of
 time ter prepared to perform
 these duties than gradu it
 is increased I suppose and
 so on I Mr GRIMES
 Yes sir I hope they
 will not be I atesof
 the naval school I degraded
 from the pursuit for which
 they are ede 850 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 11 ucated
 to that ofa mere clerk
 to keep the accounts of
 forty or fifty men It
 is an absurdity sir W
 c do not need these
 offcers A captain s clerk
 is perfectly competent and the
 duty should be im posed
 on him of keeping the
 accounts of these small vessels
 The whole thing is an
 absurdity Anybody can keep the
 accounts Mr HUNTER 1 ask
 the Senator from Iowa to
 inform me whether if W
 e vote for the amend
 ment of the Senator from
 Kentucky we do away with
 that proposed provision about giving
 the I do not think
 they ought to have pursers
 rank rank Rank should go
 with the sword Mr GRIMES
 The rank is provided forin
 an old law Mr HUNTER
 An old law Mr GRIMES
 Yes a law that has
 been in existence for several
 years The amendment to the
 amendment was agreed to Mr
 CHANDLER hope now the amend
 ment as amended will bc
 voted down it is need
 Mr HALE There is a
 verbal amendment which I wish
 to suggest to the amendment
 I do not know whether
 the Senator from Iowa has
 made it or not His
 limitation as reported is that
 nobody shall be appointed to
 the oflice of assistant paymaster

 think they will be unanimously

 charts and maps and requires
 that before they are published
 they shall be submitted to
 the inspection ofa board OE
 officers to be detailed by

 It is intendcd as a

 was offered at the last
 session as an amendment to

 the Senator from Florida Mr

 voted down by a vote
 of 25 to 14 For
 myself I cannot see that
 there has been any change
 in the condition of the

 the condition of the Tteas

 President I think that this
 is avcu y inop port
 une time to undertake to
 build seven new stearners and
 to appropriate 1 200 000
 for that I think that
 il these Inatters it would
 be obicct well to act
 as we would in our
 private affairs If we were
 strained and in difficulties instead
 of incurrin y new liabilities
 we should be disposed to
 reduce and retrench as much
 as we could I in
 the condition in thil k
 il is eminently proper which
 the Treasury is that we
 should do so now the
 business beforc the body The
 Chair Mr MASON N lr
 President I pposo none Affairs
 to incur an expenditure at
 present of and prospectively of
 some three or four or
 five hundred thousand more For
 what purpose For any pressino
 neccssity No The necessitiés ofthc
 Government for money are pres
 sing Is this a pressing
 necessity for expenditure No It
 is to increase the military
 power of this Is there
 any Government in its naval
 service pressing necessity for that
 Sir I have observed In
 the remarks that have been
 made in debate here by
 members of the Naval Committee
 that they thought it necessary
 to apologize for the expend
 iture of some fifteen or
 twenty thousand dollars to repair
 naval barracks that were in
 dilapidation and decay asa measure
 ofeconomy They thought it necessary
 to apologize in the condition
 of the country for that
 comparatively small exfrendi ture But
 now they come in at
 once and ask for 1
 500 000 when there is
 no necessity as they allexe
 for an increase of the
 Navy Now sir why is
 the Navy to be increased
 Is there any demand for
 these steamers Is there any
 such pressin necessity upon the
 military arm of the country
 to be strengthened as to
 induce Congress to borrow money
 at the ruinous rates we
 are now compelled to pay
 to strengthen it I I
 ask Senators on the other
 side to state what the
 Is there any appæhension of
 war necessity is Is there
 any apprehension that this Government
 may find itself unable to
 defend itself on any sud
 den emergency that will justify
 us in borrowinff money at
 this ruinous rate for the
 purpose now of increasing the
 Navy The honorable Senator from
 Iowa representing as he seems
 to do chiefly the Committee
 on Naval Affairs on this
 question has said that there
 is no purpose in the
 world that he knows of
 requiring any immediatc war like
 use of this increase of
 the Navy He says it
 was recommended some two or
 three years ago and not
 then adopted But that honorable
 Sen ator does not tell
 us why it is proposed
 now in the present emergent
 condition of the public finances
 Mr GRIMES If the Senator
 will allow me I will
 state that it is recommended
 now by the Secretarv of
 the Navy and furthermore that
 since the last session of
 Congress there has been a
 survey of the naval vessels
 of the United States many
 of which havc been found
 to be utterly worthless and
 that I apprehend is onc
 reason why a good many
 gentlemen who were recorded as
 having voted against the proposition
 last year voted as they
 did on the present occasion
 Mr POLIC I sugcrest to
 the Senator that the Secretary
 of the Navy did not
 recommend seven He recommends a
 gradual increase if I do
 not mistake ttle langua e
 that is used Mr GRIMES
 Naval gentlemen consider seven a
 very gradual increase Mr MASON
 well Mr President when that
 Senator has been longer in
 the public service suspect he
 will find that naval gentlemen
 consider a very small increase
 that which we who have
 regard for the public finances
 would consider a I am
 not answered when I very
 large increase am told by
 the honorable Senator that they
 have found out since then
 that many of these vessels
 were in decay and unfit
 for service What is the
 public emergency that calls for
 this increase of the naval
 force vhen we have no
 war Our com Senators to
 preserve order The amendment was
 agreed to The bill was
 reported to thc Senate as
 amended The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will put the question
 on in all the amend
 ments made as in Committee
 of the Whole un less
 certain amendments be indicated for
 a sepa rate vote Mr
 GRIMES I ask fora separate
 vote on the amendment for
 the crcauon of assistant pursers
 The PRESIDING OFFICER That was
 jected and therefore the question
 does not arise on concurring
 in that amendrncnt Mr GRIMES
 1 shall offer it again
 Mr POLK I move to
 except the amendment providing for
 the appropriation of 1 200
 000 for he building of
 seven screw steamers The PRESIDING
 OFFICER That amend ment will
 be reserved for a separate
 vote The Chair will put
 the question on cont urrinæ
 in all the amendments except
 that making provision for new
 steamers The amendments vere concurred
 in will deny that the
 credit of this Government is
 most seriously impaired In two
 attempts to raise comparatively small
 sums of money in two
 loan bills of 5 000
 000 the first was taken
 at the rate of twelve
 per cent and the last
 after vm y grcat efforts
 as are informed in the
 circles of the capitalists of
 New York for reasons satisfactory
 to then they managed to
 briug down the rate of
 merceis not unprotected we hear
 of no complaint there We
 have no unredresscd grievances in
 any interest to ten per
 cent Such a condition of
 the public credit hag been
 unknown to the Govern part
 of the world that know
 of that call for an
 ment except during the war
 of 1812 We cannot Increase
 of the Navy TV hy
 then when we are shut
 our eyes to these facts
 T hc credit of this
 borrowing money at a rate
 of usance unknown to this
 Government is it asked that
 we should ex Government has
 fallen so far belosrv the
 credit of the States that
 we learn from the newspapers
 the pend for the increase
 of the Navy and Government
 is going to the States
 and asking them the increase
 of this peculiar kind of
 naval ves to indorse its
 credit The necessity the grinding
 sels vessels of small draught

 be as the amendment requires
 heavily necessity of this Government
 has compelled Con gress within
 the last few days to
 authorize an I armed in

 000 000 The actual need
 Why sir we know from
 the newspapers that a and
 destitution of the Government although
 its bill is about to
 be introduced or has been
 intro credit has fallen below
 that of the individual II
 duced into the other branch
 of Congress provid States has
 compelled Congress to go again
 and ing for a military
 surveillance upon those States ask
 for an additional loan of

 I bill is framed in
 such a manner as to
 authorize the We have had
 a bill introduced into the
 Senate by The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question now is on
 concurring in the following financial
 of the Government the Secretmy

 Vermont ment terms he can

 Ii Mr COLLAMER Will the
 gentleman for the United States
 Navy at as early u
 as practicable into the market
 for what they Vill bring
 having due regard to effciency
 and econmny seven steam In
 this state of things we
 have a proposition me a
 moment screw sloops ottwar of
 the second class as vessels
 are rated io the Navy
 with full steam power whose
 greatest in here from the
 Committee on Navnl Mr MASON
 Certainly 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 851 Mr COLLAMER That bill
 has no warlike It is
 to avoid that purpose whatever
 It is to declare them
 no longer ports of entry
 so that ships will not
 make clearances to them It
 will prevent the necessity of
 any military force there Mr
 MASON I have not spoken
 one word Mr President of
 the reasons that induced the
 honorable Senator to introduce that
 bill speaking of the fact
 The honorable Senator has introduced
 a bill giving authority to
 the Presi dent under certain
 circumstances stated in the bill
 to discontinue ports of entry
 Very well I speak of
 the fact only What it
 may lead to is anpther
 question This proposition is to
 increase the naval armament by
 seven steamers ofsmail draught and
 heavy armament Now sir what
 is the con dition of
 the country I am not
 going to enter into any
 prospective reasoning as to what
 may be the condition of
 the country but what is
 it We have seven States
 all in the South all
 lying upon the Gulf and
 its waters that have abandoned
 this Union by solemn acts
 and have announced it with
 a Congress in session Six
 of those States whose acts
 of separation have been completed
 we are informed have confederated
 formed a sep arate government
 organized a government es tablislied
 a constitution elected a President
 at the last accounts and
 stand now as they claim
 a supreme and independent power
 among the nations o the
 earth Is that known here
 No it is not known
 here There is not a
 Senator on that side of
 the Chamber that knows it
 One hon orable Senator said
 there were discontented por tions
 of the country and that
 this naval arma ment had
 no reference to discontents in
 certain parts of the country
 Sovereign Slates that have confederated
 formed a government and a
 nation ality and organized it
 with a flag and a
 being are spoken of herc
 by honorable Senators as dis
 contents in certain parts of
 the country Now sir other
 gentlemen may shut their eyes
 to these facts if they
 think it wise to do
 so I come from that
 part of the country i
 cannot shut my eyes to
 the existing facts I know
 that what ever be the
 design of the honorable mover
 ot this proposition if these
 steamers are built thev will
 be part of the naval
 armament of this Cori federation
 to be used for any
 military purposes that the public
 exigencies may require and I
 know that the proposition of
 the honorablc Sen ator from
 Vermont will lead to this
 whatever he intends Take the
 Slate ofSouth Carolina the State
 of Georgia or the State
 of Florida This Gov ernment
 does not that they are
 no longer ortions of it
 They are not informed of
 that fact ut they do
 know that the discontents prevailing
 there have induced all the
 Federal offcers to re sicyn
 and they have nobody there
 to administer tile Federal laws
 They know that and thereforc
 they discontinue the ports of
 entry Then a ship from
 abroad that is destined för
 the port of Charleston or
 of Savannah has no right
 under the Federal laws to
 go either into Charleston or
 Sa vannah and it will
 be the duty of this
 Govern ment actino in the
 ignorancc which they assume of
 the existence of these facts
 in the South to take
 care that no ships do
 go there because no ship
 with a foreign cargo has
 any right to go into
 any of the ports of
 the United S ates but
 a port of entry Mr
 COLLAMER If the gentleman will
 in dulge me for a
 moment the very object of
 the bill Wits that if
 they were declared to be
 no longer ports of entry
 foreign vessels would take no
 clear ances for them and
 nevcrgo there at all and
 there would be no occasion
 for any force about it
 Mr MASON Whether foreign vessels
 can take a clearance for
 them will depend on whether
 foreign nations havc their eyes
 open to the state of
 the facts against which our
 eyes are shut I apprehend
 that foreign nations will give
 clearances for them Mr COLLAMER
 To ports of the United
 States Mr MASON They will
 take a clearance to contemplation
 of the United States and
 these very ships as soon
 as they are ready x
 vill be used for the
 purpose of shutting up those
 southern ports as the port
 of Boston was shut up
 under like cir cumstances by
 a power abroad equally oppress
 ive with this power at
 I lome It is in
 the con templation of the
 bill of the honorable Senator
 whatever he may have designed
 to convert these southern ports
 into the condition that Boston
 was when it was closed
 Whatever Senators on that side
 may say our eyes are
 not shut to the fact
 I cannot then vote for
 this appropriation If the Treasury
 was full I should fee
 l myself con strained to
 vote against it lest a
 misuse should be made of
 the naval power but with
 the Treasury in the condition
 that it is when this
 Government is a mendicant in
 the circles of capitalists for
 moncy and when this Government
 like other mendicants is asking
 its superiors to indorse their
 paper that they may get
 the money and when we
 are asked by those who
 administer the Government to make
 this extraordinary appro priation under
 these circumstances I am bound
 to believe that they want
 to increase the naval force
 for purposes that are not
 avowed on the face of
 the proposition Until the condition
 of the country in its
 relations North and South are
 set tled by no vote
 of mine shall there be
 any extraor dinary expenditure of
 the public money for either
 Army or Navy It is
 high time sir for the
 Government to take into consideration
 the state of things on
 out late southern borders and
 determine what those rela tions
 arc They should meet it
 like men Do not attempt
 t o cover it up
 and to evade it or
 disguise it meet it it
 f ull front declare that
 they are in rebellion and
 they are to be put
 down or declare that tl
 ney have the right of
 separation and are to be
 acknowledged in their separation Thisismy
 view of that Inatter Those
 States being out hav ing
 actually confederated having assumed a
 na tionality 1 should consider
 it was the bounden duty
 of the Government no matter
 what question separates them whethcr
 it be a slave question
 or a question efdomesticeconomy or
 anythingclse to acknowledge the separation
 and to let them go
 in peace but until those
 relations arc settled sat isfactorily
 until we know whether the
 arm of this Government is
 to be raised against them
 by no vote of mine
 shall there be any additions
 either to the naval or
 military service of the country
 Mr FESSENDEN Mr President 1
 have becn soznewhat surprised at
 thc course of remark of
 the honorable Senator frot n
 Virginia not so much howcvcr
 as I should bc had
 I not heard a silnilau
 course of remark from him
 on a former occasion Now
 sir it is well enough
 for us to understand precisely
 what the condition of this
 question is and who is
 responsible for it because it
 is rather a singular address
 to make to this side
 I of the Chamber that
 to appeal to us to
 know what is the object
 of the proposition now before
 the Senate Who has been
 in power for thc last
 four years I should like
 to know T lie Republican
 party Who has been administering
 thc affairs of this Government
 The Republican party The Senator
 will hardly pretend that Why
 then does he appeal to
 us Have we brought forward
 this proposition Does it come
 from us that we are
 thus scolded Why sir look
 back into your own records
 of your own party coming
 from your own President and
 your own Senate com mittec
 year after year and you
 have precisely this proposition to
 build these steamers We have
 had it every year for
 the last four certainly a
 proposition to increase your naval
 force because f an increase
 of that force was necessary
 It came from your I
 resident it is the offer
 of your Ad ministration it
 is the recommendation of your
 friends it is approved by
 your committee in this body
 year after year Why then
 do you talk to us
 about it Why not addréss
 the honorable Sen ator from
 New Jersey Mr THOMSON Why
 not add ress the honorable
 Sena tor from Florida appearance
 in the eyes of the
 world That has been the
 reason assigned and that has
 been the reason urged here
 year after year Vy the
 repre sentative of the Committee
 on Naval Affairs who was
 from one of these very
 seceding States has been his
 argument we having nothing of
 the kind which could be
 called a naval force in
 reality and it was recommended
 by your authority by men
 whom you placed in offce
 and whom you profess to
 follow to increase this force
 from the absolute necessity of
 the case and now that
 it happens to be brought
 forward again at this pres
 ent time under these circumstances
 for the fourth time from
 this same source the appeal
 is made to us why
 is this recommended and why
 do we on this side
 of the Chamber support this
 proposi tion Why sir the
 thing is remarkable Has the
 Senator forgotten these facts Then
 sir I suppose I am
 bound to look at it
 in another light If these
 things are so the argu
 ment of the Senator is
 predicated upon the idea that
 something has occurred to render
 it less ne cessary than
 it was last year or
 the year before or the
 year before that He is
 opposed to it now because
 it is not necessary although
 the Admin istration say so
 Why is it less necessary
 Be cause six or seven
 States of this Union have
 chosen to withdraw from it
 and not only chosen to
 withdraw from it but to
 seize the public prop erty
 in substance to declare war
 against the Uni ted States
 to take possession of the
 public fortifi cations of this
 country to seize the custom
 houses to seize the mints
 to do what if it
 took place be tween individuals
 vould be characterized by any
 name but a respectable one
 especially in the case of
 New Orleans all these things
 have täken place and do
 they render the increase of
 the naval force of the
 United States of America less
 necessary in any point Is
 our commerce safer Is the
 pub lic property in a
 better condition Are we so
 much better off in consequence
 of having five or six
 Stateswitbdraw and our fortifications seized
 our mints seized our custom
 houses seized are we in
 so much bétter condition that
 what was needed last yctu
 as an increase of the
 naval force is not needed
 this Is this the argument
 of the Senator Why thc
 Senator will permit me to
 ask him respectfully whom he
 represents here Is he a
 Senator of the United States
 of America that he makes
 an argument of that character
 Does he stand up here
 in his placc and say
 I as a Sen ator
 of the United Stales and
 member of this great body
 bound to advise for the
 good of the country the
 good of the Government say
 that in consequence of all
 that has taken place the
 force of the Government must
 be diminished Not withstanding the
 surveys that have taken place
 within the last year show
 that a portion of the
 vessels are unfit for service
 and therefore you need more
 yet in consequence of the
 fact that we have several
 States of this Confederacy in
 revolt if you please to
 call it so in consequence
 of the fact that they
 have seized the public property
 in conse quence of the
 fact that they have avowed
 through their public journals that
 they will declare war against
 the Unitcd States in a
 certain contingency therefore says the
 Senator as a Senator of
 the Mr MALLORY who was
 so long the chairman the
 port of Charleston or Savannah
 The Sen ator says that
 they are not ports of
 thie United il of that
 committee I United States I
 ohject even to the force
 which was It strikes me
 that is a sin necessary
 last year gular line of
 argument for a Senator of
 the United States to pursue
 I confess Mr President that
 in the view which I
 take of these matters the
 course which has been adopted
 by some gentlemen on the
 other side of the Chamber
 has seemed to Ille very
 astonishing With the honorable Senator
 from Mississippi Mr DAvzs who
 left this Chamber somc days
 since I recognize the fact
 that while I am here
 I as a member of
 the Senate of the United
 States I I am bound
 to discharge my duties as
 a Senator of the United
 States without reference to what
 may be passing outside of
 this Chamber So long as
 I stay here receiving the
 money of the Govern ment
 and sworn to support the
 Government I look out to
 the best of my ability
 for the interests and the
 welfare of the Government If
 I can no States and
 what follows Why the public
 force Has there been any
 change in the condition of
 longer do that I will
 leave my place here and
 of Lhe United States mustseize
 the ship that goes thc
 country that should render this
 increase less i return to
 my State and say I
 am at its service into
 the port that is not
 a port of entry Now
 necessary Why sir it is
 predicated in all these Now
 sir how do we who
 remain here we whose it
 is idle for us to
 conceal or disguise this matter
 reports of the heads of
 Departments upon the States have
 not seceded or offered to
 secede stand any longer If
 the bill of the honorable
 Senator necessities of that arm
 of the service They as
 Senators at the present time
 We look upon passes it
 will be the dutyofthe Treasury
 to take I wanted it
 for the protection of our
 commerce these occurrences remarkable as
 they are taking care that
 the revenue laws are not
 violated in the They wanted
 it to enable us to
 make a respectable I place
 outside of this Chamber and
 we are bound 852 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 11 to
 deal with them as antagonisms
 for they are antagonisms we
 are bound to look upon
 them as opposing thc interests
 and the welfare of the
 Gov ernment under which we
 live the United States and
 the Constitution of the United
 States which we have sworn
 to support That is the
 point of view in which
 we must look at them
 Can gentle men therefore say
 to themselves and to the
 coun try I standing here
 as a member of this
 Gov ernrnent must look out
 and keep my eyes open
 to see not that this
 Government has the advantage of
 my counsels but that those
 outside Of it who are
 waging war against it have
 the benefit of my counsels
 and my aid Why sir
 take into consideration in connec
 tion with this question the
 bill which was offered by
 my friend from Vermont What
 was it Sim pty a
 bill to provide that where
 the revenue can not be
 collected at a particular place
 or a partic ular point
 that place shall cease to
 be recoo nizcd as one
 where revenue shall be or
 can be legally collected under
 the Government Is not this
 what we owe to foreigners
 Take the port of Charles
 ton as an illustration What
 arc they doing there Is
 our revenue collected there Is
 the revenue of the United
 States any longer collected there
 Do they recoonize our officers
 Do they in anv way
 say or admit that we
 have the slightest pardicle of
 rightin thatplace And yet the
 proposition which is made that
 the President under such circum
 stances shall have pox ver
 to put an end to
 thc existence of that port
 as ours is characterized as
 an unfriendly act one designed
 to coerce a State one
 designed in fact to bring
 the force of the United
 States to bear upon a
 portion of the coun try
 which declares it is no
 longer under its juris diction
 I would ask the honorable
 Senator do we not owe
 it to the foreign Governments
 them selves that wc shall
 cither enforce our own laws
 in those ports or else
 declare that they arc no
 longer ports that foreign vessels
 are to enter Mr MASON
 Will the honorable Senator allow
 me to answer him Mr
 FESSENDEN Ceriainly Mr MASON Clearly
 if they will avow in
 the bill the reason for
 it that the State South
 Carolina is no longer a
 member of the Conföder acy
 but beyond the jurisdiction of
 the Unilcd States Let them
 that which they have sedulously
 refrained from avowin Mr FESSENDEN
 that make in point of
 law T hc Senator is
 a lawyer Who puts the
 reason for a statute on
 the statute book Who thinks
 when he draws a bill
 of giv ingin the bill
 the cause why he draws
 it No It is not
 necessary that we should legislator
 avow the fact We simply
 declare as proposed by the
 honorable Senator s bill this
 that there may be cases
 and there are cases in
 which it has become difficult
 for the United States to
 collect its revenue in particular
 places by the ordinary course
 and we Oivc to the
 President the of proceeding pow
 cr to sav that there
 shall no longer an nt
 tempt to collect revenue there
 for it shall cease to
 be port where vessels can
 legally enter u nd ll
 tho Is not this right
 authority ot the United States
 in point of fact So
 long as we do not
 do this if going further
 and furnishing all these States
 with postal facilities every day
 they are receiving all the
 benefits of it we paying
 the money and my friend
 s bill covers that also
 The honorable Senator says this
 will not do do one
 thing or another declare war
 against them if you please
 or else declare that they
 are no lon ger a
 part of the United States
 Sir I do not choose
 to do either in thc
 present state of affairs propose
 simply to do that which
 is necessary for our own
 protection and our own advantage
 I repeat I am acting
 as yet as a Senator
 of thc I am legislating
 for the United United States
 States and not for South
 Carolina or for any se
 ceded State and as long
 as I sit here as
 I said before I take
 it that is my duty
 What then does the United
 States want to do It
 wishes to collect its own
 revenue and it wishes for
 force enough if force is
 necessary to accomplish that I
 am not at all frightened
 by the term purpose force
 and this talk about the
 coercion of a State The
 time may come when it
 will be ne cessary for
 us to use the language
 of the honorable Senator to
 speak plainly I am ready
 to speak plainly now upon
 that subject and I say
 most distinctly if the time
 ever does come in my
 judg ment l speak for
 one when it will be
 necessary to use force in
 order to execute the laws
 of the United States under
 the Constitution anywhcrc and everywhere
 within what is properly the
 Uni ted States I am
 perfectly ready to do it
 but I trust we shall
 have no such necessity The
 measure of my friend from
 Vermont is a measure of
 peace The proposition to construct
 these additional vesscis is a
 measure of peace do not
 suppose anybody ever dreamed of
 making this appropriation for the
 purpose of having col 1
 do not bc lisions with
 these seceding States lieve l
 havc never believed that any
 collision will be necessary except
 in a certain event But
 it may be that it
 will coinc it may be
 that war will come it
 may be that these difficulties
 are to grow vastly greater
 than they are now MT
 hen that time comes I
 trust we shall be ready
 to meet all our responsibilities
 like men We need not
 be told about it however
 in advance But the question
 now is simply this what
 is necessary for us to
 do with reference to the
 inter csts of this country
 as connected with its naval
 Is this matter itself such
 as force That is all
 has been recommended to us
 more than once such as
 recommends itself to us on
 its own its such as
 we are bound to providc
 for according to oe u
 own sense of duty undex
 the Constitution and the law
 even if we borrow money
 and I take it the
 time has not yet come
 when we cannot bor row
 Inoney I am ready to
 votc it and although the
 Senator standing here wi l
 not votc it because it
 rnny be that it will
 give additional fore c to
 the orable Senator that question
 I have that respect for
 him which he is entitled
 to for his position his
 mind his intellect and his
 self propriety He is to
 determine for himself what he
 represents and whom I for
 myself I will tell him
 whom I repre sent the
 sovereign State of Virginia to
 whom I am alone amenable
 for what I may do
 or say here The honorable
 Senator referred to a remark
 that fell from the distinguished
 Senator from the State of
 Mississippi lately here which 1
 heard and heard with equal
 approbation that he intended loyally
 to contribute his mite or
 his devotion to the administration
 of this Government while he
 1 respond to it continued
 to be a member Qf
 it in the spirit ofa
 man of honor and a
 man of loy alty I
 will do nothing that will
 stand in the way of
 the full complete administration of
 this Gov ernment as long
 as I remain one of
 the partici pants in its
 admmistration but I will do
 this if I have reason
 to believe that the Government
 in which I participate to
 administer is initiating a policy
 that will lead to civil
 war that will lead to
 an unnecessary var that will
 minister to the pas sions
 of bad men in goinø
 into that war I will
 not vote to increase the
 armament for that pur I
 will not refrain from voting
 a dollar on i pose
 the contrary I would strain
 the public credit as I
 have done by voting for
 the loan bills to sup
 ply all the necessary means
 to carry on the ordi
 nary functions of this Government
 but when I have reason
 to believe that it is
 attempted to incur extraordinary expenditures
 under present cir cumstances when
 those who administer the Gov
 ernment now would refrain from
 them and when I have
 reason to believe confirmed by
 what fell from the honorable
 Senator from Maine that the
 purpose is to strengthen the
 arm of the Govern ment
 with a view to a
 prospect such as I have
 indicated I am doing my
 duty as a Senator of
 the United States in doing
 what I can to prevent
 it That is my idea
 of the duty ofa Senator
 The honorable Senator has not
 favored us with his views
 of the propriety of incurring
 this large expenditure for an
 increase of the Navy in
 the present dccrcpit condition of
 the public credit He has
 contented himself by saying il
 was the recommendation of a
 Democratic Administration Suppose it was
 docs that make it any
 bettor or any worse when
 we come to test its
 real object I know there
 has been a recommendation think
 ofa Democratic Administration alone but
 of formcr Administrations for a
 series of years to increase
 the Navy as a great
 measure of public policy to
 increase it by keepiJ g
 some proportion ate ratio with
 the increase of the naval
 Powers of Europe of France
 and England to increase it
 from the necessity of adding
 to our Navy bc cause
 of the change in that
 arm of the public scr
 Government which hc represents here
 I say to vice from
 sailing to steam vessels I
 do not know hitn that
 is no objection to my
 rnind I arn ner fcct
 ly willing it s fiould
 have that additional fbrce if
 needed e s pccially when
 I an so well defcndcd
 by the reconunendation of a
 Democratic Presi lent year after
 year aided and supported by
 a l mnocratic Senate Mr
 MASON Mr President the honorable
 a foreign vessel enters aird
 we have no power to
 Senator was a little discursive
 in his reply but he
 collect our own revcnue no
 power to enf orcc own
 laws we cannot complain if
 it pays obedi ence to
 precisely sucl i laws as
 it finds thcrc and obeys
 such officers as it meets
 So long as the law
 stands as it does now
 and we admit in poil
 t of fact that we
 have not pov ror to
 enforce our own laws a
 foreign vessel is right in
 paying obedience to such regulations
 as it finds in the
 poi t t o which
 it goes so long as
 it continuos a port of
 entry but when we declare
 that it is no longer
 a port of entry of
 the United States and give
 notice to that efltic t
 then comes the time when
 if foreign vessels un dertake
 to consider it a port
 of the United States they
 become amenable to our laws
 in reference to those subjects
 Sir it was with reference
 to this fact and this
 fact alone that that bill
 was proposed that these i
 people there are availing themselves
 of all the ad vantages
 of being a port of
 the States col has enlightened
 us or culightened me certainly
 that the pressii necessity for
 upon this point the increase
 of the naval force has
 some referencc to the condition
 of things in the seceding
 States It on lightened rne
 that far at least He
 says is there propriety in
 our allowino our naval forde
 to E go int D
 decay as it is now
 getting without in creasing it
 in view of the fact
 that the arsenals navy yards
 fortifications and public property and
 mints c have been seized
 ill those States Sir it
 is not necessary to spell
 the word apple pie to
 know the pie when it
 is before you the Senator
 on his own ground there
 is a view to increase
 the naval armament because of
 the eon dition of things
 in the States that have
 seceded I take it as
 his admission Mr FESSENDEN 1
 have admitted no such thing
 You can take it as
 you like Mr MASON He
 has had a reference to
 the lecting revenue and putting
 it in their own pock
 existiüg condition of things in
 those States Mr FESSENDEN r
 rhe honorable Senator ets while
 they are in fact nobody
 either in the x vi
 l excuse me I said
 that that was no ar
 mu eyes of the United
 States or the world That
 is the simple fact about
 it We are not only
 allow ment for diminishing the
 necessary force Mr MASON Well
 sir Ict the country pass
 ing them to consider tl
 iemselvcs apart of the Uni
 ted States collectino our rovenue
 in point of fact I
 If the honorable Senator undertakes
 to upon it and putting
 it into their ox vn
 pockets but we are ask
 me whom I represent I
 will not ask the hon
 that I ever went against
 that policy within reason able
 limits Although I conae from
 a section of the country
 that has no commerce yet
 have participated as a Senator
 of the United States in
 the duty incumbent upon us
 all to protect the commerce
 of the country and have
 never ro frained from lending
 my aid to any of
 those meas ures of public
 policy although they were to
 op erate more beneficially upon
 other sections of the country
 than that to which I
 belong But at the present
 time in a juncture of
 affairs never before known or
 anticipated in this coun try
 when the Government is dismembered
 when a large portion of
 the territory and of the
 wealth and resources of the
 country has been lopped off
 and the process of disintegration
 is going on to stop
 we know not where when
 that h as had the
 neces sary effect of destroying
 the public credit when I
 Senators who are very soon
 to become the dom inant
 power in the Government decline
 to fix an established course
 of policy when they wikl
 not say whether they will
 go to var or not
 but shadow itout darkly as
 the honorable Senator from Maine
 has done by declaring that
 a state of things may
 arise to make it necessary
 for one sir as a
 con stituent part of the
 public power I will not
 vote a dollar to increase
 the Army or the Navy
 until there is a settled
 policy an established and un
 derstood policy modeled upon the
 new state of things I
 wrant to know the policy
 of this Gov ernment w
 I zether they are to
 go to war with the
 seceding States or not they
 are to allow them peacefully
 to withdraw upon terms to
 bc set tled by negotiation
 or whether we are to
 remain 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 853 here until the 4th
 of March with these purposes
 only darkly shadowed forth as
 was donc by the honorable
 Sena tor from New York
 Mr SEWARD a few days
 ago on presenting a petition
 and as has been done
 by the Senator from Maine
 that there may be a
 slate of things svhen it
 may be necessary to coerce
 The Senator has told us
 he has no fastidious ness
 on the subject no objection
 to expressing his opinion that
 there may be a state
 of things when it may
 be necessary even to coerce
 a State We have that
 policy in that mode shadowed
 out but not avowed Now
 it is time to cstablish
 a policy and let us
 know what is to be
 done Ide sire as a
 Senator of the United States
 that I may know how
 to shape my course in
 relation to other measures of
 public policy but until it
 is done until we know
 whether a civil war is
 to be waged or not
 because of secession I will
 never vote a dollar to
 increase the military arm of
 this Govern ment Mr CLINGMAN
 I move that the Senate
 adjourn l Oh no The
 motiön was not agreed to
 there being on a division
 ayes 13 noes 27 Mr
 KING Mr President I believe
 this meas urc of increasing
 the Navy has been recommended
 to us every year since
 I havc been in the
 Senate and think the same
 number of vessels have been
 recommended Larger There may have
 been more at other times
 I have uniformly voted against
 the proposition to increase the
 Navy be cause I have
 not believed there was any
 necessity for it but treason
 is abroad in this land
 and believe there is an
 occasion and a necessity for
 the increase of the armament
 and power of the country
 N lr POLK If the
 Senator will allow me I
 wi l suggest to him
 that he is under a
 mistake he did vote for
 it at the last session
 Mr KING I think not
 My opinion would be that
 I did not Possibly I
 may havc done so at
 the last session I have
 voted against it re peatedly
 and but for the condition
 of things which exists in
 the country now I would
 not vote for it I
 will vote for it now
 how at the present time
 ever to put the country
 in a condition to defend
 itself against its enemies whether
 they be domes tic or
 foceign enemies Mr President this
 Government cannot be peace ably
 destroyed or overthrown or divided
 Be fore that should bc
 done the sovereigns them selves
 would come hcrc if their
 representatives could prove recreant in
 their defense of it well
 that it should be understood
 that the people of this
 country will never give their
 consent to a peaceable destruction
 and dissolution of it They
 would bc rccr6ant to all
 the high duties which men
 owe to their Maker and
 their country to their race
 to themselves and the high
 trust which the ancestry who
 acquired the country have be
 queathed to them if they
 could entertain a thought of
 its destruction Sir I do
 not believe it can be
 destroyed I would use forbearance
 patience I would extend every
 degree of kindness and make
 every effort for conciliati011 with
 these people but to adxnit
 their right to divide the
 country to takc a State
 out of the Union or
 to destroy it and last
 of all that they should
 peaceably have the right to
 break it up I should
 never agree to i do
 not know what these gentlemen
 consider peace They have armed
 themselves by means which are
 well known to the whole
 country They have illegally taken
 the arms belonging to this
 Government from our arsenals Cabinet
 om cet s and tnembers
 of the Senate have been
 in com plicity in this
 treason A foul and infamous
 plot 1 have no doubt
 has existed to destroy this
 Gov Providence rather than the
 skill or ernment attention of
 the people has arrested it
 and some of the men
 connected with it have been
 driven I believe indict from
 the Cabinet in disgrace ments
 have been foundin this District
 against one of them for
 embezzlement petty larceny grand larceny
 or any other infamous offense
 thata man might commit in
 addition to his treason There
 are gentlemen here who are
 opposed to this appropriation There
 were members of Con gress
 found in the war of
 1812 who voted against supplies
 to the Government to defend
 itself against its enemies It
 is not surprising that there
 should be some such mcn
 found in Congress at any
 time The greatest and widest
 latitude of freedom of opinion
 exists and should exist in
 this country A man has
 a right to talk as
 he pleases He can not
 talk treason in this country
 he must act it but
 Mr President when he acts
 it in my judg menl
 he should take the fate
 of a traitor and he
 should not scck to escape
 it by contending that he
 can do it peacefully against
 his country I cannot perceiv
 e the notion of honor
 that a man can have
 who can conceive that he
 can steal into a house
 partly his own and clandestinely
 and furtively rob it of
 its strength and means of
 defense and then assail it
 and claim that he may
 have the right to do
 so and that they shall
 not pursue him with force
 to punish him for the
 crime he has committed I
 tell these gentlemen in my
 judgment this treason must come
 to an end in my
 judgment peacefully I hope but
 never peacefully by the ignominious
 submission of thc people of
 this country to traitors never
 I desire peace but I
 would amply provide means for
 the defense of the country
 by war if necessary Mr
 GREEN From the beginning of
 this ses Sion I have
 desired to avoid ali discussion
 touch ing these questions until
 every means of adjust ment
 should have been exhausted but
 from the language thrown out
 to day I can hold
 still no longer and intend
 to express my sentiments at
 length To do so however
 I ought to ask the
 Senate to indulge mc until
 to morrow morning I shall
 therefore move to adjourn Oh
 no I The motion was
 not agreed to there being

 Mr HALE If the Senator
 will allow me 1 desire
 to ask him whether there
 is any particu lar necessity
 for him to submit his
 views upon this bill IVIr
 GREEN There is owing to
 the debate thathas sprung up

 consideration of the The bill
 provides that the benefit of

 her hdsband was receiving at
 the t imo he was
 placed on the reserved list
 on furlough pay to tho
 datc of his death deducting
 therefrom what ever amount he
 may have received in the

 act to promote the eff

 February 28 1855 placed on

 by the action of the
 retiring board he memorialized Congress
 for relief but in viex
 v of the subsequent act
 passed January 1857 providing for
 courts of inquiry he determp
 ined to avail himself of
 its provisions and took the
 preliminary steps to avail himself
 of its provi sions and
 employed counsel to conduct his
 case before such court but
 unfortunately before he was able
 to carry his purposes into
 full effect he departed this
 life just anterior to the
 organization of the court A
 keen sense of the assumed
 injustice dono him by the
 retiring board preyed upon the
 spirits of Captain Smoot and
 is believed to have hastened
 the period of his death
 and his widow who deeply
 sharcs in the reproach thus
 as she believes unjustly cast
 upon his memory prays an
 acknowledgment upon the part of
 Congress of his long and
 gallant services and prays that

 MORRIS of Illinois offered the
 following resolution and asked that
 it be referred to the
 Committee on Printing Resolved That
 the Committee on Printing be
 instructed to include in the
 printed report of the Patent
 Office the forms rules and
 regulations of that office necessary
 to be observed in applying
 for patents Mr BURNETT 1
 do not think that that
 res olution goes to the
 Committee on Printing because I
 think it changes existing laws
 Mr MORRIS of Illinois I
 will state to the House
 the object of the resolution
 I presume there is hot
 a u lembcr of this
 House who has not frequently
 been called upon for the
 forms neces sary to be
 observed in applying for patents
 and i they have been
 compelled to write to the
 Patent Offce for them if
 they are printed with the
 agri cultural and mechanic al
 parts of the Patent Offce
 report they can always be
 obtained in every neighborhood because
 those books are distrib uted
 everywhere As a matter of
 convenience these regulations should be
 printed as indicated by the
 resolution Mr PHELPS Is not
 the gentleman from Illi nois
 aware that whenever the Commissioner
 of Patents is applied to
 for a copy of those
 regula tions he forwards them
 without any extra ex pense
 Mr MORRIS of Illinois That
 is very truc Mr PHELPS
 Why then print them Mr
 MORRIS of Illinois If these
 forms were to be found
 in the Patent Office reports
 which are scattered cverywhere through
 the country they could easily
 be obtained by all persons
 who desire them without being
 compelled to apply to anybody
 Sometimes persons at great inconve
 nience are oblicred go ten
 fifteen or twenty miles to
 see somebody who is familiar
 with the business of the
 Paten t Offce 1 have
 received various letters u pon
 this subject and have received
 numerous applications for these forms
 and it does seem to
 me that inasmuch as the
 cost will be small and
 the value of the reports
 will not be diminished thereby
 these forms ought to be
 pub lisl ed in the
 back part of the book
 Mr PHELPS As the matter
 of printing a document is
 not beforc the House I
 move that the resolution be
 referred to the Committee on
 Printing It was so referred

 Whereas the Gulf States have

 that involves or Inay involve
 a sacrifice of principle or

 for the General Govermnent to

 discuss the resolution it was
 laid on the table under
 the rule WASHINGTON S BIRTHDAY
 Mr SICKLES introduced the following
 reso lution and called the
 previous question upon the same
 Whereas it has become cxpedlent
 to revive that spirit or
 amity and that mutual dc
 érence and concession wl ieh
 in the fonna ion of
 our Government overcame an the
 ob stacles arising out of
 the difference among the several
 States as to their situation
 extent habits and political in
 terests and established onr Union
 upon the sure founda tions
 of fraternal affection and the
 common welfare There fore Resoh
 ed That it be earnestly
 recomrnendcd to the people of
 the United States to celebrate
 the 22d day of February
 in stant as a national
 holiday in cotnmmnoration ofthe birth
 the exalted character the incomparable
 public services and the patriotism
 of George Washington the first
 President of the United States
 that the Speaker be requested
 to invite Hon Edward Everett
 to deliver an oration on
 that day in the of
 the i louse of Represontatives
 and furtherlnore that the Speaker
 do order and direct suitable
 arrangexnents to be rnadc for
 the occasion Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois 1 propose to debate
 that resolution 855 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE The SPEAKER The
 gentleman from New York has
 called the previous question upon
 the resolution Mr GARNETT 1
 desire to debate that rcs
 olution unless the gentleman will
 consent to an amendment Mr
 SICKLES 1 will hear the
 amendment The SPEAKER The gentleman
 from New York has demanded
 the previous question Mr GARNETT
 How did the gentleman get
 the floor to demand the
 previous question Ün der the
 rules if any gentleman desires
 to debate a resolution it
 must lie over The SPEAKER
 The Chair thinks gen tleman
 from Virginia is under a
 misapprehension If a gentleman offers
 a resolution and demands the
 previous question upon it and
 the previous question is sustained
 that shuts off debate and
 he is entitled to have
 a vote That is the
 practice of the Elouse that
 is the rule I believe
 I Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 proposed to debate that resolution
 before the pre vious question
 was called The SPEAKER Yes
 sir but the gentleman from
 New York had the floor
 Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois Then
 hope the previous question will
 not be seconded so that
 the resolution may be open
 for debate Mr BOCOCK 1
 ask for tellers on ordering
 the main question Mr GARNETT
 1 desire to say with
 the leave of the gentleman
 from New York that I
 do not object to the
 resolution but I wish to
 insert after the name of
 George Washington t words the
 illustrious Virginian and slavehold Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE in his seat
 And emancipationist Mr SICKLES And
 patriot The SPEAKER The will
 not v be read T
 hc question will be upon
 second ing the demand for
 the previous question The resolution
 was tuyain read The SPEAKER
 ordered tellers on thc den
 mod for the previous question
 and ap pointed Messrs BRIGGS
 and BURNHAM as tellers Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 wish to
 make a suggestion to my
 colleacrue Mr SICKLES I will
 hear my colleague Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE My suggestion is in
 order to strengthen the resolu_tion
 which shall vote for in
 any event that the resolution
 close with the words United
 States and omit that part
 which invites the Hon Edward
 Everett I trust that he
 will limit to dcliver an
 address it to a recommendation
 that the citizens of the
 United States keep the 22d
 of February as a na
 tional holiday Mr SICKLES I
 will accept that modifica tion
 and now I insist upon
 the demand for the previous
 question Mr HINDMAN 1 suggest
 that in lieu of a
 public address Mr Everett be
 requested to furnish his remarks
 to the New York Ledger
 Laughter Mr WI IITELEY Would
 it not be well to
 amend the resolution so as
 to ask somebody to Renewed
 Sing the Star spangled Banner
 laughter Mr CRAIGE ofNorth Carolina
 Irise to a question of
 order I believe that if
 a resolution is either debated
 or proposed to be debat
 ed it lies over Now
 gentlemen have already engaged in
 debate and therefore the resolution
 must lie over The SPEAKER
 The gentleman from North Carolina
 will pardon me I am
 satisfied that I am right
 under the rules If n
 gentleman demands the previous question
 and it is sustained cuts
 off debate and he is
 entitled to have a vote
 Mr CRAIGE of North Carolina
 That is not the point
 The point I made was
 that although the gentleman called
 the previous question he permitted
 his colleague Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 to debate the resolution and
 thereby it goes over The
 SPEAKER The Chair did not
 regard it in tl lat
 way The resolution as modified
 was then read Mr WASHBURNE
 0f Illinois 1 withdraw objection
 to the resolution as it
 now stands Mr BURNETT There
 can be no objection to
 the resolution as it now
 st ands We generally observe
 that day anyhow in this
 country The SPEAKER If therc
 is no objection to the
 resolution tellers will not be
 ordered The resolution was agreed

 following Resolved That the Secretary
 ofthc Treasury be requested to

 is seeking for information to
 accept an additional resolution also

 LOVEjOY I hope there will
 be no ob It is
 recommended in the Presi jection
 to that dent s message
 Mr P EIELPS we have
 no more right to vote

 the people or govertnncnts of
 the non slaveholding States have
 a purpose or a constitutional
 right to legislate upÖ11 or
 in teriOre with slavery in
 any of thc States of
 the Jnion Resoh ed That
 those persons in the North
 who do not subscribe to
 the foregoing propositions are t
 oo insignificant in nutnbet s
 or influence to excite the
 serious attention or alarrn of
 any portion of the people
 of the Republic and that
 the increase in their nullibcrs
 aud influence does not keep

 the amrreaate population of the
 Union Mr BRANCH Are those

 Messrs Barr Phelps Scott and
 Woodson 4 So the resolution
 was agreed to During the
 roll call the following proceedings
 took place Mr WINSLOW 1
 ask the mover of the
 olution to strike out two
 words in it Mr BOTELER
 can we not divide the
 first resolution The SPEAKER The
 House is voting on the
 first resolution Mr BRANCH I
 hope the whole resolutions will
 be allowed to be read
 again without any gen tleman
 interposinc Mr BOTELER What I
 desire to know is whether
 it is in order to
 divide the first resolu tion
 so as to take a
 separate vote in regard to
 the purpose of the North
 and the constitutional right of
 the North The SPEAKER The
 gentleman from Vir ginia will
 understand that there have been
 several responses The House has
 commenced voting and cannot now
 stop for any purpose Mr
 HINDMAN 1 rise to ask
 a question Calis to order
 It is perfectly immatenal to
 me whether gentlemen object or
 not I intend to ex
 press my views coniinued calls
 to order with out any
 regard to interru tions I
 rise to ask a Order
 Order question of the Chair
 hope that disorderly persons will
 be expel ed from the
 Hall or else required to
 deport thcm selves like gentlemen
 which they are not I
 arose to ask the Speaker
 a question The SPEAKER The
 entitled to ask the Chair
 n question Mr GROW Not
 during the roll call Mr
 HINDMAN That is what presumed
 I hope that will be
 satisfactory to those indi viduals
 who did not know it
 before division of theq tcstion
 so that we may vote
 first on the question raised
 by the resolution as to
 the right of the Federal
 Government to inter ferc with
 slavery in the States and
 second as to the purpose
 of the people of the
 non siaveholding States My object
 In asking that is this
 that the resolution while asserting
 a correct principle as as
 to the purpose of the
 non slaveholding States It thus
 which man v of us
 believe to be untrue puts
 us In a false position
 or is intended to do
 so The SPEAKER that after
 responses have been made no
 division is in order The
 Clerk will proceed to cait
 the roll The Cierl resumed
 the calling of the roll
 Mr BURNETT 1 rise to
 inquiry of understand a division
 of the resoiu the Chair
 tions to be calle l
 for The SPEAKER They are
 856 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 11 BURNETT A division was
 called for and divided the
 first and second resolu tions
 We certainly had a right
 to a division of the
 whole series of resolutions Now
 I would stultify myself by
 voting for this resolution I
 can vote that the people
 of the non slaveholding States
 have no right to iriterfere
 vith slavery but it would
 be stating what is false
 to say that they had
 no purpose to interfere with
 slavery in the slave States
 The SPEAKER The Clerk will
 call the roll Mf SICKLES
 May ask my colleague for
 permision o make asuggestion Cries
 of No Call the roll
 There is a mistake and
 gn important one in the
 resolution Calls to 6 Order
 VAN YCK 1 object to
 any interrup tion of the
 vote Mr BOCOCK when his
 name was called said I
 ask to be excused from
 voting on this resolution V
 will not take up time
 to give my reasons Mr
 BRABSON when his name was
 called said I cannot vote
 as to the intention of
 the Re publicans but I
 vote ay on that part
 of the resolution denying the
 power of the Government to
 interfere with slavery in the
 States The SPEAKER Does the
 gentleman vote Mr BRABSON 1
 vote ay Mr BURCH when
 his name was called said
 I desire to state Mr
 GROW I rise to a
 point of order The SPEAKER
 No debate can be allowed
 during the roll call Mr
 HINDMAN Why should not the
 tleman from California be allowed
 to nake an explanation as
 well as the gentleman from
 Tennes see Mr BRABSON I
 suppose he was allowed to
 speak because hc was known
 to occupy a posi tion
 different from that of most
 of us on this side
 It is well known what
 his position is that hc
 is one of the submissionist
 party of the South Mr
 BRABSON If the gentleman from
 Ark ansas says that I
 am a submissionist I tell
 him that he is mistaken
 Mr I IINDMAN I ask
 the gentleman if he is
 not in favor of submitting
 Mr BRABSON I will never
 submit to any thing that
 is wrong never Mr BURCH
 I subscribe to thät portion
 of the resolution which declares
 there is no power 01
 right in any of the
 northern States orin the Gen
 era Government to disturb abolish
 or interfere with slavery in
 the slave States Crics of
 Or But not being willing
 to vouch for the opinions
 and desires of the people
 of Massachu setts or any
 other northern State that my
 own I decline to vote
 Cries of Order Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE when his name was
 called said The resolution expresses
 only a universuily conceded principle
 and therefore I declinc to
 vote Mr HINDMAN I ask
 to bc excused from votincr
 Cries of Then because the
 latter part of tl 10
 resolut ion asserts a false
 hood I refuse to vote
 Mr QUARLES stated that Mr
 LEACH of North Carolina was
 confined to his room by
 in disposition Mr MALLORY when
 his namc was called said
 As I Ljelicve that to
 be the scntimcnt of a
 majority of thc people of
 the northern States I vote
 ay Cries of Good I
 simply ex press my opinion
 in doing that Mr MAYNARD
 when his name was called
 said I believe in a
 port ion of tho resolution
 and I hope that the
 rest of it is truc
 Still gentlemen from the non
 slaveholding States ought not to
 ex pect us from the
 slaveholding States to vote on
 that part of the resolution
 which is simply ex pressive
 of their purpose Nobody is
 more grat ified than um
 at the evidence on that
 point given by the votes
 of the other side I
 hail iL as a most
 auspicious omen I decline to
 vote Mr MCCLERNAND when his
 name was called said Understanding
 that the word peo where
 it first occurs in the
 resolution to mean the whole
 people ofa State and not
 any party or portion of
 the people thereof and that
 t he word States where
 it last occurs means slaveholding
 States understanding this to be
 the meaning and effi ct
 of the resolution I vote
 for it protesting however al
 the same time against the
 expression of any opinion on
 my part to the purpose
 of any anti slavcry organization
 of the North Mr NIBLACK
 stated that his colleague Mr
 Davrs was confined to his
 room by indisposition He Mr
 N declined to vote Mr
 PHELPS when his name was
 called said The resolution amrms
 the purpose of the people
 of the non slaveholding States
 not to interfere with slavery
 in the States If this
 be true I am glad
 of it but I cannot
 declare what their purpose is
 The resolution furthermore declares the
 non slavehold ing States have
 no right to legislate concerning
 slavery This proposition I deny
 New York has the right
 to establish or prohibit slavery
 within her limits The non
 slaveholding States have the right
 as did New York and
 Pennsylvania in former years to
 protect the property in slaves
 of sojourners in these States
 for a limited period of
 time I can not vote
 for a resolution denying such
 a right I vote in
 the negative Mr QUARLES when
 his name was called said
 Mr Speaker I fully concur
 in that portion of this
 resolution which denies to the
 General Gov ernment or to
 the people of the northern
 States the right to interfere
 with the institu tion of
 slavery in the southern States
 But what are the purposes
 of the northern peo ple
 I am not suffciently informed
 to say I hope it
 may be true sir that
 they do not intend to
 interfere with slavery in the
 southern States and that gentlemen
 from the North on this
 floor as well as the
 people of the North will
 soon evi dence that intention
 by adopting some measures of
 fair and honorable compromise I
 respectfully ask to be excused
 from voting sir Mr RUFFIN
 when his name wascalled said
 Entertaining a profound contempt for
 all such po litical trickery
 and not beirp disposed to
 swal low a gilded pill
 I respectfulty decline to vote
 Mr SCOTT when his name
 was called said As I
 believe tho object of the
 Republican party to be the
 exclusion of slavery I vote
 no Nit STOUT when his
 nume was culled said I
 shali vote for the rcsolution
 and believe it ex presses
 thc unanimous voice of my
 people was not true disunion
 would not only be justi
 fiabke but necessary Mr VANCE
 asked to be and was
 excused from voting Mr NV
 ERY when his name was
 called said As we v
 rerc not allowed in taking
 this vote to separate a
 question of fact from the
 assertion of a political principle
 and as I could not
 vote either thc one way
 or the other without self
 stultifica lion I decline to
 vote IVIr COX I vote
 for that part of the
 resolu tion which denies the
 right to interfere with sla
 very in thc States Cries
 o Order As to the
 purpose of thc northern people
 thus to inter fere I
 believe the hitherto controlling portion
 of the dominant portion of
 the North had the pur
 pose thus to interfere but
 that the majority of the
 pcoplc North have no such
 purpose now Cries of Order
 If they ever had they
 are cured of it Record

 Virginia I wish to state
 that I voted for the
 resolution without hearino it read
 Sirlce hearing it read however
 I will with draw my

 PENDLETON whose name has just
 been called has been suddenly
 cailed home by the illness
 of his father and has
 paired off with my other
 colleague Mr STANTON Intending myself
 to vote for thc Adams
 ame ndment a practical measure
 I de cline to vote
 for this abstract resolution with
 a double meanincr Mr STANTON
 It is true that 1
 with my colleague Mr PENDLETON
 but I had voted in
 the affirmative supposing Mr PENDLETON
 would so vote if he
 werc here If my colleagues
 on the other side of
 the House think otherwise I
 will withdraw my vote Mr
 NOELL I am glad to
 scc the Republican members of
 this House very generally voting
 for this proposition and I
 accept it as a very
 indication of good feeling upon
 their part Not fieling informed
 upon the subject myself however
 as to the intention of
 the North I respectfully decline
 to vote Mr WOODSON I
 desire to say that there
 is a fact stated in
 that resolution on which I
 am un informed f therefore
 vote no Mr TRAIN stated
 that he had paired with
 Mr KUNKEL Mr BARR I
 voted for the resolution but
 understanding that there is a
 difference of opinion amoncr mcmbors
 as to what the meaning
 of it is I will
 withdraw my vote Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE r ask permission to
 say that understanding the object
 of this res olution is
 to express the opinion that
 there is no purpose on
 the part of the non
 slaveholding Statos to interfere with
 slavery as it exists and
 accept ing the unanimous vote
 of the gentlemen upon the
 other side of the House
 as an indication that their
 purpose is not to interfere
 with it I vole Mr
 FARNSWORTH Understandingtheres olution to assort
 that we have no right
 to interfere with slavery where
 it exists in the States
 I vote Mr JENKINS Believing
 the fact asserted in the
 resolution to be untrue and
 the principle asserted to bc
 true I decline to vote
 upon the res Olu tion
 Mr LEAK E I rise
 toa personal explanation Mr VAN
 WYCK 1 object Mr LEAK
 E I want to know
 why it is that gentlemen
 upon the other side of
 the House are permitted to
 explain and gentlemen on this
 Sidc are not permitted to
 explain The SPEAKER The Chair
 is required to arrest debate
 during the roll call if
 objection is made Mr LEAKE
 well sir 1 desire to
 know then why the rule
 is not applied to others
 Mr Speaker I decline to
 v ote upon this proposition
 for the reason that it
 places us in the position
 of voting for a staterncnt
 of fact which we know
 to be untrue or of
 votin F acainst a principle
 Which we know to be
 true I believe it was
 designed by the gentleman who
 introduced it to place us
 upon this side in a
 false position and I decline
 to vote upon it The
 SPEAKER then announced that 106
 gen t cmen had voted
 for the resolution and 4
 against it und that no
 quorum had voted Cries of
 Call the roll Mr PETTIT
 1 rise to a of
 order I addressed the Chair
 before he had announced tho
 vote dcsirino to vote and
 I insist that I have
 the right to vote The
 SPEAKER vvith that statementoffact the
 gentleman has the right to
 vote Mr BURNETT 1 of
 order I submit that after
 the Chair had announced that
 106 had voted in the
 affirmative and 4 in the
 neg ative and that no
 quorum had voted the gentle
 man from Indiana has no
 right to vote The SPEAKER
 The Chair decides that the
 gentleman from Indiana has a
 right to vote Mr SICKLES
 The ambiguity of the reso
 lution is the reason why
 a quorum does not vote
 Cries of The SPEAKER The
 gentleman is not in order
 The gentleman from Indiana has
 thc right to vote Mr
 SICKLES 1 hope my colleague
 will modify his rcsoluliou so
 as to make his meaninm
 clear and then I presume
 there will be no diffl
 cult y about a quorum
 Mr LEAKE 1 rise to
 of order 1 submit that
 after the vote has been
 announced it is not in
 ordcr to receive the vote
 of any gentle man who
 has not voted The SPEAKER
 The Chair has already de
 cided that the gentleman from
 Indiana has the right to
 vote Mr LEAKE well the
 Chair decided wrong and I
 take an appeal from his
 decision Mr CURTIS 1 rise
 to a point of order
 Mr PETTIT I rise to
 a question of order I
 was upon the floor addressing
 the Chair for the purpose
 of voting The Chair had
 no right to make any
 announcement that should cut off
 my vote and therefore I
 submit that no announce ment
 has been made of the
 vote Mr LEAK E have
 taken an appeal from the
 decision of the Chair The
 SPEAKER The Chair decides that
 it is not competent for
 any gentleman to take an
 ap peal from the decision
 of the Chair during the
 call of the roll and
 he will not therefore entertain
 the appeal He makes the
 decision upon his own responsi
 bility subject to the censure

 P 13 and Ilenry Gratiot
 what amount if any of
 rent was cxactcd by the

 Iliiucs from David G Bates
 for lead mined and stneltcd
 upon the lands of tbc
 Ottawa Pottawatomie Chippewa Winnebago or
 other tribes of Indians prior

 the United States to the
 icgal represcnt four hundred and
 thirty one pounds of lead
 as rept prior to the

 tbc charge f0r convertina re
 fined buliion into coins shall
 not exceed one fifth of
 one per cent The Committee
 of Ways and Means recom
 mended a non concurrence Mr
 BURCH I hope the House
 will concur in this amendment
 It was adopted in the
 Senate I believe without opposition
 Our charges at this time
 one half of one per
 cent for coining refined gold
 l he consequence is that
 it drives 50 000 000
 out of the United States
 to for eicrn countries for
 the purpose of coinage I
 believe that in the history
 of the world no Govcrnmcnt
 but has charged anything for
 coinaøe 1 should like to
 know the reason why the
 Commit tee of MT ays
 and Means recommend a non
 concur rcnce in this amendment
 Mr SHERMAN The amendment is
 very important and if adopted
 by the I louse will
 rev olutionize the operations of
 our mints Under the present
 law about six tenths of
 one per cent is charged
 for refining gold This amendment
 pro poses to reduce that
 charge to two tenths which
 would be a reduction of
 over four hundred thou sand
 dollars and an appropriation of
 at least that amount would
 be required to make up
 the defi clency But the
 first clause of this amendment
 proposes virtually to give a
 monopoly to one man in
 Cali fornia of this process
 of refilling gold A few
 years a law was passed
 that whcn private establishments in
 the city of Philadelphia under
 assay offce in New York
 and tranSferthis whole process of
 refining gold from the mints
 to a single man because
 there is only one refiner
 of gold in the United
 States The amendment is very
 im portant and I do
 not think it was carefully
 con sidered by the Senate
 I have looked over the
 debates and I find that
 it was not discussed at
 all The amendment passcd the
 Senate sub silent io and
 the House ought norto concur
 in it without serious consideration
 Mr B JRCH I have
 no wish to build up
 a monopoly of any business
 nor do I think that
 will be the effect of
 this amendment We have more
 than one refiner in California
 I know that while we
 have many assay offices parties
 are obliged to send their
 bars of gold to England
 and other countries and pay
 frexght upon them to have
 them coined because of the
 enormous charges of the Government
 and after paying freight thereby
 save a large amount T
 be gen Ileman knows that
 it drives 50 000 000
 of bullion annually out of
 this country for coinage My
 honest opinion is that if
 this amendment should bc adopted
 thereby enabling our own mints
 to do all the coinage
 of bullion collected in our
 coun try it woul produce
 a larger amount of revenue
 from the mints than the
 Government now derives That is
 my impression in regard to
 it I pre sented to
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means sta tistics showing that
 such would be the effect
 of the a nendmcnt Mr
 SHERMAN I will state that
 we not only read ail
 that the gentleman presented to
 us but we crave an
 interview to the gentleman who
 is interested in this matter
 and heard him pa tientlv
 and we unanimously came to
 the conclu Sion that the
 amendment ought not to be
 concurred in Mr BURCH The
 gentleman does me injus tice
 when he says that this
 amendment is for the benefit
 of one house in California
 I do not be licve
 that that is its purpose
 It is recommended bv thc
 Su crintendent of the Mint
 at Philadel pliia in a
 ctter which I laid before
 the Commit it is the
 disposition of the If however
 House to dcfcat thc amendment
 of course it will have
 to cro to a committee
 of confcrence but it does
 seem to me that it
 would be to the advan
 tage of the Government for
 us to adopt it The
 Committee of Ways and Means
 I know is all powerful
 herc and that it is
 almost impos Sible to overcome
 their opposition but when I
 think they from a want
 of interest in the subject
 matter have overlooked the true
 interest of the Government and
 have wholly disregarded the interests
 of my constituents I hold
 it to be my duty
 to oppose even so formidable
 and influential gentlemen as compose
 that committee Mr MILLSON 1
 should like to know what
 obligation there is on the
 part of the people of
 the United States to coin
 money at their own expense
 for the benefit of those
 who extract the ore from
 the mines To concur in
 this amendment of the Senate
 would be to takca retrograde
 step Some years ago the
 Government attempted to charge seigniorage
 The present charge forcoiningmoney does
 not equal the expenses The
 one half per cent does
 not reimburse the Government its
 act ual expenses in coining
 and now the proposition is
 to reduce that charge of
 One half of one per
 cent to onc fifth of
 one per cent f would
 like to ask the gentle
 Mr BURCH man from Virginia
 whether if the effect of
 charg ing this one half
 of one per cent is
 to send to for eign
 countries for coinage year and
 if the reduction of the
 charge to one fifth of
 one percent were to keep
 that sum to be coined
 here the Government would not
 be benefited by the chancre
 Mr MILLSON By no means
 The Govern ment would be
 overwhelmed with the work of
 coinage if some of the
 gold did not go in
 bullion tofor6ign countries We novv
 export about eighty million dollars
 a year and now let
 gentlemen con ceive the effect
 of adding that surn annually
 to the existinff circulation of
 the country This gold must
 be exported We are a
 gold producing coun try W
 c produce gold for cxpor
 tation If the Government of
 the United States took the
 process of refining gold the
 Secretary oc is to be
 called upon to coin this
 80 000 000 addi tional
 why should it be expected
 to do so at its
 the r l reasury igh
 t with drawt that operation
 from Ililis amcndlnent proposes to
 extend own expense The Government
 of the United the IVY
 int that law to California
 and to all the cities
 in Slatesowns alargenumberof valuablc gold
 mines in California The whole
 of the gold contained Line
 seventeen after the word expenses
 strike out Union rl he
 effect of it would bo
 to destroy the 860 in
 them belongs to the Government
 That gold the people of
 California appropriate to themselves They
 take as I understand 80
 000 000 from the public
 treasure without accounting for it
 and they actually expect and
 require that the Gov ernment
 shall at its own expense
 coin this gold into money
 Now I think that when
 they are only charged one
 half of one per cent
 for con verting their gold
 into coin they may consider
 that they are very indulgently
 dealt with by the Government
 of the United States But
 the gentleman from California says
 that other national Governments coin
 money at their I would
 suggest to him that with
 own expense the exception of
 England we are the only
 gold producing country to any
 extent in the world The
 coinage of the other European
 nations is very small and
 for reasons of their own
 they can very well afford
 to coin moncy without charge
 Some years ago at the
 instance 1 think of my
 colleague in the Senate Mr
 HUNTER the Government undertook to
 demand a seigniorage of one
 half of one per cent
 supposing that that would be
 a remuneration of the actual
 expenses It turns out however
 to be less and yet
 there has been no proposition
 to increase the rate although
 I did last year make
 some inquiries with a view
 of so altering the present
 law as to reimburse the
 Government fully But now we
 are asked to coin this
 gold at the rate of
 one fifth of one per
 cent instead of one half
 of one per cent and
 for the sole reason that
 my friend from California says
 the gold is now sent
 out of the country What
 would be the effect of
 it If we were now
 to coin at our own
 expense all the gold extracted
 or which would be equivalent
 charge only one fifth of
 one per cent the result
 would be that we should
 convert this gold bullion into
 coin to be recoined abroad
 and that all the ex
 pense would be thrown upon
 the Government of the United
 States for nothmg I hope
 the House wili refuse to
 concur in the amendment of
 the Senate Mr BURCH I
 think it was improper for
 the chairman of the Committee
 of ways and Means to
 charge a disposition on the
 part of the support ers
 of this proposition in the
 Scnatc or elsewrhere to build
 up a monopoly at the
 expense of the Gov I
 desire to say to him
 and through ern men t
 him to the House that
 I was not aware of
 this amendrnent being ofl et
 cd until the amendments wcre
 referred to the Committee of
 Ways and Means The gentleman
 may remember that one of
 thc Senators from California and
 myself called upon him That
 was the first information I
 had in regard to the
 amendment The refining of gold
 by the mints of the
 United States is attended with
 rreat loss to the Government
 and ever will be This
 amendment saves in this respect
 much to the Government and
 if this should drive refinincr
 into private refineries the Government
 should 110t since it is
 fbr t hc advantage of
 the miner It is known
 to the members of this
 I louse that a large
 majority of the people of
 California arc enfragod in gold
 diggitp I hey have gone
 there from every State in
 the Union They are a
 con glomerated mass of citizens
 from all the States Many
 of lhcnl are representatives of
 the State of thc chairman
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Means and many of
 them come from the State
 represented by the gentleman who
 has just taken his seat
 Mr ILK soN I hey
 come from every State in
 the Union The gentleman from
 Virginia spoke of the at
 tempt to impose the tax
 known as seignioraTe upon the
 miners of California but that
 attempt failed and the tax
 never became a law The
 first and I am happy
 to say only Republican Senator
 from that State of California
 I believe also pro posed
 such a kaw and no
 one measure of legisla tion
 ever produced so much indignation
 in the State of California
 as that The gentleman from
 Virginia also stated that these
 Ininerals belonged to the General
 Government That however is a
 mooted question It arises out
 of the old legal maxim
 that the minerals belonged to
 the sover eign because the
 sovereign alone could exercise the
 right of coina re Now
 there is a question and
 it has prcsen tcd itself
 here this Congress as to
 M ho is sovereign whether
 it is the State or
 the General Government Gentlemen here
 do not acree as to
 which they owe allegiance to
 Many have left us who
 claim that the State government
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 11 is
 sovereign and that it has
 a right to the exer
 cise f sovereignty in many
 other regards as well as
 to exercise control over these
 mines But the question has
 never been yet brought to
 a position where it could
 be finally determined Mr Speaker
 I would not be performing
 my full duty to the
 people of California if I
 allowed this amendment to be
 passed upon without saying a
 word in its favor and
 hence I felt it my
 duty to call the attention
 of the House to it
 If the chair man of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means can give such reasons
 as will satisfy the House
 that it should not concur
 with the Senate in this
 amend ment well and good
 This tax fedls upon every
 individual miner in the State
 My honest impres Sion is
 that if the Government will
 coin all the bullion itself
 thereby keeping this 50 000
 000 which is annually sent
 to foreign countries for coinage
 it can do so at
 the proposed rate of one
 fifth of one per cent
 at as little loss as
 it now incurs at one
 half of one per cent
 I hope there fore that
 the House will concur in
 this amend ment of the
 Senate which I believe has
 for its object a real
 saving to the Government and
 an encouragement of the honest
 industry of those who are
 engaged in the development of
 the hidden treasures of our
 State against which I sincerely
 hope there is no objection
 The question was taken and
 the amendment was non concurred

 EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION The SPEAKER laid
 before the House a com
 munication from the acting Secretary
 of the In tcrior transmitting
 the report of the wa
 yon road expedition under Coloncl
 F W Lander which was
 referred to the Committee of
 Ways and Mcans and ordered
 to bc printed AARON H
 PALMER Mr TAPPAN I ask
 the unanimous consent of the
 House to take up and
 put on its passage Senate
 bill No 11 for the
 relief of Aaron H Palmer
 Mr CRAIG of Missouri 1
 object Mr TAPPAN I move
 to suspend the rules The
 bill was read It appropriates
 3 000 to Aaron H
 Palmer in full compensation for
 his labor and research in
 collecting information and preparing the
 same for the use of
 the Govern ment relative to
 the oriental nations and partic
 ularly Japan The report was
 read from which it appears
 that the petitioner has on
 various occasions be t veen
 the years 1846 and 1851
 addressed inter esting and valuable
 communications on the sub ject
 to the House of Representatives
 and to three Presidents and
 Secretaries of State which have
 been printed as valuable public
 documents and are generally considered
 as important contribu tions to
 our knowledge of several of
 the compar atively unknown maritime
 nations of the Last particularly
 Japan and have proved of
 high in tcrcst and value
 to our Government in opening
 and extending our commercial relations
 with several of those eastern
 countries Among those contributions Of
 Mr Palmer his plan for
 opening Japan submitted by him
 to the Secretary of State
 on the 17th of September
 1849 which met with the
 Secretary s entire ap proval
 appears to have been subsequently
 adopted as the basis of
 the policy of our Government
 in the expedition and mission
 to the ruler of that
 empire so successfully accomplished by
 Com modorc Perry in accordance
 it would seem with the
 leading views suggestions and recommenda
 tions contained therein Mr Palmer
 between 1842 and 1853 addressed
 a series of letters communications
 and contribu lions including copies
 of his printed documents to
 high functionaries in Japan having
 for their object the opening
 of that empire to American
 in tercourse and commerce and
 which he has trans mitted
 from time to time during
 the aforetnen tioned periods to
 Nagasaki through the only safe
 and reliable channels of communicatincr
 with that secluded and mysterious
 empire It rnay reason ably
 be presumed these have had
 important in fluence and agency
 at that court in preparing
 the l vay for the
 successful result of Commodore Perry
 s mission Mr Palmer it
 appears has also printed at
 different times two thousand two
 hundred and fifty copies of
 his memoirs at his owrn
 expense fordistribution to Senators members
 of Congress and exccutivc offcers
 of the Government that at
 the request of several Senators
 he prepared a large outline
 map to illustrate his memoirs
 on Siberia c printed by
 order of the Senate in
 1848 and in consequence of
 the delay at the time
 in the printing of the
 Senate documents he claims compensation
 for nine months services in
 which he was necessarily detained
 during that year in the
 preparation of the map and
 correcting the proof sheets of
 the usual as wellas extra
 numbers of copies of said
 memoir ordered by the Senate
 and also for four months
 services in preparing a report
 illustrated by a special chart
 for the Sec 1861 retary
 of State under a resolution
 of the Senate of the
 16th January 1850 In view
 of the highly meritorious and
 valuable services thus rendered by
 Mr Palmer and their important
 results in preparing the way
 for open ing new marts
 in the East to our
 commerce the committee have come
 to the conclusion that he
 is justly entitled to 3
 000 in compensation for stich
 services and expenses Mr STANTON
 1 wish to know if
 this was not in the
 employment of the Government at
 some compensation during this time
 Mr TAPPAN He not Mr
 STANTON yvell 1 never knew
 any body worked that long
 for the Government before without
 being paid The rules were
 suspended two thirds having voted
 therefor The biil was then
 ordered to a third reading
 and was accordingly read the
 third time and passed Mr
 TAPPAN moved to reconsider the
 vote by which the bill
 was passed and also moved
 to lay the motion to
 reconsider on the table The
 latter motion was agreed to

 object Mr STOUT I move
 to suspend the rules Before

 the motion however I ask
 the permission of the House
 to say that I have

 will give me a hearinÜ
 upon this Inattel and if
 the claim is just that
 it shall be allowed I
 do not ask for the
 consideration of the bill to
 day I only ask that
 it may be assigocd as

 day when its merits can
 be fully canvassed and I
 trust I will be able

 so much confusion it is

 to have it fixed for
 some particular day so that
 it may be considered during
 the present I am especially
 desirous that it shall be
 session BO considered not only
 on account of its import
 ance to the people of

 a great deal of time
 in investigating it They have
 made their report and unless
 the Housc fix a time
 for i_ts considerotion it will
 not be acted on this

 Jidoptcd January 22 1861 1
 Resolvcd I hat one of
 the vital and necessary principles
 which tor n the basis
 of all free governments is
 Lhat the constitutional Inajority nust
 always rule and thercfore the
 right of the people of
 any State to withdraw from
 the Union thereby hazarding the
 liberties and happiness the rniilions
 coznposing this Confédcracy can never
 be ac knowlcdæcd by us
 tinder any circuln stance s
 We regard seccssion upon the
 part ot any State as
 alnounting directly to revolution and
 precipitating civil war with all
 its sad train of consequences
 2 Resolved I hat the
 people of the State of
 Minnesota reiterate their unalterable devotion
 to the Constitution of t
 hc United States and that
 if its provisions are strictly
 ob served it will in

 the United States at a
 general clcctiou i uily and
 creel y participated in on
 the sallie lay by the
 people of every State of
 the Union South as well
 as North any attempt to
 dissolve or destroy Union ac
 count thereof is without exeusc
 or justification and should receive
 the cundeonnation of every patriot
 in the lav d 4
 Resolved I hat we have
 beard with astonislnncnt and indignation
 of t he recent outrages
 pevpetrat ed at Iharles ton
 South Carolina by firing upon
 nn Aincrican stetuner sailing under
 the flag of our country
 and that we expect of
 the G cue ral Governtnent
 the strongest and tnost vigorous

 and tn check the work
 ot rebellion and itnpressed wit
 h our duty to treason
 make every possible eiiÖrt to
 uphold the Ilion and to
 Inain tain the authoritv of
 the General Govet nnuent if
 e hereby tender to the
 Prcsi lcnt of the United
 States tar that Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 have no objection to
 their being read but as
 to their being printed I
 have word to say Petitions
 are not printed These resolutions
 are not addressed to the
 Sen at e There is
 no request even to lay
 them be fore the Senate
 I think that was the
 rule laid down on a
 former occasion Mr WILKINSON They
 are the resolutions of the
 State of Minnesota passed in
 the Legisla ture and one
 of the resolutions directs that
 they be sent to the
 Senators and Representatives in Congress
 I take it for granted
 that under the decision which
 has been made heretofore it
 would be inferred at least
 that they should be presented
 to this body Mr COLLAMER
 1 believe it has been
 the universal practice to print
 resolutions of a State Legislature
 Mr CRITTENDEN no objection to
 whatever has been the practice
 I only note the fact
 that this paper is not
 addressed to the Senate that
 objections may not hereafter be
 made on that score Mr
 TRUMBULL The resolutions ofStates have
 always been nrinted without objection
 Mr CRIT DENbEN 1 say
 no objec tion Mr TRUMBULL
 And never before was a
 question raised since I have
 been in the body that
 the resolutions of a State
 had to come in the
 form ofa petition States send
 their resolutions here often instructing
 their Senators what to do
 Mr CRITTENDEN It was insisted
 on here upon a former
 occasion that these proceedings should
 be directed to the Senate
 Mr FITCH Tile Senator from
 Illinois is mis ta ken
 It is not usual to
 print memorials of State Legislatures
 or any other source directed
 to in dividuats Il hese
 are not addressed to the
 Senate Mr MASON Allow me
 to say that in my
 experience in this body which
 has now extended for many
 years I have occasionally heard
 of ob jections made to
 the printing of resolutions or
 other communications from a State
 but thcy have always been
 overruled The in variable practice
 has been to c xtcnd
 that as a respect to
 the States Mr CRITTENDEN is
 no objection to that Mr
 MASON 1 thought the honorable
 Sena tor from Indiana objected
 r r he resolutions were
 ordered to lie on tbc
 table and be printed STATIC

 we declare to each State
 of this Union our sincere
 desire to secure a renewal
 of that fraternal Ii el

 distinguished the history of the
 nation 10 than half a
 century Especia ly do ve
 express to those citizens of
 the southern States who have
 nobly and Inan ullv exerted
 their unnost to prevent the
 catastrophe of dissolution our sincere
 grat itude arid iiitrhest adtnira

 had tilne to present it
 to the voters of the
 town the number of signaturcs
 could have been doubled it
 there had been tilne to
 see the towns mentioned are
 on the seaboard while others
 are in the interior of
 the State Sir 1 witl
 ask that this petitiön may
 be read It is very
 short and it is due
 to such a number of
 subscribers as may fairly be
 considered as rep resentin y
 to a great extent the
 peop e le Secretary read
 the petition as follows T
 he 110 no rabie the
 Senate and House of Representatioes
 in Congress assembled The undersigned
 citizens of Massachusetts and also
 citi zens of the United
 States faithful alike to each
 allegiance believing that their sentiments
 towards the Union a nd
 to wards their common country
 have been misrepresented and misunderstood
 willing that all parts of
 the country should have their
 full and equal rights under
 the Constitu tion and recoonizing
 in the propositions of Hon
 J J CRIT TENDEN a
 basis of settlement which the
 North and the South may
 thirly and honorably accede to
 and which is well cai
 culatcd to restore peace to
 the country respectfully petition that
 your honorable bodies may adopt
 the same Mr CRITTENDEN Mr
 President 1 wish to make
 a single remark l he
 fact that my name is
 mentioned in this petition creates
 not the least degree of
 vanity or selfish feeling on
 my part No sir I
 honor this petition and these
 petition I am cheered by
 such a voice comimr up
 ers from Massachusetts in favor
 of the Union of the
 people of this country I
 consider it sirnply as an
 evidence of their attachment to
 the Union and it is
 in that light that i
 think it is to be
 estimated and that all the
 country I hope will hear
 the voice of twenty two
 thousand of the voters of
 Massachusetts in one petition We
 have had more than fourteen
 thousand petitioners from the city
 of Boston containing only nineteen
 thousand votes Sir this speaks
 largely and loudly for the
 sentiment of that State her
 patriotic sentiment It must be
 accepted as such by all
 However wrong they may be
 in their opinions and in
 their judgment it shows hearts
 devoted to the Union hearts
 that are devotcd to that
 Constitution and that Union which
 their ancestors so much con
 tributed to establish Sir I
 feel peculiar and es pecial
 satisfaction in presenting it and
 will no longer trouble the
 Senatc with any remarks on
 the subject I move that
 it be laid on the
 table The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 FOSTER in the chair The
 petition will be laid on
 the table Mr SUMNER As
 desire to sayafewwords on that
 petition I move tl lat
 it be printed These petitiönbiis
 as I understand ask you
 to adopt what are familiarly
 known as the Crittenden propositions
 Their best apology sir for
 that petition is their of
 the character of those propositions
 Had they known what they
 are I tt el sure
 that tl ley never would
 have put their names to
 that paper Those propositions go
 beyond the Breckinridge platform which
 has already been solemnly con
 demned by the American people
 If adopted they foist into
 the Constitution of the United
 States constitutional guarantees of slavery
 which the framers of that
 instrument never gave which Washington
 Jefferson Franklin Patrick Henry and
 John Jay if we may
 credit the testimony of their
 lives and opinions would have
 scorned to give Had any
 such propositions been made the
 condition of Union this Union
 never could have been formed
 Mr Madison told us in
 the convention that it wyas
 wrong to admit into the
 Constitution the idea tbern a
 Illajority of the voters of
 the town would of property

 pro have been glad to
 sien it r Che little

 lovers of the Union of
 their fathers for two things
 all sumcient for the present
 crisis with regard to which
 I should expect the sympathies
 of the Sen ator from
 Kentucky First that the Constitution
 of the United States as
 administered by George Washington to
 be preserved intact and blame
 less in its text without
 any tinkering for the sake
 of slavery and secondly the
 verdict of the peo ple
 last November by which Abraham
 Lincoln was elected President of
 the United States be enforced
 without price or condition Here
 is ground on which every
 patriot and loyal citizen of
 the land can take his
 stand and have over him
 the flag of the Union
 How much better tliis than
 any scheme device juggle hocus
 pocus of On such a
 ground all men who really
 love the Union of their
 fathers without an if or
 a but can plant themselves
 I remember sir that on
 the night of the pas
 sage of the Nebraska bill
 it x vas at midnight
 I made thc declaration in
 the debate that then went
 on that the time forcompromise
 had passed l he events
 taking place all verify this
 truth It is ob vious
 that existinKF difficulties can now
 be arrarpcd only on permanent
 principles of justice freedom and
 humanity Any seeming settlement founded
 on an abandonment of principles
 will be but a miserable
 patch work which cannot succeed
 It is only a short
 time ago you will remcmber
 that the whole country was
 filled with shame and dis
 may as the reports came
 to us of the surrender
 of the southern forts and
 when it was known that
 Fort Sumter too was about
 to be given up there
 was a cry that went
 forth from the hearts of
 the people by which that
 fortress was save l at
 least for the present Propositions
 are made and brought forward
 by the Senator from Kentucky
 and now enforced by petitions
 from constituents of my own
 State calling upon the North
 to sur render its principles
 to surrender those impreg nable
 principles of human rights which
 constitute It is oven proposed
 sir to our northcrn forts
 surrender the principle of freedom
 in the Territo ries the
 Fort Sumter of the North
 I trust sir that they
 will all yet be saved
 and as their safety depends
 upon the people and not
 upon a Prcsr dent I
 hope that a cry will
 go forth from the peo
 ple like that which only
 a few days ago saved
 that ot her Fort Surntei
 when it was menaced For
 myself if I stand with
 many or with few or
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 863 Deputies while
 recvnizing the unu tterable calam
 ities of that revolution said
 that it was his sol
 emn duty to declarc that
 in his opinion they were
 to be referred not so
 much to the bad pas
 sions of men as to
 those timid counsels that sought
 to substitute Compromise for Principle
 Lafayette may well speak to
 his American öllow citizens now
 and inspire them to stand
 firm affainst any timid counsels
 that would substitute compromise för
 principle I have no desire
 to press my motion to
 a vote Mr BINGHAM I
 wish to present the reso
 lutions of the Lecislature of
 the State of Michigan The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FOSTER in
 the chair The subject before
 the Senate has not been
 disposed of Mr BINGHAM The
 Senator from Massa chusetts withdrew
 the motion to print Mr
 CRITTENDEN Mr President Mr SUMNER
 If the Senator from Ken
 tucky wishes to speak on
 it I do not withdraw
 the motion Mr CRITTENDEN Mr
 President Mr BINGHAM 1 had
 the floor 1 believe The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Senator from Michigan
 was reco nized but the
 Chair understood that he wished
 to present a petition The
 present subject not being disposed
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 has the floor on the
 ques tion before the Senate
 being the motion to print
 the petition offered by him
 Mr BINGHAM 1 yield Mr
 CRITTENDEN Mr President it might
 seem to be a little
 uncyracious in mc step bet
 vcen the honoralJle Senator and
 his constituents who have sent
 this petition here He charges
 them with ignorance Ele is
 better acquainted with them than
 am but it has been
 a boast long made and
 I have thought it a
 well founded boast that edu
 cation at thc North was
 more universal than in any
 otller part of the Union
 that the Common wealth of
 Massachusetts especially took the rnost
 parental care of her people
 and that they were generally
 more enlightened and a more
 reading and writing people than
 the population of any other
 State of the Union I
 had supposed that this was
 the case I have no
 particular acquaint ance with these
 gentlemen I he tie that
 is be tween us is
 that of our common citizenship
 Another tie that is between
 us is the coincidence of
 our opinions and our attachment
 in favor of this Union
 avid the honor they have
 done me in confiding the
 presentation of this petition to
 my hands The gentleman says
 they have signed it out
 of ignorance In presenting it
 I supposed I might appeal
 to the Senate to give
 additional force and effect to
 this petition because of the
 intelligence of the people by
 whom it had been sent
 The gentleman supposes they have
 signed it without alone I
 have but one thing to
 say G No sur understanding
 it and for the purpose
 of showing render of the
 Fort Sumter of the North
 no sur render of any
 of out northern forts No
 sir not of one of
 them But the bankers and
 the merchants of New York
 and Boston tell us that
 the Government shall not have
 money if we do not
 surrender our prin ciples Then
 acain sir do I appeal
 to the peo pie I
 believe that the American people
 are not less patriotic than
 the French people and that
 they only want the opportunit
 y to come forward and
 supply he necessities of the
 Government as the French people
 only recently at the hint
 of Louis Napoleons came forward
 with their loan all composed
 of small sums in order
 to conduct that war which
 ended in the liberation of
 Italy i Our Government stands
 on the aggregate virtue and
 intelligence of the people It
 only remains now that we
 should make an appeal to
 the aggre gate wealth of
 the people The farmer the
 me chanic the laborer every
 man who truly loves his
 country will contribute out of
 his earnings to uphold the
 Constitution and the national flag
 I Out of these small
 sums inspired by a generous
 that they do not understand
 it he has character ized
 my resolutions so as to
 render it as he sup
 poses impossible that an intelligent
 person could sign the petition
 They would have spurned it
 I understand him instead of
 signing it if they had
 understood it It calls upon
 the North to abandon her
 settled and impregnable principles he
 says What principles To permit
 slavery is all that is
 asked in our present Territory
 All that is asked is
 that the condition of slavery
 shall remain in the Territory
 of New Mexico as it
 now is That is the
 substance When I first offered
 these resolutions I presented them
 as a mcrc basis upon
 which to establish some measure
 of I invited gentlernen of
 all sides to compromise amendments
 and alterations and partic ularly
 I called their attention to
 that provision which embraced in
 tnese resolutions territory to be
 hereafter acquired I stated that
 my principal inducement to it
 was that it might prevent
 and would be calculated 10
 prevent the Future acqui sition
 of territory I he North
 the ruling power of the
 country patriotism we shall have
 a fuli Treasury even if
 It apprehensive that if southern
 territory was ac quired slavery
 would be established there would
 the bankers and the merchants
 stand aloof There is but
 one thing now for the
 North to of course oppose
 such acquisitions The South do
 It is to stand firm
 in their position They would
 oppose northern acquisitions in tho
 samo complain when he svas
 invited to make amend ments
 These resolutions have been beforcussince
 the 18th day of December
 and he has made no
 proposition to amend or alter
 them None Here a great
 measure of pacification Everv SenF
 tor is bound as far
 as he can to contribute
 to the settlement of our
 great national troubles If the
 propositions I offered and which
 I offered with diffidence are
 not adequate to tl te
 purpose if they ask too
 much why have not gentlemen
 moved to amend Why has
 the honorable Senator sat here
 for one month and more
 and proposed no amend ment
 to the propositions which he
 now rises to condemn his
 constituents for approving Mr SUMNER
 Will the Senator allow me
 to say that every time
 I could get an opportu
 nity I have voted against
 his propositions I have missed
 no opportunity direct or indirect
 of voting against his propositions
 from beginning to end every
 line and every word of
 them Mr CRITTENDEN Ido that
 Mr President it may be
 so but that is not
 what I am asking of
 the gentleman It is that
 if he desired union and
 conciliation at all why did
 he not move to amend
 the propositions which he now
 condemns Mr SUMNER I will
 answer the Senator Because I
 thought there could be no
 basis of peace on the
 Senator s propositions The Senator
 s propositions were wrong in
 every respect in every line
 in every word That is
 what thought 1 was for
 the Constitution of thc United
 Slates the Constitution of our
 administered by George Washington Mr
 CRITTENDEN If that was all
 true and the gentleman desired
 an amicable settlement of the
 difficulties which now thrcatcn the
 coun try had he no
 proposition whatever to makc Mr
 SUMNER Certainly the proposition which
 I have already made that
 the Constitution as administered by
 George Washington should be preserved
 pure and free from any
 amendment for the sake ot
 slavery Mr CRITTENDEN Why did
 he not move that Why
 did he sit sullen and
 silent here for one month
 or more with his breast
 full of resent mcnt Applause
 in the galleries The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Order will be preserved
 in the galleries or they
 will be cleared Immediately Mr
 CRITTENDEN With such a spirit
 of opposition to and thinking
 as he did of these
 resolutions why did he not
 propose to strike them all
 out Mr SUMNER Will the
 Senatorietmeanswer Mr CRITTENDEN Yes 1
 will Mr SUMNER 1 did
 vote for the proposi tion
 of the Senator from New
 Hampshire Mr CLARK I voted
 for it as soon as
 it could come to a
 vote and that expresses precisely
 my ideas That displaced the
 Senator s proposition entirely Mr
 CRITTENDEN All that say remains
 true The Senator now has
 particularized some three or four
 instances in which he eonsidered
 these resolutionsas particularly condemnable and
 now denounces the ignorance of
 his constituen ts as evidenced
 bv their sio ning this
 petition What ate they W
 8 want a guarantee for
 slavery he says Sir the
 gentleman only half speaks the
 truth He states it as
 though we had risen up
 here in a time of
 peace and quiet to ask
 an alteration of the Constitution
 simply for the purpose of
 ex tending slavery That is
 not the case Of the
 tep ritory acquired from Mexico
 by the common blood and
 the common treasure ail bas
 been appropri ated according to
 the wishes of the North
 and the slaveholding States excluded
 Here remains one arid steriEe
 Territory alone New Mexico The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The hour one
 having arrived it becomes the
 duty of the Chair to
 arrest the discussion and announce
 the special order which is
 House bill No 914 Mr
 BIGLER move to postpone the
 order of the day to
 allow the Senator frorn Kentucky
 to proceed Mr BAKER It
 can be done by general
 consent Mr TRUMBULL be given
 hope way for the same
 reason Butl said at the
 same leave will be given
 to reply If everything else
 may bc guided by the
 testimony of one of the

 this discussion let us hcaé
 both greatest benefactors of our
 country I mean La time
 and say now that if
 this is not acceptable Fayette
 who in his old age
 when his experience as a
 comprehensive settlement which is to
 settle sides had been ripened
 by time when he saw
 the old now and prevent
 hereafter ali controversy on The
 PRESIDING OFFICER By general this
 subject it shall not bc
 with me an indispens consent
 the bill may be laid
 aside and this dis French
 revolution as a surviving actor
 and a sur viving sufferer
 from his seat in the
 Chamber of able condition What
 right has the gentieman to

 HALE 1 object THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 12 The PRESIDINGÖFFICER
 Objection being made the vote
 must be taken It is
 moved and seconded that the
 order of the day be
 postponed to allow this discussion
 to go on The question

 noes 8 no quorum voting
 Mr BRAGG There is evidently
 a quorum present Mr TRUMBULL
 1 call for the yeas
 and Oh no The only
 object I have is nays
 to get a quorum Mr
 ANTHONY lhope the debate will
 be allowed to go on
 informally Let the special order
 be laid aside informally by
 general consent that the Senator
 from Kentucky may proceed Mr
 POYVELL There is a quorum
 present evidently Mr HALE Is
 this question debatable The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question has not
 been decided Mr HALE I
 thought the motion was to
 post pone the special order
 and allow the debate to
 go on The PRESIDING OFFICER
 That is the motion but
 no vote has been had
 indicating the presence of a
 quorum of the Senate The
 yeas and nays were demanded
 but have not been or
 dered Mr BIGLER Let us
 order them Mr HALE vote
 against this motion be cause
 I think a period of
 the session has arrived when
 if we cver intend to
 do anything we ought to
 do it and we ought
 to be about it and
 with all respect to the
 Senator from Kentucky and the
 Senator from Massachusetts I listen
 to them with as much
 pleasure as anybody and I
 have had a good deal
 of that pleasure this session
 laughter not particularly from the
 Senator from Massachusetts I say
 that think it is time
 the Senate went to the
 practical business of the coun
 try The demands of the
 country are not for any
 more speeches but for practical
 business if we ever mean
 to do any and I
 am glad the yeas and
 nays have been called for
 so that the country may
 know who it is that
 come here to make and
 to hear speeches that can
 possibly tend to no sort
 of good on earth but
 may do mischief Mr DOUGLAS
 I hope if the Senator
 is so much opposed to
 speeches he will quit and
 let us votc Laughter IVIr
 HALE 1 will say that
 that is the best speech
 1 ever heard from the
 Senator from Illi nois because
 it is the shortest Laughter
 give up now sir Mr
 DOUGLAS It accomplished its object
 Laughter The PR SIDING OFFICER
 The motion before the Senate
 is tl nt House bill
 No 914 which is the
 order of the day at
 one o clock being the
 unfinished business of yesterday be
 postponed in order that the
 discussion upon the petition which
 has been presented Inay go
 on The Chair wili put
 the question t vain Mr
 I IA LIC called ibr
 the yeas and nays and
 they werc ordered Mu TRUMBULL
 1 to say that if
 this discussion is to go
 on by thc Senator from
 Ken tuck y I trust
 it will not be arrested
 the moment hc is through
 I he time of the
 Senate has been taken up
 almost from its commencement by
 dis cussions from persons who
 have sought to throw on
 this side of the Senate
 thc responsibility for the present
 condition of things and I
 think it is time that
 some reply should be made
 to these re iterated staternents
 When u party has brought
 the country to the verge
 of dissolution is making war
 upon it capturing its troops
 seizing its forts firing into
 its vessels dishonoring its flag
 and yet talking about Union
 and peace and appealing to
 Republicans who have never been
 in power day time that
 we upon our side placed
 this respons ibility where it
 belongs upon the corruptions the
 iknbecilty the irresolution if I
 may not say the complicity
 with treason itself of the
 party ill power Now sir
 if the discussion is to
 go on and the time
 of the Senate is to
 be taken up with I
 think about sixteen legislative days
 retuaining from now to the
 4th of March with important
 bills pending if every gentleman
 who presents a petition is
 to make a speech and
 time to be taken up
 in that way let us
 have it on both The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair feels
 bound to suggest to the
 Senator from Illinois that by
 the rules of the Senate
 a motion re gard to
 the order of business does
 not open the subject so
 that it can be discussed
 upon its mer its But
 a very brief discussion is
 understood to be in order
 on a motion in regard
 to the order of business
 which is the motion now
 before the Senate Mr ANTHONY
 Is this a motion to
 post pone the order of
 the day so as to
 continue this debate or simply
 to allow the Senator from
 Ken tucky to finish his
 remarks The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair understood it was a
 motion to postpone the order
 of the day in order
 to continue the discussion on
 the motion to print the
 petition The Secretary proceede l
 to call the roll Mr
 SUMNER when his name was
 called said I desire to
 give the Senator from Kentucky
 an opportunity to be heard
 and therefore I vote yea
 The result was announced yeas
 23 nays 21 as follows
 YEAS Messrs Baker Bayard Bigler
 Bragg Cling man Crittenden Dixon
 Douglas Fitch Foster Green Hemphill
 Johnson of Tennessee Mason Polk
 Powell Rice Saulsbury Sebastian Sumner
 Ten Eyck Thomson and Wigfan
 23 NAYS Messrs Anthony Bingham
 Cameron Chand ler Clark Collamer
 Doolittle Durkee Fessenden Foot Grimes
 Hale King Latham Pearce Seward
 Simmons Trumbull Wade Wilkinson and
 Wilson 21 So the motion
 to postpone all prior orders
 was agreed to Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 am not surprised that
 Senators rnanifest such an anxiety
 to do what is called
 the business of the session
 and to proceed to that
 I take no exception to
 it no offense at it
 whatever It is but little
 that I havc to say
 and it would have been
 said in less time than
 has been occupied in determining
 this ques tion I thought
 the gentleman vvas not exactly
 correct in stating tho effect
 of the resolutions in troduccd
 by me and I wish
 to say a word in
 ref crence to those points
 which he has selected Ele
 says we ask guarantees in
 the Constitution for the protection
 of slavery in the Territories
 By those resolutions in all
 the territory north of the
 line designated slavery is prohibited
 all south of it which
 in reference to our present
 territory is nothing more than
 the Territory of New Mex
 ico the most sterile and
 worthless of its extent upon
 this whole continent is reserved
 for the South and how
 sir That slavery as it
 now exists there as a
 matter of fact shall be
 recoa nized as existing and
 that it shall continue until
 the population of the Perritory
 warrants its ad mission into
 the Union as a State
 The people are then to
 decide for themselves as they
 please whether they will have
 slavery or not I hat
 is the proposition and that
 only What principle does this
 conflict with All California that
 vast and rich territory has
 been already converted into a
 free State and New Mexico
 is alt that re mains
 of our conquest from Mexico
 From all the rest the
 South the slaveholding portion of
 the community are excluded We
 do not ask you here
 to initiate slavery we do
 not ask you to introduce
 slavery we ask you simply
 to admit the fact that
 slavery docs now exist by
 law in the Territory of
 New Mexico and simply to
 agree that it shall continue
 so to exist until It
 becomes a State that is
 all This the gentleman says
 would violate prin ciple What
 principle Any principle of equity
 or justice as between the
 several States of the Umon
 Is there any constitutional principle
 to be violated It may
 violate notions and opinions which
 gentlemen entertain outside of the
 Consti tution it may violate
 anti slavery notions but it
 does not violate the Constitution
 nor so far as I
 have heretofore understood it does
 it violate even the notions
 of the Republican party They
 go against the extension of
 slavery I thought their doctrine
 was to let it rest
 where it existed but not
 to extend it and now
 here a question comes up
 whether you will recognize it
 as it in point of
 fact exists and as you
 know it to exist I
 and allow it to remain
 until the people by com
 I ing into the Union
 as a State have the
 right to I As a
 mere question of equity between
 equal part ners ii the
 Commonwealth is it too great
 a con cession Is it
 more than an equal or
 a ratable or an equitable
 proportion Certainly I think it
 cannot be said to be
 It violates nothing but some
 dogma that has been sometimes
 asserted by extreme members of
 the Republican party that no
 slavery shall be allowed to
 exist in any Terri tory
 and that no future slave
 State shall be ad mitted
 into the Union It mav
 violate that dogma but sir
 does not this occasion call
 upon us to make sacrifices
 if they are necessary for
 the pres ervation of peace
 and union in the country
 That is a queétion submitted
 to the people of the
 United States that is a
 question submitted to us Your
 platform gentlemen addressing the Re
 publican Senators is a little
 thing of but a hands
 breadth manufactured by a few
 politicians You are governing a
 great nation Are you to
 look to that platform or
 look to the nation which
 you have been called in
 the course of Providence to
 govern Is it a fitting
 measure by which to gov
 ern the nation Although every
 principle an nounced in the
 platform may be dear to
 your hearts would you not
 sacrifice it rather than see
 secession and revolution go on
 and this country be necessarily
 dismembered You are pledged by
 every principle of the Constitution
 by every principle of morality
 by your own platfbrrn to
 preserve the Union of this
 country You obtained confidence from
 the country by that pledge
 De votion to the Union
 was assumed by you as
 a peculiar principle and a
 peculiar duty of your party
 That is forgotten When you
 cannot carry out all your
 notions and preserve the Union
 is it better to let
 the Union go and preserve
 every little peculiarity of doctrine
 of opinion which you may
 entertåin not of the essence
 of the Con stitution not
 belonging to the Constitution but
 which according to your fancy
 and notions of morality you
 may desirc to see carried
 into effect Will you carry
 all these into effect and
 lot the Union go down
 and be destroyed That is
 the question These twenty two
 thousand patriotic citizens of Massachusetts
 have said let the Union
 be preserved and so gentlemen
 I persuade my self that
 you yourselves will say Mr
 SUMNER Every citizen of Massachu
 setts will say let the
 Union be preserved Mr CRITTENDEN
 And if possible with out
 the use of arms or
 force or bloodshed Mr CLARK
 Or compromise Mr CRITTENDEN is
 your word Mr CLARK Or
 compromise I said Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 do not understand the
 gentleman Mr CLARK I said
 or compromise fol lowing the
 language of the Senator from
 Ken tucky Mr CRITTENDEN Compromise
 is a word that seems
 to be rejected I do
 not consider that I am
 asking a compromise or a
 concession but gentlemen denominate it
 so who want to assume
 themselves to be donors in
 this matter They yield nothing
 of their constitutional right accord
 mg to my notion It
 is you who call it
 compro mise and then make
 war upon the word that
 you yourselves use but am
 willing to so call it
 I am willing even so
 to accept it if it
 would be granted in any
 form but you condemn it
 in that language you condemn
 it by that name Well
 sir that is all I
 desire to say liow I
 wish to create no excited
 or heated debate We have
 great ques tions probably before
 us yet I wish to
 avoid everything like personality or
 invective or heart burning here
 that we may reserve ourselves
 calm and wise to the
 last and endeavor to save
 our country I believe it
 is necessary to save it
 1 believe gentlemen that you
 must do somethinT or the
 country cannot be saved The
 question is whether you will
 hang now upon little points
 and little questions comparatively little
 com pared to the preservation
 of the Union small and
 Insignificant indeed which of them
 you will let pass by
 if in your consciences you
 think you are making a
 sacrifice 1 have said before
 that here on this occasion
 I do not present myself
 as the advocate of slavery
 but as the advocate of
 the Union It is thei
 e that decide it för
 themselves That is the whole
 sub i 1 stand und
 my honest efforts are directed
 to that stance of the
 proposition when you exclude from
 end to preserve my relations
 to thc North to it
 after acquired territory Where the
 principle preserve my relations as
 countrymen in this Union of
 the Constitution that this violates

 every one of you I

 THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D SESSION
 the North I love the
 South I think 1 may
 say that I have every
 proper patriotic regard to every
 portion of my country I
 do not agree to the
 doctrine that the North hates
 the South or that the
 South hates the North There
 are individuals in both sections
 who indulge such feelings 1
 have not indulged them myself
 and do not believe it
 is true as to the
 masses of the people anywhere
 I see in these petitions
 that come here for the
 existence and continuance of a
 fraternal Union evidence grateful to
 my heart that that is
 not the sentiment which prevails
 in t his country No
 sir the people of this
 country love the Union the
 people of this country are
 proud of this great nation
 They have enjoyed blessirws under
 it and they desire to
 preserve it God and the
 country is the great sentiment
 existing among our people in
 every section of our Union
 I grant it Every effort
 should be made that fraternal
 affection can suggest for the
 settlement of this question Great
 sacrifices would not be too
 great a price to pay
 for Union Sir here we
 stand Revolution to a certain
 extent has gone on and
 been successful It will go
 on still further unless those
 that are yet adher ing
 to their duty shall be
 satisfied by something that you
 will do I do not
 speak of what I my
 self would individually require but
 what the millions that are
 represented here from States yet
 adhering to this Union require
 You must have a great
 motive I am sure to
 perpetuate and to secure the
 Union as far as it
 still exists and by means
 of it we may hope
 ultimately to restore every State
 of the seceding numberthat have
 gone I hope we may
 do it I believe we
 out from us can do
 it but we cannot do
 it by angry debates we
 cannot do it by heated
 discussions here we cannot do
 it by criminations and recriminations
 we cannot do it by
 denunciations Depend upon it that
 is not the way to
 do it I wish to
 practice every degree of forbearance
 until the last moment of
 deliberation has been exhausted here
 and until I find that
 no settlement can be obtained
 that some fatal prejudice that
 some fatal predeterm ination on
 this subject has destined the
 country to ruin and dismemberment
 I regret every heated and
 excited debate that I hear
 on this floor Why is
 it that gentlcmen begin to
 feel a particular impa tience
 when anything said or done
 or attempted to be said
 or done in respect to
 that subject that is so
 much greater than all the
 preservation of the country and
 the Union Senators talk about
 the little busincss of Congress
 little it is if the
 country is to be ruined
 Savc the country and then
 administer to its wants then
 provide for its necessities then
 provide for the means of
 admin istration but that which
 is precedent to ail and
 paramount to all is the
 very subject about which particular
 impatience is manifested in this
 body and we are told
 we should do the business
 of the Senate We cannot
 shut our eyes to what
 is going on We knos
 v that revolution has dismembered
 the land already to the
 amount of six or seven
 States We know that that
 fatal temperament is extending itself
 or liable to extend itself
 and ye we manifest impatience
 when anything is proposed or
 said in regard to a
 remedy for that spreading Mr
 President all that could bc
 said of them if these
 resolutions were accepted would be
 that the extreme regard which
 they have manifested for the
 preservation of the Union has
 impelled them to this error
 if error it can be
 called an error that certainly
 leans on virtue s side
 an extreme anx iety to
 preserve the relations of brotherhood
 which exist between them and
 the other portions of this
 country That is the cause
 of it an honest and
 honorable patriotic error that does
 not deserve condemnation It proceeds
 fronl sound hearts from good
 hearts who know of no
 sacrifice too great who have
 no opinion upon a mere
 matter of policy or a
 question of mere conscience that
 they would not rather sacrifice
 or give up or yield
 to the opinion of millions
 of their countrymen for the
 preservation of the Union That
 is where these petitioners stand
 As for slavery in the
 District of Columbia that WEDNESDAY
 FEBRUARY 13 1861 has existed
 a long time That is
 one of the ob jections
 which the gentleman urges Why
 Mr President that has always
 becn u disputed ques tion
 as to its constitutionality and
 all that I ask you
 is to let things alone
 do not now in this
 moment of trouble undertake to
 disturb them Let it re
 main Virginia and Maryland originally
 made the cession and let
 it remain while these States
 retain slavery and let Congress
 say it sliall re main
 in the position it was
 when it WEIS ceded to
 them unless Virginia and Maryland
 shall assent to the change
 That is what is asked
 in this re spect and
 that concludes all his objections
 ex cept as to slavery
 in places under the special
 con trol of Congress within
 the States where it exists
 places for fortifications places for
 arsenals places for navy yards
 a thing too inconsiderable to
 be discussed now Mr President
 I am very sorry for
 the time I have occupied
 and without further debate I
 shall take my seat Mr
 CLARK Mr President Mr SUMNER
 Allow me one word Mr
 CLARK I will waive my
 right for a moment Mr
 SUMNER I have no desire
 to prolong this debate or
 to occupy the time of
 the Senate will make two
 remarks The Senator from Ken
 tucky is not aware of
 his ox vn popularity in
 Mas sachusetts of the extent
 to which his name is
 there an authority of the
 willingness of the peo ple
 of that State to adopt
 anything that bears his respectable
 name Ido not think tbatdistinguished
 Senator is aware of that
 fact consequent ly he is
 not aware how easily the
 people of Massachusetts may be
 seduced to adopt a proposition
 bearing the name which they
 so much respect when if
 they examined that proposition they
 would at once reject it
 Now all that I would
 suggest in regard to these
 petitioners is that under the
 lead of that distinguished Senator
 they put their names to
 a paper which think they
 did not in all respects
 m all its bearings in
 all its obligations in all
 its propositions fully understand I
 wfil do them the justice
 to believe that if they
 did know all the bearings
 of those propositions they would
 not put their namc to
 any such paper That is
 all I have to say
 on that point but I
 wish to make one other
 remark on another The Senator
 intimated if I understood him
 arigl it that his propositions
 at least in his ox
 vn mind were not applicable
 to territory hereafter acquired Mr
 CRITTENDEN No do not mean
 to be understood as sayil
 lg that Mr SUMNER 1
 understood the Senator so Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 said did notconsider
 t bat proposition as an
 essential part of mine that
 I did not intend to
 insist upon it if I
 found it I did not
 intend that would not be
 acceptable that should he any
 obstacle to an adjustment and
 I would ropose to strike
 it out if necessary Mr
 SbMNER The Senator did not
 consider that proposition an essential
 part and yet in the
 Jo urna of the Senate
 which is now before me
 in the yeas and nays
 I find his name recorded
 in the affirmative on introducing
 those words now held or
 hereafter to be acquired into
 the propo sition There is
 the record the name of
 the Sen ator from Kentucky
 answering yea when wc were
 all asked to answer yea
 or nay on that prop
 osition Mr CLARK I was
 one of those who voted
 vainst continuing this discussion to
 day Mr CRITTENDEN Will the
 gentleman allow me a single
 moment Mr CLARK Certainly Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 did upon the
 motion oc my colleague vote
 for his amendmeßt and would
 bc content with it but
 subsequent reflec tion and the
 objections made to it here
 and else where have satisfied
 me that I ought not
 to ad here to it
 if it was to become
 an obstacle to prevent the
 passage of these resoiutions That
 is the explanation Mr CLARK
 I remarked Nik President that
 I wras one OF those
 v 7ho voted against this
 discussion to day i did
 not believe when NEW 65
 F I gave that vote
 that any good would tespltftom
 it and though I have
 now tEikpn theao ot to
 sume this discussion I am
 still of the same opin
 ion and if the Sepate
 desire to resume Che büsi4
 ness which Was undei consideration
 yestcrdäy Or any other business
 which may be Of praetical
 imr portanee I will cheerfully
 give way foe them so
 to do or if the
 Senator from Missouri desires to
 continue the remarks which he
 proposed to mike yesterday I
 will givc way for that
 purpose any thing which may
 bring good Mr GREEN 1
 will not interfere at all
 with this discussion When the
 Senator is ihi ouÉh and
 the Senate resümes the cOngidea
 atioh df the bill on
 which I took the floor
 I then propose address some
 remarks to the Senate but
 a tpres_z sent I decline
 doing so Mr CAMERON 1
 hope the Senatof will allow
 me a moment Mr CLARK
 Certainly Mr CAMERON 1 desire
 to suggest to the Senator
 from New Hampshire that instead
 of continuing this discussion we
 take up the bill which
 we left unfinished last night
 and proceed With our regular
 business The session is very
 near its close and we
 on this side will be
 held responsible for the proper
 bills to support the Government
 Mr CLARK Then 1 will
 say to the Senator from
 Pennsylvania if he will move
 to postpone this subject to
 any future time so that
 I may have an opportunity
 of speakiog upon it I
 will cheerp fully acquiesce Mr
 CAMERON Then I move that
 this ques tion be postponed
 until this day next week
 at one 6 clock Mr
 CLARK An earlier day say
 Monday Mr CAMERON Very well
 I Will say Mon day
 The PRESIDING OFFICÉR It is
 moved that the further consideration
 of this subject be postponed
 until Monday next for the
 purpose of taking up the
 bill wllic h was before
 the Senate yesterday the naval
 appropriation bill The motion to
 postpone was agreed to NAVAL
 APPROPRIATION BILL The Senate resurned
 the consideration of the bill
 H R No 714 making
 appropriations for the naval service
 for the year ending the
 301h of June 1862 the
 pending question being on con
 curring in the followin amendment
 made as in Committee of
 the Whole to add as
 ah additional section nnd be
 it further enacted That the
 Secretary of the Navy be
 and hc is hereby authorized
 to cauSc be constructed fbr

 a nd greatcst Speed compat
 above specified the sum of

 hereby appropriated out of any
 money in the l reasury
 not otherwise appropriated to be
 expended under the direction of
 the Secretary of the Navy
 Mr GREEN My might be
 sup posed that the line
 of my remarks is not
 appro priate to the present
 bill now pending before the
 Senate but under tho circumstances
 crowing out of the character
 of the speeches made on
 the pend iog amendment I
 think them entirely appropriate The
 exact subject matter upon which
 the Senate must now act
 and to which the attention
 of the Senate ought to
 be directed is the propriety
 of the appropription of 1
 200 000 to build seven
 new screw steamers ofcertain dimensions
 and draught In itself it
 would seem to be a
 matter of very small importance
 but when the intent with
 which it is now urged
 is shadowed forth by its
 friends it stikes the public
 mind With so much force
 that we cannot resist the
 occasion to meet thcm in
 the proper spirit At a
 time when the Treasury is
 depleted at a time when
 there is po actual neces
 sity thr an increase of
 our naval force at a
 time when unfortunately we have
 been driven into the market
 to borrosv nearly seventy million
 dollars in addition to a
 proposition Co inpreåse the duties
 866 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 12 uponz all imported goods
 and besides all this when
 honest contracts are urged for
 payment when the creditors of
 the Government are beg ging
 you to pay them they
 are put off with the
 poor and miserable plea that
 we have not money to
 pay men who have credited
 this Government for eighty years
 who have advanced money and
 have never received it back
 are to be pushed aside
 on the poor plea that
 we are not able to
 pay them now and when
 you undertake to pay them
 the plea is urged also
 that the Government is presumed
 always td be ready and
 therefore you will not pay
 interest in this contingency and
 under this state of things
 we are asked to appro
 priaté 1 200 000 to
 build seven new steamers I
 ask this question and I
 want the country to respond
 to it whethcr thc Senatc
 docs or not is there
 such a pressi ng necessity
 as to require of us
 toborrow money for that purpose
 for it is to bor
 row money Ito what purposes
 are these steam ers to
 be applied Why is it
 at this time when our
 resources are less than they
 have been for many years
 when our credit is lower
 than it has been for
 a long number of years
 why is it now deemed
 necessary to borrow 1 200
 000 to build seven new
 steamers This would have been
 pertinent it is now pcrtincnt
 it will remain pertinent but
 the purpose was disclosed in
 the speech of the honorable
 Senator from New York I
 do not mean the thin
 keen visaged eagle eyed Senator
 but I mean the bellicose
 Senator laugh tor whose voice
 is still for war whose
 object is to involve us
 in serious deadly conflict and
 he says he wants them
 to coerce sovereign States Why
 sir when we have been
 begging for some private clåims
 of a few dollars the
 cry was we had not
 the money and when we
 answered it and said all
 we want is an acknowledgment
 of the debt wo will
 take your credit for them
 a deaf ear was turned
 to us When an application
 for thousands but to build
 a railroad to the Pacific
 was made it was adoptcd
 almost by acclamation When the
 re sources from the Dublic
 lands amounting to 3 500
 000 annually were proposed to
 bc taken away by a
 homestead bill to give to
 the vama bonds and scoundrels
 sent out from your over
 grown cities that was adopted
 with avidity You vote away
 all your resources you vote
 away 120 000 000 When
 we ask you to pay
 an hon est you say
 you havo not 0t the
 money and you will not
 therefore acknowledge it Then you
 get up and say give
 us 1 200 000 to
 build seven new steamers for
 war purposes to coerce thoxe
 States who deem themselves injured
 and in the exercise of
 their soverei rn rights choose
 to say they secede from
 the Union Mr Prcsident it
 resolves itsclf into this ques
 tion not the protection of
 public property not the enforcenient
 of the laws but has
 any State a richt to
 secede and if she hus
 the right under any circ
 urnstanc os and in any
 contineency who is to bc
 the judge of the circumstanecs
 that jus tify it If
 ihc Vederal Goverinnent is to
 be thc judge the rifflit
 does not exist I hat
 is a denial ef the
 right If lhc State is
 to bc thc judge that
 is an admission of the
 right Who then to be
 the judge and if a
 wrong decision is made on
 whom does the responsibility filll
 and what con sequences arc
 to follow Talk to mc
 about en forcing the law
 Why sir thero is no
 man in thie Uhited States
 but what says enforce the
 but enforce it where Enforce
 it where vou havc jurisdiction
 enforce it over your Union
 That does not still meet
 the question for if a
 State the right to secede
 and does secede she is
 no longer a part of
 the Union and the enforcement
 i of the law within
 the Union does not include
 the right to enforce it
 in a seceding State Protect
 public property you say So
 say I M hateveris public
 property protect protect it against
 John Brown and Montgomery and
 the Abolition hordes who rush
 into Missouri and Virginia That
 is a not send your
 Armyand your Navy thereto pro
 tect it You own it
 asa mere proprietor and you
 are subjects to the local
 law the k w of
 Great Brit ain You have
 public property in other parts
 of the world but you
 cannot protect it with military
 power You can negotiate and
 insist upon a pro tection
 of your rights but that
 is all Have you public
 property in South Carolina for
 I intend to reduce this
 question to its simple elements
 I answer you have not
 onc single par ticle The
 right to secede is a
 question that I postpone for
 after consideration If however the
 right to secede is admitted
 whatever forts maga zines arsenals
 or other public property had
 been purchased made constructed or
 improved by the Federal Government
 cease to be public property
 of the Union they follow
 necessarily the action of the
 local sovereignty Fort Sumter this
 day is wrongfully held by
 this Government it isan actof
 war against the State of
 South Carolina But you say
 the Federal Government built it
 I answer yes with the
 consent of the State When
 When that State was a
 part of the Federal Union
 For whose benefit To protect
 Washington city No To protect
 New York No To protect
 Boston No To protect Charleston
 Yes Now a fort built
 for t hc purpose of
 protecting the city of Charleston
 is it seems to have
 its ponderous guns turned and
 their frowninff mouths directed against
 the very city for whose
 benefit it was crected Whose
 money paid for it you
 may ask I answer the
 money of the Federal Treasury
 You then will ask this
 additional question if the Fed
 eral Treasury built the fort
 and manned the fort and
 armed the fort althouTh it
 was intended for the protection
 of South Carolina can South
 Car olinn by an act
 of secession rcclaim that and
 take Federal property I ffive
 you this answer South Carolina
 contributed duc proportion for the
 l uilding of all the
 forts and she contributed as
 much to build Fort Columbus
 and every northern fort and
 every other southern fort as
 she did to build Fort
 Scunt cr so that in
 the adjustment of the accounts
 there is no injustice done
 to any por tion of
 the Union She fraid to
 build Fort Mc Henry Fortress
 Monroe Fort Columbus and all
 the other forts stretching from
 her northern line around tn
 the extremc West even along
 the great lakes She paid
 her full proportion and if
 we paid our proportion for
 Fort Sumter it is no
 injustice to divide For what
 object was it erected It
 was erected to protect the
 bity of Charleston and the
 State of South Carolina Butl
 will go a step further
 than I say therc never
 was an instance in the
 that history of the world
 where a State seceded or
 revolutionized when t hc act
 was cornplete that any other
 State claimed the forts within
 hcr lim I shall hereafter
 come to thc point whether
 its the act is yot
 complete or not but I
 do say there never wvns
 nn instance you may search
 the rec Ok ds of
 the world where a State
 revolutionizes or withdraws from an
 association of States that any
 other Power claimed a fort
 situated in her limits Hence
 when you talk aboutprotccting the
 prop ct ty tho United
 States everybody will say that
 is but iL leaves thc
 question still unanswered what is
 the property of the United
 States When you talk about
 enforcing thc laws within the
 jurisdiction of tho United States
 everybody res ponds yes but
 it leaves the question still
 unan swcrcd what aro the
 limits of the United States
 Hence the svhole of it
 disguise it as you may
 resolves itself into this one
 question has the State the
 right to secede and has
 the State in fact se
 ceded challengc the world to
 meet that ques Lion if
 concede the right and the
 fact There arc two points
 in it the right and
 the ecercise of the right
 You may concede the right
 to all States for if
 it exists with one it
 exists with all They arc
 all on perfect terms of
 equality every different question But
 what is public property State
 in t his Union acquired
 since the original That property
 which is appropriated to public
 purposes ccithin the Union not
 property outside of the Union
 You have public property at
 Spezzia on the Mediterranean but
 I venture to say that
 you will not send your
 Army and your Navy and
 your seven new steamers there
 if the Government there says
 the circumstan ces of that
 coun try rcquire you to
 desist You have public property
 in the city of London
 where your minister resides You
 will thirteen formed the Confederation
 is on exact terms of
 equality and a Union not
 bascd upon terms of equality
 would not be worth preserving
 Individuals may rise in a
 community violate the laws and
 subject thernselves to punishment but
 that never mccts the real
 question that we have to
 consider Our Government is one
 of its own peculiar kind
 This association of States is
 such a one as never
 existed before and if broken
 up by the misconduct of
 its members it will never
 have its cpunterpart Individuals in
 a single Gov ernment can
 commit treason can commit rebel
 lion can violate the laws
 Individuals in an associated Government
 can do the same things
 But in regard to a
 State a member of the
 asso ciation it brings up
 a different question for con
 sideration A county in a
 State is an integral part
 of the State an individual
 of a State is an
 Integral part of a State
 but this Federal Govern ment
 is as expressed by Mr
 Calhoun a multi ple of
 units Each State being an
 entirety an entity a thing
 of itself having power to
 breathe and exist it goes
 into this multiple by its
 own voluntary action In all
 such cases every sovereignly can
 go out of its own
 voluntary action it being an
 entirety and a unit and
 not a few individuals and
 all this talk about coercing
 springs from a confounded notion
 of thought I mean an
 uncomprehended consideration of the subject
 that they are indi viduals
 and not State sovereignties They
 con found the idea and
 undertake to liken a Statc
 in the Union to a
 county in a State but
 more differ ent ideas could
 not possibly be presented A
 county in a State is
 a fragment of a State
 a State in the Union
 is an entirety it is
 a unit i voluntary member
 of an association The county
 is no voluntary member because
 every county in a State
 but one may vote for
 a law and yet that
 one be bound by it
 Any county in a State
 there fore that revolts any
 fragment of a united sover
 eignty that flies off any
 segment of an entire circle
 that is broken in a
 political sense is rebel lion
 but when you take an
 association resting upon volition resting
 upon consent and that con
 sent is withdrawn and the
 determination is ex pressed to
 cease to be in the
 association that State is no
 longer one of thc Confederation
 I know the question may
 be asked what will jus
 tify such an act I
 will not answer and why
 have no riffht to answer
 The State must take thc
 responsibility the State itself is
 the judge of what will
 justify it other power is
 the judge the right does
 not exist and to Eissert
 that any other power is
 the judge is to deny
 the right Each State must
 judge for itself But suppose
 the State judges wrongfully and
 decides improperly and on mere
 pretense says We will dissolve
 the association into which we
 havc honorably entered then the
 State has done wrong Who
 is to punish the State
 Nobody Who is to condemn
 the State The enlightened judgment
 of mankind That is all
 There is no other tribunal
 that can possibly pass judgment
 upon her Who passed judgment
 upon the Revolution of 1776
 The enlightened judgment of the
 world Was that war waged
 by George Ill on the
 advice of his ministers a
 right ful or a wrongful
 var Everybody in the United
 States says it was a
 wrongful war What was thc
 object of that war To
 reduce the thirteen colonies to
 subjection Why was it a
 x vrongful N var Did
 not these colonies belong to
 Great Britain Yes Were they
 not subject to the control
 of the British Crown Yes
 Did they not throw off
 their allegiance and renounce it
 say ing that they would
 hold England as they did
 all the rest of the
 world in peace friends in
 war en emics Yes Was
 not this rebellion Yes If
 it was a rebellion even
 a case of rebel ion
 you say was justifiable and
 a war Inade against rebels
 wras a wrongful war Every
 man woman and child in
 the United States says even
 that Recollect the colonies were
 not component parts ofa Gov
 ernment formed by tho voluntary
 action of in dependent communities
 They were colonies planted conquered
 or purchased by Great Britain
 Even in that case everybody
 says the vv ar was
 a wrongful war brought on
 by the improper ac tion
 of the ministers of George
 Ill If that be true
 how much stronger how much
 more palpa ble qnd how
 much more extraordinary would it
 be if herein an association
 of equals each one coming
 in by its own consent
 and each one goin y
 out by its own consent
 when one goes out you
 are to undertake to exercise
 military poWer and control aid
 bring on war by the
 action of the Federal Government
 Who would be the wronr
 r ful actor in this
 light It would bc the
 Federal Government I do not
 anticipate any great diffi culty
 because I know the good
 sense I know the sound
 judgment and I know the
 warmth of heart of the
 American people Will prevent all
 of this and the few
 politicians who to make themselves
 1861 conspicuous talk about war
 and yet would be the
 first to run do not
 amount to the weight ofa
 feather in the scale Some
 of them are so large
 that they cannot run fast
 laughter and would only be
 shot in the back But
 Mr President it is our
 duty here to incul cate
 a spirit in the minds
 and hearts of the people
 which will dispose them to
 actin the best manner possible
 We are presumed to be
 representative men we are presumed
 to reflect the will of
 those who sent us here
 and acting in that capacity
 our woÉds are treasured up
 however foolish they may be
 and however ridiculous they are
 and they are not simply
 attributed to us as individual
 mem bers of the Senate
 but they arc often improperly
 ascribed to the power behind
 us the people we represent
 Let us therefore be cautious
 in the employment of words
 let us remember that this
 Union as much as we
 love it can only be
 pre served by the same
 means that brought it mto
 existence What are they Was
 any State ever whipped into
 the Union Then no State
 can ever hereafter be whipped
 in else that will be
 a differ ent Union Was
 any State ever coerced into
 the Union Then no State
 hercaftcr can be cocrccd into
 the Union else that l
 vill be a different Union
 As the States camc in
 by their own voluntary act
 they must remain in by
 their own voluntary act and
 when they go out as
 they contributed to pay the
 general expenses for fortifications and
 armies while they wcrc in
 every fortification wh ich is
 necessarily local and within the
 jurisdiction of a seceding State
 belongs to that State and
 was intended for the benefit
 of that State Sout h
 Car olina has as much
 claim to Fort Columbus in
 New York harbor this day
 as the United States has
 to Fort Sumter and the
 same right to attack Fort
 Columbus as the United States
 has to attack Fort Moultrie
 and I pledge you one
 feeble arm to act in
 a contingency that ntay arise
 as soon as the United
 States undcrtuke to attack Fort
 Moultrie or any other fort
 and if they do Y10t
 surrcndcr Sumter pretty quick it
 will be attacked on the
 other side and It ought
 to be for it is
 holding a military position within
 the jurisdiction of a for
 eign State against the will
 of that State I must
 say that I commend the
 honor and forbearance of South
 Carolina and she has done
 it to prevent the effusion
 of blood and she has
 done it with the hope
 that the good sense of
 the people would come to
 a proper understanAing of the
 subject and ad just these
 diffculties on an honorable and
 states manlike compromise or a
 peaceful separation The alternative has
 been presented to us and
 we are compelled to act
 upon it I said in
 the beginning of this session
 that Congress would do nothing
 that there was a feeling
 among the people that would
 drive thCi n with hot
 haste I thought South Carolina
 was too hasty but whether
 she was or not she
 must be the judffe CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 867 II I T
 vas afraid she would be
 too hasty and afraid other
 States would be too hasty
 I wanted the whole of
 the States to consult and
 I preferred that even Missouri
 as remote as she is
 should I be taken into
 consultation with others I knew
 that her patriotic heart throbbed
 with emotion for this Union
 but not that kind of
 Union which some Senators speak
 of when they simply say
 Union Union but a constitutional
 Union a defying each other
 one saying we can whip
 you and the other saying
 we can whip you Are
 we not ashamed of that
 as statesmen One tin eatens
 to march an army down
 South and the other says
 come on we wiil meet
 you What good can all
 that do Had we not
 better under stand what we
 want what we intend to
 insist upon what ure will
 have or separate and if
 we are forced to separation
 had we not better do
 it peace ably than by
 war One says Here is
 the great Mississippi running from
 north to south almost from
 forty ninc degrees north latitude
 to the Gulf and we
 cannot divide the Mississippi It
 does not en ter into
 the question at all The
 Congress of 1815 at Vienna
 settled the question of inter
 national law governing the exit
 from navigable waters The question
 has never been revived since
 Brazil undertook to revive it
 with regard to the Amazon
 She undertook tö make treaties
 with Peru with Bolivia and
 with New Granada conceding her
 right to close the navigation
 of the Amazon The treaty
 was rejected The treaty was
 called a treaty for fluvial
 navigation Mr Clay who was
 then our minister at Peru
 wrote an able argument against
 it It was defeated in
 Bolivia in Peru and in
 New Granada as conflicting with
 the established ciples of international
 taw as settled by the
 Con gress of Vienna in
 1815 so that the question
 of the frec navigation of
 navigable waters is not in
 volvcd in it It is
 conceded that you may impose
 police regulations to prevcn t
 smuggling and fraud but you
 cannot stop the navi ration
 Hence that question is settled
 and I say to the
 whole Nort h west entertain
 no fears upon that question
 Mis souri is as deeply
 i terested in the navigation
 of the Mississippi river as
 any other State except Louisiana
 and Louisiana by her ordinance
 of secession which I have
 here bcforc me has pub
 licly proclaimed she wilk not
 intcrferc with that free navigation
 Hence these are mere bugbears
 thrown in to timid persons
 that we can not cut
 off and divide the Mississippi
 valley 1 hope and trust
 it rnay never be divided
 yet circumstances may arise misconduct
 may be so great oppression
 so intolerable as to force
 us to divide and if
 we do divide had we
 not better divide peaceably than
 forcibly If we arc com
 pelled to divide had sve
 not better divide as hon
 orable thinking and intelligent mcn
 than as reckless brutes governed
 alone by instinct It is
 said by many herc that
 South Carolina has suffered no
 wroncr Maryland Virginia Ken tuck
 y and Missouri have sufiln
 ed it I know that
 Maryland Virginia Kentucky and Missouri
 havo suffered ton times as
 much as South Carolina ever
 did I might say a
 hundred timos as much but
 tbc fhct that she acts
 in advance whether we consider
 it hasty or inconsiderate or
 not proves that shc is
 noble patriotic and true in
 her im pulse She is
 acting for our benefit We
 tnay think a different policy
 would have better as I
 do think but it shows
 her regard for a great
 i question involving all of
 us together and not only
 ail of us but the
 whole of the human race
 It is not a question
 of slaves only The very
 princi ple that wi l
 permit them to attack one
 species of property against the
 Constitution and break it down
 wilf justify them in taking
 another species Union protecting the
 rights of the States and
 the of property and confiscating
 that also l he agra
 people of the States and
 I am really tired of
 hear I i pianism of
 the North will spread from
 the success of their attempt
 to break down slavery in
 the Ing Iono memorials and
 petitions and speeches I would
 South und every property holder
 of New York with nothing
 but Union Union P challcngc
 Barnwcll Rhett to answer whether
 he and Boston is as
 much interested in repressing is
 not in favor of the
 Union I would challenge this
 attack upon private property as
 I am Let Mr Yancey
 are you not for the
 Ijnion and they the populace
 rise let the mob gather
 let the im would both
 answer yes with as muchempha
 pulse be given to them
 and they will sav Why
 sis and sincerity as the
 Senator from Maine and shah
 one man have 15 000
 000 and we stand the
 Senator from New York But
 then I come here starving
 and begging for bread This
 feel to ask the question
 what Union do you want
 incr will be engendered Law
 abiding orderly The Union of
 the Constitution they would good
 people ought therefore to repress
 c very thing that leads
 to it We of the
 South ought to say How
 do you construc that Constitution
 repress it you of the
 North ought to repress it
 Then they separate Onc wants
 one kind of a con
 stitutional Union andtheotherwantsanotherkind and if
 it be not repressed the
 consequences will of a constitutional
 Union Now Mr President as
 we have arrived at thiis
 fearful crisis in our country
 s history let us have
 an honest understanding either a
 Union about i which there
 shall bc no controversy with
 regard to our respective rights
 or no Union and a
 sep aration That is what
 I say I have come
 to that point and I
 intend to act upon it
 No Union unless it bc
 a Union upon which we
 can all agree 1 do
 not want to be continually
 quarreling and come home to
 you in a more fearful
 degree than they can possibly
 corne to us While Missouri
 has suffered So much she
 has been the last to
 act yet that State will
 act The action however of
 Kentucky of Virginia I am
 sorry to say it and
 of Tennessee has been of
 the most disastrous character it
 has done no harm to
 Missouri but it has stimulated
 northern men to make speeches
 such as the KING of
 New York very violent domineering
 demanding threaten ing after he
 hears the returns ffbm Tennessee
 am sorry that Virginia hag
 lagged behind If ali these
 border States as they åré
 cafldd2 had Come right up
 to the mai k at
 once wd should have bad
 a settlement or a peaceful
 separation and we shall never
 have it until that is
 done Some persons say these
 southern States were precipitate Grant
 it I will not Stop
 to quarrel about that What
 are we to do Take
 things as we find them
 and shape our action according
 to the necessities of thc
 case We do not make
 the rain but if it
 rains we put up an
 our heads We do not
 make the sun shine bilt
 yet we will raise a
 parasol protect uS from its
 rays We did not make
 South Cätolinå go out of
 the Union It may have
 been hasty for aught I
 know I will not say
 it was or not What
 shall we do Take that
 coursc which is bcst ca
 culated to preserve our rights
 either in thee Union or
 in a new one What
 course ought that to be
 For every State to go
 out together I mean all
 tlié slaveholding States Do you
 say We desert our northerh
 friends No Our warm sympathies
 our high admiration for them
 will be as lasting as
 time but we can bcst
 serve them by serving d
 u solves in this rna
 ttår bcchuse if thc fifteen
 States were all to recede
 from the Union associate to
 gother and say to the
 North do this and we
 are with you again the
 Nortli would concede it to
 us but if some are
 going Off and we aren
 hesi tatino and higgling and
 dbubting it makes the North
 so confident in its power
 that they say let South
 Carolina Georgia Alabama Mississippi and
 Florida go Very well Just
 as sure as you let
 them go others will follow
 and what other Statcs will
 follow Every slaveholding State ex
 cept Delaware Maryland and Virginia
 I hm afraid of old
 Virginia She is so hwtating
 so timid walking on egg
 shells and afrTd she will
 mash them but just as
 surc as you live if
 no adjustment on honorable terms
 is made in a sat
 isfactory Inanncr Missouri Arkansas and
 Kan sas wills go Laughter
 Yes Kansas Do not be
 surprised at the use of
 that term Montgotn ery docs
 not rule there now He
 can make his rams upon
 Missouri and be driven back
 they can make attacks from
 Iowa and be driven back
 but the material interests of
 Kansas will force her to
 link her fortunes with Missouri
 But for the hot bed
 plan ts that have been
 planted in Kansas through the
 instrumentality of the Em igrant
 Aid Socicty Kansas would have
 been with Missouri this day
 and when these hot bed
 plants die out as they
 are fast dyincr out and
 sending peti lions to the
 Senator from raassachusetts be y
 cing for bread that they
 are starving as soon as
 they die out thc homogeneous
 character of the people will
 gradually bring them back into
 the arms of Missouri They
 are begging for bread and
 beg ing for an independent
 State government and then saying
 If you will not give
 us bread give us land
 we arc starvin y I
 might ask the qucstion can
 you cat land butit shows
 it is all a trick
 a fraud gotten up through
 this Emigrant Aid Soc icny
 It will die Out Every
 attempt at fraud will be
 exposed sooner or later and
 this miserab c attempt is
 now being exposed and the
 people arc beginning to Comprehend
 it Even the traveling agents
 who havc gone abroad beg
 ging for contributions to relieve
 poor starving Kansas have received
 more rifles more lead ana
 powder than they have bread
 and meat These are facts
 that I can prove in
 a court of justice I
 know what I say and
 no one who is acquainted
 with the subject will contradict
 me Do you not see
 therefore it is all a
 preparation to attack Mis souri
 I was informed by the
 Governor of Kan sas two
 weeks before the thing took
 place that he was in
 fearful apprehension that Montgomerv would
 make an attack on Missouri
 or the Chet Okee nation
 and so on down to
 L e xas for that
 was a part of their
 plan It was to circumscribe
 slavery and break it down
 through the Cherokee nation through
 the Choctaw nation througli thc
 Creek nation in the borders
 of Arkansas and then into
 Texas and that plan is
 not yet given up It
 is smothered it sleepeth for
 the time but it will
 be revived again unless we
 are prepared to meet it
 Now Mr President what Ought
 we to do Live in
 what we call afraternal relation
 yet compelled to keep arms
 in our hands or submit
 to depreda lions upon our
 property At the beginning of
 this scssion I propriety of
 havino an bb 868 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 12 arrncd
 police controlled by the States
 paid from the Federal Treasury
 to prevent these Invasions and
 cnforce the fugitive slave law
 all along the line separating
 the Élaveholding from the non
 slave holding States It was
 met with derision Very well
 When we divide as divide
 we must we shall have
 the same thing to do
 but we shall have it
 to do in a larger
 degree We shall then have
 to raise a very large
 army and a strong military
 force each watching the other
 and the slightest inter ruption
 may lead to a collision
 which will involve the whole
 country in a bloody war
 If my sug gestion had
 been received something might have
 been done but my suggestion
 was only intended as a
 means to check action and
 give time for re flection
 for if the sentiment expressed
 by the North in the
 election of Mr Lincoln is
 the set tled judgment of
 the North and if the
 practice of the North in
 stealing our negroes is the
 settled practice of the North
 I would not livc with
 you one day I_ would
 divide this hour this minute
 There are men it is
 true who say they would
 not steal a slave but
 they would not prevcntany body
 else from stealing one Thero
 are men who say they
 have no objection to the
 fugitive slave law but will
 they aid to execute it
 Not one Is not there
 then that dangerous miserable senti
 ment we cannot tolerate and
 live in unity with Perhaps
 it will be said the
 House of Repre sentatives passed
 a very fine resolution yesterday
 We have a right to
 notice the official proceedings of
 the House They passed a
 resolution that they would not
 interfere witli slavery in the
 States and also that they
 did not intend to do
 it embrac ing two points
 first they would not do
 it and second they did
 not intend to do it
 Now I wish to call
 the attention of the Senate
 to a little cir cumstancp
 that took pluce in this
 body not twelve months aö
 I asked the question of
 several north ern Senators why
 do you wish to circumscribe
 slavcry Why does it affect
 you to prevent the expansion
 and spreading of it m
 new Territories The answer was
 by hemming it in the
 slaves will gradually becotne so
 numerous that slavery will become
 so unprofitable or dangerous that
 the master perforcc will emancipate
 thus seeking to accomplish by
 indirect means the very thing
 they swear in the House
 they do not desire to
 do by direct means That
 is the purpose of every
 membcu of this Senate on
 the Republican side If it
 is not I would like
 for some onc to rise
 and r i hey have
 avowed it No one has
 answer me I have charged
 it upon them Some denied
 it of them were honest
 enough to confess it OLhers
 chose to sit under the
 charge thereby giv ing it
 a confession Therefore to say
 We do not intend to
 make adirectattack upon your State
 but we will bring to
 bear a train of circumstances
 that will break down slavery
 in your State is just
 as base and as infarnous
 as if you raised an
 army to attack us in
 the Slate You arc attack
 incr the Stale of Missouri
 every day you talk of
 enforcing the fugitive slave law
 you know it is not
 done and when you say
 you occasionally enforce it you
 know ulso that nineteen out
 of twenty never come to
 the cogni zancc of thc
 Mr SEWARD How would you
 enforce the respect to those
 that never come to the
 law in cocrniz anee of
 the law Mr GREEN I
 will tell you Your abolition
 societies fifty dollars a head
 for every one stolen and
 taken to the North would
 punish those societies and if
 you were a Union lovinc
 r eople und observcd your
 oath you would do it
 Applause in the galleries The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The galleries will
 be cleared if the disturbance
 is repeated Mr GREEN Why
 sir no ever had a
 good opinion of the law
 whel i ho felt the
 halter manfully they have been
 cut down as with a
 tended to be very mad
 about it but the Kentuckian
 sharp scythe one by one
 until every one must go
 and why Because there is
 a sentiment in culcated there
 which is in direct conflict
 with their i opinions You
 have got to go to
 Mr BRIGHT you have already
 gone to Mr FITcH and
 every one of you will
 go Yes sir as the
 Senator from New York said
 the irrepressible conflict will go
 on What did he mean
 by that doctrine I do
 not suppose he meant a
 bloody war for he is
 not a man Of war
 he is a man of
 words What kind of conflict
 then did he mean Why
 acon tinual agitation of the
 question until they get us
 in such trepidation and fear
 that out of regard for
 personal safety we would sell
 our negroeS or emancipate them
 or run them off and
 gradually work it down Missouri
 first Maryland next Virginia next
 until vou crowd them down
 to the last extrcmity That
 is the irrepressible con and
 yet his friends in the
 other House flict vote that
 they do not intend to
 interfere with slavery in tbc
 States Can that Senator reconcile
 his doctrine of the that
 all must be slave or
 irrepressible conflict nil free with
 an honest understanding of the
 vote of the House yesterday
 that they did not intend
 to interfere with slavery in
 the States Can any body
 do it There is a
 fraud in it There is
 a system inaugurated to lull
 to stop and suspend action
 in the border States and
 if I had the voice
 ofa Boanerges I would speak
 to old Virginia to rouse
 herselfup and go to work
 and not rest upon fancied
 security and not content herself
 with these vague promises ail
 th rown out for the
 purpose of staying her action
 So I would say to
 Kentucky r l ennessee and
 North Carolina For Missouri I
 need not speak She is
 ready to act she intends
 to act and her duty
 and her Interest prompt her
 to act and she will
 Now sir it is for
 the purpose of trying to
 come to some fair understanding
 that we ought to dis
 cuss this question and not
 to inflame the passions of
 either side Iccnnme nd the
 spirit that prmnpted the honorable
 Senator from Kentucky in offering
 his propositions not because I
 hope any good rc sull
 from them for I do
 not I desire a good
 re If the sult but
 do not entertain any hope
 of it amendments hc proposes
 were all adopted to day
 unanimously by all the States
 of the Union and the
 same fi cling continued to
 exist that now ex ists
 in the Abolition party and
 the same practices were kept
 up they would not be
 worth o nc single straw
 As I said to the
 Scr ator from New I
 larup shire Mr CLARK I
 believe it was I say
 now received the 6800 reward
 and gave the Aboli tionist
 one half I hat is
 the only instance that I
 ever heard of where an
 Abolitionist interposed to catch a
 negro Laughter I am not
 tålking fiction am simply statincr
 plain naked facts to illustrate
 the enormity of the attacks
 that are made upon us
 What would any northern man
 say if he had to
 pay such rc wards for
 the recovery of his property
 It is sometimes said you
 do not recover all the
 horses that escape No but
 have you ever known an
 honest community employed in the
 business of stealing horses or
 preventing the recapture of stolen
 horses Yet you think your
 community is honest who are
 engaged in doing this with
 re I own slaves jn
 Michigan this gard to slaves
 hay It would be worth
 more than my life to
 go for them Will any
 Senator say he owns prop
 ertyinMissouri and that he is
 afraid togo aftcrit Now if
 this statc of things is
 to continue if this feeling
 is to be permanent had
 we not better separate I
 say we have a retraction
 of northern sentiment or a
 separation There is no use
 of talking We cannot have
 peace we can not maintain
 our trust we cannot maintain
 our honor unless there is
 that retraction shall be the
 last to separate from the
 Union if I can help
 it but I think the
 more speedy the action of
 the border States is the
 better the prospect of a
 reac tion in the northern
 mind I think so because
 hear the ratnpant talk of
 northern Senators since they see
 a probability that the border
 States are going to hesitate
 and poor old Virginia is
 lag ging behind when she
 ought to have been fore
 It is true she was
 not fore most in the
 work most in the Revolution
 but she came up man
 fully to it She has
 always been true ever since
 but why this hesitation this
 vacillation and this doubtful position
 which encourages the North and
 dampens the ardor of the
 South You all know this
 thing has got to be
 settled in one of two
 ways cither separation or an
 honorable ad justment and say
 there can be no honorable
 adjustment which will be satisfactory
 and pro tective in its
 character unless there is a
 retraction of northern sentiment True
 you may plant an army
 along the line and my
 idea of putting that police
 force there was simply to
 put it there until the
 time for reaction had occurred
 and when that time had
 passed and no reaction had
 taken place then I was
 for I was willing to
 resort to every ex separation
 pcdient l am Ykn to
 give the North tirne place
 the prescrit Constitution is good
 enough as good and opportunity
 for repentance for they need
 it as want it as
 good us anybody ought 10
 desire it We have not
 livcd up to it Plain
 and pal pnble provisi01 ls
 of it are violated with
 impu nity and not a
 representative of that party in
 this Chamber will say ho
 will execute it If they
 will not execute it will
 they execute the Constitution as
 proposed to bc anaended by
 the honorable Sen atop from
 Kentucky Would any Republican Senator
 raise his iinger to execute
 the fucritive slave law then
 any morc than he would
 now You say you impose
 a penalty upon the States
 if there be a rescue
 by a mob As I
 have stated the mob rescues
 one and nineteen slip through
 law and elude detection and
 the fingers of the are
 spirited away through the instrumentality
 of those underground railroads and
 fifty dollars a head arc
 paid for them by the
 Abolition societies I have heard
 of but two being taken
 tor a Iono while and
 I will relate that circumstance
 to give you an idca
 of the honesty and morality
 and re ligion of some
 of the Abolitionists One of
 them was livino over in
 Illinois Two nco roes escaped
 from Missouri on one side
 of the river There was
 a Kentuckian living close by
 and the owner went over
 to the Kentuckian and draw
 I believe that is in
 Hudibras somewhere said to him
 I have offered 800reward for
 these two necrroes they will
 be sure to come to
 that Mr ANTHONY Something like
 it it is not simply
 the Abolitionist s house for
 he keeps a station on
 the Mr GREEN Now sn
 courts not sin lply the
 liberty bills not simply undereround
 railroad l he Kentuckian went
 r llhese are over to
 the Abolitionist and told him
 about it and the official
 acts of which i complain
 but the bloom as the
 miners would say that blos
 I said Now I will
 give you half of the
 reward som out It is
 the deep seated mind the
 sentiment if you will take
 them forme Well said he
 I will tell vou what
 I will do it will
 not do för that has
 been inculcated at the North
 through the instrumel talit y
 of politicians teachers of schools
 me to catch them for
 you but I will detain
 them tract societies and everything
 that you can con bere
 longenough for you to come
 and take them If they
 repent not I would then
 spew them out of my
 mouth A would let them
 go and I would resort
 to adequate means to protect
 ourselves with ourselves and yet
 when I did that I
 would not draw the sword
 I would not point a
 cannon to wards them I
 would not present a bayonet
 would not make a warlike
 movement but I would be
 ready for any action that
 they might take think the
 time for settling questions by
 physical force has passed In
 this age of Christianity of
 civilization and of refincmcnt we
 ought to be able to
 discuss questions and adjust thetn
 by reason by aBru ment
 by compromise and not by
 military power and no rnilitary
 power on land or sea
 ought ever to be used
 except in self defense That
 IS justi fiable I would
 therefore if I had the
 right to i counsel the
 southern States beg them to
 bear with Fort Sumter for
 a time though held by
 a foreign Government to see
 if l he question could
 not be ad justed without
 force butfor a foreign Government
 to hold a fort within
 our own confines never i
 would concede as right Let
 us keep the peace let
 us practice forbearance let us
 interchange opinions an l when
 we arrive at that point
 which satisfies us that we
 cannot agree that we cannot
 live together on terms of
 peace and equality let us
 bid each other farewell and
 separate as hon i orable
 men and not as belligerents
 If that is not done
 fearful consequences may If armies
 are to be brought in
 conflict result the sturdy men
 of the North and the
 valiant men of the South
 with all the improvements of
 mod I ern warfare with
 all the equipments and appoint
 i i mcnts of well
 organized armies most föarfal I
 he came there He took
 them in he bloody and
 unfortunate will be the issue
 I x vouid ceive of
 which underlies those popular political
 I here is not entertained
 them gave them to eat
 and sent his say il
 dic ations stronger than ali
 of it one that dares
 run counter to it and
 when our boy over to
 the Kentuckian and the Kentuckian
 Oh Heaven my bleeding country
 savo noble friends over on
 this side have stood up
 so returned and got them
 The Abolitionist pre Is there
 no hand on High to
 shield the brave 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE It is fcapfül
 to contemplate and yet as
 fearful and unfortunate as it
 is we are drifting along
 not dc signedly but we
 are gradually drift ing along
 up to the fearful catastrophe
 How are we to arrest
 it By such speeches as
 the Senator from New York
 has made No they stimulate
 opposition I I am practicing
 forbearance on the other side
 when tell you sucl speeches
 as his are driving the
 country to madness and doing
 more harm than he can
 ever do good in his
 life So with the Senator
 from Maine Mr FESSENDEN in
 his plausible manner of speaking
 He too led off m
 a vein tending precisely in
 the same direction Now Mr
 President we have a fearful
 respons ibility resting upon us
 This Senate cannot amend the
 Constitution This Senate can makc
 no ad justmcnt This Senate
 had better let the subject
 sleep All that is said
 is calculated to stimulate one
 side or the other We
 had better make the ordinary
 appropriations and let the people
 and the States through propei
 conventions undcrtakc It is no
 use to say that the
 work of adjustment no adjustment
 can be made it is
 no use to say It
 is a very doubt an
 adjustment can be made fut
 question to solve We as
 a Senate and as a
 Congress can do no good
 yet the motive that prompts
 the resolutions of the Senator
 from Ken tucky is good
 and I commend it only
 for this it may perhaps
 hold tbe countrv still reasoll
 long enough for that reflection
 which will bring the northern
 mind rieht Without that change
 the northern mind I would
 not accept any con stitution
 to be associated with any
 such people as they havc
 proved themselves to be in
 the past Ifwe can quiet
 the public mind if can
 throw out suggestions which will
 induce the North to pause
 and say they will enforce
 the fugitive slave law they
 guaranty us the protection of
 our rights thcy will secure
 to us all that thc
 Consti tution now promises and
 if we sce there is
 a dis indeed I position
 to do what they say
 then would love this Union
 We have grown with time
 we havc increased with age
 we have pros percd under
 every circumstance we have over
 thirty million people we have
 productions innu merable we have
 commerce manufactures civil ization Christianity
 and advancement in all that
 makes a people good and
 great War will re verse
 thc action of all this
 and throw us baclg war
 will brutalize war will barbarize
 war will throw us back
 more than a century in
 the short It demoralizes the
 people space of five years
 it eats up the substance
 of the people it brutal
 izcs the feelings and it
 is the last resort but
 sometimes a fearful necessity Now
 Mr President the object of
 my few re marks is
 this as this proposed amendment
 to the naval bill comes
 at such an inopportune timc
 comes when we have no
 money in the Tl reasury
 and comes from those who
 are refusing to dojus ticc
 to little claimants because they
 have no IT oney comes
 when we do not need
 it and comes with an
 avowal that it is intended
 to coerce the weaker States
 I think I am compelled
 to oppose it on the
 1 gcncral principles which I
 have announced shall continue to
 do so and whether successful
 or not time will prove
 whether it wili accomplish the
 ends that the friends of
 the measure expect No threats
 no petitions no demands but
 jus ticc Let the whole
 of the southern States act
 together as a unit and
 act speedily and negotiate with
 the North as equals Sir
 I would not take a
 proposition that we had forced
 upon the North The North
 ought not to take a
 proposition that I want to
 ne they had forced upon
 the South gotiate as equals
 the fifteen southern States the
 equal s of the eighteen
 on the other side Several
 SENATORS Nineteen Mr GREEN Nineteen
 now but that other one
 is going to be on
 our side and that is
 the reason I lei Kansas
 pass so easily Mr Presi
 dent everybody desires an adjustment
 everybody desires peace and harmony
 everybody desires a continuance of
 the Union but when we
 come to talk about what
 is the Union and what
 are our rights in it
 we commence to differ Let
 us go to work and
 settle the question if we
 can Do it and every
 slaveholding State will join at
 once First That any State
 has the right to Recede
 Second It that right is
 exercised wrongfully the State alone
 is responsible Third When any
 State does in fact secede
 all the fixtures in her
 limits belong to the State
 Fourth Every effort to save
 the Union and preserve the
 peace of the country should
 be made before any other
 remedy is resorted to And
 finally when ali efforts fail
 let us part in peace
 and let each section pursue
 the course and line of
 policy deemed best for the
 good of the people and
 to tho God of justice
 not of war I commit
 the fate of our beloved
 country The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question is Will the Senate
 concur in the amendment made
 as in Committee of the
 Whole Mr MASON called for
 the yeas and nays and
 they were ordered and being
 taken resulted yeas 27 nays

 was agreed to Mr G
 WIN I move an amendment
 as an additional section and
 bc it further enacted That
 so much of an aet
 enti tled An a6t naking
 appropriations Ibr the year ending
 the 30th June 1855 approvcd
 August 5 1854 as requires
 the Navy agent at San
 Francisco to disc rarge the
 duties of purser as well
 as of Navy agent be
 and the same is ner
 eby repealed I will state
 briefly that in 1854 the
 Navy agent at San Francisco
 was required to perform the
 du ties of purser at
 the navy yard on Marc
 Island Since that Limo the
 navy yard has increased its
 business to very large extent
 It is thirty miles from
 San Francisco It is the
 only navy yard in the
 United States that has no
 purser This is merely to
 repeal the clause requiring the
 Navy agent at San Francisco
 to discharge the duties of
 purser at the navy yard
 and to have a purser
 there as at all tho
 other navy yards of the
 United I have shown it
 to the chairman of the
 States Committee on Naval Affairs
 and to the other members
 of tho committee and there
 is no objec It is
 merciy to put ihat tion
 to it on their part
 yard in the same position
 as others The amendment was
 agreed to Mr ANTHONY Is
 it in order now to
 move tbc ainendment which was
 rejcctcd as in Com mittee
 of the Whole providing for
 an Assistant Secretary c t
 the Navy The PRESIDING OFFICER
 It is Mr ANTHONY i
 renew that amendment and ask
 for the yeas and nays
 upon it It was voted
 down by a light vote
 yesterday I do not want
 to discuss it The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The amend mcnt x
 vill be read The Secretary
 read it as follows and
 be it further enacted That
 the President of the United
 States sbail by and with
 the advice and cOuscnt of
 the Senate appoint froin tho
 linc of the Navy on
 the active list an Assistant
 Secretary of tbc Navy whose
 salary shall bc the shore
 duty pay ofa captain and
 who acting under the authority
 and dircction of the Sccrctary
 of the Navy shall ho
 charged with the discipline and
 efficiency of the naval service
 with tbe detailing of officers
 and with such other duties
 in relation to the administration
 of its affairs as thc
 Secretary of the Navy may
 designate The yeas and nays
 were ordered Mr RICE 1
 should like to ask the
 Senator from Rhode Island if
 the appointment of this off
 cer by the President will
 take from him his rank
 in the Navy Can he
 hold two offices at once
 Mr ANTHONY His position will
 be the same in that
 respect as the post captains
 who are now at the
 head of bureaus Mr RICE
 Are they confirrned by the
 Sen ate I think it
 is a question that should
 be looked into Mr ANTHONY
 This amendmentwasagreed to by the
 Committee on Naval Affairs unani
 mously It was proposed yesterday
 in the Sen ate acting
 as in Committee of the
 Whole and I thought from
 voted down without a division
 the course of the debate
 that the sense of the
 Sen Let them come together
 in concert make their propositions
 as honorable States to the
 others If ate was in
 favor of it and therefore
 1 have re I do
 not wish to discuss it
 newed it then we cannot
 agree our separation is perma
 Mr RICE I simply wish
 to call the attention nent
 and peaceable This is my
 whole purpose and I will
 state in II of the
 Senator from Rhode Island to
 this one II fact if
 an offccr of the Navy
 should be appointed conclusion my
 positions by the President as
 Assistant Secretary Of Ohe and
 with the advice and consenvo
 f tbe Senate does he
 not lose his rank for
 mer commission as an officer
 of the Navy Mr HALE
 Will the Senator allow me
 to answer Mr RICE Certainly
 Mr HALE I have never
 had my attention called to
 that point before but I
 know what tho practice has
 been There wag Captain Ingraham
 who was appointed at the
 head of a bureau Mr
 FESSENDEN And there is Commodore
 Smith Mr HALE He is
 there now but Captain Ingraham
 served at the head ofa
 bureau for some time and
 after that was ordered to
 the Mediter ranean Mr RICE
 Was he confirmed by the
 Senate That is the point
 to which I wish to
 call attention Mr THOMSON Captain
 Magruder was afterwards appointed and
 his nommation bas never come
 before the Senate according to
 my recollection Mr RICE Thatis
 the point to which I
 wished to direct the attention
 of the Senate Mr HALE
 The nominations of heads of
 burcaus I believe do not
 come before the Senate and
 they do not Iosc their
 place in the line of
 the Navy by being appointed
 to those positions Mr CAMÉRON
 As 1 understand it the
 law which authorized the appointment
 of these hcads of bureaus
 only authmuzed thc President to
 take from the Navy offcers
 of a particular rank and
 place them at the head
 of those bureaus which had
 in charge the business of
 the Navy They are there
 in the regular exercise of
 their duty as naval omcers
 just in the same way
 as the Presi dent could
 order them from one navy
 yard to an other That
 is a very different matter
 from this proposition which contemplates
 the making of a new
 offcer t o be selected
 from the Navy Of coufse
 if he is appointed to
 this place and con firmed
 by the Senate as civil
 officers generally are he must
 leave the line of the
 Navy Mr GRIMES i move
 to amend the amend mcnt
 by striking out that portion
 of it which re quires
 this officer to be confirmed
 by the Senate Mr RICE
 i will say to the
 Senator from Iowa that his
 amendment does not meet the
 ob iection The proposition is
 to create an offce and
 if the President has power
 to appoint an officer of
 the Navy to fill this
 offce and does ap point
 one that officer certainly loses
 his rank and commission in
 the Navy It might be
 worded so as to give
 the President the power to
 detail an offcer of the
 Navy to perform certain duties
 during I merely make the
 pleasure of the Executive the
 suggestion in order that the
 matter may be determined understandingly
 Mr PEARCE I can see
 no reason why we should
 make this to a class
 of cases which are all
 on the same footing We
 require now the Assistant Secretary
 of the Treasury to be
 nominated to and confirmed by
 the Senate believe the law
 creating the AsSistant Secretary ship
 of State required that in
 the beginning was not so
 in regard to the Assistant
 Secretary of thc Treasury atfirst
 He wasoriginallyappointed by the Secretary
 of the Treasury without the
 confirmation of the Senate but
 a few years ago in
 1857 I think it was
 we passed an item in
 one of the appropriation bills
 by which we required that
 thercaftcr the Assistant Secretary oftheTreas
 uryshould be nominated to and
 confirmed by the I Senate
 Those captains who hold positions
 at the head of bureaus
 are nominated to and confirmed
 II by the Senate Therc
 was one the other day
 not a fortnight ago the
 present chief of the Bureau
 of Hydrography and Ordnance was
 nominated to and confirmed by
 the Senate Captain Magruder I
 see no reason at all
 for this amendillent to ex
 cept this new office from
 the general operation of the
 rule in all such cases
 Mr GRIMES I withdraw my
 amendment to thé amendment Mr
 SIMMONS 1 hope it will
 be renewed It is perfectly
 competent for Congress to invest
 the President with the power
 of appointing any of these
 subordinate officers without the consent
 of the Senate The Constitution
 gives Congress that power and
 if there is any embarrassment
 in regard to his rank
 about his being confirmed by

 be stricken out and let

 as for any other service
 870 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 12 Mr HALE That would
 notmeet the objection stated by
 thc Senator from Minnesota r
 do not apprehend that the
 fact of thc omcer being
 con firmed by the Senate
 or not would affect it
 in the slightest degree because
 as the Senator from Rhode
 ISIand well says Congress may
 by law invest the President
 with the power of appointing
 offcers without sending their names
 here for con firmation The
 suggestion that is made by
 the Senator from Maryland I
 think a sufficient an swer
 to this question and that
 is that the heads of
 the bureaus in the Navy
 Department arc nom inatcd by
 the President and confirmpd by
 the Senate and they do
 not thereby lose their place
 in the line of the
 Navy I apprehended that that
 was the case but did
 not remember it Since the
 matter has been callcd up
 however my im pression is
 that Captain Ingraham s namo
 was sent in to the
 Senate Mr PEARCE Certainly it
 was Mr HALE He was
 nominated by the Pres ident
 confirmed by the Senate and
 served in thc Bureau of
 Ordnance as an officer nominated
 by the Prcsident and confirmed
 by the Senate for scvcral
 years and when they had
 done Wilh him there he
 was transferred from that bureau
 and Bent to the Mediterranean
 and he has lately come
 home from there and resigned
 Mr THOMSON If the Senator
 will me I will road
 a section from the aet
 to reor ranize the Navy
 I epartment of the United
 States ap proved August 31
 1842 SEC 3 and be
 it further enacted That the
 President of the United States
 by and with the advice
 and consent of the Senate
 shall appoint from the captains
 in thc naval service a
 chief each of the Bureaus
 ot Navy yards and Docks
 and of Ordnance and Hydrography
 who shall each receive a
 salary ot 3 500 per
 annum in lieu of an
 other compcnsation svhatcvcr in thc
 naval servicc and in like
 Jnauner appoint a ellicfof the
 Bureau Equipment and l cpairs
 VhD shall be a skillful
 naval con also appoint a
 cliicf 01 hc Bureau o
 struetor and shall Provisions and
 Clothing who shali each receive
 his services 3 000 per
 anuuen and shall in like
 Inanncr ap point f rtnn
 the surtre ons of tbc
 Navy a chief the Bureau
 or Medicine and Surgery ho
 shall receive for his services
 2 500 per annum It
 occurs to me that all
 this difficulty would be cured
 by a small amendment declaring
 that the President of the
 United States should have the
 pov per of taking from
 the list of captains in
 the Navy a person to
 act as Assistant Secretary of
 the Navy Mr GRIMES I
 do not yvant it confined
 to captains an officer in
 Lhc Mr THOMSON say Navy
 Will my friend accept such
 an amend men t Mr
 ANTHONY Certainly I think I
 can meet the views of
 Mr HALE gentlemen by proposing
 this as a substitute for
 the amendment I hat the
 Presid ent t hc Unitcd
 States Shall appoint an officer
 in the naval serviec as
 Assistant Secretary of of bureaus
 in t he naval Navy
 in iikc rnnnner as the

 So the amendment vr as
 rejected N h GRIMES 1
 wish now to offer an
 amend ment in lieu of
 the one that v ras
 offered by the Naval Committee
 yesterday in relation to pay
 masters The proposition now offered
 is similar the officers so
 retired shall be the waiting
 orders pay of their respective
 grades as it existed prior
 to the passage of the
 act of Congress to regulate
 the pay of the Navy
 approved June 1 1860 and
 be it further enacted That
 ail vacancies in the corps
 of payunasters caused by the
 Oregoinø section shall be filled
 in accordance with established usage
 Provided The num ber of
 paymasters on the activc list
 shall not exceed the number
 authorized by existing laws Mr
 HUNTER If 1 understand it
 this is not to increase
 the number of paymasters it
 only allows the substitution of
 others on the active list
 for those who may be
 permanently disabled Mr GRIMES That
 is it Mr HALE I
 am sorry to be obliged
 to differ with rny friend
 from Iowa who is a
 member of the Naval Committee
 on this proposition but I
 am opposed to it entirely
 and totally on principle and
 I think the Senato will
 be too Thisdoctrine of retiring
 offcers and pay ing them
 salaries when they are unfit
 for service has been confined
 hith erto to officers in
 the Army and Navy upon
 the ground that their special
 service and education were such
 as to disqualify them fronl
 rcnderino any other service in
 the community than that to
 which they had been educated
 and that when they have
 grown old and become sick
 or infirm in the national
 service in that particular branch
 to which they have devoted
 themselves it is but just
 that the Government should support
 them in their I do
 not agree to that prin
 sickness and old age ciple
 I think it is vicious
 and wrong but we have
 inherited it from Great Britain
 and I am not going
 I am content to have
 to run my head against
 it it as one of
 the evils which we cannot
 get rid of at present
 I think it is a
 vicious systern These pursers however
 come under no such cat
 egory They are mere political
 appointments l hey are men
 who arc picked up by
 the Admin istration as a
 reward for political favors with
 no particular education at all
 to qualify them for the
 place appointed generally speaking for
 thc po litical service which
 they have rendered to the
 party When theyare unfit for
 service they ought to be
 dropped I supposc there arc
 some rncn who would be
 retire l under this if
 it were in the Navy
 five ad01 ted Who have
 not becn years Thcy were
 not fit to go thcrc
 when they were put there
 aud if you pass this
 amendment I tbc effect of
 it will bc to pension
 for life men who are
 not fit to be pursers
 now never vore fit and
 I am opposed never ought
 to have been there to
 it from beginning to end
 Mr RICE I agree with
 what the Senator from New
 T lampshire has said If
 you pension these pursers or
 paymasters as they are now
 calked men picked up out
 of civil life whose appoint
 ments arc mere political appointments
 you may go on and
 pension Indian agents military store
 keeljers paymasters and everybody else
 who holds un ofiice under
 the Government the amendment will
 be rejected Mr GRIMES I
 am not going to have
 any tro vers y with
 the Senator from New I
 lamp snipe or the Senator
 from Min nesota anybody c
 sc about this matter for
 have no particular F intcrest
 in it Vhe Senatc yesterdav
 decided that persons should be
 taken from civil Ii fö
 and should A proposition was
 then not be military men
 before tbc Senate to take
 Hien from the line of
 the service and think the
 Senator frorn Minnesota vot cd
 against it That imposes on
 the President or whoever may
 havo the appointing power the
 neenssity of taking civilians and
 hc may take politicians for
 aught I know I want
 to close the door a
 mainst his taking politicians but
 you force him to do
 it at least you forcc
 him to take men from
 civil life and put them
 in these places You must
 have somebody to perform the
 duties of pursers You now
 have fifteen men in the
 Navy I acting as pursers
 in direct violation of the
 law of to that in
 regard to sur eons and
 authorizes the I President to
 retire paymasters whenever they may
 become unfit for duty on
 the waiting orders pay of
 their grade prior to the
 passage of the last Navy
 pay bill substituting new paymasters
 in place of those who
 may be thus retired The
 Secretary read the amendment as
 follows Phat Lhc President of
 the Ulli Rnd be it
 further enacted ted States is
 hereby authorized to place on
 a retired Ii t any
 i t nastcr in the
 Navy who is now or
 lna v hereafter be i
 proved to bc permanently incapabie
 Crom physical or men till
 infinuity of further service at
 sca and that the puy
 of the United States You
 havc eight men in your
 service who are utterly incompetent
 This rop osition is simply
 to retire those men As
 I said before I do
 not care whether you do
 it or not It those
 men so as to ret
 eiffht efficient is to retire
 men indieu of them If
 it establishes a wron principle
 vote it down I have
 no particular in terest in
 it Mr RICE I will
 only say to my friend
 from Iowa that his State
 alone or my State alone
 will furnish pursers by the
 rnonth at one half v
 ha t the present pursers
 are get lincr to discharo
 e the duties and run
 the risk of being dismissed
 at the end of cvcry
 calendar month Mr GRIMES That
 may all be but howat
 e we going to got
 rid of these persons They
 are here we are paying
 them If the President should
 exercisc the povver to drop
 them there would be such
 a clamor raised by the
 Senator from New Hampshire who
 now opposes this proposition he
 would speak so eloquently of
 the enormity of such a
 thing that the very roof
 of the Capitol would bc
 raised We have seen examples
 of that before Mr CLINGMAN
 Ifi understand the amend ment
 it strikes Ine as a
 very extraordinary pro I should
 like to know what reason
 there vision is for this
 proposition as applied to thesc
 men that would not apply
 to cvcry old clerk to
 evcry old politician to our
 ox Prcsidents to the post
 masters ail over the country
 and to everybody else that
 has ever fillcd an offce
 Why is it that we
 should not maintain for life
 every man who has been
 in offcc if the principle
 of this amend ment be
 right The Senator from Minnesota
 says what is truc no
 doubt of every State in
 the Union as weH as
 of his own that we
 can got any number of
 competent officers for this kind
 of ser vice who witl
 bc glad to take the
 place for periods of ono
 or six months and expect
 nothing but to be turned
 out at the end of
 that time ft is my
 experience and I suppose that
 of most of the Senators
 here that when you succeed
 in getting an office here
 for one of your constituents
 this remark only applies to
 a portion of them be
 holds on to his clerkship
 for a year or two
 and then he comes to
 thc conclusion that he might
 make more by getting this
 particular offce of purser in
 the Navy and he worries
 you for six or twelve
 months until you get it
 for him and novv when
 these men are to be
 turned out you have to
 pay them for life That
 is the amount of it
 Mr HALE I have never
 had any experience in getting
 any ii Laughter Mr CLINGMAN
 The gentleman has been on
 the wrong side I do
 not believe I have got
 any in butl have tried
 often and been very much
 annoyed about it Since I
 have been in Congress 1
 think 1 havc novcu known
 a single civil office abolished
 We create them from time
 to time and increase the
 salaries but no one is
 reduced or ever will be
 reduced perhaps If it comes
 to that pass that men
 are to have offccs from
 time to timo and the
 salaries increased and then when
 they happen to be turned
 out of a mere civil
 post that anybody can fill
 or at least a million
 of men in the United
 States think them selves capable
 of filling this I do
 not know what pass we
 shatl come to Mr GRILMES
 1 will the question of
 the honorablc Senator from North
 Carolina He wants to know
 what difference there is betwccn
 the case of theSe pursers
 and Congressmen an we are
 cyoinff to retire these crentlemen
 or leave of absence pay
 why we should not retire
 Con gressmen The difference is
 this most of the Congrcssrnen
 are partially insane when they
 come here Laughter The men
 whom we propose to retire
 arc wholly insane and have
 become in sane while they
 have been serving the country
 on foreign stations Severed of
 them are insane as I
 understand Mr CLINGMAN Then why
 not send them to the
 lunatic asylums of the country
 and treat them as other
 lunatics Laugh ter Mr GRIIMES
 You may scnd them to
 luna tic asylums but after
 a man has been serving
 his country upon foreicpn stations
 exposing his life an l
 his health for the sa
 ke of the country it
 seems rather hard that you
 should merely put him into
 an insane asylum and let
 his family take care of
 itself But I call for
 a vote I am not
 particular about this thing T
 hc amendment was rejected The

 detrimental to should not venture
 to ask for a loan

 latter motion was agreed to
 LIABILITY OF SHIP OWNERS Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 ask the
 unan imous consent of the
 I lousc to report back
 from i the Committec on
 Commerce Senato bill No 437
 to amend an act entitled
 An act to limit the
 lia bility of ship owners
 and for other purposes I
 object but I am willing
 that the bill shall be
 read for information Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE 1 will explain the
 bill in a few moments
 It need not be read
 by the Clerk A bill
 was passed March 3 1851
 and became then a law
 limiting the liability of ship
 owners There is a provision
 in the fourth section of
 that law which enables those
 who become liable to the
 extent of their interest in
 a ship or vessel to
 trans fer their personal liability
 by an assignment to the
 ship itself that assignment to
 be made to trustees in
 behalf of the claimant But
 it has been discovered that
 when assigning their interest in
 the ship ship owners intertöre
 with their obliga tions of
 charter party and delivery of
 cargo under bills of lading
 Therefore they ask that when
 releasing themselves of this personal
 liability they may do so
 by giving a bond with
 sureties equal to its appraised
 value instead of their interest
 in the ship or vessel
 and that all proceedings shall
 from that time be assimilated
 to those ordinarily taken in
 admiralty actions in rem where
 bonds are given as is
 proposed by this amendment The
 object of the bill is
 to au thorize a bond
 of such a description instead
 of the assignment of the
 ship itself The Committee on
 Commerce havc reported an amendment
 to the bilk f the
 Senate to make more secure
 the inter ests of the
 claimants so that whenever the
 secu rity for any reason
 becomes insecure or im pawed
 the court shall upon the
 application of the claimant cause
 additional security to be given
 or that the owner shall
 take no benefit from the
 act Mr STANTON This is
 not the bill 1 sup
 posed it was I supposed
 it was the bill limiting
 the liability of ship owners
 engaged in foreign commerce The
 bili and amendment were read
 Mr STANTON If 1 understand
 that bill with the amendment
 it releases the claim upon
 thc vessel and substitutes for
 it a bond I think
 it questionablc whether any such
 thing as that ought to
 be done Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 answer to the gentleman
 from Ohio that it is
 the usual course obtaining in
 all our courts of admiralty
 in pro ceedings in rean
 and never within my experi
 ence has any damaøe occurred
 to claimants under such proceedings
 We ask merely that the
 usual course of judicial proceedings
 be adopted in this case
 which is adopted in all
 others Mr STANTON This is
 another step in that line
 of legislation which has been
 adopted of late excepting ship
 owners from liability as common
 curriers The community who are
 interested in the transportation of
 produce have by common law
 a claim upon the entire
 property of the owner of
 the ship and a licn
 upon the ship itself and
 that lien is being let
 up step by step at
 a time for the benefit
 of ship owners and of
 those engaged in commerce and
 think myself jt is a
 question able policy and I
 am inclined not to adopt
 it Mr TRAIN 1 object
 to that bill Mr JOHN
 COC1 1ftANE 1 call the
 previous question upon the passage
 of the bill Mr TRAIN
 1 object Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 It is too late to
 make an objection now The
 bill was read with out
 objection after my explanation The
 expla nation was full and
 now move the previous ques
 tion upon the amendment and
 upon the passacre of the
 bill The SPEAKER According to
 the rule the Chair thinks
 the objection comes too late
 Mr STANTON withdrew the objection
 upon the explanation of tho
 gentleman from New York but
 when I came to hear
 tho bill read it gave
 me some inklinøs that the
 explanation did not and had
 i heard the bill read
 before I withdrew my objection
 I should not have withdrawn
 it Mr JOHN COCHRANE Upon
 the tion of the gentleman
 from Ohio it was that
 I moved the previous question
 he havinffannounced in his place
 that it was too late
 to interpose objec tion I
 explained the bill as fully
 as it was in my
 power to do and as
 fully I believe as the
 bill itself could explain itself
 to any gentleman If the
 gentleman from Ohio did not
 fully perceive the object of
 the bill it was his
 fault I think cortainly not
 mine but yet I would
 not standin I the position
 of exacting from tho gentleman
 from Ohio such close attention
 in this presence as to
 acquire a just estimate of
 the hasty language of the
 explanation or even of the
 bill itself There fore withdraw
 the demand for the previous
 ques tion and suffer the
 objection of the gentleman from
 Ohio to prevail LOGAN ilUNTER
 Mr BINGHAM I ask leave
 now to call up the
 bill for the relief of
 Logan Hunter of Louis iana
 I stated to the House
 on a former occa sion
 that this bill had been
 recommended by the Attorney General
 of the United States that
 it had been recommended by
 the Secretary of the Interior
 that it had been recommended
 by the Comptroller of the
 Treasury and that it came
 to the House with the
 unanimous consent of the Committee
 on the Judiciary T be
 bill which was read directs
 that there be paid to
 Logan Hunter late district attorney
 of the United States for
 the district of Louisiana out
 of any money in the
 Treasury not otherwise ap propriated
 the sum of 5 000
 in full for his ser
 vices on behalf of the
 United States as United States
 district attorney in the several
 prosecutions heretofore instituted in Louisiana
 against Narciso Lopez and ot
 hers for violations of the
 United States neutrality laws by
 setting on foot military expeditions
 against the island of Cuba
 Mr BINGHAM move that the
 bill be en grossed and
 read a third time Mr
 KILGORE Is not the bill
 open to amend ment Mr
 BINGHAM 1 call the previous
 question Mr McCLERNAND That bill
 is not in yet I
 am not willing to vote
 for it until I know
 some thing more about it
 The SPEAKER This bill was
 before the House on a
 fbrmer occasion and it wras
 laid over with the understanding
 that it might be called
 up at some subsequent time
 Mr McCLERNAND Does not the
 bill con tain an appropriaüon
 The SPEAKER The bill was
 received time Mr BINGHAM It
 went over as unfinished business
 Mr McCLERNAND There was no
 agree ment at that time
 that the bill should be
 consid ered in the House
 The SPEAKER It was the
 understanding that it should be
 considered Iin the House as
 I am informed by the
 Clerk Mr BINGHAM 1 would
 remind the gentle man from
 Illinois that the honorable gentlernan
 from North Carolina Mr BRANCH
 at the time I reported
 the bill moved to rexer
 it to a Com mittee
 of the Whole House inasmuch
 as it con tained an
 appropriation He withdrew that mo
 tion in consideration that the
 bill should be allowed to
 go over as unfinished business
 Mr McCLERNAND claim is now
 pending before the Committee of
 Claims of the House Mr
 BINGHAM Will the gentleman from
 Illinois allow remind him that
 this claim has been recommended
 by the different Depart ments
 of the Govcrnmcnt that its
 payment has been delayed some
 nine years but has not
 passed by reason of the
 inattention of the Housc to
 the claim There is no
 reasonable objection to the passage
 of the bill and the
 question to day is simply
 whether the Congress of the
 United States will postpone indefinitely
 the just claim of an
 American citizen M STEVENS of
 Pennsylvania I would ask the
 gentleman whether the prosecution of
 these people was not a
 part of lhe offcial duty
 of the district attorney for
 the ordinary fees Mr BINGHAM
 It wasa part of his
 official duty but it so
 happened that there was no
 exist ing law by which
 his fees could be assessed
 and paid by the Department
 Mr McCLERNAND 1 believe the
 rules quire that the bill
 shall be sent to a
 Commitlee of the Whole I
 louse and I insist upon
 it Mr HOARD I desire
 to say that this ctaim
 of Logan Hunter and other
 claims of a like character
 are pending before the Committee
 of Claims Mr SICKLES Is
 the point decided whether this
 bill must go to a
 Committee the Whole House 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE SPEAKER The
 ne cessity of such reference
 wras waived upon the occasion
 when the bill was last
 before the House Mr SICKLES
 If point was not made
 it could not have been
 waived Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania
 I move that the bill
 be laid upon the table
 MI BOCOCK I suggest to
 the gentleman from Ohio that
 he postpone the consideration of
 this bikl The gentleman from
 New York says tho claim
 is now pending before the
 Committee of Claims Let that
 committee examine it and if
 at a future day the
 committee say they have examined
 it and that it is
 all right the House If
 the gentleman may bc willing
 to let it pass presses
 it to a vote now
 it can hardly pass Mr
 BINGHAM 1 have no desire
 to force a vote I
 have no more interest in
 it than any other metnber
 of the House The SPEAKER
 be no objection the bill
 will be laid informally on
 the table M BRANCH 1
 desire it understood that 1
 did not intend to preclude
 any one from insisting that
 this bill should be referred
 to a Committee of the
 Whole I never intended any
 such thing No objection being
 made thc bill was inform
 ally laid on the table

 orat whose instance has the
 bill been laid upon the

 has only been passcd by

 from Illinois intends to send

 The gentleman from Illinois has
 yielded the floor to me
 Mr MORRIS The gentleman from

 I hope the gentleman from
 Iowa will not press his

 of Illinois About a three
 quar ters of an hoar
 Mr HASKIN I insist on
 the reading of the Rcso
 vcd That the select cornmittec
 raised to inquire into the
 facts in regard to the
 abstraction of certain bonds report
 It proves the necessity of
 passitp the bill from the
 Interior Department have leave to
 report to mor which was
 offered to be introduced this
 morning by the chairman of
 the Committee of Ways and
 row the 12th instant at
 one O clock Mr BURCH
 The gentleman has made his
 Means and exposes the reason
 why the Treas ury is
 empty I insist that I
 have a right as a
 report Mr SICKLES There is
 no objection to the member
 of this House to hear
 the report read report but
 there is to its consideration
 at this The report was
 made the special order for
 to day am surprised that
 gentlemen at one o clock
 time The SPEAKER T hc
 gentleman has a right should
 be opposed to having this
 information con to make his
 report and it will be
 considered ailer veyed to the
 country The SPEAKER There is
 a special in the other
 inatter shall have been disposed
 of I have no disposi
 advancc of this one and
 when that is disposed Mr
 MORRIS of Illinois tion to
 thrust this report upon the
 House They of this will
 come up and the report
 can be read Mr HASKIN
 I do propose that the
 have already passed a resolution
 to receive it portshall be
 considered now butl propose to
 have the House docs not
 wish it submitted I am
 will ing to withhold it
 We were appointed to make
 it read from the Clerk
 s desk for information this
 investigation and are ready to
 make the re I desire
 also to say in this
 connection port that the report
 has been unanimously agreed to
 by the cornmittec Mr BOCOCK
 1 would the Calls to
 order Mr SICKLES 1 rise
 to a point oforder Mr
 HASKIN the report be read
 Tho SPEAKER The Chair decides
 the genllcman is not entitled
 to have it read now
 874 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 12 Mr HASKIN I appeal
 from the decision of the
 Chair Mr SICKLES 1 move
 to lay the appeal on
 the table Mr BURNETT How
 can the gentleman ap peal
 from the decision of the
 Chair unless the re port
 be first submitted I do
 not understand the gentleman from
 Illinois ag having submitted it
 yet There can be no
 appeal till the report is
 offered The SPEAKER The gentleman
 from Ken tucky will understand
 that the report has been
 received Mr MORRIS of Illinois
 I conceive that I have
 some little rights here particularly
 as a mom berdfthe select
 committee The resolution which I
 offered yesterday to make this
 a special order for One
 o clock to day certainly
 supersedes in its effect any
 special order that was previously
 made Hence when I submit
 the report and when its
 reading is called for the
 gentleman from Iowa is clearly
 out of order in objecting
 to it and endeav oring
 to break down the special
 order of yester day The
 special order on the Pacific
 railroad bill does not precede
 but follows that which was
 made yesterday Mr HASKIN I
 have the floor have I
 not The SPEAKER The Chair
 has decided the question and
 the gentleman from New York
 is entitled to take an
 appeal Mr HASKIN Then 1
 do appeal from the decision
 of the Chair and I
 hope the appeal will be
 sustained by the House The
 SPEAKER The Chair will state
 the ground of his decision
 There is a special order
 ending in of the gcntleman
 from Iowa Mr CURTIS 51
 he gentleman from Iowa has
 the floor assiTncd him by
 the Chair on the Pa
 cific railroad i ill After
 the gentleman got the floor
 the gentleman from Illinois Mr
 MORRIS claimed the right to
 make his report saying that
 there was a special order
 to that effect The Chair
 thinks he cannot take the
 floor from the gen tlcman
 from Iowa nor supersede the
 special order that was then
 under consideration but as soon
 as this special order is
 disposed of thc report of
 thc select committee will be
 in order Mr A DRAIN
 I move that the special
 order on the Pacific railroad
 bill be postponed till after
 the reception and reading of
 thc report made by the
 gentleman from Illinois The SPEAKER
 The gentleman from New Jersey
 has not the floor for
 that purpose The gentleman from
 New York Mr HASKIN appeals
 from the decision of the
 Chair Mr SICKLES I move
 to lay the appeal on
 thc table Mr MORRIS of
 Illinois Iwantto make additional remark
 if the gentleman from Iowa
 will yield me thc floor
 for that purpose I think
 thc Chair has misapprehended thc
 order of facts When the
 gentleman froin Iowa stated that
 hc lcmanded the special order
 it was two or three
 minutes befm c one o
 clock I arose stated that
 a special order had been
 made by the House yesterday
 to receive the report of
 thc select com Illittec on
 the abstracted bonds at one
 o clock and inasmuch as
 it was about that time
 I was desirous beföre the
 special order or the Pacific
 railroad bill 01 the regular
 order of business should comc
 up to get the floor
 to subrnit the rc port
 of the select committee Hence
 the gcntle man from Iowa
 waived his right even if
 hc had the precedence to
 enforce his claim in favor
 of the special order which
 he has specially in charge
 Under these circumstances again repeat
 that I think there is
 a misapprehension in regard to
 the order of facts and
 that the report which I
 sub mitted at one o
 clock is now before the
 House for consideration I desire
 to extend every courtesy to
 the gentleman from Iowa but
 let me tell him that
 there is as much interest
 felt in this report and
 in the facts pertaining to
 the abstraction of bonds from
 the Interior Department as there
 is in his bill and
 a good deal more although
 the gentleman from Iowa seems
 to have that one dis
 tinct idea in his head
 and thinks of nothing else
 from day to day and
 from hour to hour büt
 the Pacific railroad which is
 t o deplete the Treasury
 of Nir CURTIS 1 thank
 the gentleman for the cornplimcnt
 hc pays rne wish to
 say in regard to his
 own rcport that I gavc
 way for him to pre
 sent it I extended to
 him all the courtesy due
 to his report The Chair
 has decided that he had
 a right to report He
 has reported and the gens
 tleman may have it ordered
 to be printed The gentleman
 s report will come in
 immedi ately after the Pacific
 railroad bill shall have been
 disposed of I think that
 inasmuch as the gen tlernan
 s report requires no action
 while actionis required upon the
 Pacific railroad bill we should
 go on with tho consideration
 of that bill Mr FARNSWORTH
 Is this appeal debat able
 The SPEAKER It is not
 The Chair will remark that
 the report of the gentleman
 from Illi nois was not
 made a special order Leave
 to report was merely given
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 would
 suggest that the report bc
 printed and be allowed to
 ap pear in the columns
 of the Daily Globe The
 SPEAKER The Chair will say
 that the Pacific railroad bill
 was made the special order
 for to day The report
 of the gentleman from Illi
 nois was not made a
 special ordcr but loave was
 given him to report The
 Chair has given him leave
 and the report bas been
 received but the Chair does
 not feel authorized to suspend
 the special order for the
 consideration of that report Mr
 McCLERNAND 1 make this point
 of order The SPEAKER The
 Chair will state that there
 is one point of order
 pending which has not been
 disposed of Mr HASKIN I
 ask for the vote upon
 my appeal Mr SICKLES There
 is no appeal pending It
 could not have been received
 because there was nothing before
 the House on which an
 appeal could be based Mr
 McCLERNAND My point of ordcr
 is this I understand the
 Chair to say that he
 has received thc report of
 the gentleman from Illinois The
 SPEAKER The Chair did so
 state Mr Now 1 insist
 on know ing whether the
 gentlcmn n has reported or
 not and that can only
 be ascertained by the reading
 of the report N lr
 HASKIN That is the point
 The SPEAKER Chair does not
 think it is the right
 of the gentleman to have
 his report read Mr I
 I ASK IN The gentlenn
 ll from Iowa has stated
 to rnc that hc yielded
 to the gentleman from Illinois
 to make his report at
 onc o clock was carried
 to the Clerk s table
 but until that report is
 read it is impossible for
 the House to ascertain that
 a report has been madc
 Mr BURNETT 1 would the
 gen tleman from Iowa that
 he will probably expedite his
 business by allowing t hc
 report of the gentle man
 from Illinois to bc read
 Mr CURTIS Ifthé House will
 allow me 1 was going
 to say that as gentlemen
 seem determ ined to consumc
 thc hour anyhow I am
 willing as a matter of
 economy that the report shall
 be I hope therefore that
 without any further consumption of
 time thc report will be
 read SPEAKER The suggest that
 in order to proceed regularly
 it will bc necessary to
 suspend the special order Mr
 CURTIS ri hen 1 hope
 the special order will bc
 post oned for that purpose
 Mr SICÆLES With the understanding
 that it is not to
 be considered at this time
 The SPEAKER There being DO
 objection the special order will
 be suspended with that un
 derstanding Mr HÆSKIN 1 then
 withdraw my appeal from the
 decision of the Chair Mr
 CASE I desire to say
 that I was in structcd
 as one of the members
 of the committee to prepare
 certain bills to be reported
 to the House but my
 health has been such for
 two or three days I
 past that I have not
 been able to do so
 and I ask the permission
 of thc I ouse to
 present them ata future timc
 The report was then read
 as follows I The select
 eonnnittee to whori was rc
 erred the resolu tion of
 the f louse adopted on
 the 24th day of last
 directing thern to inquirc into
 and report the facts in
 relation to the f audulent
 abstraetiou of certain bonds held
 I bv the Govern ncnt
 in trust tire Indian tribes
 from thc T epart noel
 t of lhc and to
 were also refen cd the
 connnnnicalion or John B Ftovd
 late Secretary late sec and
 rotary ot tho interior beg
 leave respectt aliy to report
 I hat upon the lay
 of heir appointment they repaired
 to che h t eriut
 Deparuncnt and held an interview
 with Hon Jacob Thompson then
 Secretary of said Department and
 expressed to him their desire
 to enter upon the duty
 as signed them at as
 early aperiod as would comport
 With his convenience and be
 consistent with the public interest
 Three days thereafter and as
 soon as they were authorized
 to employ a stenographer your
 committee organized and hnve labored
 to bring their investigation to
 an early termin ation with
 a diligence that has been
 quickened by an ap preciation
 of the grave character of
 the subject committed to them
 and of tho interest felt
 by the House and the
 coun try in its remarkable
 details It soon became evident
 that the mere abstraction of
 cer tain bonds from the
 Interior Department a fact easily
 ascertained and indeed admitted by
 the person who took them
 was an incident of minor
 importance in comparison with the
 transactions preceding and connected with
 that act and your committee
 therefore considered it incumbent upon
 them to trace as accurately
 and thoroughly as possi ble
 through the tortuous windings of
 vast and complicated interests and
 extensive though concealed raynifications the
 mot ives and purposes and
 deeds of those who have
 been the patties to a
 daring and unprecedented fraud upon
 one of the Departments of
 the Government rn vicw of
 the magnitude of the offense
 and the great loss involved
 they have regarded themselves ful
 y justified in pushing the
 investigaiion to the furthest limit
 of the authority vested in
 them I he want of
 time rather than the lack
 of zeal has prevented them
 from obtaining akl thc information
 they desired yet enough has
 been ascertained to satisfy in
 their opinion the material inquiries
 with which they were charged
 by the House as they
 think will appear from a
 succinct account of the evidence
 that has been adduced before
 them THE INDIAN TRUST BONDS
 By reterence to the abstract
 marked A herewith transmitted it
 will be seen that the
 Government still holds State bonds
 and certificates and United States
 stocks for certain Indian tribes
 to the amount of 2
 525 241 82 l hese
 bonds as well as the
 eight hundred and seventy abstracted
 and one Indian bond handed
 to Hon G N FITL
 H and not returned by
 him to the Department for
 reasons assigned in his correspondence
 with Godard Bailey were purchased
 from time to time by
 authority of law with the
 money of tho Indians arising
 t ron treaty stipulations Originally
 they were in charge of
 the Indian bureau while that
 bureau was connected with the
 Departtnent of War and remained
 in its custody after it
 becazne one of the bureaus
 of the Interior Department in
 1849 and from that tiune
 up to 1857 In that
 year the custody of the
 securities v vas transförred to
 the Sec retary of the
 Intcrior I he Government having
 the bonds in its possession
 was the trustee for the
 Indians who were the actual
 owners of them and presuming
 that its agents havc cxcrcised
 ordinary diligence and care as
 their custo dians the question
 arises as to the extent
 of its liability for their
 loss Your committee do not
 however propose to pursue that
 inquiry as they cannot doubt
 that a great and Inagna
 ni mous Government will not
 permit those have com Initted
 thcmsclves to its protection to
 be robbcd by its of
 ficers or employés without making
 prompt and ample compensation Yet
 the disregard of these fiduciary
 obliga tions would seem to
 aggravate the turpitude of the
 offender whose felonious hand could
 rifle so sacred a trust
 Such an act furnishes most
 melancholy evidence of the decay
 of public virtue and will
 remain a blot upon our
 history and an indication of
 our downward career In this
 respect it Inatters but little
 who was the transgressor Che
 tact of the connnission of
 the act at a moment
 when we thought we had
 reason to boast of our
 good faith and int egrity
 will romain fixed in the
 public mind and be remembered
 as a dark offense when
 its guilty perpetrators have been
 long forgotten THE MANNER OF
 KEEPING THE BONDS Under previous
 Administrations the bonds were placed
 in the immediate charge of
 some clerk selected for his
 integ rit y and capacity
 who kept them in a
 safe in Ibe Indian office
 No stanl or other mark
 of designation was placed upon
 any of them with the
 exception of a small portion
 and tbc only safeguard the
 Government had was the faith
 fukness and honesty of tnc
 person intrusted with their keep
 ing So careless a mode
 of transacting the public business
 ankl administering a trust so
 delicate and important as tonnds
 us by tho Inagnitude of
 its fi liy Neither the
 Com rnissioncr of Indian Affairs
 nor tho Secretary of the
 Interior over counted the bonds
 in person and the only
 information that either of them
 could have possessed touching th
 eir safety was the payinent
 of tt1C coupons every six
 Inonths and such examillations as
 they occasionally chose to order
 to be Inade by others
 Fortunately for the Goveunnetlt however
 no loss was sustained durinr
 previous Adliliois l rations nor
 is there the slightest ground
 to believe that I Ion
 Robert McClelland of Michigan former
 Secretary of thc Interior whosc
 supervision of the trust while
 it re mained in thc
 Indian office has been called
 in quesUon and whose letter
 was referred to your committee
 acted at any time in
 any way unthithfuk to it
 On the contrary t be
 evidence of Mr Henry Beard
 cniirely exonerates hini frorn any
 blame further than the expression
 already made by the committee
 of their opinion of the
 modc in which the business
 was generally managed tary exorcised
 the greatest watchfulness and care
 for it is hot within
 their province to institute such
 aminvestiga tion I hose desirous
 of further intörtnat ion can
 obtain it from the rccords
 of the Interior Department Still
 they deem it but justice
 to add that they have
 discovered noth ing to involve
 the late Secretary Ilon Jacob
 l ho npson in the
 slightest degree in the fraud
 and nothing to indi eate
 that be had any cornplieit_v
 in the abstraction or that
 he had any knowledge of
 it until the time of
 the disclosure by Godard Bailey
 Soon after hc entered upon
 the dillies of his office
 at the connncncelncnt of the
 present Admin istration ho appointed
 two additional disbursing clerks for
 his Dcpartrnellt one ot whoa
 I was Mr Baiiey who

 bond was required of him
 vhich he subsequently executed in
 the penal sum of 5

 Texas and Wrn C Cor

 as securities This bond was
 acknowledged before Moses Kelly justice
 of the peace and its
 sumciency certified to by Philip

 attorney It was then approved
 by J Copies of thc
 appointment and bond will be

 shows that Mr Dailey camc
 to Washington a bank rupt
 in fortune and a political
 advcnturer seeking office He brought
 with him however the highest
 tcstimonials of confidence and respect
 from various distinguished men in
 Alaba na where he lived
 and in South Carolina where
 he was born and had
 previously resided Being a man
 of acknowledged talents with these
 evidences of capacity and respectability
 we are not surprised that
 thc Socrctary of tho interior
 reposed confidence in him While
 he should perhaps havc exercised
 a more watchful guardian ship
 over thc stocks and the
 Illovements of his subordi nates
 it cannot bc inferred that
 he was intentionally negli gent
 of his duty Any other
 public functionary might have been
 deceived in thc same way
 THE ABSTRACTED BONDS All the
 stocks including those that were
 abstracted were kept in the

 the whole ainount as shown
 by said abstract is eight
 hundred and seventy two of
 1 000 each whcn in
 fact Mr Bailey delivered to
 Mr VVilliam H Rus scll
 eight hundred and seventy only
 One of the other two
 is accounted Or by the
 corrcspondence between Mr FITCH and
 Mr Bailey already referred to
 The reason vhy the remaining
 one is embraced in the
 abstract and was included in
 the published list is explained
 by the cvidence of Mr
 Henry Beard the fhitilful custodian
 of the bonds under Sec
 retary McClelland in the advertisement
 eight hundred Mt Beard says
 and seventy one bonds were
 embraced The Indian bond handed
 to Mr FITCH as stated
 was not crnbraced It oc
 curred in this Ivay it
 needed only one hundred and
 forty threc I ennessee bonds
 to c 01nplete the eight
 hundred and seventy missing but
 our office book or lisl
 or bonds as prepared by
 Bailey indicated one hundred and

 state that ninety nine of
 these bonds were issued by
 the State of Missouri for
 the St Louis and Iron
 Mountain railroad ninety by the

 and St Joseph road one
 hundred and thirty for the
 North Missouri road fifty one
 for the Missouri Pacific road

 Soma di liculty occurred in
 the identification of the North
 Carolina bonds Several witnesses stated
 that they held bonds whose
 numbers corresponded with those given
 in a printcd list and
 as they had been held
 by themselves or tbosc from
 whom they obtained thctn long
 before those in the Interior
 Department were abstracted tbey int
 errcd that the list was
 incorrect The solution of the
 difficulty or mis understanding may
 be found in this the
 State of North Carolina issued
 bonds to aid in various
 enterprises and these were divided
 into ckasses each class bearing
 a diflin ent date yet
 having a precisely similar series
 of numbers A party might
 thereföre hold a bond whose
 number cor responded with anumbcr
 on the printed list but
 the bonds wonld not be
 identical because belonging to separate
 classes designated by dates There
 seems to have been no
 cause tor sirnilar inistakes in
 reference to the bonds issued
 by other States NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN
 MR RUSSELL AND MR BAILEY
 VViiliam l Russell is the
 head of the housc of
 Russell Majors VVaddc l a
 firm widely known as contractors
 Vith the War Department for
 transporting Army provisions over the
 western and southwestern plains Mr
 Russell stated to the committee
 that hc had heard in
 Ncsv York of such a
 man as Mr Bailey although
 he did not exactly re
 mernbc r his nmnc who
 had been in that city
 to sell Chi riqui securities
 and Florida bonds thc latter
 for Mr Yulee a Senat
 or from that State I
 Vhcn asked frotn whom he
 re ceived his information he
 gave the answer usually resorted
 to in such eases namely
 be could not remember next
 heard of Mr Russell is
 that hc is on his
 way from New York to
 Washington in colnpany with Luke
 Lea Esq a Mr Lea
 formerly Comruis banKer in thc
 lat er city sioner of
 Indian Affairs and is a
 partner of Mr Russell in
 the banking business at Leavenworth
 Kansas In a conversation that
 ensued between them Mr Russell
 madc known to Mr Lea
 his embarrassed circumstances and asked
 if he Alit Lea did
 not know of sonle onc
 that Mr Russell Mr Lea
 answered in the could assist
 him negative ile states in
 his testilnony that Afr Russell
 sug gested that he had
 heard of a inan in
 VVashington by the nanne of
 Bailor or Bactey who was
 a relation of Governor Fioyd
 and an for the negotiation
 or sale ot stocks and
 asked his friend if he
 knew hilli Mr Loa was
 again but stated that he
 knew unnpelled to rive a
 necra ive a man there
 by the name of Ba41ey
 and Mr Russell said that
 he supposed that hc was
 the man ot whom he
 was in search It is
 very evident froni Mr Lea
 s examination that he was
 both an artful and unwilling
 witness He had to be
 pressed with great pertinacity to
 induce him to disclose what
 he knew and even then
 his answers were so inter
 spersed with irre evantand equivocal
 remarks designed to relieve hitn
 from suspicion of complicity that
 your com nit tee are
 compelled reluet antly to notice
 the absence of the candor
 and frankness that they rnjglit
 reasonably ex pect to find
 in his responses Hc was
 compelled however to say that
 he informed Mr Russell that
 Mr Bailey was in no
 condition to assist him that
 he had nostocks or money
 and was as poor as
 anybody Beiöt e separating Mr
 Russell seeming still to believe
 that aid might be obtained
 in the quarter indicated requested
 Mr Lea to see Mr
 Bailey in regard to the
 Inatter Mr Lea complied with
 this re quest and stated
 to Mr Bailey that Mr
 Russell had sold unless assistance
 was rendered the acceptances of
 Gov ernor Floyd would be
 protested and hc would be
 compelled to retire fi mn
 the Cabinet Mr Lea is
 however careful to state in
 his evidence that he gave
 no intimation to N I
 r Bailey that he rnight
 use the stocks he had
 in his charge be longing
 to the Indian trust fund
 Mr C G Wagner who
 is liearly related to Mr
 Bailey and in whose hands
 was first placed his confQ3ssion
 states in his evidence given
 your cormnittee are pleased to
 say with full and honorable
 ran kness that hc learncd
 from Mr Bailey that Mr
 Lea did Inention the stocks
 in the conversation between them
 And indeed this would naturally
 be inferred fi om the
 fact that Mr Lea was
 perféctly farniliar with the business
 of tbc De partment and
 knew that Mr Bailey had
 the stocks in charge and
 had no large connnand of
 privatc means Mr Lea admits
 that after the delivcry of
 the first installment of bonds
 to Mr Russcil he knew
 that Mr Russell and Mr
 Bailey were engaged in rifling
 the Indian trust safe Lhat
 they so contbsse d to
 him that he had conversations
 with thenl on the subject
 and that he endeavored to
 dissuade them from further connnissions
 of the crime Hc also
 statcs that he refrained from
 intörming the Soc retary of
 the Interior oc the transactions
 referred to and that he
 exacted the Inost solemn pledges
 fronu his two friends that
 his natne should never be
 publicly known in connection with
 the business But his precautions
 have not availed to afford
 him entire exemption fronl responsi
 bility in connection with the
 transactions yout committee have inquired
 into Mr Lea did not
 introduce Mr Bailey to Mr
 Russell nor does he state
 that he appointed for thcnn
 a place of meeting yet
 it happened that these two
 per sons did mect at
 the iVar Department on the
 saine day that the interview
 between Mr Lea and Mr
 Bailey occurred Mr Russell says
 this was between the 12th
 and 15th days It was
 probably on the 13th day
 of that of last July
 E he chief clerk of
 the War Departnrent Secre 111011th
 tary Floyd s most intirnate
 fiviend Colonel W R Drinkard
 was the mcdiunt through whom
 the introduction 100k place hl
 that day they had their
 first interview at the War
 De parttnent Colonel Drinkard as
 shown by his own evi
 fence impressed Mr Bailey with
 the bc ief that Mr
 Rus sell was a gentleman
 of great respectability and pecuniary
 resources and that if the
 acceptances of the Secretary of
 War werc allowed to go
 to protest he the Secretary
 would be greatly agonized and
 disturbed Messrs Russell and Bailey
 held a private interview in
 the third story of the
 and within a tow hours
 thereafter Mr Bailey Departnrel t
 deiivered to Mr Russell 150
 000 of bonds at the
 room of the latter person
 in Washington city and on
 the same evening the recipient
 rcturned with to New York
 Mr R FsseII states that
 he left with Mr Bailey
 one note of Russell Majors
 in their stead as security
 Ninety of these one hundred
 and fifty bonds were Mis
 souris and the rest Tennessee
 s Mr Russell does not
 re collect at first whether
 or not the January coupons
 were on the bonds but
 states that subsequently the most
 ot the bonds were retired
 by him in order to
 obtain those as hc Bailey
 was posi coupons to return
 to Mr Bailey tivc in
 his request to bave thern
 returned I hesc cou pons
 having been taken off the
 bonds were afterwards disposed of
 I hc object was of
 course to conceal the fraud
 for if the coupons were
 on hand it was not
 prob able that the bonds
 would be dcnnanded or inquired
 tor According to the statement
 of Mr Russell there was
 no further correspondence or eonnnunication
 between Mr Bailey and hitnsclf
 until the September ihliowing At
 that time he returned to
 VVashing1 on fbr the purpose
 of obtain ing others An
 iutervicw was held with Mr
 Bailey the result of which
 was that three hundred and
 eight y seven bonds in
 addition to thosc first taken
 were transfOrred to Mr Russell
 ou the following day The
 protection of tho honor of
 Sccretary Floyd the necessity of
 providing for the other acccptances
 and the bonds previously delivered
 and which were alleged to
 have been hypothecated were as
 signed as the reasons requiring
 fnrthcr assistance this as in
 the first instance the paper
 of Rusself Majors Waddell was
 leftas security Mr R ussoll
 states that at this conference
 Mt Bailey first int orrned
 hifn that the bonds in
 his possession belonged to Indian
 trust fund It was the
 agrcémerit that the bonds first
 taken should bc returned within
 ninety days but at the
 soeond interview the time was
 extended to the of March
 1861 In October Mr Russell
 rcturned the South Carolina and
 Florida bonds one hundred and
 fori y or fifty in
 ntunber having ascertained that he
 could not negot jate then
 and North Carolina bonds were
 subst itutcd in tbcir stead
 iMr Russell again appeared in
 VVashington in Decennbe r Ik
 ilow ing and on the
 grounds so successfully relied upon
 before natnely the protection of
 the War Departinent frotll dis
 race and the bonds previously
 takon sacrifice he vas enabled
 to obtain t rcrn Mr
 Bailey three hundred aud thirty
 three bonds as an additional
 advance niaking the entire number
 abst raeted eight hnudred and
 seventy From and third occasions
 a the bonds obtained on
 the second readv refu red
 to it is evident the
 Jan eoupotl s were ent
 o i as a precaution
 arrainst leteeUan l ennessce pons
 belonaing to other bond than
 those abetracted were returned by
 Mr Russell doubtless bccause the
 abstracted Vile tran ac tion
 last bonds had passed beyond
 his reach referred to appeare
 tQ _ha ve closed the
 business relations of these two
 persons so far at least9
 as they related to the
 abstraction of bonds MR BAILEY
 S MOTIVES FOR TAXING 1ifiE
 ZONDS Why Mr Bailey abstracted
 the bonds is a question
 tO which your committee can
 present no satisfactory answer As
 he and Mr Russell were
 entire strangers previotisly to their
 meeting at the War Department
 neither the obli gations of
 friendship nor the suggestions of
 kindly feeling seem to have
 prompted the act Mr Russell
 insists that no money or
 other valuabic consideration ever passed
 to Mr Bailey or indeed
 was ever rnentioned in their
 inter views Mr Bailey confirms
 tbis statement in various come
 municatlons which have reached your
 cotnmittce It not ascertained either
 that Mr Båiley came suddénly
 into the possession of any
 large amounts of money His
 bank account was kept with
 Messrs Riggs Co of Washing
 ton city and Mr Riggs
 testifies that between July and
 the 13th of December hid
 deposits increased laigely over Tor
 Iner ones but amounted in
 thc aggregate to not more
 than five or six iboüsand
 dollars ft is true that
 this Sum is a large
 one to be ia the
 pog gessiop a person whose
 salary was but 2 000
 per annutn and who was
 supporting a fam ily yet
 it would not of itself
 constitute aground for grave suepieion
 or afford a clew to
 the discovery of the purposes
 of the abstractor Mr Bailey
 in his eonversations with Various
 witnesses stated that his design
 was to protect the eharacter
 of Gov ernor Floyd and
 to save hilli from the
 dishonor and retire ment froin
 the Cabinet that would be
 necessarily incident to the protest
 and discovery of the acceptances
 wliich had been illegally issued
 to the firm of Russell
 Majors Waddell Whether this consideration
 was the sole motive of
 his conduct it is left
 to the House to determine
 Your committee are however con
 rained to express the con
 viction that bohind the events
 that have been made con
 spicuous and beneath the exterior
 of the transactions that have
 been described is a purpose
 which although suceess fully hidden
 was none the less powerful
 and c flicient and has
 given unity and vitality to
 the schelnes now partially exposed
 MR BAILEY S CONFESSION A
 part or the evidence adduced
 is found in a communi
 cation frozn Mr Bäiley dated
 December 1 1860 and ad
 dressed to Hon Jacob I
 hompson Secretary of the Interior
 containing a statement that a
 portion of the bonds consti
 tuting the Indian trust fund
 amounting to 870 000 were
 no longer in his possession
 This confession was on the
 13th of December placed in
 the hands of Mr Wagner
 with the request that it
 should be delivered to the
 Secre tary of tbc Interior
 five days before the expiration
 of his terna of office
 or as Mr Wagner understood
 it five days betOre the
 4th of March On ihc
 20th of the saine month
 Mr Bailey addressed a note
 to Mr Wagner requesting that
 the note previously committcd to
 him Mr Wagner should be
 given to the Secretary of
 the Interior immediately upon his
 return from North Carolina Mr
 Thozupson arrived on the afternoon
 of the 22d of December
 On the evening of that
 day the acceptances issued by
 the War Department and the
 receipt given for the bonds
 by Mr Russell were handed
 to Mr Thompson at thc
 office of the President in
 the Executive mansion by Hon
 H M RICE United States
 Senator from Minnesota No earlier
 intünation of the abstraction had
 reached Mr Thompson Your committee
 not designing to examine Mr
 Bailey as a witness the
 chairman addressed to Mr RICE
 a note and rro this
 he replied that politely requested
 his attendance lie would answer
 any question that might bc
 propounded to hiln in writing
 Seeing t hat he stood
 so pertinaciously on his privilegc
 as a Senator it was
 not thought consistent with the
 duty of the committee or
 dignity of the House to
 press any further inquiries unless
 the House shall so order
 Had the original intention of
 withholding from the Sec retary
 alf knowledge of the fraud
 unti within a few days
 of the 4th of March
 been carried out the confusion
 incident to a change of
 administrative officers would have prevented
 prompt investigation and deprived Mr
 l hompson of the means
 of immediate detonse Mr Bailey
 in the exercise of forethought
 prudent to avoid detection made
 up his stock account for
 the current year showing on
 its face that all the
 bonds were satuy in his
 custody and had caused its
 presentation to the Second Auditor
 Mr Fuller That officer refused
 to approve it for the
 reason that the coupon account
 designed to be a chcck
 upon it did not accompany
 it It is perhaps to
 this re fusai that may
 in part be attributed the
 early disclosure of the fraud
 It will be observed that
 while Mr Bailey s statement
 is dated December l 1860
 and embraccs the entire number
 of bonds and fixes the
 inonti of July as i
 hc tirne at which he
 intrusted thcm to other parties
 tbc testilnony ot Mr Russell
 shows that they were not
 afl delivered at one time
 but that three hundrcd and
 thirty threo were transferred to
 him on the 13111 of
 December nearly two weeks subse
 quent to the date of
 Mr Bailey s confession The
 only satisfactory explanation that can
 be given Df this notice
 able discrepancy is the supposition
 that the statement was actually
 prcparcd on the day it
 vas given to Mr Wagner
 and the day the last
 bonds were delivered to Mr
 and dated wrongfully I ecenlber
 to allay any that Inight
 be excited if it verc
 seen that thc date of
 the abstraction was identical with
 the date of the last
 accept ance which vas issued
 by the War Departinent for
 the purpose as your committee
 think ot making up a
 definite amount of securities TRE
 nysPOSIT10N OF TRE BONDS As
 soon as the abstract ion
 of the bonds was made
 known to the Secretary of
 the Interior he applied i
 imsclt dili gently to discover
 with who n they were
 lodged that pro écedings might
 be instituted their recovery Moses
 Kelley F sq his chief
 clerk was dispatched to New
 York and he there caused
 writs ot injunction to be
 served upon a parties in
 whose possession bad reason to
 believe tho bonds to he
 But ascertaining this of obtainin
 z the desired information to
 bc both siow and un
 satisfactory Mr h01npson advised that
 your cuu n ittee 876
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 12
 should hold some of its
 sessions in the city of
 New York Being desirous ofexpediting
 the investigation and of avoid
 ing the heavy expense that
 would be incident to the
 sum mooing of a large
 numbcr of witnesses from that
 gity your committee concurred in
 the propriety of this suggestion
 and having asked and obtained
 leave to sit in such
 places as they believed the
 public interest required they pro
 ceeded at considera b c
 inconvenience to New York From
 the testirnony there procured it
 was apparent that the bönds
 had been disposed of by
 Mr Russell and his agent
 and that Mr Russell did
 hot have it in his
 power to restore any of
 them A imited number of
 them were traced into the

 which are not included in
 the above statement At an
 early stage of our proceedings
 and before the ex amination
 of any witnesses your committee
 designated two or their nutnber
 the chair nan and Hon
 Mr I i10MAS to consult
 witn Robert uld Esq United
 States district at torney Ibr
 the District of Columbia in
 reft rencc to the ab
 straction of the bonds and
 the legal questions connected therewith
 That officer adviscd that the
 testimony of both Mr Bailey
 and Mr Russell should be
 taken An important witness Jerome
 n Sjrnpgon who would bc
 fOund in New York it
 was expected could not be
 ob tained He had acted
 in that city as the
 confidential busi ness agent of
 Russell Majors Waddell and knew
 it was believed all the
 details it their business transactions
 with the Government and of
 the abstraction of the bonds
 I hc Inost activc and
 diligent search for hill proved
 unavailing As none of his
 acquaintances remen her to have
 seen hirn since about the
 day tk llowing Mr RusselPg
 arrest and as no trace
 of him has yet been
 discovered it is evident that
 he absconded or concealed himself
 to avoid the responsi bility
 of his acts and an
 appearance before the ccnnmittee or
 the courts Jn view of
 this circumstance and otthe advice
 given by tbe district attorney
 and under thc belief that
 unless a full state ne
 nt could be obtained fro
 n some one immediately connected
 with the transaction no satiståctory
 report could bc madc of
 the facts in rclation to
 the said fraud as was
 required by the resolution of
 the House it was deterrnined
 to atrord Mr Russell an
 opportunity of appearing the Previous

 it lily duty to state

 to do so you can
 but if you do not

 indicated to you you can
 withhold your answer Mr Russeil
 Iam anxious to makea statmnent

 make out a state nent
 of the whole transaction in

 it at length on your

 prosecution and think it due
 to me that I should
 be permitted to knake a
 full statement although do not
 fear the result of the

 verbally I will unake it
 in that way but i
 should like to inakc it

 then sworn but after a
 questions On the 23d of
 January he again appeared and
 was re minded of what
 had been said to him
 on a previous oeca sion
 and more fully admonished that
 he was not required to
 answer any questions Hc was
 also advised that bis ex

 he desired it in whole

 approved Jan uary 24 1857
 ernitled An act Inore effectually
 to enforce the attendance of
 witnesses on the summons of
 either House of Congress and
 to con wel them to
 discover their testi mony was
 shown to Mr Russell and
 after reading it he requested
 further time to advise with
 his counsel Before leaving the
 comini ttee rooll however he
 stated in reply to a
 question that he understood the
 statute and that it had
 been explained to him previously
 to his appearing be fore
 the committee On the 25th
 Mr Russell presented to the
 committee a paper prepared he
 states as an ariæwer to
 the question that had been
 previously proposed to him and
 requested He left it with
 that it should be placed
 upon the record the cormnittee
 and no further questions were
 proposed This instrument though not
 properly belonging to the rcc
 ord of our proceedings is
 transruitted to thc House för
 its inspection as one of
 the acccnnpanying papers On exmn
 ination it will be found
 to be not an unswer
 to the quest ion that
 had been asked as introductory
 to more important ones but
 an elaborate eflört Inade by
 Mr Russell with technical adroitness
 and legal acumen to avail
 hirnselt of the act of
 Congress belOre referred to and
 to interpose it as a
 shield between himselt and the
 consequences of his deeds Nearly
 ail the material state nents
 therein contained are wholly incorrect
 It is not true as
 hc alleges that he was
 not perniitted by law to
 reiUse to testify to any
 fact within the scope ot
 our inquiries Neither is it
 true that he was required
 to testity He testified of
 his own free will and
 was not conipelled as declared
 by the title of the
 act to discover testimony nor
 was he required as expressed
 in the body of the
 law to give his evidence
 Your cmnmittee thcre örc while
 they are constrained to consider
 the course adopted by Mr
 Russell as a confession i
 of his moral guilt do
 not deetn it within their
 province to anticipate or prejudge
 a question of law which
 may arise in legal prosecutions
 THE ACCEPTANCES ISSUED BY TUE
 SECRETARY OF WAR When the
 iniquitous act perpetrated by onc
 of the sub ordinate officers
 of the Interior I epartment
 in the ab straction of
 bonds was Inade known it
 was discovered at the sarne
 tilnc that acceptances unauthorized by
 law and deceptive and fraudulent
 in their character had been
 is sued by the Secretary
 ot VVar in tavor of
 Messrs Russell Majors Waddell As
 a portion of these arc
 inseparably connected with the history
 of the bond cinbezziement it
 is propoee l first to
 inquire into the circmnstances attending
 their issue It is stated
 by Mr Russell that on
 the day he made his
 last application tor securities Mr
 agreed to Curnish then on
 the condition that there should
 he deposited with h in
 in their place the acceptances
 of Governor Floyd as Secretary
 of VVar Mr Russell it
 would appear had then on
 hand 8735 000 of acceptances
 of bich wore unconditional and
 t lnc balance and payable
 out of the earnings of
 Russell Majors Waddell for 1861
 Copies of the acceptances will
 bc enibraced in the testimony
 of Hon Jacob l hcnnpson
 The amount of the bonds
 he received on that and
 previous occasions was eight hundred
 and seventy ot l here
 vas there forc wanting to
 make up the requisite sum
 of securities 135 000 and
 we accordingly find that there
 is an accept ancc bcat
 ing latc Decen ber 13
 for that precise amount When
 it is reunen bercd that
 that is the date of
 the last de livery 01
 bonds and of the receipt
 theroiör the inference seenus unavoidable
 that the acceptance was issued
 to unakc up an ascertained
 deficiency and that it was
 anticipated that it would go
 into the possession ot Bailey
 Ithere are other facts that
 should be stated in this
 con nection Mr Russell fixes
 the probable earnings of his
 firm tor the year 1861
 at frotn 500 000 to
 600 000 whilc Cap tain

 together with those for ditional
 ones issued issue l unconditionally
 tnust be regarded as a
 loss as the Governrnent will
 doubtless acknowkedge the obli gation
 to replace the bonds belonging
 to the Indian trust l
 and there is little reason
 to expect that Russel Ma
 jors VVaddelI will Inake a
 return of what they have
 received If your com nittee
 could rest here and could
 feel justi fied in expressing
 the belie that there are
 no other out standing liabilities
 and that no further demands
 would be upon this or
 any future Congress in contiectiou
 with made these extraordinary proccedings
 they would denn this an
 occasion tor congratulation to the
 House But untOrtu had been
 proposed he acain expressed a
 dcsire to sublilita nately there
 are transactions ofa similar character
 but of written statement and
 leave was accordingly granted On
 a still greater mamritnde that
 claim your attention Russell Majors
 Waddell but that at no
 time shoul l he issue
 those acceptances to exceed one
 half of the amount which
 he knew of his own
 knowledge was actually due to
 the parties for services already
 perlörmed Mr Sont er on
 being called on to produce
 this communication says that had
 an impression and he supposed
 it was derived frotn a
 letter of Mr Floyd that
 the War Department is sued
 acceptances to the extent only
 of one half of the
 amount that would become due
 to Russell Majors Wad dell
 on work in process of
 execution Although an cx amination
 of the letters received by
 the bank and his own
 private letters failed to bring
 to light such a emumuniea
 tion as he had expected
 to find Mr Soutter does
 not change his opinion but
 concludes that it was derived
 from the statements of some
 persons whose names he cannot
 now recall These letters and
 representations are important as showing
 the means adopted by the
 Secretary of VVar to get
 the paper he issued into
 circulation MORE THAN OF ACCEPTANCES
 ISSUED In relation to the
 acceptances issued unconditü nally by
 the late Secretary of War
 your committee deem it their
 duty to state all the
 iäcts they have been able
 to discover as fully as
 possible They amount in the
 uggrcgate to the enormous snm
 of Add thereto thc conditional
 acceptances which have already been
 thrown back i_lpon the Government
 through the aaency of A
 Ir Bailey and he sum
 total is 6 977 395
 I his estimate is based
 upon Iata furnished by the
 War Department It appcars therefi
 om that acceptances to the
 muount of 9840 000 were
 returned to the Department for
 cancellation Mr Russell Ijowever claims
 to have returned only 200
 000 or 250 000 further
 states that the acceptances which
 he did rcturn were those
 which had matured in his
 own pocket and could not
 therciöre be negotiated But this
 assertion is positively contradicted by
 the indorsements on the returned
 acceptances and by the testimony
 of Mr Irvin a clerk
 in the War Department From
 the careless and irresponsible manner
 in which business was transacted
 bv that gentlernan and the
 late Sec retary of VVar
 and from the fact that
 it was the habit of
 Governor Floyd to issue acceptances
 at the Departrnent or at
 his house or at vhatever
 place he happened to be
 it is a Inatter of
 great uncertainty whether or not
 the 840 000 should be
 deducted from the sum heretofore
 stated probability is that when
 the acceptances were returned to
 Governor Floyd by Mr Russell
 he accepted others at the
 same time for the same
 amount of which I hcre
 was no registry xnade It
 is deuned safest to proceed
 upon the sup position that
 the acceptances inade in the
 place of those re turned
 were registered Upon this hvpothesis
 the 840 000 must bc
 deducted from the of unconditional
 ac ceptancös made and registcred
 in thc War Department I
 llis would leave ofthern so
 far as is shown by
 the records of that Department
 5 339 395 still in
 circulation add to this alnount
 the 798 000 of conditional
 acceptanecs re cci vet bv
 Mr Bailey in lieu oft

 is 6 137 305 Here
 then confining the statement to
 the ree ords of the
 War I eparunent is a
 deficit of 6 137 395
 fall upon the holders of
 these acceptances or to be
 assumed in sc ne way
 by the Governinent WHAT WAS
 DONE WITH THE ACCEPTANCES The
 evidence shows t hat the
 acceptances have been sold in
 various parts of the United
 States wherever a bank or
 private individual could be induced
 to purchase Inas nuch however
 as the amount of those
 that havc been truced di
 rectiy into the hands of
 present holders constituted but a
 small fraction of the sum
 still unaccount ed for and
 as own ers are daily
 filing additional claims at the
 War Depart ment it is
 deemed unnecessary to giée a
 detailed staternent of the discovered
 acceptances or to make other
 mention of them than to
 refer to the papers relating
 thereto pæ sentcd by the
 War Department and to the
 general evidence It is proper
 however to remark in t
 his connection that while your
 comn ittee do not deem
 it necessary to give said
 details the data in the
 War Department fix the minimum
 amount of outstanding acceptances known
 to that Depart rnent at
 1 445 000 FURTHER LIGHT
 ON GOVERNOR FLOYD S PROCEEDINGS
 Mr Richard B Irvin the
 faithful and intelligent clerk to
 whom reference has been made
 elsewhere in this report says
 in his evidence l here
 may of course be other
 outstanding acceptances of the whereabouts
 of which the Department has
 110 knowledge I here will
 also be iOuud embraced in
 his evidence given upon being
 recalled be fore the counmittee
 on thc 6th instant a
 letter addressed to R A
 Barnes Esq president of the
 Bank of the State of
 Missouri under date of January
 24 1861 to Ilon Joseph
 Hokt Secretary of War which
 is of interest and will
 throw light upon the conduct
 of Governor F oyd s
 proceedings and assurances in regard
 to the acceptances Mr Irvin
 still further testified to the
 receipt of other letters by
 the War Deparuncnt since the
 papers fUrnishcd to the corn
 mittee hy that Department were
 transmitted of a charac ter
 similar to Mr Barnes s
 I his hranch of the
 inquiry is evidently prolific and
 could be pursued to a
 great length if necessity required
 or time would permit MR
 RCSSELL S ESTIMATE To avoid
 all appcarancc of unfairness your
 comrnittee consider it proper to
 give Mr Russell s estirnate
 of the atnount of acceptances
 issued as set t orth
 in the Ollowing extract from
 his testimony the 18th of
 January he was again betöi

 asked Did you ever directly

 person any consid eratioas or
 make to any person any

 Russell theu stated that besides
 the acceptances be has used
 and those still renraining in
 his possession the latter solnewhat
 less than 200 000 in
 annount Governor Floyd gave hitn
 others which he returned unused
 to the If credenee should
 be given to these War
 Deparunent explanations the amount of
 acceptances still outstanding is very
 large But Mr Russell s
 statements are so ram bling
 vague and unsatisfactory and he
 shows such utter ignorance of
 the details of his business
 and such incapa City or
 unwillingness to make an exhibit
 of his affairs that your
 committee have considered it Inuch
 safer Lo base their conclusions
 upon the records furnished by
 the War Dc partment These
 records are of a character
 too peculiar to be passed
 without comment PECULIAR RECORDS IN
 THE WAR DEPARTMENT By reference
 to thc testinuony of Mr
 Irvin a clerk in the
 War Depart nent it will
 be seen that he kept
 a registry of the acceptances
 011 loose pieces of paper
 only as they vcre reported
 to hiln from tune to
 time and no other was
 made He states too that
 there was no registratiou of
 the 798 000 of conditional
 acceptances which fell into Mr
 Bailey s hands and that
 in nnediately atter the discovery
 of the ab straction of
 the bonds Governor Floyd went
 to his office and directed
 Mr Irwin to enter an
 order of cancek lation of
 those acceptances which he did
 upon a slip of paper
 as he had entered the
 dates and arnounts of others
 that had bccn issued The
 acceptances being in the hands
 of lion Jacob fl hornpson
 having been placed there by
 Mr Bailey in lieu of
 the abstracted bonds an order
 of cancel kition at such
 a time was simply an
 order against the Cov Had
 thc acceptances been held by
 other parties ern nent the
 order would have been equally
 futile for if legally issued
 iL could not invalidate Ilem
 TO RUSSELL MAJORS AND WADDELL
 It also appears from the
 records of the War Department
 that while tl lese acceptances
 were being issued to the
 alnount of IniUions of dollars
 Russell Majors Waddell were reemlarly
 receiving their pay for the
 services pertörmcd under their contract
 in lnoney from t he
 Government The azuregate mnount of

 this sutn wag paid by
 the proper offi cerat Leavenworth

 ted in his evidence that
 every acceptance which he made
 ran against unearned rnonev alid
 was desiglied to ivc then

 their contract yet there has
 not been discovered the slighest
 indication that I be tnade

 of General Johnston the Aril
 Y and of Hon Mr
 Atkinson the Phird Auditor of

 a detailed staternent ot the
 payrnents which prescntt l to
 the comitiittee the amounts of
 the earn ings and payments
 will fully appear It would
 per haps bc sullieient to
 say upon this point that
 Mr Russell acknowledges that there
 is now but a smalt
 sutn due his firni current
 earnings But it was considered
 desirable to reniove an uncertainty
 from this question and to
 ascer tain positively whether Russell
 Majors VVaddell had ever presented
 any clailn to the War
 Department extra services and whether
 any claim for such services
 had ever been paid by

 In his letter occurs this
 passage Within the tbur years
 since I have presided over

 the Govermnent by em bezzleinent

 time 860 000 000 have

 by the best re suits

 depletion of the public Treasury
 and the debase ncnt of

 the vicious and the reprobation
 of the good if by
 the most perfect system of
 accountability is meant a method
 oftransacting business that promises rewards
 to neoligence and aflörds the
 most valuable facilities and incentives
 to fraud then indeed may
 the late Secretary have reason
 to speak with confident self
 praises of his systelli of
 admin istration and line of
 policy Whether or not his
 assertion that there has been
 no em bezzlexnent or thetV
 in his Department that will
 soon be decided in the
 courts The recklessness of his
 offcial conduct his inattention and
 the ignorance of the details
 of hisaffairs have been already
 shown and will stand out
 in still greater distinctness on
 examination of the contradic tions
 and obscurities of his testimony
 Your committee will theretOre leave
 judgment to be pronounced by
 the House and by the
 countFY but will present as
 a valuable aid in corning
 to a correct conclusion a
 brief abstract 01 the testimony
 of Hon J P BENJAMIN
 United States Sen ator fro
 n Louisiana IMPORTANT TESTIMONY OF
 SENATOR BENJAMIN BUCHANAN NOTIFIED OF
 GOVERNOR FLOYD S SYSTEM OF
 ISSUING AC CEPTANCES Mr BENJAMIN
 who prornptly appeared at the
 request of the committee and
 testified with co nmendabie and
 cour teous frankness states that
 during the first session of
 the present Congress some twelve
 or eighteen months ago he
 was written to by the
 attorney of Duncan Sherman Co
 of New York and his
 opinion requested as to the
 legality of acceptances issued by
 Governor Floyd to Russell Majors
 It was Inentioned in that
 letter that thesc VVaddell 6
 drafts as they were then
 called were offered for nego
 tiati011 with the assurance that
 they were issued with the
 approbation of the President and
 Attorney General Mr BENJAMIN visited
 the President and submitted the
 inquiry to hill The President
 replied that he knew nothing
 about the rnatt er that
 they had been issued without
 any knowl edge of his
 that he did not know
 by virtue of what law
 they were issued but that
 he Mr BENJAMIN might rely
 if Governor Floyd had issued
 them be had issued them
 properly and that he had
 better apply to him Governor
 Floyd to ascertain by virtue
 of what law he was
 acting INTERVIEW WITH GOVERNOR FLOYD
 In pursuance of this suggestion
 Mr BENJAMIN called on Governor
 Floyd and was infonned by
 him that the matter had
 not been submitted to the
 Attorney General as was that
 the drafts were issued in
 pursuance of long stated established
 custom of the ofhcc that
 he was not aware of
 any law actually authorizing their
 issue that he would in
 that the acceptances were issued
 to Russell quire into it
 Majors Waddell only atter he
 had ascertained that tbc trains
 for transportation which they had
 contracted to send from St
 Lonis to Utah had actually
 started on their way i
 that the payments were to
 bc Inade under the contract
 in installnnents as the trains
 arrived at different points and
 that having received intelligence of
 the actual departure of the
 trains he had accepted in
 advance of their arrival at
 the intennediatc point having a
 certainty that they would arri
 ve suggested to him says
 Mr BENJAMIN that I thought
 he Ivas acting nnprudently that
 if any accident should happen
 to these trains by att
 acks by Indians or any
 other cause and they should
 fail to arrive it would
 be impos Sible ün him
 to pay the acceptances upon
 intelligence of that tact and
 that trltat would give good
 reasons tar coin plaints and
 investioations which would be injurious
 to him Two days and
 urged him to discontinue the
 practice afterwards I received a
 note from hill införming me
 that he was obliged for
 the frank statement I had
 made to him and that
 upon reflection he had determined
 he would ac cept no
 more GOVERNOR FLOYD CONTINUES HIS
 OLD HABIT It has been
 shown that contrary to the
 assertion of Gov ernor Flovd
 no practice of issuino acceptances
 had ever prevailed in the
 War Department previous to its
 introduc tion by himself that
 he issued these acceptances indis
 criminately and without reference to
 installments or the arrival or
 departure of trains and without
 regard to znoney which was
 due One would naturally expect
 to find that Governor Floyd
 having been adlnonished by one
 whose position and egal learning
 gave authority Iris advice havin
 confessed the illegality of his
 proceedings and ex pressed a
 determination to nrake no further
 acceptances ence It will be
 seen frmn theirreplies that no
 such claim has ever beeli
 Inade or allowed General Johnston
 however states t hat there
 is an account a uounting
 to 827 390 49 stiii
 su peuded which the late
 Secretary of VVar directed to
 be He also states reduced
 by a disallowance of 9

 that Russell VVaddcl not only

 caution and cir cutnspection even

 that supposing the previous policy

 Only 860 000 of these

 and its consequences distinctly pointed
 out having expressed his intention

 PRYOR I wish to inquire
 of the gentle man from
 Illinois how many members of
 the com mittee concurred in
 that report Mr MORRIS of
 Illinois All of them Mr
 PRYOR I so understood the
 gentleman from Illinois to state
 before but understand that all
 the members Of the committee
 did not concur in the
 report Mr MORRIS of Illinois
 The report is a If
 I am mistaken in this
 I am unanimous one ready
 to hear from members of
 the committee on the subject
 Mr BURNETT 1 understood that
 the House agreed to have
 the report read with the
 under standing that it was
 not to be considered at
 this time Mr THOMAS I
 will state that there is
 some misunderstanding in reference to
 this matter The SPEAKER The
 Chair will state that it
 was distinctly stated that the
 reportwas not to be considered
 at this time Mr THOMAS
 1 merely desircd to state
 that the remark of the
 gentleman from Virginia re quires
 some explanation I think however
 it is possible that had
 better defei my remarks upon
 the subject until I have
 had some conference with the
 members of the committee Mr
 MORRIS of Illinois very well
 The SPEAKER There being no
 objection the report will be
 ordered to be printed I
 merely want to Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois say that I
 am ready to consider this
 report 8t any time gentlemen
 of the House may choose
 to fix Mr HINDMAN we
 are willing to give you

 hope it may expedite the
 final result upon the Senate
 amendments Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 Before the gentleman proceeds to
 ask one question Mr CURTIS
 I hope the gentleman will
 not interru t me Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois I rise
 to a question of order
 then I wish to know
 whether it is in order
 to move that the House
 disagree to all the amendments
 of the Senate and ask
 for committee of conference Mr
 CURTIS I suppose it is
 but I do not propose
 to make that motion at
 this time The SPEAKER The

 Unless that order is dispensed
 with by unanimous consent each
 amendment must be considered by
 itself Mr SICKLES A very
 large number of those amendments
 relate merely to names and
 are en I suppose of
 course the tirely uhimportant House
 will not quibble with the
 Senate about the names of
 individuals to be inserted I
 will suggest to the Mr
 CRAIG ofMissouri gentleman from Iowa
 that as I have an
 amend ment prepared to the
 first amendment of the Sen
 ate he allow me to
 present it at this tim
 and he can then speak
 to it Mr CURTIS very
 well havenoobiection Mr BURNETT I
 wish to say in réference
 to the sv estion of
 the gentleman from Illinois that
 I will not consent to
 any agreement by which the
 vote shall be taken on
 the Senate amendment as a
 whole 878 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 12 The SPEAKER The
 Chair has already de cided
 that the vote must be
 taken upon each amendment separately
 unless that course be dis
 pensed with by unanimous consent
 Any mexi ber has a
 right to require a vote
 upon each amend ment Mr
 PHELPS I suppose the unimportant
 amendments may be passed over
 by unanimous consent and the
 vote taken upon them in
 gross Mr BRANCH 1 ask
 that the usual courge be
 taken and the amendments considered
 scpai atel y The SPEAKER
 That course will be taken
 Mr CURTIS wish merely to
 indicate to the House the
 course I desire to pursue
 T hc Senate has made
 a considerablc num ber of
 amend ments to the bill
 most of which I regard
 as im material They are
 introduced in the bill for
 the purpose of furnishing guards
 which I supposed and still
 believe were suffcief tly provided
 fbr in the original bill
 as it passed the House
 But the amendments being introduced
 by thc Scnatc and not
 of vital importance I am
 disposed to adopt them There
 is one amendment which is
 of importance than any other
 which relates to a northern
 road The difference between two
 and three roads seems to
 be conceived by the Senate
 as a matter of no
 vast importance It is the
 difference between and which the
 ment is to advance in
 bonds I wish the House
 to recollect that these bonds
 are not to be issued
 except as the road progresses
 They cannot be all advanced
 or required by the directors
 in less than ten or
 fifteen years There is no
 money to be drawn from
 the Treasury and the bonds
 are all to be secured
 by a first mortgage upon
 the roads which mortgage must
 be satisfactory to the At
 torncy General Thie Government of
 the United States is therefore
 secured in the advances it
 makes These three roads arc
 so far apart that thcy
 will not be competitors so
 far as the local tradc
 is concerncd while they will
 as overland roads accommodate great
 sections of the Repub lie
 Mr Speaker I commenced considerinrr
 and laboring for this Pacific
 railroad with the belief that
 one road would answer our
 purpose and thut we should
 press through only one central
 route I have labored at
 it in Congress for Our
 winters and I am now
 satisfied that we cannot get
 Pu cific railroad by adhering
 to one road because local
 and sectional issues are such
 there rnust be moro than
 one road to satisfy public
 expecta I tion and general
 interests I he committee of
 the House therefore consen ted
 to two roads and thus
 the bill went to the
 Senate of the United States
 where a third road was
 provided for as we now
 find itin the amendments to
 this bill These three roads
 arc an extreme northern road
 an extreme southern road and
 a central road All sections
 of the country will thus
 be acconnnodated by the construction
 of those three In thc
 consideration of thc amendments of
 the Senate am disposed to
 have then all passed by
 the House I have detern
 fined whenever any amendment is
 brought before the House to
 move a concurrence as believe
 that most of tho amendments
 of the Senate are unimportant
 and as wc are at
 a late period of the
 session I trust that we
 shall not lose the bill
 on that account It the
 l ill be not altogether
 satisfactory it can here after
 be amended This is a
 point it is right the
 House should take notice of
 If it bc found after
 a year s reflection and
 exertions that there is anything
 wrono in the bill the
 next Congress will have an
 opportunity to correct it for
 by an amendment of the
 Senate all the corporations rc
 quired under its provisions are
 to be referred back to
 Congress where everything will have
 to be considered and approved
 before any land or bonds
 will attach to the company
 There is arso a pro
 vision in the bill wl
 ich authorizes a subsequent Congress
 of the United States to
 correc any im propriety in
 the construclion growino out of
 con fusion or disturbance in
 the country The bonds would
 be of little or no
 value and thc road could
 not go forward on the
 basis here proposed The integrity
 of the country is necessary
 to its pro gresse now
 move that the House concur
 i first amendment of thc
 Senate I will not call
 for II the previousquestion however
 because my friend from Missouri
 Mr CRAIG who regards this
 amendment as materially affecting the
 interests of his constituents desires
 to submit some remarks Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri Mr Speaker
 while I I have worked
 as hard for the construction
 of a Pacific railroad as
 t he gentleman from Iowa
 Mr CURTIS or any other
 man upon this floor yet
 I must state my belief
 that under the provisions of
 this bill as amended by
 the Senate no road will
 be built upon the southern
 the northern or the central
 route The first amendment of
 the Senate starts out in
 the absence of information in
 the absence of experiments with
 instruments and no doubt against
 the wishes of those whose
 money is to construct this
 great work by fixing the
 starl ing point upon the
 western border of the State
 of Missouri It should have
 been left open to the
 whole western border of t
 he State so that the
 best starting point could have
 been selected I can demonstrate
 upon that map which stands
 in view of the House
 that under the Senate ameJ
 d ments in getting two
 hundred miles west of the
 Mississippi river you have to
 go more than one hundred
 and seventy miles out of
 tbc way In goinry to
 a point north of west
 the Senate amendment proposes to
 run south of west and
 then to thc point of
 destination By that course from
 the mouth of the Kansas
 river to Fort Riley you
 will ignore the largest military
 establishinent America and probably in
 tl e world You will
 ignore sir Fort Leavenworth by
 running in the direction of
 Fort Riley a little military
 establish ment that will not
 furnish a single car load
 a month for transportation The
 amendment takes the road to
 that small fort and away
 from Fort Leavenworth from which
 millions and millions of pounds
 are sent off every season
 to the interior mountain regions
 in the direction of New
 Mex ico and the Pacific
 States You not only do
 that but by the second
 amendment of the Senate when
 you get to Fort Riley
 the road is madc to
 run north to Fort Kearny
 I have a friend in
 my eye who may perhaps
 know the reasons for this
 change of route Mr WASHRURNE
 0f Illinois Will the gen
 tle nan from Missouri explain
 the reasons VI y that
 amendment was made i aln
 anxious to know the reasons
 which induced the Senate to
 put in this atncndmcnt which
 affects us of the northern
 States so seriously Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri I think I
 can an swer The distinguished
 Senator from Missouri who oflLTcd
 this amendment in the Senate
 rcsides in the city of
 St Louis and I have
 no Ioubt that he offered
 it with a view to
 help his immediate consiitucnt s
 In reference to the starting
 point I d not arraign
 hilli for endeavoring to subserve
 the interests of St Louis
 by fixing it at the
 rnout h of Kansas river
 It I lived where hc
 does per I would have
 offered the same amendment but
 the pun rfing of the
 road from the starting point
 at the mouth of Kansas
 river to Fort Riley and
 then off to Fort Kearny
 could only have in total
 ignorance of the geo raphy
 of the country or in
 a desire to ignorc the
 interests of his constituents in
 I lorthern Missouri to ignore
 the great central belt of
 the Union from Philadel phia
 Pennsyl vania to the Missouri
 river It does Ignore Philadelphia
 I larrisburg Columbus In dianapolis
 and Springfield and the whole
 central belt of States That
 is not all T be
 roads as laid lown in
 this bill would in my
 judgrnent prevent any rnan who
 had a little Inorc than
 the zunount necessary to subsist
 his family from taking any
 stock An amendment less objectionable
 than the one moved in
 the Senate and which seems
 specially intended for the benefit
 of the city where he
 re sides was offered in
 this House by my colleague
 from Missouri who represents the
 city of St Louis That
 amendment luerely fixed the start
 ix g point at the
 mouth of Kansas river and
 pro vided for the road
 run westward in the direction
 of tbc central route Still
 sir that amendment was voted
 down in this House by
 a vote of three to
 one I submit the following
 amendment to the first amendment
 of the Senate Strike out
 and proceeding thence up the
 valley of said river to
 the vicinity of Fort Riley
 and in lieu thereof insert
 and with a branch trom
 sorne eligible point on said
 line not morc than fifty
 miles west of the Missouri
 river to tbc city of
 St Joseph Mr Speaker I
 do not propose the amendment
 with any vicw of endangering
 the passage of the bill
 but on the contrary to
 insure the concur rence of
 the House in the amendment
 of the Sen ate and
 the passage of the bill
 All I ask in my
 amendment is that the main
 trunk of thc central road
 shall start from the mouth
 of Kansas river and take
 the best route that the
 instruments will show And we
 ask for the benefit of
 fifteen hun dred miles of
 country running due east from
 the point indicated in the
 amendment that you shall give
 them fifty miles of grant
 by which they may plant
 this great central railroad and
 we will be content with
 that That fifty niles if
 consented to by thc House
 will open a market for
 more American citizens and morc
 American products than any two
 hundred miles of railroad on
 the American continent The Senate
 amendment as it is ignores
 the entire lake region The
 six hun dred and fifty
 miles of grant given by
 the Senate amendment will open
 a market for ail these
 peo ple and make a
 road which in my judgment
 will be acceptable to the
 persons who will have to
 furnish the materials for the
 road and thc road will
 be built It is a
 poor privilege which we ask
 but it is a privilege
 that is asked for by
 morc men women money and
 persons of lhis country than
 are repregented by any thousand
 miles of that road and
 its branches as it is
 laid down in the bill
 It is against running six
 hundred miles out of the
 way to get away from
 central Illinois and other States
 in proportion that we protest
 Mr FARNSWORTH I am in
 favor of the amendment of
 the gentleman from Missouri to
 the amendment of the Senate
 do not however rise to
 uddress myself to that amendment
 but simply to express the
 hope that the I louse
 will non concur in all
 the Senatc amendments get a
 committee of conference and frame
 a bill for a Pacific
 railroad which can be passed
 into a law The bill
 as it went from this
 House was incon gruous and
 bad enough put through here
 as it was under the
 spur of the previous question
 and under a trick of
 the rules which cut off
 all amend It has been
 made infinitely worse by the
 ments amendments of the Senate
 and now it is a
 great unwieldy and inconoruous thing
 which no man can expect
 the President will ever sign
 or which will ever build
 a railroad if it is
 signed I venture to assert
 that no railroad naan vho
 knows any thing about railroads
 and their cost can be
 found who will say that
 under this bill any stock
 will be taken and put
 into any one of these
 roads It is great nonsense
 and a waste of tilne
 yea worse than a waste
 of time for us to
 eno tffe in a discus
 Sion of this bill as
 it has come to us
 from the Scn ate Therefore
 1 hope the House will
 non concur in any of
 these amendments Let us bring
 this matter to a settlement
 by getting a committee of
 conference to frame a bili
 for a Pacific railroad with
 proper guards and provisions which
 will secure its passage through
 this House Mr McCLEkNAND I
 do not rise for the
 purposc of going into a
 discussion of the expe diency
 of cormccting the Atlantic with
 the Pacific by means of
 a railroad to be constructed
 by pri vate enterprise aided
 by Federal patronage The public
 judgment has been long since
 pronounced In favor of such
 a measure and I am
 in favor of it I
 have been for it since
 the date of the acqui
 sition of our Pacific possessi01
 1s under tbc treaty of
 peace with Mexico have been
 in fhvor of it as
 a necessary means of consolidatintr
 and inte grating our extensive
 territories our ocean bound Republic
 and only awaited the ripeness
 of time to embark in
 it After ten years of
 thorough dis cussion and searching
 investigation the country has pronounced
 in favor of it with
 remarkable unanimity The only question
 remainincr now is as to
 the plan and form of
 the Ineasure whether the Gov
 crnment will intervene to assist
 in the effectua tion of
 the measure and whether onc
 or more roads shall be
 constructed This is tl le
 question For myself inasmuch as
 private enterprise has shrunk frotn
 espousing the enterprise alone and
 unassisted for so long a
 time I am willing and
 even desirous that the Government
 should succor it Hence sir
 I voted for the bill
 upon its pas sage through
 this House I voted for
 it how ever more on
 account of it s object
 than on account of its
 details Indeed I objected to
 many of its details as
 incongruous and ill advised I
 objected particularly to a multiplication
 oc roads as endan gering
 the project and as committing
 the Gov crn ment to
 too great a liability Yet
 I voted for it as
 the best I could do
 under the circumstances As was
 truly observed by my colleague
 Mr 1861 FARNSWORTH the Senate
 has made numerous and cumbrous
 amendments to the bill They
 have added to the incongruity
 of the bill and committed
 the Government to still greater
 ad vances of money or
 land in aid of the
 enterprise They have added another
 road to run from Lake
 I Superior to Puget sound
 with a branch to Port
 land in Oregon They have
 fixed one of the eastern
 termini of the road at
 the mouth of the Kansas
 river on the western border
 of Missouri instead of leaving
 that terminus open for determ
 ination by the company created
 by the bill Ry this
 change they have substituted Westport
 for a point on or
 near the san le parallel
 of latitude I say the
 latter as St Joseph in
 Missouri point because it seems
 to have been generally conceded
 that all the considerations of
 business population and centrality would
 have designated that point In
 this the public interest wras
 sub ordinated to local views
 and the dictation of a
 single city St Louis I
 regret all this not that
 I am unf riendly to
 St Louis but on account
 of higher considerations the convenience
 and ac commodation of the
 country at large I am
 in favor of one road
 a great central road which
 with the roads now in
 operation shall connect the two
 oceans but I am in
 favor of leaving the line
 of that road to be
 located by the practical intelligence
 of private judgment I would
 not have Congress to locate
 it by accidental ör competinæ
 combinations on this floor Such
 a location must except by
 accident be injudi cious and
 objectionable Moreover believe with my
 colleague that the multifarious and
 inultiforrn purposes of chis bill
 as tunended by the Senate
 cannot be accom plished under
 Its sanction In its present
 form It will almost certainly
 prove impracticable It is a
 monstrous medley which will repel
 capitalists from supporting it by
 embarking their capital and endeavors
 in favor of it No
 discreet capitalist will adventure his
 fortune upon so rickety and
 I If any should be
 found willing leaky a bottom
 to embark upon it it
 will only be those who
 will rely upon the Government
 rather than upon them selves
 for a safe deliverunce I
 am in favor of the
 amendment of the gentle man
 from Missouri Mr CRAIG as
 I understand it but I
 think it might be improved
 The bill as it passed
 the House contemplated two branches
 eastern branches to the central
 road one starting from the
 svestern border of Missouri the
 other starting from the western
 border of Iowa the two
 branches to unite at an
 eligible point near the bor
 ders of those States The
 gentlmnan s amend ment proposes
 to preserve this arranøement in
 part If in order I
 would amend his amendment by
 striking out that portion of
 the Senatc amend ment to
 which it relates and substituting
 one road a single road
 for all the roads proposed
 by the bill a rond
 starting from the wcstern border
 of the frontier States of
 the Mississippi or l åis
 souri valley and runnincr westerly
 upon a line to be
 determined by the company to
 San Francisco or to the
 navigable waters of the Sacramento
 in I I would leave
 the point of departure California
 from the western border and
 the intermediate line to its
 western terrnination to be fixed
 by the practical judgment of
 the company of course restricting
 their discretion in general terms
 to the most eligible route
 between the eastern and western
 termini of the road Such
 a road could bc built
 in reasonable time upon the
 basis of this bill by
 the union of indi vidual
 enterprise and capital with the
 largess of I the Government
 aid such a road would
 answer all exigent purposes for
 the Present and would facilitate
 the construction of other expedient
 roads in due timé I
 arn for such a road
 and will vote CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 879 The pecuniary credit of
 the Government is im paired
 we are already in debt
 and forced to bor row
 more and more money to
 keep the Govern mentin operation
 to keep it upon its
 logs Under these circumstances am
 opposed to encumber ing the
 Government with any unnecessary indebt
 I am opposed to extending
 its operations ment in any
 experimental form involving a still
 further strain of its credit
 Let us be sure of
 our contin ucd national existence
 before we launch off upon
 a treacherous sea of experimental
 spcculation Mr CRAIG of Missouri
 Will the gentle man from
 Illinois allow me here to
 suggest that after the vote
 is taken on my amendment
 the question will bc upon
 concurring in tho Senate amendment
 and a non concurrence therewith
 will be tantamount to his
 amendment That vote must be
 taken at any rate after
 the vote is taken upon
 my proposition Mr McCLERNAND 1
 do not know that 1
 shall have an opportunity to
 offer my amendment unless it
 be offered to the amendment
 of the gen tleman from
 Missouri If the House non
 Mr CRAIG of Missouri concur
 in the Senate amendment you
 will accom plish the obicct
 or your amendment exactly The
 SPEÄKER That be the first
 ques tion after the amendment
 of the gentleman from Missouri
 is disposed of Mr GROW
 The gentleman from Illinois will
 allow me to suggest that
 this bill is to be
 consid ered in the House
 and the previous question can
 be demanded on each a
 nendment and under the new
 rule the previous question exhausts
 itself on the single amendment
 But there never can be
 more than two amendments offered
 if the pre viotts question
 is called on the whole
 bill If the gentMman from
 Missouri calls the previous ques
 tion on his amendment to
 the first amendment of the
 Senate the previous question will
 exhaust itself when the vote
 shall have bcen taken on
 his amendment and the amendment
 of the Senate will still
 be open to further amendment
 If the gentleman from Illinois
 will allow me I desire
 to say a word further
 in reply to the remark
 made I have by his
 colleaguc Mr FARNSWORTH heard the
 remark frequently made upon this
 floor that this bill passed
 the House under the trick
 of the rules as it
 is called and under the
 pre vious question and that
 no opportunity was af forded
 to amend it That is
 a great mistake The bill
 could have been amended in
 Committee of the Whole in
 any way that gentlemen desired
 to amend it The original
 bill was read through by
 sections and was open to
 amendment But be cause gentlemen
 chose to leave it until
 it was too late they
 charge the fault upon the
 trick of the rules and
 say the bill was put
 through under the spur of
 t he previous question when
 really it was their own
 ignorance of the rules that
 prevented them from amending the
 bill The bill could have
 been amended and perfected in
 any way that any gentleman
 desired But because they chose
 to wait until it was
 too late they charge it
 upon a trick of the
 rules that the bill passed
 the House in such a
 cumbersome form Now II admit
 that there were some things
 in thc bill as it
 passed the House which might
 have I am in favor
 of one road or been
 improved 1 should be content
 with one but if there
 th ree are to be
 more roads than one I
 am in favor of th
 rec Mr McCLERNAND 1 wish
 to say a single word
 or two in conclusion before
 I yield the floor Mr
 MONTGOMERY Will the gentleman allow
 me to say a word
 in relation to this central
 route Mr McCLERNAND Certainly Mr
 MONTGOMERY In the place the
 central route or that portion
 of the Pacific rail for
 it most heartily nay as
 I have already said I
 will vote though with some
 reluctance for the road which
 is intended to connect with
 the city bill as it
 passed the House but drugged
 with the I of Philade
 phia and those cities that
 lie in the same parallel
 of latitude is of such
 a character as Senate amendments
 I do not think r
 can vote for it Such
 a road would in my
 judgment satisfy ought to preclude
 the possibility of the adoption
 ail reasonable public expectation more
 the pub of the amendment
 of the Senate It necessitates
 all the travel aud all
 the trade of that region
 to lic sense would probably
 condemn Independent of the inherent
 defects of the meas I

 least five hundred miles longer
 than any other route that
 could be adopted cither north
 or south accommodating no trade
 and no travel and affording
 no advantages whatever of a
 commercial character Why this is
 done I cannot is intended
 by the gentlemen from New
 England and the Lakes and
 the gentlemen from St Louis
 to combinc their forces to
 cut off all trade along
 the middle line of these
 great States of the Union
 Mr McCLERNAND makc an appeal
 to the gentleman from Iowa
 before I yield the floor
 I voted for the bill
 as it passed the House
 It has been so amended
 by thc Sen ate that
 I cannot vote for it
 now He has already stated
 in the hearing of the
 House that he him self
 disapproves of many of the
 amendments of the Senate I
 ask him whether he had
 not better stand up against
 amendments be condemns and insist
 upon the bill as it
 passed the House and trust
 to the chances of its
 success Let me ay to
 him that he had better
 not exchange the true friends
 of the measure in the
 House for enemies in the
 Senate for many of these
 amendments have reason to believe
 were made by the Senate
 in a spirit of hostility
 to the measure But thc
 gentleman says unless we concur
 in these amend ments we
 may lose the bill Let
 me say to him if
 we do concur we will
 be in still greater dan
 eer of losinry it Let
 us maintain the bill as
 it should be and if
 the President should veto it
 we will be justified by
 the judgment and sense of
 the country If we simplify
 the bill by curtail ing
 the liabilities which are to
 be imposed upon the Government
 and confine it to one
 great cen iral road upon
 a line corresponding with the
 parallel of latitude on which
 the greatest weight of population
 is to be found in
 the great States of Pennsylvania
 Ohio Indiana Illinois and Missouri
 all will be well the
 road will be con structed
 and the people will be
 satisfied Mr CURTIS desire to
 say something in opposition to
 this amendment Half a dozen
 speeches have been made in
 favor of it Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri As the gentleman
 from Iowa has indicated a
 purpose to call the pre
 vious question I desire to
 say few words before he
 addresses the House Mr CURTIS
 Very well I yield to
 the gcn tleman Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri I know very
 well how the gentlen lan
 from Iowa feels about the
 I know that pending amendment
 of the Senate hc is
 opposed to it but the
 fear that he will lose
 his last two years work
 and I admit that he
 has vorked faithfully induces him
 to agree to bad amendments
 of the Senate with a
 hope of getting them lopped
 off by the next Congress
 tell the gentleman that he
 is trying a dangerous experi
 ment The company that he
 contemplatcs Will never be organized
 under this bill Now I
 am sure that if the
 gentleman from Iowa thought that
 any one of tbc amendments
 of the Scnate and I
 believe there are forty five
 of them would be non
 concurred in he would speak
 and vote with me against
 this amendment of the Senate
 that am now trying to
 get modified but a belief
 that he can put through
 the bill with all the
 Senate amendments induces my friend
 to op pose me in
 this modification I tell him
 now that after we shall
 havc passed this point ve
 cannot go back The bill
 will certainly have to go
 back to the Senate on
 a number of the amendments
 and I ask him now
 to talk to the House
 as he feels about this
 amendment and to ask the
 House to join himself and
 me in adopting my modifica
 tion If he does not
 do that the amendments made
 by the Senate and Lo
 which he is opposed will
 be voted down At least
 some of the amendments of
 the Senate will be non
 concurred in and all the
 dangers which he apprehends from
 the bill hav ing to
 go back to the Senate
 will have to be in
 curred and then he cannot
 go beck to correct the
 I ask the gentleman error
 on this vital matter from
 Iowa to reflect that all
 of these amendments cannot possibly
 be concurred in by the
 House Why not therefore when
 he knows that my amendment
 to the Senate amendment is
 fair and 880 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 12 just and
 called for by a larger
 business interest than is represented
 in any of the Senate
 amend ments when he knows
 that it will accommodate more
 trade and commerce and travel
 than any other amendment offered
 why does he not I
 say give his adhesion to
 this righteous amendment which I
 know is ftvored bv his
 heart and judg ment The
 gentleman froni Iowa flatters himself
 with the hope that the
 House will concur in ali
 of these forty five Senate
 amendments and that he can
 thereby save his bill but
 he entirely deceives himself on
 that point I ask him
 now to come to the
 rescue and save my amendment
 Mr PRYOR I do not
 rise to debate this ques
 tion not at all I
 am persuaded Mr Speaker that
 no speech whatever might be
 its ability couhd even impede
 the passage of this bill
 still I do feel it
 incumbent on me as a
 Representative from Virginia to enter
 my protest against a meas
 ure for which there is
 not a particle of warrant
 in the Constitution against a
 measure which con templates the
 achievement of the most chimerical
 object against a measure involving
 an expendi ture which no
 contrivance of mathematical calcu lus
 can ascertain Is this the
 time when the rapid consolidation
 of the Government is already
 pre cipitating the disruption of
 the Confederacy to augment Federal
 power by fastening on the
 Gov ernmentmn excrescence creater in
 magnitude and influence than ever
 the East India Company was
 iii the palmiest day of
 its power Chimerical I say
 is the idea of traversing
 by a triple railway boundless
 deserts where nothing is heard
 but the howl of the
 wild beast and the yell
 of the more intrpctable chimerical
 measure in com parison with
 which the Colossus of Rhodes
 or the Pyramid of Cheops
 sink into insignificance Are we
 now when our utmost energies
 and resources are engrossed in
 the endeavpr to support the
 Gov crnment which we have
 and maintain the terri tory
 we possess is this the
 time to inaugurate so stupendous
 un enterprise When yobr Treasury
 is bankrupt when you have
 not money in your exchequer
 with which to discharge the
 petty debts due the menials
 in your employ when your
 credit is exhausted and the
 Federal Government proposes to travel
 over the icngth and breadth
 of the Union a mendicant
 for the indorsement of the
 States to sustain it is
 this I say the time
 to inaugurate an enterprise involving
 so much expense and the
 consumma tion of which I
 believe to be impracticable With
 these suggestions and wishing to
 bring the mat tor to
 chose I move to lay
 the atncndments on the table
 Mr CRAIG of Missouri Will
 that carry the bill to
 the table The SPEAKER pro
 Mr STANTON in the chair
 The motion carries the bill
 with it Mr SICKLES I
 ask the gentleman from Virginia
 to suspend his motion fora
 Inoment that I njay make
 a reply I think it
 is but fair that such
 an attack on the bill
 of a general nature should
 be met Mr PRYOR I
 have every disposition to ac
 commodate the gentleman from New
 York but inasmuch as he
 uan have an opportunity to
 reply hereafter I must with
 all respect insist on my
 motion The uestion being on
 Mr PRYOR s motion Mr
 I R YOR called fbr

 The vote was announced as
 above recorded MESSAGE FROM SENATE
 A messacre was received from
 the Senate by Mr PATTON
 one of its clcrks notifying
 the House that the Senate
 had passed Mouse bill making
 appropriations for the current and
 contingent ex penses of the
 Indian department and for fulfilling
 treaty stipulations with various Indian
 tribes for the year ending
 the 30th June 1862 with
 sundry amendments in which he
 was directed to ask the
 qoncurrence of the House Mr
 PHELPS Let these Senate amendments
 be referred to the Committee
 of Ways und Means Mr
 GARNETT 1 object to their
 refere e out of their
 regular order PACIFIC RAILROAD BILL
 AGAIN Mr CURTIS I hope
 that the vote just taken
 will be regarded as a
 test vote and that the
 op ponents of the bill
 will recognize that it is
 impos Sible for them to
 defeat the bill and will
 therefore allow the friends of
 the measure to go on
 and per fect it as
 well as they can Now
 in regard to the amendment
 of my friend from Missouri
 I confess there is no
 man asso ciated with n
 le in t his measure
 who has worked harder or
 more faithfully than he has
 done and therefore I dislike
 to oppose any propostion of
 his But still i must
 present this amendment in its
 proper light This is a
 controversy as any one can
 see between two great lines
 of railroad running through Missouri
 the one is called the
 Pacific railroad and the other
 the Hannibal and St Joseph
 My friend Mr CRAIG represents
 a constituency which is Inorc
 directly interested in the latter
 There is also a conflict
 between two cities the city
 of St Louis and the
 city of St Joseph Kansas
 City is almost directly west
 of St Louis and therefore
 the Senators from Mis souri
 insisted upon Kansas City being
 made one of the points
 of this road so that
 St Louis would be sure
 to have nn easy and
 certain connection by the so
 called Pacific road Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri One of the
 Sena tors from Missouri voted
 for that amendment under a
 misapprehension of the geography but
 he is now anxious for
 the adoption of my amend
 ment My collcague Mr WOODSON
 who rep resents tho district
 near the mouth of t
 ue Kansas river is also
 in favor of it Mr
 CURTIS did think that the
 fairest way would have been
 to leave thc point open
 specify ing only the western
 border of xMissouri or Iowa
 and let all Ehe different
 railroads compete for the terminus
 on the western frontier of
 those twa States Mr CLARK
 of Missouri Will the gentle
 man from Iowa permit me
 Mr CURTIS Certainly Mr CLARK
 of Missouri I am not
 partic ularly interested in any
 of those roads but I
 want to make a sugestion
 I propose to strike out
 all after the words said
 river in the seventh line
 up to and including the
 word Riley in the mnth
 line and to insert Thence
 up the Missouri valley to
 or near the fortieth par
 allel of north latitude That
 will accommodate all parties Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri I have
 no objection to take that
 Mr CURTIS The gentleman from
 Missouri had better take the
 amendments adopted by the Senate
 and afterwards if they prove
 to be too much of
 an incumbrance we can get
 rid of them by further
 legislation at another Congress Now
 Mr Speaker two points have
 been made in the Senate
 Through the efforts of the
 Sen ators from Missouri the
 point at or near the
 mouth of the Kansas has
 been obtained för the interest
 of St Louis and for
 some reason they have also
 put in Fort Riley as
 a point This last point
 is perhaps one degree south
 of a due west line
 from the mouth of the
 Kansas Now sir one gentleman
 Mr MONTGOMERY has said that
 this route is thus made
 a most ex traordinary zig
 zag line The gentleman from
 Pennsylvania says it first runs
 northwest then southwest then north
 then west then south and
 in that way he made
 it appear a perfect abortion
 Now what are the facts
 The Senate amendment has fixed
 Kansas City as a starting
 point From thence the route
 proceeds almost due west per
 haps as I have said
 one degree south of west
 to Fort Riley from whence
 Fort Kearny being made a
 point the route proceeds in
 a northwest erly direction From
 that point there is no
 ma tenal change of direction
 to the Salt Lake valley
 and thence to California all
 the way near the latitude
 of 410 and in a
 very direct line The other
 branch for Iowa still remains
 the same as in the
 House bill starting from some
 point on the western border
 of the State of Iowa
 The two branches are straight
 lines one starting from Missouri
 and the other from Iowa
 and they are so arranged
 as to start one north
 and the other south of
 the point occupied by my
 friend from Missouri If they
 will only continue the Han
 nibal and St Toseph road
 in a direct line until
 it intercepts either branch of
 the Pacific road they will
 have a better line then
 than any one from St
 Louis and they will have
 the same advantages that all
 the roads in Iowa wili
 have when they are prolonged
 as they will all come
 withili the angle of these
 two lines which embrace both
 States Now gentlemen undertake to
 say that the whole North
 the whole Lake country is
 going to be iønored Why
 sir the roads running from
 Chi cago through northern Illinois
 if they are pro longed
 as they are now being
 extended will also come within
 this angle and therefore I
 say that all the lines
 running west from Chicago and
 from St Louis and all
 eastand wrest lines between these
 cities and therefore the main
 lines through Penn sylvania Ohio
 Indiana and Illinois between lat
 itud 380 and 410 north
 latitude will come within this
 angle and will all be
 accommodated and any of them
 can claim to be the
 main Pacific route just as
 fairly as those on any
 exterior line can claim that
 advantage But the gentleman says
 they vvill have to build
 their own Pacific railroad Well
 sir it wriEl be doing
 just as we in Iowa
 have had to do We
 have some six or seven
 lines of road running from
 east to west through the
 State of Iowa and they
 have all to be prolonged
 to meet this main line
 i and enjoy the advantage
 of the Pacific railroad Mr
 MONTGOMERY The gentleman will remember
 that Iowa has received land
 grants for her roads to
 the extent of millions of
 acres from the Government We
 have had to build ours
 without Mr CURTIS And has
 Missouri received lands I hope
 therefore thegentleman fro 71 Mis
 souri will not insist on
 putting in his amelidment i
 should have been very glad
 if it had remained as
 the House passed it I
 should have preferred to see
 it remain an open question
 as to the start ing
 point on the western border
 of Missouri as is the
 casc in regard 10 Iowa
 But I see plainly that
 Senators will insist upon this
 particular amend ment and I
 shall therefore vote for it
 in the House and hope
 it wili be adopted In
 regard to the complaint that
 this bill is very incongruous
 and very elaborate I have
 just this to say I
 doubtthe capacityofevery man in t
 his House togetupabill that will
 be human perfection Iam very
 sorry that some of the
 honorable gentlemen who are colleagues
 of mine on the committee
 if they can see incongruities
 in the bill now did
 not see them the time
 when the bill was under
 con sideration in committee and
 have them stricken out This
 bill has been amended and
 arncndcd over and over again
 för the last two years
 all its Mr CRAIG anticipated
 very properly my view merits
 have been discussed and all
 its details have of this
 matter that in order to
 secure the bill we been
 considered in detail by special
 committees THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE THE
 OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED
 BY JOIIN C RIVES WASI
 IINGÆON D C THIRTY SIXTH
 CONGRESS 2D SESSION of this
 House I believe it is
 about as perfect a bill
 as one of its magnitude
 can be made except ing
 the repetitions and tautology incorporated
 by the Senate amendments In
 regard to the charge that
 the bill involves interests of
 such magnitude that it should
 therefore be voted down I
 will say that you can
 never secure the construction of
 a railroad to the Pacific
 without considerin5 matters of importance
 and magnitude And I will
 say further that a Pacific
 railroad cannot be carried through
 on a single idea or
 to accommodate a single line
 of road Make it as
 you may subject it as
 you please you will affect
 the whole railroad system of
 the West and each road
 will be enlisted in its
 ultimate advantages and success Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri As I
 do not intend to reply
 to the gentleman from Iowa
 I ask him to answer
 me one or two questions
 I desire to ask him
 if the amendment which I
 have proposed now is nota
 fair one and if the
 route is not one demanded
 by the public interest Mr
 CURTIS The principal objection to
 my friend s amendment is
 that it adds another fork
 i to the road It
 bas been objected that it
 already has too many forks
 and termini and the gen
 tleman now proposes to add
 another in order to connect
 his point The same which
 the gentleman ur es in
 support of his amendment would
 apply to Iowa with equal
 force line for Missouri gentleman
 demands another there is no
 reason why I should not
 demand an other line so
 as to have two points
 in Iowa and I think
 under tho circumstances he ought
 not to ask it Mr
 SICKLES I ask the gentleman
 from owa to give mc
 five minutes I desire to
 say a Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri word The reason why
 my friend from Iowa does
 not ask for two branches
 is that the Senate did
 not fix the terminus of
 the Iowa branch at a
 point that is not central
 in respect to that State
 but they left it open
 to the whole western border
 Df that State and i
 can prove by my friend
 from Iowa that such has
 been my wish in respect
 to the terminus of the
 Missouri branch But the Senate
 have taken it upon themselves
 to fix the point of
 starting in respect to my
 State and tak ng that
 point to be settled I
 think that the public will
 the public good and the
 public interest dc mand that
 this additional branch which will
 not exceed fifty miles and
 Inay not be fifteen In
 I ask that as a
 repre length shall be granted
 F entative upon this particular
 question of the interests of
 six of the largest States
 in the Union Mr CURTIS
 In respect to that in
 my opinion there is nothing
 of it It is nota
 fact that a gentleman starting
 fronl Philadelphia would be obliged
 to go over the Hannibal
 and St Joseph railroad or
 over any other pm ticular
 route to reach the Missouri
 river Why sir you may
 reach it anywhere on a
 line of four or five
 hundred miles I in length
 tha t will answer every
 purpose as a start ing
 point We have six or
 seven roads runninT through Iowa
 any one of which prolonged
 as now progressing would in
 my iudgment furnish a more
 direct route than the Mannibtil
 and St Joseph route it
 is the intention that these
 roads shall be prolonged And
 there is another road projected
 through Missouri the State line
 road which wili prove just
 as direct as the Hannibal
 and St Joseph road T
 hc representative of every road
 tells the public that his
 road is the most direct
 route Why sir every through
 kine of road leading from
 the eastern cities to the
 Missis sippi from the roads
 through Canada to the Bal
 timore and Ohio road all
 claim that peculiar fit FRIDAY
 FEBRUARY 15 1861 the House
 how many miles of railroad
 are em braced in this
 bill and in the Senate
 amendments and also vv hether
 any practical engineers have estimated
 the cost of these roads
 and if so what is
 that estimated cost What I
 would ask is the estimated
 cost of the three roads
 proposed and their branches Mr
 CURTIS Thero are branches to
 the dif ferent roads created
 by the Senate amendments which
 are nothing more than roads
 in Oregon and Washington for
 which grants of land have
 been made just as the
 other States and Territories have
 recei ved grants where the
 Govern men t owns lands
 rl hey ought not to
 be counted in this matter
 throw thcrn 01 1 t
 oc the estitnate The three
 roads will require the construction
 of about five thou sarfi
 l miles of road but
 the Government of the United
 States will not give bends
 for the whole extent of
 their cost Thore is no
 such proposi in the bill
 The people f the United
 States have constructed thirty thousand
 miles of road with but
 littlc assistance from the United
 States and under provision of
 his bill several thousand miles
 more may bc added in
 fifteen years As to the
 question of the estimate of
 engineers I will say that
 they have considered and reported
 on all these roads cxceptine
 only their branches It is
 said that no railroad men
 would undertake to orcanize under
 his coin pan y All
 I will say is that
 N _lr Cornine of New
 Y 01 1 who owns
 more railroad stock than any
 othcn man in the United
 Slates says that the bill
 is practicable even with thc
 amendments of thc Sénat and
 rccommcnds that it be passed
 as it is So Mr
 Farnham a wcll known and
 distinguished rail road man and
 rnau y nthers ad visc
 nie Mr BRANCH What is
 the amount that practical cncrinecrs
 estimate Will be the cost
 of those three roads Mr
 CURTIS They will cost it
 is estimated about three hundred
 million dollars but the Gov
 ernment of the United States
 will not be re quired
 to advance any such sum
 The bill pro vides for
 the loan of the Government
 credit to the amount of
 125 000 000 in thirt
 y year bonds No money
 is to be drawn from
 the rrreasury Mr BURCH What
 will the land be worth
 that t hc Government wiil
 give Mr CURTIS Nothing if
 the road were not constructed
 but what the Goverrkment retains
 will hc largely enhanced in
 value by the building of
 the roa d Mr BURCI
 I If the value of
 the landg be dedi icted
 the roads will not cost
 more than Mr BRANCH One
 question iii reference to the
 cost of these roads I
 beheve the gentlcrnan from Iowa
 is a practical engineer himself
 The question I wish to
 ask him is this Docs
 hc know of any railroad
 in the settled portions the
 United States where labor is
 abundant and pro visions cheap
 built through a mount ainous
 coun try that cost less
 than 100 000 a mile
 Mr CURTIS That is more
 than roads cost It is
 not calculated now even in
 the mountains that they witl
 cost at this day rnore
 than 40 000 a mile
 as they run through plains
 W c arc now making
 roads in the West at
 less than 20 000 a
 mile Roads are constructed upon
 the Plains and in the
 mountainous regions of the country
 much cheaper than formerly I
 now yield to the gentleman
 from New York provided he
 will call för the previous
 question Mr SICKLES Mr Speaker
 the gentleman from Virginia Mr
 PRYOR I at thc very
 outset of the consideration of
 those arnendments of the Sen
 ness of shortest best and
 cheapest So our roads II
 ate assails the measure as
 impracticable as un through Iowa
 and Missouri will hereafter contend
 II constitutional and utterly beyond
 the capacity of for these
 advantag es in reaching the
 Pacific road II this Government
 to execute I am sir
 Let us look at this
 thing fairly It is mainly
 a to l ght at
 the threshold upon all his
 objections l or shall I
 detain the House Iono with
 quest ion between Hannibal and
 St ToselTh what t shall
 have to say in reply
 He says it is railroad
 and what is galled the
 Pacific railroåd impracticable By that
 assertion he impeaches in Missouri
 The same conflict is engendered
 between the roads in Iowa
 Thev are ignored i the
 scientific researches and the mechanical
 genius of the age for
 sir for ten years past
 the scientific just as my
 friend s road in Missouri
 is neglected Mr BRANCH I
 want to ask the gentleman
 ability 6f this country has
 concentrated its atten a question
 for information I wish him
 to inform tion upon the
 practicability of this Work and
 I will 56 New SERIES
 NO 56 accept their demonstration
 of its feasibility and stand
 upon it against the naked
 assertion of the gentleman from
 Virginia When the Baltimore and
 Ohio railroad was projected its
 originators were ridiculed as demented
 and thoSe Who barked in
 the enterprise were denounced as
 impos tors Thé gentleman from
 Virginia to day occupies the
 same relation to the proposed
 Pacific com municdtiohi that the
 skeptics of 1830 occupied in
 reference tothe projected scheme of
 the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
 When you pass this bill
 his tory will refute his
 extravagant Objedtionsto this measure as
 effectually as eiperiehce has demon
 strated the absurdity of the
 objectionsmadé tovthé earlier projected in
 this country At tlfis moment
 Mr Speakier wh cn the
 telegraph carries our thoughts over
 sea and land from Londoh
 to Calcutta from the Rhine
 to the Ganges is it
 for American policy and genius
 and enterprise to pausc bcfore
 the rashly ventured objections of
 t nere doctrinaires No sir
 This railroad will be It
 will be built by American
 capital and built American capacity
 Nor will diere be a
 very large draft upon con
 stitutionai scruples in executino it
 I wilt remind the gentleman
 from Virginia that the Cabinet
 of in his judgment I
 presume a President wise cautious
 and statesmanlike Cabinet was unanimous
 in the opinion that ittwas
 constitut tional for the Government
 to aid in ther construc
 tion of a road which
 would as this road is
 re quired to do transport
 the mails munitions Of War
 and ti Oops of the
 United States The Cabinet of
 Mr Buchanan is also a
 unit on the Same queStion
 and has been so through
 all its phåses Mr McCLERNAND
 If the gentleman will permit
 me I will maké a
 single rernårk aid it is
 his all the great parties
 in this co untry repre
 sented in national conventions have
 indorsed not only the constitutionality
 but the feasibility ofa Pacific
 railroad Mr SICKLES That is
 the very next remark I
 proposed to make I believe
 the gentleman from Virginia concurred
 with my friend from Illinois
 in his choice ofa candidate
 for President That statesman I
 allude of course to the
 honorable Senator from Illinois Mr
 DOUGLAS has been distinguished for
 his long and devoted advocacy
 I might also add ofa
 Pacific railroad measure tl lat
 the lcct of the southern
 confed eracy ad vocated and
 recommended the con struction of
 a Pacific railroad as constitutional
 and practicable Mr PRYOR Does
 thc gentleman state that Hon
 JEFFERSON DAvrs favbrs the cohétruCtiOn
 of a Pacific i ailroad
 Mr SICKLES Certainly General DAVIS
 hag frequently ad vocated the
 constitutionality and feas ibility ofa
 Pacific railroad I heard him
 myself in a speech delivered
 in Philadelphia when he was
 accompanying President Pierce to New
 York in dorse the constitutionality
 of the measure But to
 pass from the authority of
 individuals I amrm as suggested
 to me by the gentleman
 from I Illinois Mr MCCLE
 RNAND that all the ptirties
 1 n this country and
 all the platforms which have
 been made during the last
 eight years have de clared
 as a settled question of
 constitutional law and public policy
 that the Pacific railroad is
 con stitutional and practicable and
 necessary The gentleman from Virginia
 compares this work to the
 Colossus of Rhodes and to
 the pyra mids of Egypt
 Why sir neither he nor
 I know how many thousand
 years since human hands erected
 those monuments and it is
 poor compliment to bhe progress
 of civilization to say that
 the Pacific railroad cannot be
 built by human hands in
 this veneration when three thousand
 years ago the pyramids were
 constructed by the and resou
 rces of that epoch Mr
 PRYOR Will the gentleman allow
 me a moment i SICKLES
 Certainly Mr PRYOR The gentleman
 impeaches my intelligence Let me
 aSSuÉö Iiiin Chat we have
 the testimony of authentig historians
 for the fact 882 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 13 that
 the Egyptian pyramid was constructed
 by a courtesan ofcelebr ty
 out of the wages of
 pros titution Mr SICKLES 1
 shall not in a dis
 cussion with the gentleman from
 Virginia as to I presume
 there the resources of ancient
 Egypt are no reports now
 accessible as to its finances
 i and in what he
 now says think he is
 merely repealing here one of
 the fictions of Herodotus and
 undertaking to give it the
 dignity of a fact It
 is like many by an
 assertion on this floor other
 stories of the same author
 made to enter tain his
 cotemporaries and not to enlighten
 pos _ terity The gentleman
 says ve have no credit
 upon which to undertake this
 road No credit Why Because
 anarchy has been brought upon
 the land and startled capital
 from its equanimity But there
 is a better day before
 us Kentucky has spoken and
 Tennessee has spokcn and your
 own Virginia has spoken and
 said to this demon of
 anarchy thus far shalt thou
 go and no further Applause
 in the galleries Credit will
 bc re stored credit will
 come again with the revived
 energies and the restored repose
 of our people and the
 Government Mr PRYOR The gentleman
 from New York alludes significantly
 to the result of the
 recent election in Virginia Now
 once for all I wish
 to speak a word of
 this business The result of
 that election has exposed Virginia
 to the compli ments of
 gentlemen whose praises she will
 accept in no grateful sense
 What has she done that
 she should be the victim
 of such suspicious ado ration
 What crime has she committed
 that she should be condemned
 to so intolerable an expia
 tion Permit Ine to say
 sir that Virginia by the
 result of the recent election
 has not pronounced for submission
 She has declared this and
 noth ing else that so
 far as she is concerned
 she is willing in the
 abundance of her patriotic magna
 nimityt to make one rnorc
 effort to save the Union
 but unless justice and right
 be rendered her she vill
 not hesitate moment to sever
 tho ties which bind her
 to an iniquitous and oppressive
 associa tion A plause m
 the galleries Mr S18KLES I
 have not ventured to be
 the I do not predict
 what she prophet of Virginia
 may do I only record
 whHt she has done and
 what she is now doing
 and I do afiirm that
 Vir ginia is responding 10
 the rnagnanimous policy of i
 Congress and the Executive yes
 she is respond I ing
 to the appeal wrhic h
 the northern masses have made
 to her to submit our
 difficulties to the arbit rament
 of reason and not of
 passion I say that Virginia
 in her recent election declares
 for the Union now What
 she may do on some
 future la I know not
 ir LEAK E Will the
 gentleman allow me one word
 Mr SICKLES Certainly Mr GROW
 Does the Pacific railroad pass
 through Virginia Laughter Mr LEA
 K E I want to
 say one word in sup
 I say now port ofthc
 declaration of my colleague to
 the gentleman from New York
 and through i him to
 the House and through this
 House it I i could
 to the whole northern branch
 of this Con federacy that
 Virginia has decided by a
 vote of ene hundred and
 twenty out of one h
 t tndred and fifty two
 members of her convention in
 favor of secgssion unless ample
 guarantee be given her i
 by the 4th of March
 I state furthermore that she
 ncvcr will submit to the
 Union as it is now
 and by her election she
 has determined in the Inost
 solemn mnnner she could determine
 She has said this and
 this is i all she
 hus said or means to
 say that she is will
 ing to preserve this Union
 and is anxious to do
 We regret to see from
 many of our northern exchanges
 that the import of the
 late election in l his
 State is to a large
 extent misunderstood or nisrepresented in
 that section The iinpression that
 Virginia has déter nined to
 remain in the Union as
 matters now stand to submit
 to the rule of tbe
 new dynasty under the Chicago
 programme is a gross and
 pernicious error She has decided
 to do no such thing
 nay she has decided to
 do just the reverse by
 a popular judgment approxirnating ubanimity
 She has determined that her
 connection with the northern States
 shall end unless satislhctory and
 inviolable assurances are given that
 every constitutional right she has
 will be recognized and respected
 and that her equality and
 safety as a nember of
 the Confederacy will be free
 from all jeopardy Mr SICKLES
 All these interruptions are quite
 unnecessary if they vere intended
 to an swer any implication
 of mine that I understood
 the result of the election
 in Virginia as excusing gentlernen
 holding the opinions entertained upon
 the other side of tho
 House from just and neces
 sary concessions I have not
 saiil nor supposed that this
 election terminated all the questions
 which have agitated the country
 Far from it I said
 no such thing But sir
 while do not mean by
 any word I may say
 here or by any construc
 tion I may put upon
 any southern elcction zto excuse
 or release gentlemen on that
 the Repub lican side of
 the Mouse from their full
 responsi bility at this crisis
 for the crisis is yet
 herc and upon us now
 yet I may be permitted
 asan Amer ican as a
 northern Democrat at least to
 con gratulate my country any
 party my associates at home
 who have stood by the
 South in all her trials
 who have fought side by
 side with her in all
 her battles I may congratulate
 the three hun dred and
 twelve thousand Union men of
 my State that they have
 met with manly a just
 and cor dial response from
 the people of Virginia und
 Kentucky and Tennessee And that
 is all I do And
 I may be permitted to
 add as I will that
 the common sense of this
 country understands the result of
 the popularexpression in those three
 States to be an earnest
 a profound an intense as
 sertion of their love for
 the Union and their con
 fidencc in the intelligence and
 patriotism of the people That
 is the way I understand
 it that is the way
 the masses the people understand
 it Mr Speaker I did
 not intend to go into
 any extended discussion of these
 matters but only re ferrcd
 to thon as bearing upon
 the financial credit of this
 Government and therefore resuming the
 current of n Y remarks
 I say that you will
 look nt the history of
 Governments and of AdmiE1 istrations
 you will find that they
 had credit in proportion as
 they inspired confidence in propor
 tion as the Government is
 made strong in its in
 tegri1Y No Govcrnment can have
 credit when it submits to
 anarchy It will have credit
 i hen cap ital startled
 by these sudden and fearful
 events shall have recovered its
 conoposure and that day is
 not far off The passions
 which have been aroused on
 the remote frontier have found
 a barrier where they should
 find it in hen rt
 s and purposes of their
 associate States We do not
 ask them to listen to
 us for they re fusc
 but vtje know they will
 130t refuse to heed Virginia
 and Kentucky and Tennessee A
 sir gle word more and
 1 will bring these re
 marks which were only designed
 to be very cur sot
 y and brief to a
 rapid conclusion I say that
 the objections stated upon this
 floor heretofore and repeated to
 day that this measure is
 to im pose upon the
 Government an impossiblc outlay is
 but a characteristic specimen of
 the exaggera tions which are
 indulged in our discussions Sir
 this bill does not call
 upon the Government to raise
 one dollar in the present
 condition of its credit No
 man supposes that this year
 or next year or the
 year after this Government will
 be called upon for any
 sum of money if we
 pass this bill to morrow
 No sir and long ere
 the period shall arrive when
 the Government will be called
 so if she can get
 justice and failing to get
 jus i I tice she
 Will look to her own
 right arm for pro upon
 10 issue its bonds or
 stake its credit we will
 I have recovered all our
 energies and the magnifi tcction
 and appeal to no earthly
 power whatever cent resources and
 powers of our people will
 go to take care of
 her rights on in the
 development of their destinv on
 this Mr PRYOR I appeal
 to the gentletnan to I
 will obtrude upon continent and
 the consolidation of our empire

 agreed to PERSONAL EXPLANATION Mr
 FITCH while Mr SIMMONS was
 address I dislike very ing
 the Senate on the tariff
 bill much to interrupt the
 Senator from Rhode Island or
 any other gentleman while speaking
 but I ap peal to
 his courtesy to yield me
 the floor for a mo
 ment for a personal explanation
 though on a mat ter
 which is perhaps of little
 importance in itself Mr SIMMONS
 Certainly Mr FITCH 1 desire
 the Clerk to read an
 ex tract which have marked
 from the report pre sented
 to the House of Representatives
 yesterday It is very on
 the subject of the Indian
 bonds brief The Secretary read
 as follows By reference to
 the abstract marked herewith trans
 mitted it will be seen
 that the Government still holds
 State bonds and certificates and
 Jnited States stocks for certain
 Indian tribes to the amount
 of 2 525 241 82
 I hese bonds as well
 as the eight hundred and
 seventy abstracted and one Indialla
 bond handed to I Ion
 G N FITCH and not
 returned by him to the
 Department tor reasons assigned in
 his cot respondence with Godard
 Bailey were purchased from tune
 to time by authority of
 law vvith the money of
 the Indians arising fronn treaty
 stipulations Mr FITCH Hud the
 correspondence been published in the
 Globe of course it would
 have borne its own explanation
 and I should never have
 alluded to it but that
 not being published I deern
 it proper to state the
 reasons why this bond has
 not been returned it is
 the bond to which I
 alluded a day or two
 since when asking the Senate
 to refer with instructions a
 certain bill to the Judiciary
 Committee in order to bring
 to a close the controversy
 between my State and the
 United States relative to payment
 of interest on Indiana bonds
 held in trust by Government
 Some years since to state
 briefly the manner in which
 the bond camc into my
 possession the Secretary of the
 Interior either personally or through
 some clerk I do not
 recollect it is im material
 which stated to me as
 one of the Sen ators
 from Endiana and a member
 of the Commit tee on
 Indian Affairs that these bonds
 were held in trust by
 him for the Indians and
 the interest was unpaid by
 Indiana that he was about
 to ask Congress Lo authorize
 him or some one else
 to institute proceedings in law
 or in some other manner
 for the security or recovery
 of the amount of the
 bonds and the interest unless
 the State consented to some
 arrancrement by which the in
 tercst was promptly paid blame
 there be for its not
 having been promptly returned That
 it will be found and
 returned there can It will
 thus be seen that one
 scarce be a doubt of
 the perhaps too few good
 natured acts of my life
 an act to which I
 assented out of regard on
 the one side to the
 good name and reputation of
 my State and on the
 other a desire in the
 dis charge of what I
 felt to be a duty
 to save to the United
 States Treasury a sum annually
 appro priatedto meet interest which
 the officers of the Government
 claimed was due from that
 State has caused my name
 to be lugged into this
 House report in a sort
 of semi juxtaposition with a
 recent matter and one altogether
 foreign to that which was
 the subject of correspondence between
 the Department and myself I
 say with the Depart ment
 because part of the correspondence
 was directly with the Secretary
 not all as the report
 would imply with his clerk
 A description of the bond
 is recorded in the Department
 and its identification therefore easy
 As the matter oc curred
 some years two or thereabouts
 since as it had no
 connection direct or remote Wilh
 that which it was supposed
 the committee was ap pointed
 to investigate as no loss
 could by any possibility occur
 from it to the United
 States or gain to any
 individual Ido not I confess
 clearly comprehend the necessity for
 making allusion to ita part
 of the report Neither is
 the motive any more clear
 Relative to that however i
 will i dulge in no
 supposition trustingit was one whi
 if known would commend itself
 to respect TARIFF On motion
 of Mr CAMERON thc Senate
 as in Committee of the
 Whole resumed the consid eration
 of the bill 11 R
 No 338 to provide for
 the payment of outstanding r
 I reasury notes to authorize
 a loan to regulate and
 fix the duty on imports
 and for other purposes The
 PRESIDING OFI ICER The Chair
 is advised that there are
 several amendments which have been
 reported from the select committee
 and the first thing in
 order will be the considera
 tion of the amendments reported
 from that com mittee Mr
 SIMMONS Mr President as this
 bill is brought up for
 the purpose of being considered
 by the Senate at the
 present time I shall proceed
 to state for the information
 of the Senate the grounds
 takcn by tho committee and
 the reasons upon which they
 have based the annondments J
 ha_d not supposed myself they
 propose to it that this
 bill would be taken up
 this morning any Of course
 like any representative from any
 further than to assign it
 consideration to mor other State
 I was unuriliing that Eli
 y State should be placed
 before Congress ih the attitude
 in which a debate on
 any such proceedings would place
 it and at the sucgestion
 therefore of the officer with
 whom the conversation was had
 I opened a correspondence with
 the then executive of In
 diana upon the subiect and
 in order that the application
 on the part of the
 Department should be thoroughly understood
 by the State Executive the
 Secretary and the class of
 bonds known placed in n
 lyr hands one of the
 bonds a 1 000 bond
 as a specimen of its
 class that I might in
 close or describe it to
 the Governor The cor respondence
 resulted as I remarked the
 other day in the debate
 namely in my discovering that
 the bond was OF a
 class which the State supposed
 it I had provided the
 means of paying or at
 least re leased itself from
 any direct liability for payment
 in other manner by the
 passage of the bill by
 which it agreed to surrendcrihe
 Wabash and Erie canal for
 the bonds The United States
 never surrendered the bonds in
 their possession in or der
 to exchange them for certificates
 in the stock of the
 canal and it is not
 now nor was it two
 years since probable that Congress
 would au thorize such an
 exchange because the canal has
 proved worthless By this correspondence
 there fore I learned that
 the bonds vere no better
 ap parently than waste paper
 and hence some care lessness
 probably in not seeing that
 the onc row and perhaps
 have not hcrc some of
 the data which I intended
 to read If the Senate
 pre fer to take these
 arnendments up in the order
 in which they are proposed
 and act upon them I
 wilk explain thetn but I
 have been roquested to state
 the general grounds on which
 these amend mcnts are sumrested
 by some members whp are
 in favor of the bill
 Mr SEWARD 1 wish to
 make a suggestion to the
 Senator from Rhode Island The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Does the Sen
 ator fi orn Rhode Island
 yield Mr SIMMONS Certainly of
 the operation of the present
 tariff for the three entire
 years that it has been
 in operation togethér with the
 returns of the first half
 of the currbnt year with
 the estimate of the Secretary
 Of the Treasury for what
 will come in in the
 two remain ing quarters of
 the present we found that
 under tho provisions of the
 tariff act of 1857 there
 I have been thrown on
 the market in the first
 three years 1 017 upon
 which there have been paid
 144 000 000 in duties
 The current year taking what
 has been paid for the
 first two quar ters and
 what has been estimated by
 the Secre tary of the
 Treasury for the next two
 will give 40 000 000
 of revenue and thus wehave
 forfour years 184 000 000
 of duties upon importations of
 about 1 300 000 000
 showinl r an average duty
 of per cent and an
 average income of the sum
 of 465000 000 The expenditures
 for the three years whiéh
 are entire years under this
 bill have been 66 000
 000 per annum Last year
 they were only but it
 will be recol lected that
 the Post Office appropriation bill
 for that year failed and
 was paid during this year
 making an average of 68
 000 000 for each year
 of the last three exclusive
 of payments on ac count
 of interest on the public
 debt That is just more
 than we have received annually
 beside the interest on the
 public debt which at the
 end of tbc present fiscal
 year will amount to over
 5 500 000 per annum
 When this Admin istrafion came
 into power there was a
 public debt requiring about interest
 per annum That debt has
 been increased and will have
 been increased by the end
 of this fiscal year to
 an an ount which will
 require additional per annum making
 a deficit under the present
 tariff law of 24 000
 000 annually for I take
 it that the incidental payments
 paymeniß for claims c will
 absorb all that we receive
 from the public lands We
 therefore had to provide or
 seek to provide for a
 deficiency of from 20 000
 000 to 24 000 000
 a year and like all
 other questions of this kiod
 it is very easy for
 people to complain of any
 mode for increasing your revenue
 but very diffcuit to find
 anybody willing to pay a
 dollar towards its 1 have
 found that the invariable rule
 increase Every interest that you
 propose to require money from
 comes here with a protest
 and a com nuttee to
 back it up in variably
 We therefore supposed it was
 our duty to propose a
 measure that would i Ficrease
 this revenue at least year
 The rate of duty under
 the present law having real
 izcd about 14å per cent
 the actual rates would be
 16 per cent if equal
 amounts were imported in ail
 the schedules We propose to
 carry the measure up to
 an average of 20 per
 cent upon the I whole
 what the late Secretary of
 the Treasury in his first
 annual report said this present
 bill would yield It is
 an addition to the present
 rates of about one 30
 uper cent We have endeavored
 to attain that end We
 have carried up many of
 the articles of these schedules
 from one fourth to one
 third embrac ing many things
 on the dutiable schedules that
 In almost every ques have
 l itherto been free t
 ion in which we have
 imposed higher rates of I
 duties than the existing law
 we have been met_by delegations
 fairly representing the wishes un
 Mr SEWARD 1 understood the
 honorable doubtedky of those who
 sent them here remon Senator
 to ask whether it was
 proposed to take IL stratitw
 a ainst the increase I
 have now given a general
 outline Of Lhe ne up
 the first or that he
 should go on I believe
 nobody supposes cessity of this
 bill Mr SIMMONS Yes sir
 that in any probable contingency
 we can import N Ir
 SEWARD I wish simply to
 give b im notice that
 at the proper time to
 suit his own any considerable
 amount annually more than we
 I shall propose to strikc
 have done for the last
 three years There were convenience
 abolit jt larger importations in
 those three years than there
 out of this bill the
 provisions as well of the
 amendments as of the original
 bill ör abolishing have been
 for any three years since
 the existence oftheGovernment byaveryconsiderableamount or

 the Uni I will submit
 that niotion at his con

 per cent larger than they
 ted States i ever were
 before m any three previous
 years i venience either now
 or at any other time
 Mr SIMMONS sir perhaps it
 might They were three very
 prosperous years interu have been
 as well for the Senator
 from New York rupt ed
 at one time in 1857
 but the aggregate Lo hear
 the reasons for that amendment
 beföt c he amount of
 importations in that year was
 nearly i including the quantity
 in the ware concluded to
 vote against it In raising
 this revenue the committee I
 house Mr SEWARD 1 gave
 the honorable sena concluded to
 go upon the general plan
 where they tor notice that
 I desired fo hear hi
 n and so I placed
 in my hands was immediately
 returned to the Department During
 the correspondence that suspended the
 offering of t11C amendment until
 I had made spe cific
 duties of placing about 25
 per cent upon the fair
 wholesale market value of bond
 became mislaid whether among the
 Gov should hear his remarks
 ernor s papers or mine
 I know not but having
 i i IVIr SIMMONS I
 was about to say I
 goods as the duty specifically
 to be laid where the
 value was known to them
 Where those was interrupted that
 the committee to which this
 beon placed in rnv custody
 by the Department values were
 not distinctly known in this
 country subject was referred had
 first to consider the state
 should be among my papers
 and therefore I as of
 the finances of the country
 Having obtained l they have
 fixed upon a rate of
 30 per cent as a
 sunle all the responsibility and
 all the blame if a
 report frorn the proper Department
 of the result II maximum
 upon those articles which come
 in com 886 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 13 petition with
 the labor and industry of
 our coun try As an
 exception to this they have
 raised the duty to 33
 per cent on such wines
 as are not specific They
 have put a specific duty
 upon t he higher cost
 wines as well as a
 specific duty upon brandies and
 spirits I make the statement
 of the general outline of
 the plan It will not
 do for Senators to criticise
 this measure by the statements
 that have been printed and
 laid on our tables in
 order to see whether or
 not i re have exceeded
 those rates During the investigation
 on this subject there has
 been an unusual degree of
 interest manifested throughout the country
 Various memorials have come here
 saying this was suddenly sprung
 upon the country askmg us
 to delay its consideration until
 they could find out what
 the provisions of this bill
 were but we could find
 no reason for delay when
 we came to reflect that
 this bill has been printed
 more than two years that
 it passed the House of
 Representatives very nearly a year
 ago was printed in all
 t hc newspapers came here
 to the Senate and was
 referred to the Committee on
 Finance believe5 on t he
 10th of May last and
 has been so far as
 the friends of a sound
 system of duties are concerned
 approved of and intended to
 be passed from that day
 to this when ever there
 was an opportunity to get
 at its con sideration We
 have endeavored strictly to confine
 our selves within the rules
 that I have stated in
 the general route of travel
 in changing this revenue system
 We have not been unmindful
 at the same time of
 the effect that such increased
 rates of duty would have
 upon the industry of the
 country upon the consun iers
 of merchandise of the country
 and its effect commerce for
 let me say that every
 member of that committee so
 far as I know and
 I believe every one ex
 pressed the opinion that they
 regarded the navi gating and
 commercial interests of this country
 with as high a degree
 of favor as any other
 pur suits in the country
 There is no purpose to
 trench upon them or to
 raise this revenue to their
 detriment any further than a
 sufiicient revenue may prove a
 detriment to all who have
 to pay the taxes There
 was no purpose of crippling
 any branch of trade The
 delegations that have been before
 us from the different cities
 representing the commercial and navigating
 interests of the country have
 all been 4tssured that we
 intend no hostile purpose against
 those branches of busi ness
 and industry and I trust
 they svere assurcd in such
 a manner that lhey will
 ret u1 n to their
 constituencies and make that declaration
 without hesitation The Senator from
 New York has called my
 at tenti0D to the warehousing
 system and as t hat
 is upon my tnind 1
 will speak upon it now
 I he committee have very
 much increased the time allowed
 by the bill as it
 came from the Ilouse of
 Representatives That biil required the
 duties to be paid within
 one month from the time
 of entry and all goods
 in warehouse to pay the
 duties in cash wilhin thirty
 days from the passage of
 this bill S Ve have
 taken into he l e
 culiar slate of the country
 the vast annount of imports
 now in the warehouses and
 i order to prevent a
 sudden call on these importers
 far the amount of revenue
 upon those imports l ave
 con cluded to postponc the
 operation of the bill in
 refü erence to the warehouse
 system for nearly five months
 until the 1st of July
 next leaving the im porters
 of those goods an opportunity
 and then after that time
 we are not to call
 for the duties under threc
 months postponing all claim upon
 the goods now In warehouse
 until the 1st of Oc
 tobei next unless they desire
 to take t l lem
 out sooner for consumption considered
 t hat was due to
 the present condition of the
 coun cry altered as it
 has been in many respects
 sine e t_he orders ing
 of a committee of the
 Chamber of Commerce of New
 York that if it was
 to their conve nience I
 would be willing to extend
 it to nine months beyond
 that time making in all
 from the time of entry
 to the time at which
 they would have a right
 to a return of the
 duties one year A single
 member of that committee said
 that he thought that ought
 to be satisfactory others thought
 the time should be extended
 even further but upon consultation
 with other members of the
 committee we thought that that
 was as long a time
 as was safe for the
 Treasury M e thought it
 was the duty of the
 committee to look to the
 interests of this Government One
 of the reasons for not
 extending the time for the
 payment of duties is this
 goods go into warehouse to
 a very much larger extent
 than usual when there is
 a re vulsion in trade
 At the very time when
 the Gov ernment is getting
 but very little money from
 im portations owing to the
 stagnation of business what little
 imports come in go into
 warehouse to avoid the paytnent
 of duties as we have
 scen within the last sixty
 days and we have been
 driven into thc strcets for
 money with the exac tions
 that have been made upon
 this Government of from 12
 to 36 per cont per
 annum for the loan of
 money for a year That
 circumstance seems to be brought
 up here by some members
 of the Senate as a
 matter of gratification to them
 that the Government of the
 United States should be reduced
 to these necessi ties It
 is a matter of great
 mortification to me that the
 credit of this Government should
 be im paire nder any
 circumstances and it is for
 the rcaso hat we cannot
 afford to give these exten
 Sive credits that we have
 hitherto done that the committee
 thought it prudent and expedient
 nay even indispensable to the
 safety of the Govern ment
 that they should be shortened
 W heu cred its were
 extended and this warehouse systern
 was first adopted one year
 was the extent of the
 term for which they could
 lie in warehouse but as
 our resources increased we had
 vast amounts of money in
 our Treasury doing nobody any
 good locked up from the
 community and these credits were
 enlarged in order that the
 money might do good to
 somebody and they were enlarged
 with out interest and l
 ropcrly enlarged for any facil
 ity we can give to
 trade and commerce without paying
 too dearly for it ourselves
 wc ought cheer fully tk
 give But when we come
 to such a pass that
 the interests of the Government
 require us either to exact
 this pay in arcasonablc time
 or to 00 into the
 street to hire money to
 carry on the Government I
 think duty to the Government
 re quires us to shorten
 the credit within a reasona
 ble time not to shorten
 it so that we should
 cm barrasstheimportecsofmercllandise Wo propose to
 give them three months to
 look about them selves and
 make arrangements and negotiations by
 which to obtain money to
 pay these duties whereas tbc
 bill as it originally passed
 the House provided that the
 duties should be paid in
 thirty days Another consideration for
 n ot extending the time
 for this drawback l eyond
 nine months is this these
 debenturc as they used to
 bc called whot e goods
 were subject to drawback will
 ac cumulate and enlarge themselves
 according to the length of
 the timo they a ro
 au standing and we thmurht
 that the stun of or
 perhaps in active times of
 commerce would be as us
 it would be safc to
 allow to accumulate azainst the
 rlh easury in prosperous times
 for it will be recollected
 that the period of the
 greatest exportation of this foreicrn
 merchan disc that is in
 our warehouses is v hen
 there is a revuksion of
 trade in this country MT
 hen the knar kct is
 dull hero merchants look abrQad
 to seli the goods that
 are In wareaouse When the
 market is dull hero the
 receipts of the Treasury are
 small I have stated it
 to these different gentlemen who
 represented the great commercial cities
 and had t honght and
 expected that the disposition of
 the committee to do everything
 within the verge df prudence
 that they could do without
 jeopardiz mg the Treasury too
 much would have satisfied these
 importers of foreign merchandise But
 President whatever these delegations may
 say when they return to
 their constituents I will say
 for them that they pressed
 their free trade notions here
 and their adherence to that
 idol with more than an
 eastern devotion Nothing will induce
 them to give up this
 idea of havino goods remain
 three years without paying duties
 No conces sions that I
 have been able to make
 will appease them and therefore
 notwithstanding the state ment of
 the Senator from New York
 if he shall move to
 strike this all out and
 leave it at three years
 I shall appeal to the
 Senate when that timo comes
 to protect the Government of
 their country I shall be
 as liberal as I think
 the Gov ernmcnt can afford
 to be for it is
 a great deal more pleasant
 to be liberal than to
 bc exacting and more according
 to my disposition but I
 know it is t ime
 that this Government was looking
 about it and providing means
 for its expenses without resorting
 to loans every year I
 have stated that for four
 years I have endeav ored
 to induce thöse who had
 the charge of the finances
 of the Go ernment to
 look at this thing as
 it was and try to
 provide a remedy for it
 We have been put off
 with promises and hopes and
 delusions that this thing would
 yet come outright that we
 should get money enough under
 the pres Instead ent tariff
 to carry on the Government
 of that we have got
 au average of 46 000
 000 a year for four
 years in the most prosperous
 times the country ever knew
 for importations As to these
 estimates in regard to the
 receipts for the present two
 quarters say nothing about them
 I take them as the
 Secretary hands them whether i
 never venture myself too much
 or too little to say
 what six months will bring
 in 1 can only tell
 and only profess to be
 able to tell very nearly
 what 100 000 000 under
 any particular tariff will yiekl
 in revenues but as to
 how many hun dred millions
 will come in in a
 year is a matter never
 havo ventured n conjecture on
 As to these immense rates
 which have been charged in
 this bill and which have
 been got up to elucidate
 the diffculties of collecting the
 reve nue with specifie duties
 or with duties partly specific
 and partly ad calorenz I
 believe I shan defer any
 comments upon them until v
 re come to the practical
 application on the amendments which
 the coxnmitrtee have reported 1
 Vil only say In passing
 that these gentlemen ho have
 called on me have appeared
 to be very candid They
 have answered every question I
 have asked them as to
 the market value of the
 goods they have made calculations
 upon with the utmost frank
 have no doubt they intended
 to make ness these statements
 fairly but they have been
 most egregiously mistaken as to
 the laws of the Uni
 ted States for the collection
 of revenue thåt now exist
 and as to the probable
 results of this bill now
 under consideration In nvany instances
 sec they vary 20 or
 per cent upon the duties
 now itnposcd upon the merchandise
 that they pass upon For
 instance they take carpets and
 they say the pregent duty
 is 19 per cent and
 we are going to raise
 it to a fabulous amount
 understand the act of 1857
 and the roen who are
 inaporting under it tell me
 aright the du ty now
 is 24 instead of 19
 per cent Then in ali
 these cal culaiions I sce
 they reckon the pound sterling
 at 4 44 Everybody that
 knows anything about it knows
 that our laws require duties
 to be as sessed at
 4 84 to the pound
 sterling so that they make
 the cost less and the
 duties more upon this specific
 amount by 10 per cent
 besides what mis in order
 to relieve the and at
 the very time when wo
 shah be rpceiving tako s
 they make in reckoning the
 ratcs of duty for these
 goods was given irnporters from
 any sudden cali on them
 for the the least into
 the Treasury tnerc will hc
 most of I and they
 make a vast increase in
 these duties payment of these
 duties much as the Treasury
 these goods exported and most
 of these deben vvhen in
 fact there is no increase
 at an reqllired them I
 am told that the amount
 of these ture bonds come
 upon the r Ih easury
 for payrnent I was struck
 with one of these tables
 that goods at present in
 warehouse is from 50 000
 000 so that it wili
 cut us off at both
 eids We shall showed the
 enormous rates on woolen goods
 and to 60 000 000
 will an amount of duty
 on them be receiving little
 and paying out much in
 times perhaps of or of
 revulsion Five six million dollars
 in my W c have
 then made a further provis
 on that judgment is as
 much as it is safe
 to Ict accurnu after the
 duties bavo been paid the
 importers shall II latc a
 ainst the I reasury at
 such tirnes For this have
 a right to reship these
 goods to any port in
 reason wo thought we should
 not extend the time a
 foreign country any iirnc within
 six months after duties are
 paid beyond iViine months I
 arn thereafter and have a
 return of the duties with
 willing to do that much
 for the convenience of the
 a reduction of I per
 cent J suggested to a
 meet merchants shawls that duty
 was from to 41 per
 cent upon this Enø ish
 calculation of 4 44 to
 the pound sterling asked thegentleman
 who handed rue this table
 to tell ine the cost
 of the shawls that he
 was seiiing and dealt in
 He gave noe their cost
 and gavc me the amount
 01 duty i l this
 hill by the pound rate
 caleu at e d in
 cents and parts of a
 cent and then the percentage
 and aflcr hav THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 1861 887 inm told
 him we designed to my
 30 per cent upon these
 foreign goods he gave me
 five specimens The first shawl
 cost him francs weighed cighteen
 ounces and paid 68 cents
 duty that was 3 per
 cent upon the dutiable value
 The next one cost 17
 francs wei hed twenty one
 ounces aud paid 93 cents
 that IS 30 per cent
 The next one cost 22
 francs weighed thirty one ounces
 paid 1 14 duty which
 was 31 per cent The
 fourth cost 25 frances weighed
 thirty ounces and paid 1
 33 duty which wras 30
 per cent The next cost
 32 francs weighed thirty nine
 ounces and paid 1 74
 duty which was 30 per
 cent There were five articles
 that he had on his
 paper in all of which
 we came within 1 per
 cent in our cal cuiations
 of what vverc the actual
 duties on his in I
 told him that though we
 were not all voice Yankees
 we werc all pretty good
 at guessing I then asked
 him the wholesale price of
 these goods as he sold
 then i Ho gave me
 the price of the first
 on which he paid 68
 cents duty as 3 50
 the wholesale market value That
 at 20 per cont would
 be TO cents and the
 duty was 68 cents The
 next one cost him 17
 francs which would pay 93
 cents duty and it was
 sold at 5 at whole
 sale We put it at
 93 cents which lacks 7
 cents of being 20 per
 cent on the home value
 The next originaliy cost 22
 francs and sold for 6
 and paid 1 14 duty
 Twent J per cent on
 that would be 1 20
 6 cents more than he
 will have to pay The
 next was the one vvhich
 cost 25 francs and the
 price was 7 50 and
 will pay 1 33 duty
 Twenty per cent on the
 selling price would have been
 1 50 The next was
 the 32 francs onc which
 paid 1 74 duty and
 sold for from 8 50
 to 9 whic h would
 be 80 duty at 20
 per cent and the duty
 under this bill is 1
 74 Thus in all these
 cases of these enormous high
 duties as they are called
 that I have been able
 to get at specifically I
 do not find a real
 in stance where according to
 the value in the New
 York wholesale markct we put
 a duty on thc goods
 of over 20 per cent
 althou gh we designed to
 put it at 25 per
 cent and whcre we knew
 the price we did put
 it at that so that
 we can under lated with
 such great accuracy and intended
 to illustrate the enormous duties
 that are imposed by this
 bill We see by the
 instance given that every de
 parture from tbc common ad
 cal orenL rate of duty
 that would shomtv to the
 greatest advantage has been taken
 up as for instance the
 one on com these parties
 w e had a meeting
 assigned an even ing to
 receive the delegations before the
 committee I invited the Senator
 from Virginia to attend but
 he could not come but
 all the rest of the
 members of the committee were
 there to hear these parties
 state their grievances and the
 terrible effects the ruinous effects
 that this bill was to
 produce upon their interests It
 turned out after about three
 hours session that taking the
 representa tions of the Sheffeld
 manufacturers and the great workers
 of steel in this country
 after they had argued this
 question to their hearts content
 one of the men a
 consumer of steel suggested that
 should take a quarter ofa
 cent off one of the
 rates of duty and with
 that he would be perfectly
 content They had been rncmorializing
 Congress and used up a
 ream of paper and when
 they got to the point
 they wanted one of the
 specific rates altered one quarter
 ofa cent a pound Thecom
 mittee concludcd if they could
 sleep onc night over it
 that probably they would not
 disturb us any more The
 next morning one person from
 each delegation came to my
 room to inquire the conclusion
 at which the committee had
 arrived I told them for
 the committee that we hud
 con cluded not to alter
 it at all They said
 they came to tell me
 they were perfectly satisfied and
 were very glad to hear
 that wc had not changed
 it Mr CAMERON If the
 Senator will allow me I
 do not desire to interrupt
 him but Ilierely to ask
 his opinion on the rate
 of duty on chain cable
 Some objection has been made
 to that I should like
 to hetir him on that
 point IVfr SIMMONS I am
 not familiar with the manufacture
 of chain cable and I
 am now givincr a mere
 explanation of the principle of
 the bill merely desire to
 disabuse the mind of the
 Senate of any influence received
 by these rnemorials which I
 only wish to state this
 have becn sent to us
 question in regard to steel
 WI ach has acritated this
 country more perhaps than any
 other question that l ias
 been brought before Congress for
 five years My friend from
 Minnesota Mr WILKINSON had one
 of these memorials from Rhode
 Island He thought it was
 a little singular that Rhode
 Island steel workers should send
 a memorial to him He
 called my attention to it
 and I told him I
 knew why it was not
 sent to me They knew
 I would Oive them considerable
 of a lecture if I
 found a man in Rhode
 Island who did not know
 more about this tariff than
 to send such a memorial
 as that But I told
 him we would examine the
 sub In the first place
 the me ject and ferret
 it out morial set out
 with a statement that there
 was no ning yard in
 England twenty four inches wide
 steel made in this country
 and that there was a
 vast arnount of revenue received
 from it I went two
 thirds of a square yard
 in each yar l The
 It is what we with
 n y friend from Minnesota
 to the Treasury dutics are
 said to be per cent
 call the sixty square or
 one hundred and twenty Department
 and found the quantity of
 steel im I ported last
 year and thc arnount of
 duties paid threads to the
 square inch counting both ways
 I then got returns from
 steel makers the square yard
 there would be a duty
 of 2 in and about
 Pittsburg and on comparing the
 cents and 10 per cent
 of the whole value to
 amount they madc with the
 whole import ations cover tho
 printing and the wholesale price
 of I found that they
 exceeded the ilnportation vastly in
 that little vicinity around Pittsburg
 the goods was from 9
 to 10 cents a running
 yard At 10 cents the
 duty to bc paid is
 17 per r After we
 had got the rates of
 duiy from the cent and
 that is selected as an
 instance of the T peasury
 books I told him the
 best way to see extravagant
 rate of duty imposed by
 this bill At I what
 the rates of duty were
 vas to go into an
 the common selling price in
 New York it is 17
 importer s store and ask
 the price of the steel
 that these people talk about
 We went into a per
 cent and it is ciphered
 out here to be store
 on the avenue we found
 there steel valued per cent
 on thc English prices They
 have put ever on anybody
 We right to put this
 stcel at 30 per cent
 as any aitticle there It
 is the most highly eldboratéd
 fabric that is It is
 taken out of the hills
 Of is made from iron
 Permsylvunia They say it is
 a raw material I tell
 these people that the mainspring
 of a Watch is raw
 material for a watchmaker He
 wants that to build his
 watch iVith the same as
 I want steel to put
 on my plow only that
 I happen to use iron
 ones and do not need
 any steél I have traced
 out very many of these
 memo rials I have gone
 to the headquarters Avhere im
 porters sell these goods and
 I have invariably found in
 them the most extravagant goit
 of mis representations as to
 the operation of this bill
 You would not replcnish your
 Treasury this cen tury if
 you had to follow them
 all but when I follow
 out one to its legitimate
 results I present that to
 the Senate and prefer they
 should make up their mind
 upon that rather than to
 divide their attention among a
 thousand things which they cannot
 recollect Therefore Shall not go
 into general cxplanations unless somebody
 should desire it from me
 on particular sukfrc ts but
 I will givc another illustration
 to the Senate in regard
 to these memorials that are
 traveling around here We are
 told of these extravagant duties
 that are piaccd upon cotton
 goods which are said to
 be all the way from
 40 to 80 percent I
 have the tariff of 1842
 and I have the calculation
 of their imports under that
 tariff which has received very
 great years that tariff vgas
 in operation the average duty
 collected on the whole of
 the importations was 26 7
 per cont There was not
 3 per cent col lectcd
 under that high tariff The
 duties on these coarse cotton
 goods under that tariff were
 6 cents a square yard
 and in this bill that
 I have reported of what
 it was under the tariff
 of 1842 and there is
 more clamor about this than
 there was about the tariffof
 1842 There is absolutely more
 clamor against paying a cent
 a Square yard for the
 heavy cotton sheetings than there
 was to pay 6 cents
 at that time The duty
 by this bill is not
 much over 10 per cent
 We design to put the
 lowest rate of duty on
 goods worn by the laboring
 classes of the coun try
 We put I cent per
 square yard on those goods
 that cost generally about 10
 cents per square yard We
 put 2 cents on finer
 goods that prints imported to
 print here We put 3
 cents on goods that generally
 sell from 8 to 12
 cents counting from 140 to
 200 threads above 200 threads
 w hiCh was omitted in
 the printing of the bili
 on a sched ule from
 12 to 16 cents we
 put 4 cents and then
 25 per cent ad tudorem
 Now take the aggre gate
 average of all those and
 they will run from one
 sixth to ono half what
 they were in the tariff
 that VVith the prices of
 these goods am person to
 tell me what they will
 cost if they tell me
 how many picks they count
 For the last thirty years
 they have all been bought
 by these counts every newspaper
 that publishes the account of
 thc sales of print cloths
 there is given the count
 and the price That is
 the way all üe circulars
 come from England and in
 addition to that he this
 print down to cost 3
 072 cents a running at
 the Trcasury at seven and
 three quarters or yard I
 do not believe I have
 known the time eight and
 three quarters I forget which
 The I circulars from England
 tell you at what you
 within ten years that you
 could buy a piece of
 the low duty steel which
 was the high priccd steel
 gray cloth that money not
 printed I know was vakued
 at perhaps eight and three
 quarters the prices laid down
 in New York or Providence
 about the price of English
 printing we went the store
 1 told the Importer we
 base the market value and
 take one of i we
 wanted the price of steel
 for another purpose I have
 been unable to find any
 of the great ex than
 to purcl ase that wre
 wanted to know what any
 comm ssion oloths r i
 here is another question about
 cot_ton threads travagances that are
 charged to this bill in
 many it was worth because
 we were about to legislate
 if regard to which a
 very respectable firm New l
 have no doubt that Senators
 on the subject He said
 he had imported rather more
 than he needed and had
 sent a lot to Phil
 York has sent a circular
 here to the Senate That
 of these papers HüNTER j
 who was at the head
 of the Finance adelphia and
 New York but he had
 got the re is a
 casc in which ib is
 said the business is to
 oe o c that xxve
 had I turns and could
 answer us precisely that this
 entirely destroyed if we put
 30 per cent on it
 some two or three hundred
 memorials from the cast steel
 netted him 15 cents a
 pound That is Thirty per
 cent was the duty believe
 under II the market value
 these people are complain sent
 around to all the blacksmiths
 the United I ing at
 a duty of cents a
 pound on it That is
 the entire Importation of this
 article the It is about
 14 per cent il ladies
 will not have any to
 do their need e v
 hat the bill puts on
 it it is going to
 be the utter duties were
 epon steel They said this
 bill upon the market value
 here and they get it
 up work if you put
 this on i destructiou of
 it This is prtnted and
 laid on increase l the
 duty from 40 to 261
 per cent The I to
 260 per cent on the
 foreign cost Thus when It
 is from a respectable l
 ouse Senator from Virginia used
 to come here every ever
 I have undertaken to go
 to the dealers of Senator
 s tables k nosv one
 of the gentlemen personally He
 had these articles as do
 before I make a statement
 bill of indictment against the
 extravagance of the i about
 them f have invariably found
 them to be letters to
 me from a late of
 mine They billi now Is
 Such great importance had complainin
 2 about duties when they
 were the have gone on
 gnd showed that it wiil
 be a dead Deen given
 to this duty on steel
 so extensively most reasonable and
 as little as the Government
 was it used that at
 the request cf ihe agents
 of ii could get along
 with without any hardship than
 now imposed thatitwili be a
 prohibition 888 tw el tl
 ciphered this over Here is
 an invoice of t ead
 costing 175 sterling which is
 a dutiable VAIue of 5
 697 The duty at 30
 per cent is 1 706
 10 Now if you look
 at the other charges tl
 üt are made here you
 will find that they are
 as rnuch as the duties
 order to make outa loss
 this th read they put
 more than 1 700 there
 as chzu ges for commission
 and interest T_he com is
 charged at per cent and
 that is per cent more
 than i cver had to
 pay when I I lave
 had my goods sold but
 perhaps they charge it and
 very likely they do As
 I make it out giving
 them pe _r cent commission
 and allowing them 4 per
 ccn t fijr freight they
 would have abou ti 400
 profi t afterall these extravaga
 o t cha rges and
 the duties 4re paid but
 they say it would be
 a doss to make ib
 If an additiooal duty of
 6 per cent is imposed
 Why sir I can make
 out a very satisfactory paper
 statement at any time to
 show loss if you will
 Ine make the charges If
 I put on 1 700
 charges on the sale of
 read to the value of
 1 175 or 5 687
 worth besides the duty that
 is 60 Pér cent on
 t be whole I do
 not expect to have to
 talk doog a boubsuch papers
 as these are They are
 Ofs the same charactet They
 are made out to make
 a ease exactly as I
 stated but if you go
 into the items you will
 detect the errors I have
 not seen oneyeL x vhich
 gives the pound sterling as
 it should be as the
 law requires I have not
 examined them all but every
 one I have gone I
 do not expect that I
 will have Lime this session
 to examine them all We
 have had as many papers
 sent to us on this
 subject as a man could
 read in seven months and
 10 do not expect to
 have to answer all of
 them Mr WADE How about
 screws Mr SIMMONS It is
 just the same about screws
 have seen but one or
 two rnemorials about them but
 as the Senator has mentioned
 it I will tell him
 what the duties are on
 screws In the tariff of
 1842 there was a duly
 of 12 cents a pound
 imposed upon screws of all
 sizes This tariff puts the
 duty at B and 5
 cents an averagc of cents
 1842 valued all this mercandise
 I was for four n
 aonths gettil lg values from
 iln porters of rnore Lhari
 four hund red articles of
 rner chandise got thctn from
 importers in every large city
 of the country and made
 up the values from their
 letters The screws then were
 of different klDd not near
 as good and there was
 not near as much waste
 of iron to rnake tl
 lem market value then of
 the large sized screws was
 40 cents a pound an
 l small screws were valued
 at 66 cents a pound
 and duty of 25 per
 cent on those values By
 the tariff of 1842 12
 cents per pound was put
 on all kinds so as
 to have but one rate
 Qi duty The duties in
 this bill arc about half
 as riluch as the duties
 then und the screws Itisjustahout
 25 per cent upon the
 market value of those screws
 1 looked the books over
 and took tho samples a
 bu nd red gross screws
 of each sort of various
 sizes I rnade the average
 of them myself and it
 carne out about 25 per
 cent on the averaæe They
 wan Led more to be
 put on l hc smaller
 kinds but I told them
 the rule of the comruit
 tee was a specific duty
 equal to 25 per cent
 on the market valuo where
 we could ascertain it and
 where we could not sorne
 other CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE put in
 the labor and stuck to
 it and lived in one
 story houses upo n 1
 a day Théy have now
 got a great capit l
 built up by their labor
 gnd people now tell us
 how much they divide on
 the 50 they put in
 They have been at it
 twenty years draw no sqla
 ry and they have succeeded
 If any body will work
 as they haye I do
 not care whether they will
 begin to nakc pins screws
 large hanuners or sheet anchors
 if they work as they
 have done they will be
 snre to come out ahead
 I wish every one would
 have a little more of
 that kind of skill I
 think it is the best
 So much for the screw
 business This duty has been
 assailed I have sometimes thought
 it was assailed as they
 assail me person idly in
 the newspapers because I happen
 to be put on this
 committee do not know what
 else they can havc to
 say There is a large
 interest in Rhode Island in
 this business and I never
 could sec why these mechanics
 were not entitled to just
 as Inuch protection as any
 ot her class of people
 cannot see w by they
 are not cntitled to as
 much if they live in
 Rhode Island as if they
 lived in any other part
 of the country They do
 not ask any more and
 if they did I would
 not give it to them
 I am going to try
 to do right by all
 interests if I know how
 and I shall eXpect them
 to have just as nuch
 as others I do not
 ask anything because fifteen or
 twenty failed and lost all
 they had Ido not mean
 to take anything under because
 these men have been successful
 They deserve it They have
 worked night and day for
 it and have managed their
 affairs well I hey are
 now competing with the same
 sort of work that is
 made in England where money
 is 3 per cent per
 annum J hey have manufactured
 the screws and the additional
 duties put on iron will
 amount to them to 30
 000 or 40 000 a
 year They ask nothing for
 that They say only put
 these duties on and we
 shall be independent of England
 for iron in a little
 while and go to Penn
 sylvania to get it and
 so they wilt I heard
 a complaint made about the
 duty on iron last year
 that time there was a
 man in n y who
 used a very large quantity
 Q iron two or three
 t housand 100s and a
 thousand tons of wrought iron
 every year and called his
 at tention to the duty
 on wrought iron and I
 told hirn that the Slate
 of Pen nsyl vania wanted
 solnc t hing H e
 looked the bill over saw
 that there was a dut
 y of 6 on pig
 iron und hc said That
 is about ri ht I
 wc uld rather give 7
 if they would only make
 it a litlle better So
 too when we came to
 tbc duty on bar iron
 he said That is about
 right all I vant is
 for t make the iron
 better they would make it
 good T h lt is
 the fi2ejing of a man
 who consutnes three thousand tons
 of iron a year He
 makes stationm y engines You
 find that the people who
 buy iron in immense quantities
 are not complaining about the
 duties on it II is
 the peoplc who arc for
 the makers of it in
 Wales r l hcy are
 the anen who are com
 laining Ihat we are goino
 to injure tho country f
 they t bought thc Americans
 were to pay the whole
 t this duty do you
 think all Sheffield would be
 here al out steel and
 all Wales about iron Ehey
 think it will come out
 of their pockets the end
 They arc not concerned about
 our February 13 terest that
 Mill press upon us for
 the next five years bas
 got to be raised out
 of these tariffs Another thing
 that I have to say
 in reference to the amonnt
 of money that has been
 expended is that in add
 ition to the estimates we
 are voting here and there
 which are not estimated for
 for building steamers for trans
 porting African negroes who have
 been captured m slavers and
 those estimates coming fronl the
 Treasury do not amount to
 the surn it will be
 necessary for us to raise
 Everybody recollects that in the
 year 1857 when the first
 Treasury note bill was presented
 to the Senate the chairman
 of the Committee on Finance
 said that it required 12
 000 000 to operate the
 Treasury to adv ntage for
 the nt service and the
 ordinary operat ons of the
 Treasury Now the Administration coming
 into power is coming in
 With u balance of 1
 000 000 for both purposes
 We are going to starve
 then l to keep them
 at low water mark with
 the chin just above water
 The Senator from Californ wants
 as much as 500 000
 in San Francisco for the
 mint This Government will be
 soon without funds The last
 time 1 was at the
 Treasury Departnlent they had but
 2 000 000 that were
 available and there were requisitions
 upon it för 1 800
 000 from one Department 1
 think that In some form
 or other we have got
 to raise more money so
 as to have more than
 in the Treasury we must
 keep 4 000 000 or
 5 000 000 there in
 my opinion Then I have
 provided a loan in this
 bill nearly forgotten to mention
 that 1 do not believe
 that the coming fiscal year
 will turn out to be
 an average year for impor
 tations orxevenue and 1 have
 provided a loan We have
 now loans enough authorized to
 pay up the Treasury notes
 outstand ing including the 10
 000 000 which come due
 next January and to carry
 on the Government to the
 301b of June next That
 is what is pro vided
 for but the deficiencies for
 the year ending June 30
 1862 are not provided for
 Unless this tariff gives revenue
 enough för the coming year
 we must have a n
 additi01 ial loan and I
 have no idea that it
 will do not believe we
 shall import an average quantity
 by 20 per cent place
 trade is impoverished credit is
 very much impaired and we
 cannot expect this great coun
 try to revive in three
 months from such a depres
 Sion as we are now
 undergoing and I think it
 to provide for or the
 deficiency of the next year
 I have also got a
 provision in the bill for
 issu ing stock at six
 per cent and authorizing the
 I M juld rather give
 2 if Secretary and President
 it the bids are not
 at par decline to receive
 them and to issue in
 lieu of it ih easury
 notes in denominations of not
 less than 20 at six
 per cent to be receivable
 in Gov ernmeot dues or
 paid out where the creditors
 of the Government will accept
 them Then there is another
 provision that if any of
 the loans al ready authorized
 are not proposed for at
 par they may convert them
 into Treasury notes and those
 notes may be funded in
 this stock by the holders
 whenever they choose to take
 at par the stock already
 authorized In that way be
 lieve we shall relieve ourselvcs
 from this entire dependence upon
 the money lenders and combi
 nations of money lenders If
 they will not let us
 have it at a fair
 price the people will in
 my opinion These requirements I
 think it is in dispensable
 to meet mode was adopted
 But we endeavored to fbllow
 I people paying it If
 we paid it they would
 not that rule in variably
 care a fig but these
 duties will make a competi
 It is said these screw
 manufacturers made an lion in
 t hesc articles and thul
 loss comes out of immense
 fortune I have heard it
 stated in some them in
 the end That is the
 way it works These I
 think we should get this
 memorials that there werc over
 worth fbreign agents are as
 busy as a Mother Carey
 s I money and in
 this way the Treasury notes
 will of screws used in
 this country every year But
 chicken in a storm whenever
 you get to this eventually
 be funded if you will
 get t he returns from
 all the manufac tariff They
 say You will ruin business
 you Now wish to make
 one commentin reference tories yott
 will find that there was
 not 1 tax your people
 But when I come to
 these large to the security
 of this Government and the
 sug worth of them sold
 last year instead of 4
 000 000 consutners they say
 That is about right put
 gestion of the Secretary of
 the Treasury that the That
 the way these statements arc
 made There it on let
 Pennsylvania have it and we
 shall have States in this
 Union should indorse the securities
 have been I believe twenty
 two or twenty three iron
 better than we have had
 That is my ex I
 of the United States I
 have no doubt that screw
 manufactories established in Ncw England
 perience for the last twenty
 years gestion is made from
 the best motives Some of
 New York and New Jersey
 There is one in I
 do nol intend 10 upon
 this matter New York now
 some in Massacht lsetts some
 in have told the Senate
 the general outlines of the
 I States from some cause
 or other but 1 think
 it Rhode Island There were
 twenty two or twenty proceedings
 of the commiuee I shall
 now state was because when
 we went to borrow we
 had a three of Ehern
 l have seen a list
 and out of the further
 t in nay deliberate judgment
 with Secretary who was left
 handed with bot i hands
 twenty two that were years
 back nineteen importations equal to
 those for the last three
 to whonl they did not
 like to lend I thilBk
 that of thern failed and
 ost their capital A good
 years under the present tariff
 that is upon i was
 one great trouble I desire
 to state what my nntny
 of them had LO pay
 installments after they bill would
 give more than opinion is
 about the credit of this
 Government I set up the
 factory and but three or
 four are stand of duties
 instead of 144 000 000
 think the Government of the
 United States has ine the
 whole set They have fought
 through which we have received
 under the present tariff got
 the first mortgage upon all
 the property in and have
 succeedtad ii the end when
 others faili d It is
 my deliberate judgment that the
 Treasury every State of this
 Union and that t he
 creditors Although expect if we
 are ever of the States
 have only second mortcraffes That
 pioneer company was made up
 of a parcel of I
 blessed with a majority i
 this body and the Obher
 mechanics w_ho owned but very
 little stock but House to
 reduce the expenses vastly yet
 the inw ted States that
 did not take precedence of
 all other 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 89 debts against any
 debtor I believe that the
 bonds of thc United States
 are just as much secured
 by the pt0F erty of
 the Siate and city of
 New York as are the
 bonds of the State and
 city of New York The
 only difference is we have
 the right to take first
 if it comes to that
 but I would not give
 a jackstraw for the indorsement
 of all the States of
 the IJnion on the bond
 I held if I had
 the United States at my
 bock to protect me Still
 I have no objection if
 people should indorse the United
 It will not hurt it
 The credit is good enough
 You cannot put names enough
 on the back of it
 to destroy it and I
 have seen paper where thc
 only trouble was I saw
 so many names on the
 back of it that I
 doubted it That is the
 only objection I have to
 having this indorsement It cannot
 do any good yet I
 admit the patriot isn of
 the States that are willing
 to lend their I know
 it is donc from the
 best of mo I am
 merely making this statement to
 show that it is entirely
 unnecessary in my view of
 the case but if there
 is any timid creditor who
 wants tliree or iöur indorsers
 let him have them I
 believe Massachusetts proposes to ind
 orse these have never knowpn
 her five per cents to
 notes be below par But
 to satisfy the most timid
 let t hern be indorsed
 but I do not intend
 to put gny thing in
 this bill to ask anybody
 to indorse our paper I
 have now explained the general
 principles of the bill and
 when it comes up regularly
 if the amend tnents of
 t he com nittce are
 not satisfac tory I will
 explain thern as fur as
 I can with great pleasu
 re The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 FITCH in the chair libe
 amer d cnents offered by
 the com mitt ee will
 be read in the order
 in which they occur Mr
 WILSON lhopewe shali now take
 up these amendments of the
 committee and proceed with them
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair
 has announced that the amendments
 will be read in the
 order in which the committee
 reported them Mr FESSENDEN to
 know the cou rse of
 proceeding with reference to the
 bill whether after the bill
 has been read through and
 the several amendments reported by
 the special committee are disposed
 of It will then bein
 order to move amendments to
 any of thc sections as
 a Senator may desire The
 PRESIDING OFFICER TheChairsup poses the
 entire bill will be open
 to amendment after all the
 amendments of t he committee
 have been disposed of The
 Secretary will read the amendments
 The first amendment of the
 committee was in section one
 linc fifteen to striko out
 two and insert so that
 the clause will road Provided
 That no stipulation hat bc
 Inade to prevent the United
 States Croni rein bursing any
 surn borrowed under authority of
 this act at any time
 after the expira often years
 Mr SIMMONS I have an
 amendment to that section if
 I can find it about
 the loan that i was
 speaking of and think the
 Senate would facili tate business
 by adjournincr over and lettincr
 me arrange rny papers on
 this subject I have been
 called upon unexpectedly Mr WILSON
 think we had better pass
 over that part of the
 bill in regard to the
 loan and go to the
 fifth section of the bill
 I think ve can make
 some progress with it this
 afternoon Mr HUN I ER
 1 will suggest to thesenator
 from Rhode Island who has
 the management of that it
 was not expected to come
 up to this Lliil day
 we thought this day would
 be occupied If he will
 TIX to mor with counting
 the votes row or any
 other day for the consideration
 of the bill we shall
 then be ready to act
 upon it I did not
 come here prepared I have
 not rny pa pers with
 tne If he will say
 to morrow or indi cate
 a day when it can
 be taken up again I
 will a rree to it
 1M r BIGLER Let it
 go over as unfinished business
 Mr CAMERON desire to say
 Mr Pres Ident that the
 session is coming very near
 to a close and I
 think we had better continue
 the con sideration of the
 amendments this afternoon Mr WILSON
 As the Senator from Rhode
 Island does not sccm to
 be quite ready to go
 on with this amendment and
 the Senator from Vir ginia
 makes the same statement I
 think we may pass over
 the bill informally and take
 up one or two other
 matters and this bill will
 come up in order to
 morrow I want to take

 and arms in the regular
 service case of wounds or
 injuries received ili the linc
 of duty or in case
 of being killed in the
 performance this question of the
 Senator who is a member
 of the Committee on Naval
 Affairs was that the public
 should not draw any improper
 inferences from this movement That
 was my sole reason W
 e have heard a great
 deal of the necessity of
 having military force in this
 District Although as devotedly attached
 to the Union of the
 States as anybody else although
 opposing this doctrine of secession
 as strenuously as anybody else
 I have never had any
 idea that there was any
 neces sity for filling this
 District vr ith military and
 surrounding this Capitol with a
 military force to preserve the
 peace of the country and
 in order that the country
 might know that the reorganiza
 tion of the militia of
 this District had no reference
 to the political troubles of
 the times I called upon
 the Senator from Massachusetts who
 is a mem ber of
 the Committee on Military Affairs
 fi l an explanation Mr
 MASON 1 looked into this
 bill a week I do
 not now very distinctly recol
 or two acro lect its
 provisions nor am I at
 all versed in mili tary
 matters but I will ask
 the Senator from Mas sachusetts
 whether by the terms of
 the bill for really I
 do not recollect any oath
 is prescribed to the men
 There is an oath to
 the omcers I pre sume
 but 1 desire to know
 whether the men are required
 to take an oath when
 they are enrolled Mr TVVILSON
 in reply to that question
 I will say that there
 is in this bill a
 provision requiring that the offcers
 and soldiers shall take an
 oath to support the Constitution
 of the United States and
 the laws It is a
 different oath from that required
 by the bill passed by
 the House of Representatives which
 is now on the table
 re ported by the Committee
 on Military Affairs That bill
 requires the taking of the
 oath that a man takes
 on going into tho actual
 service of the country This
 is a simple oath to
 support the Constitution of the
 United States and the laws
 of the country Mr I
 v1ASON I hope the Senator
 wilk indi of such duty
 the same provisions will be
 ex cate t Section that
 contains the oatll so that
 it tended to them their
 widows and orphans as are
 I may be cad provided
 bv law in like cases
 to omcers non com missioned
 offcers and private soldiers of
 like grades belonging to the
 regular Army of the Uni
 ted States Mr WILSON This
 bill was prepared by a
 board consisting of General Jesup
 Major Lee General Weightman Mr
 Randolph and Colonel Hickey it
 was recommended by the Secretary
 of War unanimously agreed to
 I understand in the House
 of Representatives last ycar by
 the Committee Military Affairs therc
 and is unan imously agreed
 to by the Committee on
 Military Affairs of the Senate
 this year The bill was
 reported to the Senate without
 amendment and was ordered to
 be engrossed for a third
 reading and was read the
 third time Mr ULSBURY 1
 should like to ask the
 Senator from Massachusctts what particular
 rea son exists at the
 present timc for tl ie
 reorganiza tion of thc militia
 of this District I do
 not know of any circumstances
 existing at the present time
 that call imperatively for the
 reorgan ization of thc militia
 of the District If such
 rcasons exist I think it
 is 11 10 to the
 people of the District that
 they should know what those
 reasons are and they should
 be stated to the country
 Mr WILSON Some two or
 three years ago a commission
 was appointed to revise the
 militia laws of this District
 The commission took the matter
 into consideration devoted a great
 deal of time to the
 consideration of it and made
 a report ILSON I have
 not the bill bcfore me
 but I think it is
 the third section Let the
 Sec retary read that section
 The Secretary read it as
 follows SEC 3 Jlnd bc
 it further enacted That each
 officer non cmnmissioned otiicér and
 private before entering upon the
 duties of his office shall
 inake oath or affirmation iu
 due forrn of law before
 a Inagistrate duly eonnnissi01 f
 d and qualified that he
 wilt support and defOnd thc
 Constitution and laws of the
 United States and wili faiLhfukly
 pertOrrn the duties appropriate to
 the of lico and connnis
 sion or war rant which
 he holds or rnay hold
 in the militia of the
 Dis trict of Cohuubia and
 to obey the orders of
 his lawfully appointed superior oflicer
 to the best of his
 knowledrre skill ability and judgment
 which oath or affirmation Shakl
 be signed by the officer
 non connnissioned officer or pri
 vare taking the same Certified
 by the magistrate and rc
 corded in the ofhco of
 the adjutant general of the
 ruilitia and in the offtce
 of the clerk of the
 circuit court of the Uni
 ted States for the District
 of Columbia Mr MASON i
 presume it is always usual
 I am sure it is
 so in the State of
 Virginia and I morc confident
 on that than the other
 point when a citizen takes
 a military office under the
 Government and becomes thereby one
 of the ad ministrators of
 its laws as he does
 that he shall take an
 oath properly to dischargc the
 duties of the office but
 I have never heard an
 oath of that kind imposed
 upon the privates the nen
 in the ranks unless in
 the regular service of the
 United States when they enlist
 l hat is a voluntary
 act and they place themselves
 for the time being under
 the orders and control whatever
 their own opin ions may
 be of their superiors but
 the militia and the Secretary
 of War Mr Floyd recom
 dut y is an involuntary
 duty The law requires mended
 the passage of the bill
 At the last ses that
 able bodied citizens ofa certain
 age shall be Sion of
 Congress the Committce on Military
 enrolled against thcir will and
 shall be required to Affairs
 of the House of Representatives
 as I un perform military
 duty Now to impose an
 oath derstand unanimously directed Mr
 PENDLETON upon those men may
 be to entangle their con
 bill that has come from
 the other House and has
 been referred to that committee
 This bill was presented some
 years since and is the
 result ofa report made by
 a commission that was appointed
 I will state to the
 Senate and for that purpose
 I perhaps It is worthy
 of consideration that if there
 any one on the Committee
 on Military Affairs who has
 made any particular examination of
 it I do not know
 it will state further in
 regard to it that the
 bill being understood to be
 the re port of a
 commission composed of gentlemen of
 the highest character and respectability
 which had been and had
 reported at a time when
 no trouble or diffculty was
 anticipated it was received in
 that way by the committee
 and I do not think
 had any serious consideration at
 all Now I am not
 aware and if other Senators
 members of that committee were
 aware of it they did
 not brine it to the
 attention of the committee that
 there was an oath provided
 for in this bill I
 confess it Inay be deemed
 a hard confession to make
 but I believe truth is
 the best policy un der
 all circumstances that I never
 read the bill through I
 am not satisfied that when
 read through the bill will
 turn out to be wrong
 but I am satisfied the
 Committee on Military Affairs did
 not investigate it with any
 cfoseness or direct ness Under
 those circumstances while I think
 the bill itself is proper
 and ought to pass I
 cannot but think since those
 questions are raised and since
 there are points made here
 that ure new at least
 to one member and I
 take it to very nearly
 all the committée that the
 bill itself should be referred
 back to the committee If
 the bill is as I
 anticipate it is it can
 bc reported back again at
 an early day and there
 will be no difficulty in
 passing it I submit a
 motion that the bill be
 recommitted to the Committee on
 Military Affairs there to be
 considered and again reportetl to
 this body The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Senator from Arkansas moves
 the recommitment of the bill
 to the Committee on Military
 Affairs The Chair begs perrnission
 to state further in refer
 ence to the motion made
 by the Senator from Vir
 gmia that the bill having
 been three times read it
 is not under the rules
 of the Senate open to
 amendment unless by unanimous consent
 Mr MASON well sir 1
 that imous consent will be
 given If not I can
 move to reconsider the vote
 ordering the bill to be
 read a third time but
 I suppose by unanimous con
 sent the amendment may be
 received Mr BRAGG As one
 lately appointed upon the Committee
 on Military Affairs I wish
 to say in addition to
 what has been said bv
 my friend from Arkansas that
 I was not aware that
 a pro vision in relation
 to an oath was contained
 in this took it that
 the bill as introduced by
 the Senator from Massachusetts was
 the same as that reported
 from the commission and I
 understood him to say when
 he introduced the bill that
 there was a commission appointed
 to draft the bill or
 rather to report in relation
 to the reorganization of the
 militia of the District That
 commission was composed of regular
 offcers of the Army and
 of sorne of the militia
 offcers of the District I
 learn upon inqun y that
 the provision in rela tion
 to the oath has been
 incorpörated into the bill at
 this session and suppose by
 the Senator from Massachusetts before
 he introduced it at 0
 11 events I learn that
 that provision was not in
 the bill as originally reported
 T be bilk has been
 pending before Congress for some
 time and to that bifl
 I for one have no
 objection but I think it
 is a departure from usage
 as has been said by
 the Senator frorn Virginia to
 require an oath of the
 privatee of the militia of
 the District as such If
 I had been aware that
 there was such a pro
 vision in the bill should
 certainly have objeöted to report
 the bill to that House
 This year the I sciences
 requiring them to do a
 duty which they to it
 before it was reported from
 the committee Committee on Military
 Afiåirs in the Senate have
 i X vould not volunteer
 to do which they would
 pay I supposed it was
 thc bill which l had
 before seen taken the bill
 up considered it and unanimously
 a militia fine rather than
 do and in contravention and
 which was got up and
 reported in the way I
 agreed to report it It
 has no relation in any
 de of the usual policy
 as I should understand it
 of have stated I should
 certainly have objected to gree
 whatever to he present existinm
 slate of military law I
 will piopose therefore to amend
 the provision as it is
 now Therefore I shall sus
 affairs in thc country It
 did nol originate in that
 by striking out so much
 of the section as imposes
 tain the motion made by
 the Senator from Ark way
 It has as I understand
 the concurrence or an oath
 upon any others than the
 offcers ansas to recommit the
 bill unless it is agreed
 support of the friends of
 the militia in the Dis
 l Nir JOHNSON of Arkansas
 I wish to say by
 commoti consent that that provision
 in rela trict Colonel Hickey
 who wasa member of that
 in regard to this bill
 that I m vas present
 in the tion to privates
 shall be stricken out board
 has expressed over and over
 ao ain his cornmittee at
 the time it was under
 consideration The PRESIDING OFFICER It
 requires anxiety that it should
 pass and certainly see no
 and that assented to the
 report Thcro is before unanimous
 consent to entertain the motion
 of the reason whatever why
 it should not receive thc
 that committee as the Senate
 must be aware a Senator
 from Virginia to amend this
 bill as pro support of
 every Senator bill the common
 term for which among us
 there ii posed by him
 If there be no objection
 the bill Mr SA ULSBURY
 My reason for asking II
 is the test oath bill
 for this District That is
 a will be amended according
 to that proposition 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 891 Mr LANE
 If the Senate agree to
 that I have no objection
 to the bill The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Is there any objection
 to the amendment proposed by
 the Sen ator from Virginia
 The Chair hears none No
 objection being made the third
 section of the bill will
 be amended according to the
 sucygestion of the Senator from
 Virginia and it is so
 amended Mr HALE I beg
 your pardon sir 1 did
 not understand that agreement to
 go to that ex I
 understood the agreement was that
 the tent Senator might move
 his amendment I did not
 agree that unanimous consent should
 be given to its adoption
 Mr MASON I so understood
 that I should be at
 liberty to make motion Mr
 HALE That is all 1
 understood and all that I
 agree to The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The motion can bc entertained
 only by unanimous consent Mr
 HALE I consent to it
 but that is not consenting
 that the motion be adopted
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The Senator
 Representatives which Senators choose to
 call a test oath If
 Senators wish to amend the
 bilt by striking out the
 words non commissioned off cers
 and privates I do not
 know that I care a
 great deal about it I
 see no reason why it
 should not apply to non
 commissioned offcers and no special
 reason why it should not
 apply to the pri vates
 Certainly if they are called
 out for any special service
 it should be applied to
 them Tho PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair begs leave to state
 that a motion was made
 to reconsider the third reading
 of the bill and the
 third reading having been reconsidered
 and the Senator from Arkansas
 having moved a recom mittal
 of the bill that motion
 now takes prece dence of
 the consideration of the motion
 to amend and the question
 before the Senate is on
 the re committal of the
 bill to the Committee on
 Mili tar y Affairs and
 M ilitia Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas Mr President I have
 made this motion Mr BRAGG
 Withdraw it Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas see no reason suggests
 a distinction which the Chair
 is unable why I should
 withdraw it but if the
 Senator will to comprehend Thc
 amendment can be made by
 take the floor and state
 the reasons why I should
 unanimous consent only Mr WILSON
 Mr President Mr HALE I
 rise to a question of
 order do so I will
 give way to him Mr
 BRAGG It can be amended
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas If
 it is to be The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair will
 amended do not desire a
 recommittal Mr sy ILSON I
 suppose it is desired that
 hear the question of order
 Mr HALE The Senator from
 Virginia unanimous consent to make
 a motion to amend the
 bill and unanimous consent is
 given to the Senator and
 thereupon the Chair decides that
 the motion prevails That is
 the appeal I make Mr
 FITCH The Senator from New
 Hamp shire is clearly mistaken
 That was not thc motion
 of the Scnator from Virginia
 Mr HALE It is what
 he says it was Mr
 FITCH It was that unanimous
 consent should be given to
 have a vote on the
 third section of the bill
 reconsidered in order that hc
 might move to amend it
 Hence the necessity of unan
 imous consent The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question and the only
 question that can be presented
 in this state of the
 bill upon the proposition to
 amend it is whether it
 shall be amended accord ing
 to the suggestion by unanimous
 consent There is no question
 as to entertaining a motion
 to amend The question is
 Shall it be amended according
 to the suggestion Mr MASON
 It stands in this way
 I was not present when
 the bill was taken up
 and it had been read
 three times when I came
 in I pre surned it
 was in a condition to
 be amended and I was
 informed by the Chair made
 the motion every Senator who
 votes upon this bill shall
 fairly understand it I do
 not know that there is
 any pressincr emergency to get
 it through in ono or
 I do not know that
 anything will two days arise
 under it in a few
 days that ve need to
 hurry it I called it
 up for the purpose of
 getting it through as we
 had reported it but if
 the Senator from Arkansas desires
 to examine the bill with
 more care and wishes to
 recommit it to the Com
 mittce on Military Affairs for
 that purpose I do not
 object to it I will
 state Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 then I have confidence that
 this bill is unobjec tionable
 That was the feeling with
 which I sup I had
 no idea there was ported
 it at the time anything
 in it that could bc
 considered in the nature of
 a test oath The misfortune
 of such a measure as
 that with the destructive and
 unhappy effects it would have
 upon the people of the
 Dis trict I thought were
 palpable to every member of
 the committee That was the
 conviction I had I I
 will now withdraw the in
 supporting the bill motion to
 recommit with a view to
 enable the Senate to get
 clear of the only objection
 that I hear raised to
 the bill by striking out
 the provis ion which has
 been alluded to If Ibat
 is not done I shall
 renew the motion to recommit
 the bill to that the
 motion was out of order
 because the bill the Committee
 on Military Affairs for further
 had been read three times
 I tl cn said I
 presumed consideration The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The motion by unanimous consent
 I could make the motion
 to recommit having been withdrawn
 the question and if I
 could not do it in
 that way I could move
 recurs on the amendment offered
 by the Senator to reconsider
 the third reading of the
 bill and from Virginia avoid
 this question I will move
 that thc vote on the
 third readinx of the bill
 be reconsidered Thc PRESIDING OFFICER
 The Senator from Virginia then
 withdraws for the tin le
 beino his motion to amend
 and moves to reconsider the
 vote ordering the bill to
 be read a third time
 The motion to reconsider was
 agreed to The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question recurs on ordering
 the bill to be read
 the third time and an
 amendment is now in order
 Mr MASON I move to
 amend the bill by striking
 out so much of tbc
 third section as im poses
 an oath on the privates
 The amendment IS in line
 two of the third section
 to strike out II Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas I desire
 to in quire of the
 Chair whether if the Senate
 decline to amend the bill
 by striking that provision out
 it will still be in
 my power to nove a
 recommit tal of the bill
 I should be glad to
 know that The PRESIDING OFFICER
 There is no question about
 that Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas
 very well 1 will allow
 the vote to be taken
 on that amcndmcnt beföt e
 I movc to recommit the
 bill E Mr GRIMES I
 trust the motion of the
 Sen the thinghad not been
 påtlin what is the objection
 to requiring théSegeritlemen who organize
 themselves into militia companies to
 take an oath to support
 the Constitution of the United
 States There is a good
 deal of expense incurred by
 the Government of the United
 States in behalf of these
 militia companies We have defaced
 our public grounds marred the
 beauty of the finest square
 in the city that was
 left uS us a sacred
 trust for the ornament of
 the city and at public
 expense built a large unsightly
 arsenal for the militia of
 this District The Government Of
 the United States is at
 considerable expense for them and
 if there is any possible
 service they can ever be
 called upon to do it
 is to maintain the Constitution
 of the United States and
 the laws and I ask
 why this peculiar sensitiveness at
 this time in moving to
 strike out this provision Do
 gentlemen see anything in the
 state of the coun try
 at this time that induces
 them to let this thing
 go out to the country
 that the Senate of the
 Uni ted States called up
 a bill for the organization
 of the militia of the
 District and the only possible
 objection that was made to
 it was that there Was
 a provision in it that
 the militia should take an
 oath to support the Constitution
 of the United States and
 the Senate would not pass
 it until that was stricken
 out Sir if that is
 stricken out I am against
 the bill entirely Mr LANE
 I will say with the
 permission of the Senator from
 Massachusetts who feels an interest
 in the bill that the
 best thing we gan do
 with it with the cert_ainty
 that it will be reported
 back in a few days
 is to re refer it
 to the Com miltee on
 Military Affairs Let them have
 an op portunity of examining
 it carefully and they will
 directly report it back it
 will then without any kind
 of question pass the Senate
 in good time pass the
 House of Representatives and become
 the law of the land
 I trust in order that
 all Sen ators may be
 satisfied that the bill has
 becn thor oughly examined and
 reported by that Commit tee
 with a recommendation that it
 may pass as I know
 it yvill that it may
 be recommitted and I move
 that the bill be recommitted
 to the Com mittee on
 Militar Affairs Mr HEMPHILL When
 called into the service of
 the United States there is
 no doubt that the privates
 as well as the offcers
 must take an oath but
 I think we shall not
 find in the history of
 the laws of any of
 the Slates or of the
 Unitcd States regulating the militia
 that the privates are bound
 or ought to be compelled
 to take an oath when
 they are not in active
 ser vice when they arc
 not in a state of
 war When South Carolina twenty
 eight years ago imposed an
 oath of allegiance upon the
 offcers of the mi litia
 it almost involved the State
 in civil war It was
 called a test oath and
 the parties almost came into
 hostility but there was no
 attempt in that case to
 impose an oath upon the
 privates This is the first
 instance I think that we
 can find in the history
 of the laws of the
 United States or of the
 States or of the District
 of Columbia where any attempt
 of this kind has been
 made The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question is on the motion
 to recommit the bill to
 the Com mittec on Military
 Affairs and Militia The motion
 was agreed to PRINTING OF
 DOCUMENTS Mr FITCH I move
 to take up ibe bill
 re ported by me from
 the Committee on Printing this
 morning in regard to the
 printing of extra num bers
 of documents It is very
 brief and relates ator from
 Virginia will prevail and that
 this pro to the public
 business The object of it
 is to save some money
 to the public Treasury It
 will lead to no discussion
 whatever and hope it will
 now non commissioned omoers and
 pri vision will be stricken
 out In the first place
 I the words believe it
 is not usual to require
 an oath of per vates
 Mr WILSON I wish to
 say one word in re
 sons who are engaged in
 the volunteer service of be
 taken up the country and
 in the second place even
 if it The motion was
 agreed to and the bill
 S No gard to the
 bill As we all understand
 it was I introduced the
 bill was required everybody who
 is familiar with 552 relative
 to printing extra numbers of
 mes framed by a commission
 here without making any changes
 in it The l human
 nature knows that notwithstanding all
 saoes reports and documents was
 read twice by its title
 and considered as in the
 Committee of the bill vas
 placed in my hands by
 Colonel Hickey the promises or
 oaths that you can create
 you It directs that from
 and after the close with
 an earnest request thatwc should
 get the bill may pile
 them on mountain high if
 a man is Whole of
 the present session of Congress
 no extra num those in
 disposed to be a coward
 or a traitor he will
 vio through that the omcers
 in the District II bers
 of any message report or
 document what had been late
 his oath and act according
 to his nature terested in
 the military of the Distnct
 very anxious for many months
 to have it done i
 i Mr HALE Iam opposed
 to striking this oath ever
 shall be ordered to be
 printed by eithel I introduced
 the bill as it came
 from him without I out
 and I think it would
 have a bad aspect to
 the House of Congress except
 by joint resolution examining it
 ordered the bill to be
 printed and country to go
 outatthis time that on the
 question reported from the Joint
 Committee on Printing when it
 was printed read the bill
 through with of the passage
 of a bill organizing the
 militia of this and that
 motions of either House Of
 Conuress to I supposcd that
 this section of the Dist
 nct a requisition calling upon
 them to pledge print extra
 numbers shall be referred tc
 that some care committee themselves
 to support the Constitution and
 laws bill was understood by
 all the members of the
 1 should Mr FITCH The
 Itis certainly very different from
 the of thc United States
 vvas stricken out committee Other
 proposition which came from the
 House of il think very
 much with the Senator from
 Iowa if object is simply
 to prevent the printing ot
 use 892 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 13 less extranumberofany document
 There is now no sort
 of coöpcration between the two
 branches of Congress upon thatsubject
 In printing even the Patent
 Office report the House allows
 a cer tain number to
 the Department and the Senate
 allows a certain number und
 the number is use lesely
 multiplied more than the wants
 either of the Department or
 tho public require This bill
 simply contemplates as we now
 have thc same printing establishment
 for both branches of Con
 gress instead of each branch
 electing its Printer as heretofore
 that all the printing shall
 be ordered by the joint
 action of the two Houses
 Mr FESSENDEN The numbers Mr
 FITCH Yes sir Mr FESSENDEN

 idea The was repot téd

 ADAMS AND OTHERS Mr KENNEDY

 the Senate to allowr me
 to report a joint resolution
 from the Committee on Naval
 Affairs and to ask for
 its consideration at this time
 It will cheate no debate
 It is an object of
 charity To make the case
 short I am directed by
 the Committee on Naval Affairs
 to whom wras referred the

 Thompson and Thomas H Greer
 praying that authority may be
 given to the Secretary of

 Mr MASON I wish 10
 ask why we should pay
 these oxpcnses Mr HALE If
 the Senator will give me
 his ear a moment I
 will state These were sailors
 that were in jurcd very
 serionsly so by the dis
 charge of a gun in
 the service of the Government
 and they were put upon
 this poor widow to nurse
 and provide for and she
 did it out of her
 own means Mr KENNEDY 1
 hope 1 may be allowed
 to explain further Upon some
 day ill July 1859 in
 a trial of ordnance u
 gun bursted and two men
 killed and three very dreadfully
 Inangled They were taken up
 and carried to thc nearest
 house that ofa poor widow
 and there they have been
 ever since and this is
 merely a bill to author
 I ize the Secretary of
 the Navy to adjust and
 settle the account to see
 that there is no overcharge
 for board and attendance The
 account of attend anco at
 1 50 a day is
 here in the papers They
 sirnply ask some three or
 four hundred dollars to rein

 Mr WADE I desire to
 renew a motion that I
 made two or three days
 ago to take up the
 House joint resolution No 62
 for the benefit of a
 division ayes nine noes not
 counted George H Giddings As
 I understand there is The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question no
 real to it It is
 to pay a certain is
 on concurrinz in the report
 of the Committee amount for
 carrying the mails That is
 all there Patents on the
 bill now before the Senate
 re f is about it
 The bill merely provides that
 the De ported by the
 Senator from Pennsylvania partment shali
 ascertain and pay what is
 actuaily Mr B GLER I
 will state that this bill
 and due for services that
 are performed and I hope
 Ibe amendments were referred to
 the Committee it will pass
 There seems to be no
 objection to it Patents and
 the Patent Office and thoroughly
 A member of the House
 wants to be absent and
 examined As I stated before
 the committee are he desires
 to have this littie bill
 passed before he I unanimous
 as to the amendments that
 should be leaves and I
 told him I would do
 what I could concurred in
 and those from which the
 Senate about it I hope
 we shall take it up
 and pass it should dissent
 If it is desired by
 any Senator Mr LANE 1
 should like to know if
 there is thoy can be
 examined and explained in detail
 any report accompanying it Mr
 WADE Yes sir a very
 long report It is a
 resolution that has passed the
 House It has the univcrsal
 assent of the committee of
 the Sen ate I believe
 and if the gentlernan will
 read it or hear it
 read he will be satisfied
 It is so worded it
 seems to me it is
 impossible there can be anything
 wrong about it It is
 to enable the De partment
 to pay this rnan wrhat
 is actually due him for
 services rendered Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas Let us take it
 up and pass it Mr
 LANE I should be very
 much obliged to the Senator
 from Ohio if he would
 state some thing like the
 arnount of this clainf I
 do not want to have
 the time of the Senate
 taken up by the reading
 of the report Mr WADE
 There is no amount stated
 in thc resolution I do
 not profess to have investi
 cyated the case I was
 applied to to bring it
 up and it having the
 assent of the committee I
 go more by faith than
 by sight on these small
 sub The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will state that the
 joint resolution is not before
 the Senate for consideration The
 simple question is on taking
 it up for consideration The
 motion was agreed to and
 the Senate as in Committee
 of the Whole proceeded to
 consider the joint resolution H
 R No 62 for the
 bene fit of George H
 Giddings Mr LANE I should
 like to have some in
 formation about it and if
 we cannot have it from
 the bill should like to
 hear the report The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The res olution will
 be read The Secretary read
 it It directs that George
 H Giddings Le paid for
 services on route 8076 in
 accordance with the order of
 Postmaster Gen eral A V
 mown of October 23 1858
 after de ducting what has
 been received tliereon up to
 this tune on proof being
 furnished that the service has
 been performed which amount is
 to be paid on the
 certificate of the Postmaster General
 and be accepted by Giddings
 in full for all claims
 for services and damage against
 the United States Mr MASON
 If 1 understand the reading
 of the joint resolution correctly
 it directed that the amount
 sl ould be ascertained and
 the amount paid I think
 we ought to know what
 the amount is before we
 direct it to be paid
 I submit to the Senator
 from Ohio that the amount
 should be ascertained and we
 ought to know what it
 is before we direct it
 to be paid Mr HEMPHILL
 This bill is to be
 sent to the Secretary for
 the purpose of ascertaining the
 anoount Tho committee has not
 undertaken to stato what the
 amount will be because it
 has left that to the
 Secretary The very object of
 the bill was that he
 should ascertain the amount due
 and the number of trips
 that have been perfen med
 This route was cut down
 but notwithstanding it was cut
 down from a weekly to
 a semi monthly service the
 weekly service x vas continued
 to be performed for some
 time afterwards at the re
 quest of the citizens upon
 the route and at the
 request of the Secretary and
 the comtnanding cren eral of
 that department The mails were
 i ven regularly to the
 contractors at the different post
 offices and were authorized to
 he given by the De
 partrnel t notwithstanding the order
 to cut down tl le
 service This is merely to
 provide for the pay ment
 for services that have been
 actually per formed across the
 wilderness for several hundred miles
 Mr FOSTER 1 know bill
 at all Mr President but
 I remember within a year
 or two past we passed
 a bill somewhat sim ilar
 authorizing the Depart tnent to
 settle with some contractor I
 thinka steamboat company on the
 Lakes and pay such an
 amount as was due for
 services actually rendered It was
 very sim ilar to this
 in its terms and it
 came back from the President
 vetoed with a staternent in
 the veto message that according
 to the ciaim and accord
 ing to the apparent data
 on which that account was
 to be settled it would
 take somewhere from forty to
 sixty thousand dollars to pay
 it No man in the
 Senate at the time supposed
 the amount would be anythiF
 g like that sum if
 they förmed any opinion on
 it at d genera ly
 it was thought a very
 trifling one After that bil
 remember it did not pass
 I think that a sufli
 cient reason why we should
 know something more about this
 resolution before we pass it
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE After
 an examination those who voted
 for the bill to which
 I have reférred voted against
 it i have forgotten noW
 What became of it but
 I am quite sure on
 a statement of the amount
 which according to the terms
 of that bill would have
 been paid it was rejected
 by the Senate almöst unanimouslv
 Mr HALE If the Senator
 from Connecticut will allow me
 he is in part correct
 and in part very incorrect
 in his recollection The fact
 is the bill he refers
 to was a bill for
 the relief of Ar thur
 Edwards and his associates which
 passed Congress and proposed to
 fix the precise sum that
 was to be paid per
 pound each trip for carryinff
 the mail and the Assistant
 Postmaster General I notified the
 President that upon that basis
 it would require a very
 large s eun The President
 vetoed the bill It then
 came back and the bill
 was ao ain introduced in
 the precise form in which
 this bill is authorizing the
 Postmaster General to audit their
 account for services rendered and
 to pay them vhat was
 equitably due It passed without
 dispute and became a law
 Whether it has been audited
 by the Postmaster General or
 not I do not know
 I was on the committee
 and know all about that
 bill and the diffculty was
 that it fixed a precise
 sun I per pound that
 was to be paid in
 the first instance and as
 they calculated it at the
 pe partment they made it
 so large much larger t
 han the claimants said it
 would be that the President
 vetoed it and then it
 ctnne back and we passed
 it in this shape sending
 it to the Postmaster Gen
 eral to audit Now sir
 let me say a single
 word ih relation to this
 liltuter I think these contractors
 Gid dings Co have a
 higher claizn upon this Gov
 ernmcnt than any contractors that
 ever came bo fore them
 They are the real pioneers
 of this overland mail route
 They went on and estab
 lished it long before the
 Butterfield c ontract was entered
 into or before they had
 explored it and they had
 their mails on there and
 were perform ing regular contract
 service from the Atlantic to
 the Paciiic I do not
 remember the names of the
 termini of their road Subsequently
 Congress passed an act author
 izing the Butterfield folks to
 establish un overland route Instead
 of taking the overland route
 which it was the manifest
 intention they should take the
 central route they came down
 on to the very route
 that Giddings Co had before
 explored on which they had
 been the pioneers and occu
 pied a considerable portion of
 the route upon which Giddings
 Co were running their mail
 and which they had occupied
 long before Butter field ever
 thotwht of it so that
 the credit of beinsy the
 pioneer in this overland road
 is due to GidL I
 dings Then the Postmaster General
 after the Butterfield folks bad
 comc down and taken a
 con siderabke portion of their
 route discontinued the middle of
 their route leaving them several
 hun dred miles on the
 Pacific coast and several hun
 dred maes on the Atlantic
 coast and deducted from them
 a pro rata amount leaving
 them at the trouble and
 expense of mai ntaining th
 e western end on the
 Pacific and the eastern end
 on the Atlantic Well sir
 finally there were some other
 deduc tions made and the
 Postmaster General Mr Brown then
 entered into a new contract
 with them which was supposed
 on all hands to exhaust
 the power that was reserved
 to the Postmaster General to
 lixnit and con trol their
 contract and yet notwithstanding that
 afterwards there was a still
 further reduction of the route
 and of the pay 7nade
 When that was done the
 inhabitants upon the route petitioned
 and sent remonstrances many of
 which have been published and
 General Twiggs I think it
 was tbe commanding ofiicer of
 the Army in that region
 notified the Govern ment here
 that it was absolutely necessary
 for the existence of the
 Army that this mail should
 be carne and by the
 universal call of the citizens
 and of the A i
 lny for the carryong of
 this mail acrreeablv to a
 secoj id contract made with
 Post master General _Brown thev
 went on This res olution
 now proposes simply to pay
 thern not contract route not
 for any dam for their
 ages that they have lost
 by the curtaihnent of their
 route but for the services
 that they did ac tually
 u pon t hcir contract
 in obedience to the universal
 call of the citizens of
 the country and the Army
 of the Government and it
 is for that that this
 resolution proposes to pay them
 I be in funds to
 meet indispensitiépaym éngon the Istproxa
 Mr CLINGMAN The statement of
 a sen t imo The
 obstacles unexpectedly thrown in the
 Way of ator Mr FOSTER
 shows that it may be
 a matter passage of the
 bill reported by your committee
 yegtérday of some importance with
 reference to the amount authorizing
 the accepthncd of the guarantee
 profférbd by that is to
 be paid under this resolution
 It may severa iof the
 Stat eS compel me reluctantly
 td ask for the be
 alk right but there does
 not seem to be any
 I of the conntry should
 it continue I fear there
 musg be a information before
 thc Senate to justify our
 voting loss of 8800 000
 Under all the circum stancés
 however it througl in this
 form i had rather let
 it oo b instead of
 calling for as I suggegtcd
 in letter over until to
 morrow If the Senate adjourns
 to you of the 11th
 instant I have thooghtitadviSablö toask
 now it will cmne up
 to morrow as the unfinished
 for reserving the right of
 declining to accept business If
 I am satisfied at that
 time It is right I
 shall vote for it I
 wish to give gentlemen time
 political condition of the country
 within the nexetCirdfiYS to look
 into it The Senator from
 Ohio holds the reportin his
 hand It isa long report
 and Sen ators are irnpatient
 We are not now in
 a con to hear that
 report understandinglv and thét efore
 to vote perhaps advisedly on
 it move that the Senate
 adjourn Mr FITCH 1 wish
 to appeal to the Senator
 from North Carolina His motion
 if now put and carried
 placcs myself as a short
 time since the temporary occupant
 of the chair in a
 very unpleasant predicament I stated
 to the Senator from Pennsylvania
 Mr CAMERON then that if
 the tarifF bill was informally
 laid aside it would be
 the unfinished business to morrow
 Here is a proposition to
 leave another matter as unfinished
 business and I shall be
 placed in the attitude ot
 having deceived that Senator Mr
 HALE Let this resolution be
 the un finished business of
 the rnorning hour Mr FITCH
 With that modification 1 perfectly
 willing to agree to it
 if it is understood that
 the tariff bill is the
 unfinishcd business at the expiration
 of the Inorning hour The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair will
 state that they wilf be
 under the control of the
 Senate to rnorrow morning whether
 they will proceed with the
 consideration of this bill or
 with other business Mr BIGLER
 If the Senator from North
 Carolina will allow me I
 think before we adjourn we
 might unanimously adopt the resolution
 ex tending the courtesy of
 the Senate floor to the
 peace commissioners now in Washington
 It can be done by
 common consent The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Does the Sen ator from
 North Carolina withdraw the motion
 to adjourn MG CLINGMAN r
 will withdraw it if that
 can be done by general
 consent without debate Mr MASON
 It is too late to
 do that now NV e
 have refused that courtesy heretofore
 and I think it is
 t oo late now to
 do it Mr B GLER
 Let us do it by
 common con move to proceed
 to the consideration of that
 resolution Mr FITCH 1 shall
 not interpose any ob jection
 but I was about to
 prooose to the Senator from
 Pennsylvania to provide that this
 courtesy might be reciprocal I
 understand they sit with closed
 doors The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 question is on the motion
 to take up the resolution
 indi cated by t he
 Sena_tor from Perinsylvania Mr CLINGMAN
 Hit meets with objection I
 will insist upon my motion
 to adjourn Mr MASON I
 move that the Senate adjourn
 The motion was agreed to
 there being on a division

 DEPARTMENT February 13 1861 SIR
 It is indispensabie that I
 should give to day notice
 ora loan of in order
 that Lhe Government tnay at
 the end of which proposals
 för the loan will be
 recciVed Allow me to remind
 you that the loan bill
 undér I ask for proposals
 was not presented for the
 approval of the President until
 the 8th instant and that
 on t he 9ih Sat
 i I urday there was
 not a quorum of your
 committee to actr L on
 the bill reported yesterday accepting
 the guaranteeofthe States I advert
 to these circumstances to exonerate
 rhy i self in the
 judgnent of those who have
 an interest in the discharge
 o the liabilities pressing upon
 the Treasury from any Want
 of diligence on my part
 Your coinmit tee l believe
 all understand that more than
 5 000 000 ol l
 reasury notes havo been redeemedou_t
 of the currenc revenues that
 about two million dollars niore
 fäll due before the 4th
 of March less the alnount
 paid in for public dues
 making nearly the 8 000
 000 now requiredto Ineet the
 public wants before that day
 that more than one third
 ot the revenue derived from
 the customs is paid in
 I I reasury notes due
 at a future day and
 that the present embarrassed state
 of the Treasury arises from
 the operation of a paper
 system which compels the Govermnent
 to ah ticipate the payment
 of its debts out of
 its current rev cnues As
 I have decided to issue
 the notice for a loan
 to day I am constrained
 to request that the bill
 reported yesterddv tnay not he

 expect ation of a call
 thr a loan at a
 future day on guarantied stock
 could not fail to hava
 a very disadvantageous effect on

 The result was announced as
 above recorded Mr CURTIS I
 now move that the special

 I suppose that requires unanimous
 consent Mr CURTIS No sir
 it does not The SPEAKER
 The motion to postpone is
 in order Mr CRAIGE of
 North Carolina 1 rise to
 point of order Mr SICKLES
 I call the previous question
 on the motion to postpone
 The SPEAKER It is not
 necessary No de bate is
 in order M CRAIGE of
 North Carolina The pre vious
 question was not called till
 after I obtained the floor
 and was recognized by the
 Chair Then the gentleman from
 New York Mr SICKLES proposed
 to call the previous question
 I have as zood a
 right to the floor as
 the gentleman from New York
 and I will keep possession
 of it The SPEAKER The
 gentleman from North Carolina was
 recognized and has the floor
 and is entitled to be
 heard as far forth as
 any member can be heard
 on this subject No debate
 on this question is in
 order CRAIGE of North Carolina
 There was a motion made
 to postpone the special order
 on the Pacific railroad bill
 I then rose to a
 point of order and have
 a right to state it
 The SPEAKER The Chair will
 hear it with creat pleasure
 Mr CRAIGE Carolina A few
 days acro on the motion
 of the gentleman frorn Ohio
 Mr CORWIN to morrow was
 set apart for the consideration
 of the report of the
 special commit tee of thirty
 three Now I hold that
 it is not competent for
 the House on the mere
 motion of the gentleman from
 Iowa to supersede that order
 The SPEAKER The Chair supposes
 that that question will be
 decided when it arises to
 morrow Mr CRAIGE 0fNorth Carolina
 That the very point But
 the gen tleman from Iowa
 desires to have it decided
 now He moves to postpone
 the special order of to
 morrow arid to substitute for
 it the special order on
 the Pacific railroad bill The
 SPEAKER The Chair supposes that
 nothing can be decided ut
 present on that subject I
 The only question to be
 settled now is us to
 the postponement of this special
 order till to morrow If
 the point of order be
 raised to morrow it can
 bc decided then VVItoIe nun

 PRESIDENT appointed Mr BULL the

 to join the committee that

 the House of Representatives to
 infOrrn the President and Vice
 Presiden t elect of their
 election CONSOLIDATED LAND OFFICES Mr
 JOHNSON of Arkansas The Commit
 tee on Public Lands to
 whom was referred the bill
 H R No 841 making
 further provision in relation to
 consolidated land offces have instruct
 ed me to report it
 back without amendment and at
 the same time to propose
 to put it on its
 passage It is a bill
 of public importance relating now
 to our public land systen
 l and there is no
 occa Sion for debate in
 regard to it It is
 recommended Mr CURTIS I again
 appeal to gentlemen to by
 the General Land Office and
 the scope of it allow
 this matter to go over
 as a special order Mr
 BURNETT Nothing is in order
 but the call of the
 roll Mr SHERMAN 1 think
 that gentlemen on both sides
 of the House are laboring
 under a mis apprehension It
 seems to me that if
 we now adjourn the gentleman
 s motion to postpone will
 come up in the morning
 as unfinished business Mr CURTIS
 I would like to know
 hovvy that is The SPEAKER
 It is the opinion of
 the Chair that Mr BURNETT
 1 object to everything except
 the calling of the roll
 Mr FARNSWORTH The Chair has
 a right to answer the
 question Mr RUFFIN 1 object
 Mr HARRIS of Maryland I
 rise to a ques tion
 of order I can state
 in a word or two
 It is now the law
 that when local land offices
 in a State no longer
 pay theirown expenses they shall
 be consolidated That is the
 law already but no proper
 provision has been made by
 law for taking care of
 the rec ords and for
 the payment of the necessary
 cx I ask that the
 penses to carry out that
 system bill bc put on
 its passage Mr CRITTENDEN 1
 think petitions must be first
 rcccivcd The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 in the chair Petititions have
 preference under the rule but
 the Senator from Arkansas may
 in sist on his motion
 Mr GRIMES 1 ask the
 Senator from Ark ansas if
 this is the bill that
 makes an appropria tion for
 the payment of clerks JOHNSON
 of Arkansas It is not
 the bill which makes that
 appropriation there is a special
 bill before us for that
 purpose This pro Mr PHELPS
 How a order vides simply
 for the unprovided expenses of
 con be entertained when the
 House is voting solidated land
 offices The law is that
 t hpy shall Mr HARRIS
 of Maryland 1 have the
 floor be consolidated but provision
 has not been made If
 the gentleman from Missouri will
 allow me The SPEAKER Nothing
 is in order except as
 to the manner of doing
 it and the payment of
 in regard to the motion
 to adjourn tion with that
 that I desire to state
 my point of I understand
 that the Chair was an
 opinion as to ivhether if
 the House should adjourn now
 this matter would come u
 as un finished business to
 morrosv I ask for t
 le opin ion of the
 Chair Mr WINSLOW Thatis nota
 order Mr HARRIS of Maryland
 It is a of order
 The SPEAKER The Chair cannot
 consider that as a point
 of order but there is
 no impro priety in the
 question being asked and answered
 Mr CRAIGE of North Carolina
 under stood the Chair to
 decide a while ago that
 he could not answer the
 question if objection were made
 The SPEAKER If objection be
 made the vote must be
 proceeded with Mr BURCH when
 his name was called said
 I cannot vote understandingly unless
 the Chair decides the question
 asked Calls to order Mr
 SICKLES addressed the Chair Mr
 CRAIGE of North Carolina and
 others called the gentleman from
 New York to order Mr
 SICKLES 1 have aright to
 be recognized by the Speaker
 Mr PHELPS 1 call the
 gentleman to order The calling
 of the roll has been
 commenced and nothing else is
 in order Mr BURCH 1
 desire to the Chairaques tion
 the answer to which will
 influence Iny vote Calls to
 order I the expenses Mr
 HARRIS of Marylahd It is
 in connec Mr CRITTENDEN 1
 not wish to 0b struct
 anything that my friend from
 Arkansas I desires so urgently
 as he does this but
 it occurs to me that
 in the morning hour petitions
 ought to be preferred to
 bills being put upon their
 pas sage or being debated
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Petitions first
 named in the order of
 business but it is in
 the powor of the Senate
 to change that order by
 a vote and it is
 the duty of the Chair
 when such a motion is
 made to submit it to
 the Senate It is notorious
 Mr JOHNSON of Arkansas that
 all the morning hour for
 some considerable time has been
 consumed with petitions These petitions
 every mornino recur they amount
 to about the stune thing
 every time tbey carry not
 one particle of force on
 the face of God s
 earth here in tbc Senate
 which is the place they
 are designed to act on
 These petitions consume all the
 time here and I know
 that the mass of Sena
 tors if not almost every
 one are tired of hearing
 them If they were presented
 as they are in the
 other House under the rule
 there without con suming time
 it would be all the
 better but if I recollect
 rightly there is not a
 positive provision This bill has
 been put before the _
 Senape this way I trust
 the Senator will allow it
 to pass as it is
 a bill of actual importance
 and econom ical bill to
 the Government of the United
 States in relation to the
 public land system I wouldhöt
 urge it but for the
 fact that I am instructed
 to do so by the
 committee and I am satisfied
 of its im portance The
 motion was agreed to and
 t he bill H R
 No 841 making further provision
 in relation to consolidated land
 omces was considered as in
 Committee of the Whole It
 provides hat here after the
 register the consolidated land dis
 trict at Boonville In the
 State of Missouri and of
 all other consolidated land districts
 in conse quence of additional
 duties imposed upon him and
 in addition to the fees
 now allowed by law shall
 be entitled to charge and
 receive for making transcripts forindividuals
 or furnishing any other record
 information respecting public lands or
 land titles in his consolidated
 land district such fees as
 are properly authorized by the
 tariff existing in the local
 courts in that district but
 the whole amount of the
 register s compensation including all
 fees and commissions to which
 he is entitled under existing
 laws is not to exceed
 3 000 per annum or
 pro rata per quarter and
 the excess if any over
 that amount is to be
 paid into the Treas urv
 of the United States and
 the receiver is to receive
 his equal share of the
 fees and it is to
 be his duty to aid
 the register in the preparation
 of the transcripts or giving
 the record information II also
 proposes to authorize the Secretary
 of the Interior to make
 a reasonable allowance for office
 rent for anv consolidated offce
 and when satis fied of
 the necessity therefor to approve
 the em ployment by the
 register of one or more
 clerks at a reasonable per
 diem compensation for such time
 as they arc al solutely
 required to keep up the
 current public business to be
 paid out of the surplus
 fees authorized to be charged
 if any and if no
 surplus exists out of the
 appropriation for incidental expenses of
 district land offices but no
 clerk is to be so
 paid unless his employment has
 bccn first sanctioned by the
 Secretary of the In terior
 The bill also extends to
 and provides for all expenses
 heretofore incurred by any register
 or receiver of any consolidated
 land office for additional clerical
 aid or offce room It
 is unne Mr JOHNSON of
 Arkansas cessary to say more
 I I have said Phe
 bill applies to all consolidated
 land omces and is according
 to the reconnnendalion of the
 Interior Department The bill was
 reported to the Senate ordered
 to a third reading read

 on the state of the
 Union Whereas certain citizens of
 the United States are at
 this time in open rebellion
 against the Government and by
 overt acts threatcn its peace
 md harmony and to cornpass
 its final overthrow Eliereföre Resolved
 That the Government of the
 United States is supreme with
 full inherent powers of self
 pmtection and defense Resolved That
 Mlchigan adheres to t he
 Government as ordained by the
 Constitution and for eustaining it
 intact hereby pledges and tenders
 to the General Government ail
 its military power and material
 resources Rcsoh cd That concession
 and compronlise are not to
 be entertained or offered to
 traitors while the rights and
 in ests of Union loving
 citizens should be regarded and
 re spected in every place
 and under all circumstances Resolved
 I hat his Excelleney tilC
 Governor bc requested to fatwa
 rd a eopv of these
 resolutions to out Senators and
 Representatives in Congress and to
 the Governors of our sister
 States JAMES President of the
 Senatc DEXTER MÜSSEY Speaker of
 the House of Representatives Approved
 February 2 1861 AUSTIN BLAIR
 Governor Mr BINGIIAM These idcnt
 passcd the Legislature of Michigan
 with great unanimity In the
 Senate composed of thirty two
 members thirty voted in their
 favor and in the House
 of Representatives of about eighty
 members only six I think
 voted against them In my
 judgment the people of Michigan
 in a proportion fully as
 great entertain the satne sentiments
 and principles 1 I ley
 declare in the most emphatic
 language that the Government of
 Illc United States is supreme
 with full inherent powers of
 self protection and defense A
 Gov ernmcnt destitute of such
 powers a Government of confederated
 States from which any of
 then l can withdraw nt
 pleasure in their judgment and
 in mine is perföctly worthless
 if indeed it de scrves
 to bc called by the
 name of Government They also
 declare that the Constitution is
 the supreme law of the
 land and that all its
 provis ions should be obeyed
 and enforced alike in every
 portion of the Confederacy Ellhey
 have no sym path y
 with rebellion or treason nor
 with that class of nen
 whether connected with the Admin
 the least exacting and best
 Government on the face of
 the globe Its benefits and
 blessings have been showered upon
 all its burdens scarce felt
 by any but if in
 their hardness and blindness they
 shall continue in open violation
 of the laws the Government
 will deserve the contempt of
 its own citizens and of
 the civilized world if it
 sub mits to its own
 destruction for fear of the
 sense less and unmeaning cry
 of coercion The enforce ment
 of the laws of the
 land over every inc h
 of this broad Republic is
 not coercion in any offens
 ive sense but a duty
 imposed by the most solemn
 obligations and which cannot be
 disregarded or neglected When a
 Government either from in tention
 or imbecility refuses to administer
 its own laws alike everywhere
 it has already become a
 party to its own disintegration
 and annihilation The duty of
 preserving the Union is imposed
 upon every man who takes
 an oath to support the
 Constitution and no means should
 be left untried to avoid
 collision and bloodshed consistent with
 that fidelity to principles which
 no man can prop erly
 surrender but any concession which
 would H vet mo re
 closely the fetters of slavery
 or extend that institution over
 new territory will be resisted
 by the people of Michigan
 by all peaceable and lawful
 means I move that the
 resolution be laid upon the
 table and printed The motion
 was agreed to Mr WILKINSON
 1 present the memorial of
 several gentlemen in the state
 of Minnesota in relation to
 the state of the Union
 and I wish simply to
 remark that they are members
 of the Legislature the Senate
 and House of Represent atives
 of that State and embrace
 I believe every Republican member
 of that body They are
 in striking contrast Mr President
 With the petitions which have
 been received from the cities
 of Boston New York and
 Philadelphia and other places so
 numerously signed and presented here
 m favor of the Crittenden
 propositions And I wish simply
 to state that in my
 humble judg ment if Senators
 or if the people would
 ascer tain what the true
 sentirnent of the country is
 they must get off from
 the sidewalks of our cities
 they must go away ft

 of the several States are
 by the score and hundred
 tarred and feathered banished and
 many even murdered by lawless
 mobs without judge or jury
 indict ment or trial and
 their property confiscated without any
 process of law that the
 authorities of the States wherein
 these crimes are perpetrated take
 no measures to prevent or
 punish them but rather encourage
 and approve them that among
 those who have been so
 maltreated are citizens of Minnesota

 the extension and perpetuation of

 of the United States GENTLEMEN
 The undersigned citizens of the
 city of Hastings representing the
 nationalities of the New and
 Old World fraternally united in
 devotion to the Constitution of
 the Federal Union and the
 principles of free governrnent thereby
 secured look with anxiety and
 alarm upon the in crease
 of public dissension evidently arising
 from the per turbed state
 of political affairs now threatening
 the dis ruption and overthrow
 of the most perfect system
 of civil government ever devised
 by the vvisdom of liken
 The se cession of five
 States from the Confederacv our
 kindred in blood and languaae
 and of the same political
 affliationg and the threatened defection
 of others fill us with
 deep concern that any condition
 of our national affairs or
 acts of legislation should have
 led to such calamitous results
 As we deprecate the spirit
 of crimination which engenders recrim
 ination a fanatical policy fraught
 only witli mischiet and destructive
 to peace we pass aside
 fi oxn any allusions to
 the causes of existing trouble
 and pray your honorable bodies
 speedily to pass upon such
 measures as will give quiet
 to a feverish and distracted
 country We would respectt ully
 recommend the plan of adjust
 ment embraced in the Crittenden
 resolutions or that sub mitted
 by Hon H M RICE

 combination of the principles of
 both such as will secure
 equal justice to every section

 No 338 to provide for
 the payment of outstanding Treasury
 notes to authorize a loan
 to regulate and fix the
 duties on imports and for
 other purposes Mr WIGFALL I
 understood yesterday that the unfinished
 business was the joint resolution
 of the House of Representatives
 in reference to I hope
 it will be George H
 Giddings s claim taken up
 now The PRESIDING OFFICER That
 was dur ing the morning
 hour Mr WIGFALL It was
 to be taken up as
 1 understood as unfihished business
 supposed by the then Secretary
 of the Treasury would be
 made as he said in
 relation to his scheme about
 1 bclieve 1 stated the
 time some 51 000 000
 It was said then that
 such a sum vvould be
 ample inasmuch as it was
 supposed by Mr Guthrie that
 the expenditures bf 50 000
 000 I think sir that
 more than one of the
 leadm s and eminent men
 ill the party about to
 come into power estimated duril
 g he last year that
 something like 50 000 000
 ought to suffice for the
 annual expenditures of the GOV
 ernment Now sir we all
 know that in the first
 year of the operation of
 this tariff of 1857 it
 was exposed to a severe
 financial pressure and therefore that
 year could afford no test
 of its revenue capacities but
 in the very next year
 when there was a par
 tial revival of trade it
 yielded about 50 000 000
 comincr within 2 or 3
 per cent of the estimate
 which was made in regard
 to it Did any such
 measure ever produce results more
 nearly accord I ing with
 its estimate than 3 or
 4 per cent SD The
 PRESIDING OFFICER If there had
 II in regard to the
 cstimate of the Secretary of
 the been time witliin the
 morning hour it would haire
 Treasury for what it was
 to yield during the last
 been but the entire hour
 was consumed by the fiscal
 year He estimated that it
 would yield some 55 900
 000 Its actual yield accordine
 to a presentation of petitions
 and reports Mr WIGFALL 1
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 will allow that matter to
 be consid ered now It
 will not lead to debate
 i Mr GRIMES and Mr
 FESSENDEN It will Mr SIMMONS
 I have given way now
 for three or four bills
 and l think we had
 better go on with the

 OFFICER House bill No 338

 of the Whole Mr WILSON
 I move that tbe message
 of Mr SIMMONS I propose
 now that we pro ceed
 Wilh the amendments beginning in
 the sixth the President on
 which I had the floor
 bc post section and passino
 over the loan portion of
 the poned and specially assigned
 for Monday next bill and
 I have a n amendment
 to offer to the fifth
 at one o clock Mr
 CLARK I hope not Thcre
 was another section whcn wo
 get through with the amend
 question postponed to the same
 time on which I mcnts
 reported by the committee Mr
 HUNTER What doesthe Senator from
 have the floor Rhode Island
 propose I did not hear
 him Mr WILSON Then will
 say half past i Mr
 SIMMONS I propose to commence
 with twelve o clock on
 Monday the amendments at the
 sixth section of the bill
 Mr CLARK I have no
 objection to that Mr HUNTER
 The Senator from Rhode Mr
 LAND I suggest to the
 honorable Sen Island Mr SIMMONS
 presented his views at large
 ator to say Tuesday nt
 one o clock Tl bcre
 is no special ordcr for
 that day and I desire
 very much on the bill
 yesterday and it seems to
 Ine that to have the
 floor for a few moments
 when the perhaps as I
 reprcsent the ropposite opinions 1
 ought to present them before
 we comuncnce to act If
 it comes up on Monday
 message comes up I do
 not wish to impede or
 it will clash with the
 order at one o clock
 and I on the amendments
 throw any obsta_cles in the
 way of action on the
 shall have no opportunity of
 getting the floor bill but
 It strikes me t hat
 probably I had better Mr
 WILSON As I have given
 way sorne fifteen or twenty
 times already I suppose I
 can present what I have
 to say now than afterwards
 Mr P resident it is
 very disagreeable to speak do
 so oncc more and I
 propose Tuesday at one as
 I do on this occasion
 with a consciousness of o
 clock my inability to prevent
 the passage of this The
 PRESIDINGOFFICER The motion is have
 no doubt that the adoption
 of this to postpone the
 rnessage of the Presi lcut
 of the I believe it
 measure is n forwone conclusion
 United States communicatil C to
 the Senate sc rics of
 resolutions adopted bv the Legislature
 of has been generally understood
 that the adhesion Virginia having
 in view a peacefal settlement
 Qf of the State of
 Pennsylvania to the Republican statement
 which I have from the
 Register of the Treasury made
 up since the annual report
 was 54 100 000 thus
 coming within less than 4
 per cent of the estimate
 of the Secretary of the
 Treas ury The Secretary of
 the Treasury estimated that the
 tariff would yield during tl
 is year some thing like
 60 000 000 We all
 know that up to the
 period of the presidential election
 the receipts from this tariff
 were lapgely in advance of
 ihe receipts of the corresponding
 period in the last fiscal
 year when it actually yielded
 54 100 000 According to
 the statement given to me
 it will be found that
 not only did the first
 quarter yield sornething more than
 the first quarter of the
 last fiscal year but the
 receipts for the month of
 Oc tober were something likc
 500 000 in advance of
 those of the corresponding month
 of the last fiscal year
 We kliow t hat the
 exports of this yéar up
 to that period were largely
 In advance of those of
 the preceding year There was
 every reason thereföre to expect
 that if there had been
 no political trouble the revenue
 under this tariff of 1857
 would have been much larger
 this year than it was
 during the last and that
 probably it would have reachcd
 sométhing like 58 000 000
 or 60 000 000 Why
 sir we exported last year
 400 000 000 including specie
 which is now a product
 of this country and we
 were exporting up to the
 time of the presidential electi013
 th is year greatly more
 than we were during the
 last year But the Senator
 from Rhode Island in order
 to undervalue the revenue capacity
 of this tariff of 1857
 takes what he calls four
 years been operation but a
 little over three years and
 a half He takes that
 first year of financial panic
 he takes the two years
 that were hardly average years
 for commerce did not revive
 until last year the questions
 w bich now threaten the
 Union and party was upon
 condition of the passage of
 and he takes this year
 without the consideration and I
 suppose an obliga I of
 this severe political crisis and
 revolution in bill make it
 the special order fbr Tuesday

 placed and estimates it according
 to tion that has been
 incurred at such a price

 its revenuccapacity is concerned would
 reduce the annual expenditure to
 something I tell you in
 what it is that their
 expectations have like 58 000
 000 and that not upon

 expenditures of the Gov conjecture
 but the actual experience of
 the last ermnent have not
 been reduced to the extent
 that fiscal year I say
 but for hesc times there
 was they expected The public

 probability that this tariff of
 1857 would fact abandoned as
 a source of revenue It
 has have yielded Add to
 that the been proclaimed by
 the party coming into power

 I believe the Secretary of

 give them away in the
 shape i Interior says the

 as the Secretary of the

 in excess of that of
 the Sec rior has well
 said this has operated constantly

 otherwise would have bought should

 to receive them as a

 the fact that the bounty

 exhausted its operation has hitherto
 kept down Offce Department If
 we had received the receipts
 from the public lands as
 he estimated we should have
 received quite But Mr President
 if it were to be
 understood enough to carry on

 these lands were to be

 we not know from the
 experiencc hasalmostexhausted itself there being
 only about of the past
 that our ad valoretn tariffs
 have gen 8 000 000
 of acres to be taken
 under it we might erally
 increased in revenue faster than
 the ex soon hope to
 have a revenue of or
 penditures and population of the
 country Have 6 000 000
 from that source and this
 added to the we not
 seen that the revenue from
 the existino capacity of this
 tariff of 1857 1 mean
 in a goog tariff was
 increasing rapidly up to the
 period cf time I mean
 if credit were restored if
 there were political disturbance Was
 there not every rea no
 revolution and diSunion abroad because
 in re son thereföre to
 suppose that it would soon
 yield gard to that exceptional
 state of things I can
 pre if it did not
 tl is yca r the
 60 000 000 estimated dict
 nothing I say if the
 times were good there by
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 If we were would be
 full reason to believe if
 we were to to add
 such proceeds from the public
 lands as apply the proceeds
 of the public lands honestly
 to we should have a
 right to expect in case
 we did the payment of
 the public debt that we
 should not pass a homestead
 bili w hcn the bounty
 land derive enough from imports
 together with the bill shall
 be exhausted we should probably
 have proceeds of those public
 lands to carry on this
 or rnore And sir why
 Government and to begin to
 pay the public debt should
 xvve not devote the proceeds
 of the public say so
 because according to the statement
 of lands to the payment
 of tho public debt It
 was the Secretary of the
 Treasury for the last fiscal
 the great resoli ree in
 the war of the Revolu
 tiön and genecaily but to
 set them aside aÅä fund
 to enable anybody who bad
 a note as long money
 was there to exchtnge it
 dollarfordotl a that I in
 addition to the fact that
 they were receivable for public
 dues would frobablj have enabled
 sus keep out not at
 an interestof2 from 10 10
 12 per cent but an
 interest of 8 per cent
 But sir it was acrainst
 the Cieed of the Chicago
 platform and upon that åccotüit
 all dt tempts of this
 sott have been ejeOtédg sand
 we have seen the consequences
 that have been en tailed
 upon us But Mr President
 this was riot the Only
 re spect in which the
 expectations of those who voted
 I fot the tariff of
 1857 were disappointed ihfegard to
 public expenditures We did not
 suppose that the Post Ofiice
 Department was to be saddled
 as a constant and permanent
 source of expenditure for millions
 annually upon the Treas ury
 and yet such has been
 the case and when a
 Demoeratic President recommended an increase
 of the rates I of
 postage to make it self
 sustaining and when a Dcmocratic
 Postmaster General récommended the same
 increase and when we sought
 here to i pass it
 into a law and also
 to cut off at the
 same time the expenditures arising
 outof the franking privilege that
 bill was lost in the
 House of Rep resentati ves
 and we have been met
 by a persist ent opposition
 whenever We have attempted to
 make the Department sustain itself
 What has been the consequence
 What do you suppose MI
 President has been the expenditure
 out of the Treasury for
 the Post Offce Department for
 the past three years I
 venture to assert that if
 i any Senator wras called
 on to st ate it
 he could not come within
 the amount by millions Here

 ury for the support of

 Register We have in the
 Postmaster General at the head
 of the Post Office Departihent
 an ofiäcer who ac cording
 to the state of our
 present lævvs can plunge this
 Government into debt almost at
 his pleasure He can increase
 the expenditure on a route
 he can order up the
 service as they call it
 There is scarcely any practical
 limit to his discretion as
 to themmount in which he
 can involve this Gov ernment
 I Ie is not limited
 by the receipts from postages
 he not limited even by
 the appropri ations in annual
 bills but he increases this
 expenditure pleasure Now sir unless
 we do something to restrain
 this discretion unless we do
 Something to regulate this Department
 instead of adding thus immensely
 to the imposts as it
 isproposed to do in this
 bill we shall never I
 succeed in rescuing the Treasury
 from its financial embarrassments I
 believe that sotnething might be
 done that one great step
 might be achieved if we
 were to put out to
 contract not only the trans
 portation but the delivery of
 the mails I believe we
 could thus arrano e a
 scheme which would not only
 eut off a great and
 unwholesome source of putronage from
 the Executive but which would
 add greatly to the cheapness
 and emciency of the Post
 Office service itself But sir
 without refer ence to that
 which is theoretical it is
 certain that if the Post
 Offce Department were managed as
 it was managed up to
 the year 1851 and made
 a self sustaining Department so
 as to relieve the Treasury
 from these vast embarrassments and
 if the proceeds of the
 public lands were applied to
 the payment of the public
 debt if trade and com
 merce were to revive the
 tariff as it now stands
 would yield us an abundance
 för the just wants of
 the Government But Mr President
 suppose that in the present
 condition of the finances of
 the coun try now since
 the debt has been increased
 it was desirable to get
 more money than the tariff
 of 1857 would give we
 could easily make additions which
 on the im ports of
 the last fiscal year would
 giva us some thing like
 more of revenue than we
 re ceived for t hat
 fiscal year and that too
 without interfering with the business
 of the country with out
 imposing any burden which it
 would be griev ous to
 anybody to bear I had
 a statement made out at
 the Treasury Department showing the
 details of such an amendtnent
 of the present law Without
 reading the tables I will
 state in general terms that
 if we were to raise
 the 4 per cents to
 10 the 8 per cents
 to 10 the 12 pcr
 cents to 15 and carry
 up the spices to 30
 we should l avc got
 in that way an increase
 of revenue fbr the last
 fiscal year of a little
 over 2 000 000 The
 im portations of articles on
 the free list exclusive of
 specie were about 72 000
 5000 and if we bad
 laid got somet hing like
 or that is to say
 the two together would havc
 given an addition of nearly
 and we should have had
 with these two additions a
 revenuc of nearly the last
 fiscal year I say these
 addl tions and changes in
 the tariffof1857 wh ich would
 not bear heavily on any
 one would yield us if
 any Why should we not
 then be contented with bring
 us in much more money
 as I think I am
 proposed to pass and which
 would give us this additional
 amount of money without embarrass
 ing any branch of trade
 without impairing the operation of
 any of the great divisions
 of our in dustry We
 know from statistics that the
 oper ation of the tariff
 of 1857 upon the industry
 of the I country has
 been eminently beneficent 1 have
 turned to the various great
 branches of our indus try
 to see I took the
 iron and that is a
 matter about which we hear
 most complaint I com pared
 the imports and exports of
 iron and of iron manufactures
 under the last tbrce years
 of the tariff of 1846
 and the three years of
 the tariff of 1857 The
 average annual import of iron
 and iron manufactures for the
 last three years under the
 tariff of 1846 was 22
 781 000 and for the
 three years under the tariff
 of 1857 16 060 800
 thus showing that the imports
 had dirninished actually 6 000
 000 or nearly one third
 On the other hand the
 average annual export of iron
 and Iron manufactures for thc
 last three years of the
 tariff of 1846 was equal
 in value to 12 799
 000 goo THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 14 18 58 such
 this would bank II or
 an average of The average
 annual export under the tariff
 of 1857 for three years
 were or an average of
 5 312 000 thus showino
 an increase of one fourth
 in that rc gard We
 see that the average yearly
 import under the last three
 years of the tariff of
 1846 was much greater than
 for the same number of
 years under the tariff of
 1857 thus showing a diminu
 tion of the importations under
 this tariff on the one
 hand and on the other
 that for the same period
 there Was a large increase
 of the exporta lions of
 iron and manufactures of iron
 What does this prove It
 proves that a duty of
 24 per cent is in
 fact more protective now than
 duty of 30 per cent
 was at the time the
 tariff of 1846 was passed
 It is more protective because
 the differ ence between the
 relative cost of iron here
 and in England at this
 time and then is so
 much less now than it
 was then and the very
 fact that the importations of
 iron have fallen off under
 this reduction of duty to
 24 per cent shows that
 probably to reach the revenue
 standard in stead of increasing
 you ought to diminish the
 I duties If these facts
 do not prove this conclu
 Sion positively they go far
 to establish its prob ability
 To show too the effect
 the present tariff has had
 upon the general interests of
 the country we find that
 the yearly averaffe exportations of
 iron and manufactures of iron
 are increasing from 4 000
 000 up to 5 000
 000 a year increasing at
 the rate of nearly 25
 per cent and that in
 the short space of three
 years How is itin regard
 to the general manufactures of
 the country I have compared
 the last three years of
 the tariff of 1846 and
 the three years of the
 tariff of 1857 in regard
 to the exportations of domestic
 manufactures I find that the
 aver acye exportations of domestic
 manufactures for the last three
 years of the tariff of
 1846 in 1855 1856 1857
 were 1 find that for
 the last three years of
 1858 185 9 1860 the
 average was say thus showing
 a rapid increase of the
 exportations of domestic manufactures undci
 this tariff of 1857 t
 Is not that evidence of
 tl le benöficence of its
 operations Have we not evidence
 of it from the I
 assertion of the newspapers Are
 there any petitions here from
 the manufacturers for an in
 crease of the tariff Have
 we not seen lately that
 the Massachusetts mills have resumed
 full work Is there any
 other interest in the country
 aspros perous VVhy sir I
 heard a shrewd man from
 Massachusetts say two years ago
 that wherever they had new
 machinery they vvere doing well
 and that those who were
 running old machinery in Rhode
 Island instead of altering their
 machine ry were seeking to
 alter the tariff and that
 if they would introduce the
 new improvements and keep up
 with the progress of the
 age in manufac tures they
 would not require an increase
 of the tariff and I
 say these statistics prove the
 fact for they show a
 general improvement and increase and
 advance in the manufacturin r
 interest of the country The
 difference between the tariff of
 1857 and that now proposed
 so far as manufactures are
 concerned is this the tariff
 of 1857 made the raw
 nnaterial to a great extent
 free it diminished the expense
 of manufacturincr and at the
 same time it reduced the
 duty on the textile fabric
 thus enablin y thc manufacturer
 to make a profit and
 IRON yet sell his product
 ata lower rate That eave
 him a larger circle of
 consumers and customers That placed
 him at issue and at
 war vith nobody The customer
 was pleased because he got
 the articlc cheaper the manufacturer
 was contented because being enabled
 to produce cheaper he could
 furnish the article at a
 lower price and thus satisfy
 the consumer This tariff now
 proposed while it increases the
 duty upon the ras v
 material of some species of
 raw wool and upon iron
 en deavors to compensate it
 by laying duties almost prohibitory
 upon the manufactured articles so
 that in order to enable
 the manufacturer to make a
 profit the consumer must be
 forced to pay a larger
 price and th us the
 manufacturer under this tariff will
 have a smaller circle of
 consumers be cause there must
 be fewer who will consume
 at high prices than at
 low and hc will find
 himself at war with the
 consumer and every other inter
 est as long as this
 tariff remains on the statute
 book But sir allow me
 to proceed with a review
 of the operations of this
 tariff upon the great inter
 ests of the country 1
 have shown you how it
 acted upon manufacturers of iron
 How is it upon raw
 cotton For the years 1855
 1856 and 1857 the average
 exports of cotton those were
 the last three years of
 the tariff of 1846 were
 116 034 000 and the
 average price 10 2G ceots
 For the years 1858 1859
 and 1860 the nverage yearly
 exportation was 161 542 000
 at an aver age price
 of 11 76 cents thus
 showing a large in crease
 of the quantity exported and
 of the price which it
 brought Does this say nothing
 for the tariff of 1857
 I am looking now to
 the produc tion not only
 of the manufacturer but to
 the in terest of him
 who produces the raw material
 How is as it to
 tobacco W by sir I
 find that in the last
 three years of the tariff
 of 1846 the average exportation
 of tobacco was 15 865
 000 In the years 1858
 1859 and 1860 the average
 ex portation of tobacco was
 17 996 000 thus show
 ing a large increase in
 these items f Mr Pre
 ident if I had time
 but I know I shall
 be forced to weary the
 Senate more than I desire
 to do with every effort
 that I can make to
 con dense and compress I
 should like to go into
 a review of the operations
 of this tariff on the
 for eign trade of the
 country I would like to
 show how it has been
 increasil ff our direct communi
 cation with Europe how it
 is that under its op
 eration we have been decen
 tralizing our European commerce from
 Liverpool and England Before that
 most of our French and
 continental goods with the exception
 of Bremen goods which come
 here directly in steamers used
 to go through England but
 from the time the tariff
 of 1857 was passed and
 we reduced so largely the
 duties on wine brandies cloths
 and the continental prod ucts
 our direct trade has been
 increasinff As a consequence our
 ships have gotten a larger
 share of freights as a
 consequence of it our mer
 chants have had a larger
 share of profits upon these
 exchanges and we ourselves have
 been able to consume upon
 cheaper terms As another con
 much upon a commercial center
 in Great Britain We have
 been building up one of
 our own and New York
 but for these political troubles
 an if you will not
 crush it down with this
 monstrou bill which is now
 proposed may soon become the
 center and emporium of the
 world Fut Mr President have
 no time to enter now

 the benefit of our producer
 who thus is enabled to
 ship his products to market
 at a less expense as
 he ships it directly to
 the ben efit of the
 American ship owner who thus
 gets a larger share of
 freights and to the benefit
 of the American consumer who
 thus gets these goods cheaper
 than otherwise he would have
 done pass away from that
 to the consideration of this
 tariff itself The Senator from
 Rhode Island has gravely asserted
 in his place that this
 tariff x vould yield I
 think 20 000 000 more
 than the other If it
 bc the tariff that I
 think I am prepared to
 shosv it is it is
 almost prohibitory upon many of
 the maerial articles of American
 consumption In the first place
 it is so complicated and
 cumbrous that it wili take
 double the expense to execute
 it that the other tariff
 does It will open the
 door to five times as
 much fraud and in regard
 to this point I base
 myself not upon my simple
 asser tion but on a
 letter which I received from
 the collector of custorns of
 New York last year to
 whom I addressed some interrooatories
 in this regard This is
 a letter from Mr Schell
 The appraisers as will be
 seen express the opinion that
 the execution of the proposed
 law tariff would require in
 their department doubte the prcscnt
 store aecomtnoda tions and threo
 tiroes the force of the
 prescnt cniployés In the custom
 house proper I am persuaded
 an increase of from one
 third to one half would
 be required in the force
 of liquidating Ineasurers weiui ers
 c and the embar rassment
 and delay to importers in
 obtaining a disposable possession of
 their goods would be increased
 a hundred This is a
 letter from Mr Schell I
 sent an interrogatory Mr BIGLER

 of that letter Mr HUNTER

 house base the ad valorem

 the article and they are
 the men who are the
 best judges of it In
 regard to this statement the
 Senator has seen it as
 well as I have left
 here by the commit tcc
 of hardware men it will
 be found to be cor
 roborated to a considerable extent
 by the state ment of
 the appraisers themselves from whom
 I have received estimates in
 regard to it Mr BIGLER
 The Senator from Virginia will
 agree with me in onc
 view on the present point
 He will agree with me
 that a statement which attempts
 to reduce the specific du
 y to ad valoron based
 on the present depressed prices
 would not give the Senate
 a fair idea of what
 would be right as a
 general policy If these statements
 i are based on the
 present depression of prices the41
 they are dclusive I hope
 I shall be allowed a
 single remark on a point
 which the Senator has passed

 trouble him again It is

 is something like But sir
 there have been some amendments
 the comparison which the Senator
 from Rhode proposed to be
 made in the bill by
 the committee Island made yesterday
 between the specifics under the
 tariff of i842 and the
 specifics now proposed and I
 went to the custom heusc
 for the ad caloretns as
 if what was a moderate
 duty then is notahigh But
 let us look at the
 duties themselves I come first
 to iron that great necessity
 of the country as necessary
 almost as food as water
 as air Let us look
 and sce what are the
 duties imposed upon that and
 here I must beg the
 Sen ate to bear with
 me if I am tedious
 because it is impossible to
 explain the operation of this
 bill without entering more largely
 into these statistics than I
 should otherwise like to do
 Here are the answers of
 the New York appraisers to
 the ques tions which I
 addressed to them in regard
 to this Morrill tariff bill
 A The dutiablc value of
 bar iron is from 30
 per ton upwards the great
 buik of it being valued
 at about 37 per ton
 On these prices which represent
 the value of 80 per
 cont of the bat iron
 imported into the United States
 the new duty ivould be
 equivalent to 50 and 40
 per cent ad valorem B
 Dutiable value of rails 29
 per ton New duty equal
 to 41 3 per cent
 J have a statement here
 from an extensive im porting
 house in New York a
 house that imports iron Oothonth
 Brother which makes that cost
 26 62 which would make
 the specific duty if reduced
 to its corresponding ad calorem
 about 45 per cent but
 take it according to the
 ap praiser s statement here
 is 41 per cent upon
 railroad iron C Dutiable value
 of boiler plate about 15
 per ton New duty equal
 to 44 9 per cent
 That is for New England
 sir G Rolled and hammered
 iron not included in A
 aver the invoice price at
 all the principal markets of
 the as they Mjould bc
 upon those amendments Ac country
 where the goods are bought
 and thus it cordinr to
 this account but small changes
 have is a system so
 complicated that it is a
 most im been ntade by
 the amendments in the duties
 possible to execute it with
 certainty and it n mst
 I There is a change
 made in the duty on
 locomotive open the door to
 fra_lld of every description Why
 tires and parts which used
 to pay 24 per cent
 now sir I doubt if
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 will pay from 14 to
 17 per cent anvils which
 himself could collect this duty
 according to the formerly paid
 24 will now pay 36
 per cent turo system which
 he herc recommends Ee would
 inch wood screws which formerly
 paid 24 will now pay
 60 per cent cross cut

 to take this schedule in
 regard to cottons and execute
 it himself TV hat would
 II paid 24 per cent
 the new duty is 48
 per cent became of the
 in porter when hc was
 acting on on steel which
 formerly paid 12 per cent
 the new duty is 22
 7 pcr cent This is
 a statement this cumbersome compound
 operation W hcn hc came
 in with his yard stick
 to measure it and from
 the custom house dated February
 13 1861 And yet sir
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 with his scales to weigh
 it becausc there is a
 said that tbc dealers in
 steel were all contented it
 must not weigh more minimum
 as to weiyht than so
 many ounces to the yard
 when he has with the
 imposition He convinced them thqt
 the framers of the bill
 knew more about their done
 ali this if t he
 importer shonld say Ict Ine
 pay the specific duty aud
 go the Senator would business
 than they knew of it
 themselves and duty now I
 have just shown that the
 imposition of a duty of
 24 per cent will prohibit
 the importa tion of iron
 more largely now than 30
 per cent would under the
 tariff of 1846 The reason
 Of it is that the
 processes of making iron are
 improved so much that the
 relative difference between the cost
 of making iron here and
 producingitabroad has diminished and diminished
 to such an extent that
 24 per cent will exclude
 more importatious of iron now
 than 30 per cent would
 at the time the tariff
 of 1846 was passed I
 think I may say that
 such is at Icast a
 probable conclusion from the statistics
 which I have quoted But
 in regard to this reduction
 of specifics to ad calot
 ems I base myself upon
 the opinion of the experts
 the ap praisers in the
 custom house who are best
 ae quainted with the average
 prices If I were to
 refer reply Oh no I
 must know its Plice you
 must they all went away
 gratified that hc had followed
 to private individuals and to
 firms I could make a
 much more telling statement against
 this bill but give not
 only your own invoice but
 I must have his own
 head and not taken their
 sucrgestion a certificate of the
 consuls to know price in
 Here is 22 per cent
 upon so important a raw
 J choose rather to rely
 upon the public ofiicers the
 principal markets of the world

 have The statement I have
 made is taken from their

 who complain ot the Morrill

 I saw from New York

 to their statement as I

 it would do the city
 more harm if you were

 you were to Now Mr

 a statement made by Mr

 importers of woolen goods which
 I sup I will not

 have seen weary them by
 going through it as all
 have seen I will only
 advert to the fact that
 on an arti it cle

 49 per centum On woolen

 Duflil and pilots they ran

 believe that a tariff which
 lays such duties as these
 upon the coarser woolen goods
 upon f hose goods which
 are Inos t generally consumed
 can raise anything like the
 rcvcnuc ofa tariff of 24
 percent It will be found
 when we come to look
 at it that the consumption
 of thesp imported articles in
 the 24 per cent schedule
 with the exception of iron
 I mean of textile f
 äbrios is increasing under that
 reduction and the revenue is
 increasi1V under it I do
 not believe that upon most
 of them we shall get
 an add itional dollar by
 increasing the reven ne l
 n the coyl Irary I
 have nvdoubts althouffh I do
 if we should not have

 diminishing the duties on I
 will pass over I come
 now sir to cottons the
 article of spool thread an
 article of prime necessity on
 whick r the amended tariff
 proposes a of 30 per
 cent and on which we
 have had some statements that
 go fhr to show that
 t Ike ad ditional duty
 v ill be nearly prohibitory
 and come to sonu_ other
 articles upon which we have
 been so directly iriförmed The
 custom house appraisers say that
 u n ler the proposed
 bill ready composed wh Olly
 or in part of n
 ad e wool SD far
 as they have becn able
 to test it will carry
 a duty of 28 40

 oa l orcnz Unbleached cottons
 they furnish two Mr SIMMONS
 Do you call them manufac
 tures of cotton I thought
 they were made out of
 another kind of stuff Mr
 HUNTER 1 suppose cotton bagging
 is It is put under
 that head cotton Mr SIMMONS
 He must be a very
 smart man if he says
 this gunny cloth is made
 out of cot ton Mr
 HUNTER Be it so The
 article is in dispensable to
 every cotton planter I do
 not care what you call
 it or of what material
 it bc made and if
 he pays from 37 to
 73 per cent it matters
 to him very little what
 you call it Mr S
 M MONS There is no
 such duty Wit M HUNTER
 The duty on herrings ranges
 from 25 to per cent
 Mr SIMMONS On what Mr
 HUNTER On herrings pickled or
 salted The importat ions are
 at one dollar per barrel
 large Barrel No 1 25
 per cent No 2 25
 per cent and No 3
 33å per cent So say
 the cus tom house appraisers
 The monstrous duties which were
 proposed on glass in the
 bill as it came from
 the i louse have been
 a good deal reduced by
 the amendments of the committee
 Still find according to a
 recent custom house statement that
 the duties on glass rangc
 from 28 to 62 per
 cent I have here a
 statement made by the appraisers
 I will not read the
 whole of in regard to
 cWars it for the statement
 is made upon the bill
 as sent from the House
 which is proposed to be
 amended but I will read
 this German cigars range froin
 5 guilders that is 2
 to 12 guilders 11 80
 per thousand dutiable value and
 he pro posed rates on
 the highest value weighing 24
 pounds is equal to 260
 per cent and on the
 lowest value weighing 12 pounds
 equal to 310 per cent
 The committee have reduced that
 nearly one half The specific
 duty I believe is reduced
 one read 130 and for
 half And so for 260
 310 read 155 Thus it
 will be seen Mr President
 that I ve are laying
 ahnost a prohibitory duty upon
 the ci rar which is
 imported in large quantities and
 of the greatest value I
 mean the Ger man cigar
 which IS used by those
 who can least afford to
 pay money for the consumption
 of cigars which is a
 very large item and important
 article in the trade which
 ve get in return from
 the con tincnt for the
 exports svc send there Tlihis
 is one of the articles
 in which our continental trade
 was increasing and onc which
 instead of being dis couraged

 of the bill Let me
 take up now the svoolens

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 903 Mr
 President I gave last year
 an exhibit of this bill
 and made statement in regard
 to it could go through
 with nearly the whole of
 this proposed tariff but I
 feel that I should weary
 the E Senate and myself
 too much if I would
 take item by item and
 enter into these details Suffice
 it td say it will
 be found generally that the
 duties which are imposed by
 this bill correspond with the
 character of those which I
 have just been de scribing
 and that duties of this
 onerous charac ter cannot in
 the present state and condition
 of trade be supposed to
 bring in so much revenue
 as we are now collecting
 from the more moderate rate
 of duty Why sir gentlemen
 ought to rec ollect that
 we cannot impose and collect
 the duties now that we
 couid in 1842 or even
 in 1846 They ought to
 remember that the difference in
 the cost of production in
 manufactures in this country and
 he manufactures abroad is diminished
 so much since then that
 what was a revenue duty
 at that timc is a
 prohibitory duty now They ought
 to know too that owing
 to the rapidity of the
 communications of trade we can
 not expect those large prpfits
 or hope for those large
 differences of price which have
 heretofore existed Everything is tending
 towards a com mon level
 of price and a duty
 which may be small nominally
 will sometimes amount to a
 high y protective duty and
 so a duty which many
 years ago would have been
 thought to be a ruere
 revenue duty may now in
 the present condition of trade
 become prohibitory I believe it
 would not be diMcult to
 take up the different tariffs
 to take up the tariff
 of 1842 and to show
 to what extent if it
 were reénacted we should now
 dimin ish and prohibit the
 trade of the country Now
 sir I ask if it
 is to be considered a
 fiscal measure to impose these
 enormous duties for the benefit
 of the manufacturers and the
 iron masters to be paid
 by the consumer Is it
 not obvious the duties on
 those which have been taken
 and lost or consumed and
 rehouse the residue again I
 venture to say that there
 focanother five years is not
 a man in the whole
 United Kingdom who has any
 character for financial ability or
 commer Cial intelligence who would
 think of propoSinm a repeal
 of that system Why should
 we do it here Has
 it not been eminently beneficial
 since we extended the sys
 tem to three years Why
 sir let us look to
 the I have had a
 statement history of its operation
 made of the goods that
 were imported and reéx ported
 from dhis country from the
 years 1833 to 1846 before
 the system was established and
 for a corresponding period of
 years from 1848 to 1860
 In the first period of
 thirteen years the entire re
 exportation of merchandise was 79
 767 000 and from 1848
 to 1860 the reéxporjation of
 goods im ported was 146
 095 073 nearly double Of
 this latter of goods reéxported
 92 200 000 worth were
 reéxported frorn the warehouses Thus
 our ship owners have derived
 the profit of freights on
 this increased trade which we
 have given to New York
 Thus our merchants have derived
 the profits on these exchanges
 Thus the owners of real
 estate have derived the profits
 upon storaces Thus New York
 has been able to be
 come rapidly and it is
 since the passage of the
 warehouse bilt that her progress
 has been most most rapid
 a great emporium and center
 of com the great storehouse
 for the surplüs Commoditiee of
 the whole world the City
 in which they were stored
 wrould become the center Of
 the commerce of the world
 and the greatest commercial empo
 rium upon the earth Keep
 this law up and Néw
 York on the Atlantic coast
 and San FianCiséo on the
 Pacific are destined if these
 Stateg cm continue together and
 if the times shall hereafter
 be and continue to be
 prosperous el do notrkfiOw that
 they are not destined under
 any circumstances to become the
 greatest cities of the world
 But sir the policy and
 the measures which are so
 ne cessary in order to
 enable them to realize thig
 greatness and to place themselves
 in this advan tageous position
 it is proposed ruthlessly and
 wantonly to destroy at one
 blow I do n ot
 know on what principle it
 is unless that another man
 s gain is your loss
 I do not know whom
 it injures i know that
 the merchants the real estate
 holders and the ship owners
 in our cities are greatly
 ben efited by it But
 we are told that by
 the warehouse system the Government
 of the United States give
 a credit How gives a
 credit If foreigners choose tö
 store their goods in New
 York instead of London and
 we permit them to do
 so is the Government of
 the United States them any
 more Credit than if wc
 forced our importers to send
 to Lon don for them
 instead of getting them at
 the store house at New
 York No sir We may
 thus It is because owing
 to the throw diffcult ies
 and Obstacles in the way
 of their merce Why is
 it warehousing system a great
 amount of the goods getting
 imported goods and we may

 He says nocwithstanding the amend
 system Mr President what justification
 can there be ment reported
 by the committee that he
 has a for it Every
 other abuse that I have
 heard of paper made out
 to show that the duty
 on steel somehow or other
 is justified by the Chicago
 I above 11 cents a
 pound is 221 per cent
 If that platform If we
 want to take the proceeds
 of the public lands to
 pay the public debt the
 Chicago platform with its homestead
 bill stands in the way
 If we want to resist
 an appropriation of between one
 hundred and two hundred million
 dollars to three Pacific railroads
 the Chicago platform requires that
 too Its principles ha ve
 become a sort of higher
 law higher than the Con
 stitution higher than public justice
 higher than public credit Let
 everything else fail and perish
 so that the principles of
 the Chicago platform are carried
 out Sir I have presented
 these views in regard to
 this tariff for the purpose
 of showing how it witl
 operate upon the whole country
 for the purpose of showing
 how it will operate upon
 the non slaveholding States themselves
 I have said noth ing
 about my own State or
 In y own section Within
 the last four or five
 years my State has been
 reviving the tide of emigration
 which was gettin out to
 a great degree has ceased
 the sta tistics will show
 that she has been increasincr
 in population and in wealth
 But pass this bill and
 you send a blight over
 that land the tide of
 emi gration will commence I
 fear to flow outward once
 more and we shall begin
 to decline and ret rograde
 instead of advancing as I
 had fondly hoped we should
 do And what I say
 of my own State I
 may justly say of the
 other southern States But sir
 I do 110t press that
 view of the I know
 that here we are too
 weak to subject resist or
 to defönd ourselves those who
 sy napa thize with our
 wroncrs are too weak to
 help us thosc who are
 stron y enough to help
 us do not sympathize with
 our wronøs or whatever we
 may suflér under it No
 sir this bill will pass
 And let it pass into
 the statute bodg let it
 pass into history that we
 may know how it is
 that the South has been
 dealt with when New Eng
 land and Pennsylvania held the
 power to deal with her
 interests Mr SIMMONS I say
 let it pass and wc
 will let it pass into
 history The Senator has indulged
 I do not in a
 long debate upon these questions
 choose to debate the general
 proposition while the amendments are
 pending and I merely rise
 to call the attention of
 the Senate to the fact
 that fon timo since n
 y present this is about
 tho were true it would
 notbe a very tremendous duty
 but it so happens that
 as the bill stands there
 is no duty upon steel
 above 11 cents a pound
 except an ad talorem duty
 of 20 per cent That
 is one of the amendments
 which has been printed and
 been on his table fora
 fortnight and yet he says
 I only mention it to
 the duty is 22 per
 cent show how reckless people
 are ia making state ments
 about u bill which is
 right before them The Senator
 commenced with reading us a
 lec ture for not havina
 agreed to pledge the proceeds
 of the public lands in
 the early part of this
 ses sion for t he
 redernption of Treasury notes He
 says the Chicago platform was
 in the way then I
 never heard anybody say anything
 about the Chicago platform in
 the Senate in connection did
 not say witli the sale
 of the public Ian Is
 what I might have said
 when the Senator urged the
 plcdgc of these lands to
 keep the notes t that
 the fact is thc public
 lands have becn pledged cvcr
 since 1848 for the redemption
 of the public and they
 have always been used since
 debt acrainst the pledges of
 the Govermne nt and I
 did not want to pledge
 them over twain I do
 not understand this pledging of
 a fan l three or
 four times over for different
 debts and then spending it
 all for the ordinary expenditures
 of the Gov crnment This
 very land fur d was
 pledged to pay the war
 debt of Mexico a pledge
 which has not been redeemed
 and yet the Senator is
 quar reling witli us becausc
 we do not pledcre it
 over I said then that
 I did 1 0t moan
 to prcnn ao mn ise
 according to my hopes and
 pay according to my fears
 I do not want 10
 nvak e a promise when
 we wish to borrow DM
 ney that cannot be kept
 although that has been the
 practice of this Ad ministration
 and the last 1 am
 rather s ow about Inal
 ing pledges but when I
 nmlcc them I vv ant
 to sec them fulfilled rl
 he Senator says that such
 financial mana e ment as
 this Government has been conducted
 on for the last few
 years would ruin any cc
 untry the dollar all over
 the country and all the
 new enterprises were abandoned That
 is the reason why railroad
 iron has not been imported
 People have not had the
 money to buy it When
 the English stopped in August
 1857 taking our rail road
 bonds and State stocks in
 payment for our importations of
 their iron it wras not
 a month be fore money
 here was 3 pcr cent
 a month and it continued
 to increase until it got
 to 10 per cent and
 then the banks all stopped
 Your trade has been such
 under this téu iff that
 they would slop in thfee
 months any time if England
 refused to take your bonds
 Just as soon as they
 stop doing that we have
 to stop It is time
 we had a sys tem
 that we could control ourselves
 Everybody understands the reason why
 these railroads ceased to be
 built and why the consumption
 of iron has It has
 been owing to the inability
 of been less the people
 to purchase iron and if
 the Enélish manufacturers would have
 sold it at 15 a
 ton the people here could
 not have bought it The
 Senator wants low duties in
 order to irn port frotn
 Germany to help our ship
 owners Why sir does the
 Scnmtor know in w hut
 vessels Gcrnnan dry goods come
 here It is true we
 have I had a large
 increase of iln ortation of
 merchan dise frorn Germany but
 do the American ships bring
 it There is hardly a
 case of dry goods that
 does not come in steam
 vessels and foreign ers have
 driven our steamers off the
 ocean The business is in
 their hands freights and all
 He seems to rejoice when
 somebody else gets this trade
 away i rom us I
 Ie would t8ke down duties
 in order 10 furnish English
 and German steamers with freight
 and keep them going while
 our people were starving rl
 hen in regard to the
 great difficulty of collect ing
 these specific duties hc has
 a great many au I
 did not allude to them
 when he read thorities I
 thought they would do very
 them last year well before
 election but I never supposed
 any body would repeat them
 after the election was over
 They are pretty good Democratic
 author ities I know pretty
 good frec trade authorities but
 he said any such a
 bill as this with specific
 duties and compound duties ought
 to be sent to the
 Tycoon of Japan I thought
 that very smart Well sir
 who is responsible for the
 management laughter but I see
 that vvh0 1 England and
 Ice a treaty of cominerce
 with Japan of the finances
 for the last few years
 Mr HUNTER I ask the
 Senator who is Louis Napoleon
 is Tycoon enough to fix
 in the treaty that after
 the first six months all
 the ad responsible for the
 refusal to put up the
 postages I ct lroræn duties
 shall be put into specifics
 That is the Dernocra tic
 party his tycooncry Hc does

 he can help it Hc
 watches England for term commencpd
 that at cach session this
 regu six months and collects
 duties for six months on
 such as to bankrupt any
 country Now should lar eulogy
 has been pronounced on the
 existing the ad valoron system
 and then he requires thorn

 Virginia that it would like
 to know if all the
 apl ropriat ions have not
 been presen t cd to
 the Senate by the Senator
 frotr to be put into
 specific duties to last for
 tbc entire morc than supply
 the wants of the Governtnent
 and pretty generally when he
 was pressing the Virginia Elis

 They have other influences of

 trust there will not be

 prevail in the mind of
 the ynerchandise This harangue against
 all who do no t
 happen to agree with the
 Senator s notions of low
 duties and the purpose they
 have in trying to supply
 the Treasury with means I
 have heard ever since I
 l he Senator has knew
 anything about tariffs told us
 of the effect of these
 high duties as he calls
 thern and he has made
 a statement as to there
 being a duty of 70
 per cent on cotton bag
 ging which he says is
 made of cotton Senator from
 Virginia We have several institu
 o reat dctll longer I
 had intended to conduct this
 debate without lions that are
 very christianizinrr as well as
 com Oing into these large
 dealings upon the amend merce
 The Senator says the duties
 on cotton goods ments I
 hoped first to gct the
 bill amended but the impression
 will go to I he
 country from what are very
 difficult to collect under this
 bill antl he the Senator
 has said that here is
 a bill that is dwelt
 particularly on the counting of
 thc threads If the Senator
 had ever read the English
 tariff he ooing to raise
 to 70 or 80 Der
 cent tbc duties on would
 have seen that the duties
 on linens are the leading
 articles of consumption and I
 do not like to have
 that go to the country
 without some advanced step by
 stop every four threads Where
 II I go sixty threads
 they would make fifteen dif
 explanation and correction ferent stages
 We can pattern after England
 about The Senator has been
 telling vou that under very
 heavy and there is I
 cent a square yard on
 the present tariffthe low duty
 on iron has affected warehousing
 but he is very careful
 not to pattern it That
 is all the duty there
 is on heavy cotton If
 you bags by this bill
 This cotton bagging weighs the
 importation of iron so that
 it is almost a pro
 i I after them when
 they look for revenue about
 two pounds to the square
 yard and hc hibition now
 He has got tables ciphered
 up can fix the tariff
 so as to allow the
 Government to be defrauded it
 will bc satisfactory to the
 Sen I do not care
 what his tables are duty
 is I cent upon two
 pounds of manufactured showing it
 That is all but everybody
 who knows anything about busi
 ator from Virginia if I
 van understand his rea cotton
 in a yard of cotton
 bagiYin soning The Senator made
 appeals to the labor there
 is put upon it So
 of every one of the
 in ness in this country
 knows that the revulsion of
 stances the Senator has quoted
 but shall not go 1857
 utterly annihilated the projects for
 railroads ofthecountry to everybody that
 plowsand plants throuoh them The
 Senator was on this com
 and there has been no
 demand for railroad iron T
 hese are very ingenious things
 but what are the products
 of labor and how is
 labor sold and T hc
 country has been too poor
 the by the committee to
 this bili and yet has
 re i railroad stocks have
 been down to 50 cents
 on II what regulates the
 wages of labor Is it
 not the 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 905 price of its
 products in the markets when
 they are sold IC I
 can raise a bushel of
 wheat With a day s
 work and sell it for
 1 25 that is the
 price of my day s
 work If it goes down
 to 50 cents that is
 the price Now suppose this
 tariff does enhance the price
 of the products of the
 labor of the country for
 whose benefit is it The
 benefit of the men who
 do the labor The great
 manu facturers that are spoken
 of are mere agents to
 sell laborin the market because
 the production The great end
 of all these appeals is
 to get labor against capital
 to make the notion that
 the em ployer and employed
 bave some different and an
 tagonistic interests That is the
 whole purpose That has been
 the game for twenty years
 about election time and now
 it is kept up continually
 Why sir it is the
 interest of every laboring man
 in the land I care
 not what his pursuit is
 to have the market price
 of wages high That is
 the in terest of every
 man who produces anything and
 it is the interest of
 the employer alike to havo
 it high and there will
 be just as much chaffering
 about it if it is
 low as if is high
 If a man is selling
 his labor he will get
 the highest market price he
 can and the man that
 is buyirp it will get
 it at the lowest market
 price No matter if the
 price is 50 cents or
 1 they will chaffer they
 are sharp bargain makers but
 it is the interest of
 both that the market price
 should be high was 2
 a day they would chaffer
 about it and the man
 that worked would want 2
 25 and the man that
 employed him would want to
 get his labor at 1
 75 So it is between
 the buyer and seller of
 everything The Senator spoke a
 great deal of the ware
 housing svstern and hc thinks
 when it comes to that
 the English may be right
 Now I have some kittle
 returns of the warehouse and
 I will just let the
 Senate understand why I want
 to have that system amended
 He gets his returns from
 the Treasury I have not
 found any report of 54
 000 000 or anywhere near
 He said it would have
 been but för some accidents
 There must have been a
 terrible sight of accidents under
 this tariff Mr HUNTER I
 have the statement of the
 Register putting it at 54
 000 000 Mr SIMMONS 1
 have the returns here too
 Mr HUNTER 1 can give
 the Senator the table if
 he desires it Mr SIMMONS
 r have a statement herc
 from the Register of the
 Treasury signed by him friv
 ing these three years I
 do not know whether he
 has two sets of books
 or not Laughter It was
 a little over 53 000
 000 one year But I
 shall not look at it
 for I want to talk
 a little about this warehousing
 On the 1st of July
 1857 when the new duties
 under the present tariff took
 effect there was no schedule
 more than 30 per cent
 and the next below that
 was 24 per cent There
 was then in the warehouses
 of the country merchan dise
 amounting to 56 392 840
 and on that amount of
 goods there were due to
 the United States of duties
 That was the return I
 have taken pains to see
 how many of these goods
 at 12 per cent per
 annum and even 36 per
 cent give this credit and
 let these folks shave our
 notes and pay us with
 our own money that is
 due to us on goods
 That is what he wants
 and he says there is
 no credit in that Oh
 no He can cipher it
 out in any way If
 he wanted to get rid
 of it he would have
 us 3 000 000 a
 year and it would at
 100 per cent duty but
 whcn he wants to hire
 money to lend to others
 wi ut interest and pay
 3 per cent a month
 on it there is no
 credit in that I want
 to bring this warehouse account
 t o a close the
 same as I want some
 other accounts closed I want
 to see how much these
 funds have suffered during this
 Administration the extravagance of which
 he said would ruin the
 country I mean to make
 no charges against this Administration
 I have more reason to
 pity them than to find
 fäult with them Laughter I
 did not intend to say
 anything about the Sen ator
 s continued appeals and charges
 upon us that our platform
 induced us to make this
 revenue bill Why sir this
 bill passed the House of
 Rcpre sentatives before the Chicago
 platform existed I do not
 know how the House of
 Representatives came to know what
 the Chicago platform would be
 They passed this bill before
 thc platform was made I
 thought we had agreed very
 well about amendin it I
 did not know of any
 serious ob jection to any
 single one of these amendments
 in committee As to this
 long tissue of rnatter about
 the woolen goods the committee
 have taken all that detail
 out of this bill and
 I prcsume the Sen ate
 will do sÖ whenever we
 come to that amend ment
 Perhaps that is one reason
 why the Sen ator wanted
 to make his speech now
 It happened to be prepared
 for another kind of bill
 than that before us and
 he wanted to Inakc the
 speech now because it would
 not apply at all after
 the bill is amended as
 the committee propose Che Sen
 ator s speech is on
 the general principles of the
 bill such a one as
 might be made when the
 bill was perfected and it
 is the onc which he
 made last year as the
 Senator from Vermont Mr COLLAMER
 suggests to me I thought
 the Sen ator had the
 same colored paper before him
 that he had last year
 The tables were made up
 for another occasion to go
 to an election upon I
 shall not detain the Senate
 with this kind of debate
 I do not want to
 waste time by it but
 I want to get at
 the amen lments as soon
 as possi blc and if
 I shall have occasion to
 address the Senate again I
 shall undcrtake to satisfy the
 Sen ate and the country
 as to cvery one of
 the Sena tor s books
 and papers and not be
 a great while about it
 either BIGLER Before the Senate
 goes into executive session I
 simply desire to state that
 intend to reply to the
 arguments of the Senator from
 Virginia not only those which
 he has pre sented to
 day but some which hc
 has heretofore presented but Shail
 not do so until we
 have proceeded with the amendments
 and the bill is about
 ready for its final passage
 My purpose is to reply
 to his general argument with
 reference to the policy and
 general bearings of the bill

 resolution would involve the neces
 sity of a session ot
 the House on that day
 I must object I think
 that Congress should as a

 in my colleague s could
 be at a lower rate
 of duty than the brandies
 fore us I believe there
 is an order to go

 fixed at 30 pct cent
 Taking executive session at three
 o clock the amount of
 duties due on these goods
 and cal The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr BRAGG in culating 30
 per cent as t he
 rate of duty on them
 all and the goods would
 fall about 100 000 short
 of the aniount shown by
 the Treasury books 1 think
 this warehouse fund has to
 bear of the burden of
 the corruption fund about election
 times There were not goods
 enough in x varchouse at
 30 per cent to pay
 the warehouse charges acrainst them
 according to the reoorts This
 shows that there could not
 be a dollar s worth
 of anything in warehouse but
 brandies and wines Why should
 we give a crediton these
 16 000 000 of duties
 for three years while the
 liquor of the importer is
 aøeincr The rise in any
 liquor in three years while
 it is put away to
 age would pay 10 per
 cent These 56 000 000
 of goods would have given
 us 56 000 000 of
 duties under the previous tariff
 because the liquors were 100
 per cent before 1857 W
 c did without 56 000
 000 for three years Yet
 the Senator says it is
 no credit If we find
 half the capital and the

 TON I ask the unanimous
 consent of the Elouse for
 leave to make a personal
 expla nation I do so
 for the first time since
 I have been i a
 member of this House life
 which is scarcely silvered by
 a ray of benignity he
 finds as the consequencc of
 his teaching and conduct a
 disrupted Union a terrified people
 and the prospect of un
 ending hate and bloody strife
 If there was mercy for
 the thief upon the cross
 there lna v be mercy
 for him God grant him
 repentance before he fills his
 dishonored grave But what a
 life he has lived He
 talked the language of love
 to the black race only
 to hide his hate for
 the wmte racc who people
 our southern States He paraded
 hutnan itarian phrases and took
 upon his profane lips the
 name of God only to
 cloak his malice and sanctify
 his hate He has had
 in specific wickedness many rivals
 but if we measure men
 s guilt by the objects
 upon which are oent who
 can tell the magnitude ofthat
 portentous crime which cause lessly
 dismenxbers to destroy the American
 Republic As such a Republic
 has parallel so such a
 criminal has no peer But
 Iny colleague praises him and
 commends him to innnortal honor
 Nero had a friend who
 placed immor tctLes upon his
 toll b and the worst
 fiends of the French xcvolution
 had their dcfendcrs after death
 but were this old mau
 now dead and thus powerless
 in his party at home
 I even Inv colleague wou
 d shrink frorn the task
 ofcmbalmin r his bad meniory
 It will after death only
 be regnunbered to be execrated
 late letters to colleague Mr
 COR v 1N and his
 cornpatriot Mr Ewing show that
 age which EO often reclailn
 s t he n ostreprobate
 soul has not withered nor
 cust01r1 so often tires of
 its baleful work has not
 staled tho infinite variety of
 his rnalice and his mad
 I I istory in its
 record of this great anti
 slavery sedi Lion and its
 consequent revolution will only picture
 the whiteness of his hair
 to contrast it with the
 blackness of that purpose which
 for years and years has
 pursued a cru sadc whose
 terrible consultiü ation is upon
 us in the crun b
 ling away of our States
 an l the destruction of
 their unity Mr STANTON Was
 that statement con tained in
 the speech delivered by my
 colleague upon this floor Mr
 COX I will say right
 here that while correcting the
 remarks bct wcen my colleague
 M r HUTCHINS and nysclf
 at his special instance and
 request an additional paragraph was
 made to the i delivered
 renitu ks He came to
 Inc and asked the privilege
 of defending his predecessor Mr
 Gid I dings in a
 paragraph and he requested me
 at the stune tillie to
 unswrer his paragraph I lc
 read his i paragraph defi
 inding Mr Giddings and I
 wrote the paragraph which has
 been read in response Laughter
 Ali the rest of the
 speech IS just I put
 nothing i addition about as
 I deli it to my
 responsc to my other colleugue
 M r STAN TON But
 as I have said I
 did put in a response
 to a paragral li which
 In y friend Mr I
 IUTc111NS requested to print on
 behalf of his predecessor and
 if there be anything wroncr
 in that statement I am
 willing to meet my colleague
 upon it at any I
 ti me IM r STANTON
 I have a single word
 to say It is a
 question of taste in these
 per about this sonal controversics
 bet veen mernbers as to
 how far a aontleman will
 alter remarks which have been
 replied to upon the floor
 For myself I ncvcr touch
 the reporter s notes of
 anything that has been said
 bearing in the remotest degree
 a personal character Mr COX
 My colleague will see no
 alteration of the remarks I
 made in reply to him
 Mr ST ANTON I am
 reported as replying to a
 speech containing that extraordinary para
 graph and with havinff in
 that reply taken no It
 therefore places me in notice
 whatever of it the position
 of having perrnitted such an
 extraor dinary of an old
 colleague upon this floor to
 go forth to tbc public
 without reply It is for
 thal reason that I desire
 to call attention to it
 lierc that it Ilia y
 bo known that not onc
 wortl of w hat the
 Jlcrk has read was uttered
 upon this floor and that
 the speech J replied to
 did not contain one word
 of it Mr Speaker Mr
 Giddings would not choose I
 have differed with him in
 rne for his defender I
 did not sympat hize with
 the tnany respects 1 did
 intensitv of his anti slaverv
 sentiments not always concur in
 the wisdom prudence or sagacity
 of his conduct upon this
 floor there is onc thing
 for which the whole world
 I have disposition Mr Speaker
 to in any personal con
 troversy v ith my colleague
 He has an extraordinary taste
 and inclination to rake up
 our domestic quarrels and to
 parade them upon this floor
 to bring here our dirty
 linen and to wash it
 in the face of the
 House and nation I have
 no such taste and therefore
 I do not choose to
 arraiffn him however strong the
 temptation may be There is
 no State which has not
 Its per sonal party conflicts
 and collisions but there is
 no other gentleman of any
 State who deems it consistent
 with State pride with the
 honor and dignity of his
 State 10 parade such controversies
 before the nation and make
 them subjects of dis If
 my colleague be am cussion
 upon this floor bilious of
 the reputation or the notoriety
 that speech is likely to
 give him then he is
 welcome to it It is
 akin to the notoriety sought
 by that Eros tratus who
 burned the temple of Diana
 at Ephe sus that his
 name might be attached to
 an histor ical event If
 my colleague chooses to make
 him self immortal by attacking
 a historical personao e and
 a historical character he is
 welcome to the notoriety which
 belongs to the act Applause
 and cries of Good Mr
 COX Mr Speaker 1 wish
 to say a in response
 to my colleague It comes
 with a bad grace from
 hirn or from any gentleman
 on t hat side of
 the House from the State
 of Ohio to un dertake
 to arraign me under the
 pretense of a question of
 privilege when from the beginninc
 of my term in Congress
 till this very moment I
 have been pursued by them
 both here and at home
 in a personally vindictive and
 malicious style which has no
 parallel in political ctunpaigns or
 parliamentary debate My colleague has
 taken a part of the
 same personal campaigning against me
 During the last campaign Mr
 Giddings causelessly began an attack
 upon me as very many
 members will recollect and the
 gentleman his successor Mr HUTCHINS
 on Saturday last I as
 the House will bear witness
 commenced tl is controversy He
 referred to me in language
 I le has seen vehich
 w Ill not now characterize
 proper to tone it own
 in the speech which he
 has published v But the
 gentleman Mr STANTON goes out
 of his way and takes
 ad vantage of a question
 of privilege to court favor
 with the abolition wing of
 his party by this gratuitous
 dofense of its leader I
 did attack Mr Giddings in
 the first part of the
 It was called for by
 the attack remarks I made
 of my colleague and the
 questions discussed by him The
 gei tleman knows it He
 did not deer n it
 proper then to reply He
 says that he would have
 replied if this extract I
 lad been spoken I want
 the House to remember that
 the bpinrring of Ohio politics
 into the Elouse was begun
 by thc attack of rny
 colleague M k I I
 üTcHINsj upon me I want
 them also while I was
 sitt inry in my seat
 to remcnnber that the remarks
 published about Mr Giddings were
 in response to the successor
 of Mr Giddings and at
 his request as he will
 now bear me testimony Is
 not that so I ask
 my colleague to respond Mr
 HUTCHINS 1 will state that
 1 desired my colleague to
 permit me t o insert
 a sinole par agraph in
 reply to his attack on
 Mr Giddings which my five
 minutes would not allow me
 to do I told hitn
 he could reply to it
 in the House I did
 not sec his reply I
 did not know what it
 was ff0ing to be MI
 COX I wrote off my
 reply while my colleague was
 present and I read to
 him as much of it
 as I had then finished
 Ad y colleague is truthful
 and will bear testimony to
 that But sir Mr HUTCHINS
 1 commenced reading the it
 gentleman s reply but i
 did not stay to see
 it wilk award him credit
 and that is for fideiity
 finished and did not know
 what it was until i
 Mr WASHBURN E of Illinois

 Fcfn uary 11 1861 DEAR
 SIR I received last evening

 but when a Democrat from
 Ohio or a the reported
 speech of Mr JUNKIN and
 requesting from nic northern Democrat
 stands up here for the
 Union a staternent of the
 facts and circurnstances at teudilltr
 the he is at once
 made the mark for tbc
 missiles of death of my
 brother in law Mr Ja
 nes H Kennedy re scorn
 hate and personality It shows
 that they ferrcd to in
 said speech Blr Kennedy resided
 in Hagcrstown Maryland a young
 love their party better than
 the Union that they will
 stand by their platform rather
 than the Con stitution IVIr
 WEBSTER Personal explanations seem to
 be in ordcr this I
 bavc endeavored for some days
 to get the floor for
 that purpose but have not
 succeeded and I avail myself
 of this opportunity to do
 so It will be remembered
 that some days ago when
 my friend the senior mem
 ber from Pennsylvania Mr STEVENS
 was mak ing a speech
 I interrupted him by making
 refer ence to tt vo
 instances in which citizens of
 my State lost their lives
 in atternptinø to arrest their
 slaves in the State of
 Pennsy vania I said then
 as I say now that
 in alluding to those cases
 I had no desire to
 enter into cnnunatlon or recrimma
 tion I had no desire
 whatever to increase thc gentlevnan
 under tl irty years of
 of liberal edncation easy fortune
 and with all the surroundings
 which lend at He pursued
 his slaves who had escaped
 into Pennsylvania and on the
 2d June 1847 arrested thexn
 in Carlisle Under legal advice
 he appeared with them be
 fore the court clanning their
 restitution under the Consti tiltion
 and he act or Congress
 or 1793 I hc facts
 were not disputed The judge
 declared his undoubted right to
 return then to Maryland but
 decided that by the recent
 act of 1847 coniinonly known
 as the pcrsoual liberty bill
 of I that State the
 court was iOrbi Iden to
 hold jurisdiction the sheriff forbidden
 to render assistance or to
 use the I jail for
 safk keeping II Being thus
 deprived of officiat aid while
 passing from door to carriarc
 at the curbstone hc the
 cau rt int uriated avid
 although a few Ivas attacked
 by an citiz ens person
 ai friends were with tllim
 aided bv soene others t
 ougtit nalktully in defense they
 were over I powered tite
 laves rescued and he left
 prostrate on the street with
 severe bruises in the region
 of the chest and his
 knee cap broken Many other
 citizens were present in this
 letter that the statement L
 made at the time of
 interrupting the gentleman from IPennsylvania
 Mr STEVENS though not giving
 all particulars was substantially correct
 in regard to the cose
 at Carlisle I also referred
 to a case which occurred
 in the county of Lancaster
 The gentlemån also inhis reply
 referred to that case and
 in doing so hc used
 the following language The fact
 is that Mr Gorsuch was
 murdered by his own slaves
 He was warned before he
 undertook to arrest then that
 the nem oes were known
 to be desperatc and that
 they would undoubtedly take their
 master s life and Mr
 Gorsuch swore by his Maker
 that he would arrest thegn
 or die in the attetnpt
 He made the effort and
 was shot down by his
 own slave and not by
 Pennsylvanians Well sir would it
 be believed after such lan
 guage as this that Mr
 Gorsuch was a highly re
 spectable citizen of my State
 an old gentleman a worthy
 member of the Methodist Episcopal
 Church That he followed his
 slaves into the county of
 Lancaster taking with him a
 marshal of the United States
 and the process of the
 Uni ted States which had
 been provided by the fugitive
 slave law of 1850 and
 when he attempted to ar
 rest his slaves under the
 process of law he vas
 resisted by a_n armed mob
 of negroes and mur dered
 and his son who was
 with him barely escaped with
 his life Nevertheless these are
 the facts and nothing but
 the facts I do not
 care to dwell upon these
 things and I regret that
 it has been necessary to
 allude to them I desire
 that the concord and fraternity
 at all which has so
 long existed between the old
 Corn monweallh of Pennsylvania and
 that of Mary land shall
 not bc destroyed I admire
 that old State The boncs
 of many of my ancestors
 sleep within her bosom and
 many relations now live within
 her limits I have very
 great regard for that State
 and I hope it will
 continue to be in the
 future as it has been
 in the past the key
 stone of the Federal arch
 But I do say to
 the gen tleman from Pennsylvania
 who has undertaken to arraWn
 my conduct in regard to
 this matter that if lie
 desn es to maintain those
 friendly rela tions I trust
 he will take sorne other
 course N vl len the
 death of one of our
 most respectable and Christian citizens
 is alluded to a citizen
 unhappy excitement which exists in
 the country I but I
 did it because the senior
 member from Penn in making
 what I sup sylvania M
 r STEVENS posed to be
 a strong anti compromise speech
 re ferred to certain alleged
 wrongs perpetrated by citizens of
 the South apon citizens of
 the North and included mv
 own State I made those
 re marks in that interruption
 simply as a sort of
 I set off so that
 when the people of his
 State should come to sce
 his speech they might find
 that we also had grievances
 to complain of and that
 cluding a professor in the
 coilcge a clergy nan who
 was foully brutally murdered in
 his State while at tempting
 to arrest his slaves by
 due process of said to
 have used language of bitter
 hostility against the owners arid
 who was afterward tried as
 an accessort l law than
 of referring to him as
 a man of violence but
 acquitted as I learned because
 or a doubt whet hcfliis
 and profanity and of making
 the death of another encouracring
 had been heard by or
 influenced those actively enuaged in
 the riot Mr Kennedy remained
 confined to his bed at
 the hotel until the 25th
 and being a rnan of
 vigorous constitution his friends did
 not suppose al and n
 ninte rrupted healt h though
 crippled for life that his
 injuries would prove fatal But
 his appetite sooli failed and
 his general health rapidly decih
 cd without any apparent adequate
 cause For nuu y days
 previous to his dent h
 he frequently awoke Croxn sleep
 with great oppression and of
 breathing thereby they migrht be
 inclined to settlc amicably which
 increased and became gradually tnot

 linc of policy hereafter I
 trust at least that l
 efore he again undertakes to
 question the correctness of my
 statements or to arraign my
 conduct upofi this floor he
 will see that his own
 statements are founded jn fact
 and that his own conduct
 is above reproach Mr STEVENS
 of Pennsylvania 1 desire to
 say a single word The
 gentleman from Mary land says
 that he interposed in my
 speech be cause I was
 making what he supposed to
 be a strong anti compromise
 speech If the gentleman i
 i as stated by Mr
 1Miller that he had recovered
 fronn those had read my
 speech although I do not
 eXpect rnudvert upon In y
 conduct both as regards the
 injuries to his dcatn Vhcn
 his body was brought home
 to Hagerstown and anybody to
 take that trouble he would
 have correctness of the facts
 which I stated and the
 motives which induced me to
 state them Now the ten
 thousand of our citizens who
 attendéd his funeral ii found
 that I made a very
 conservative speech Mr Speaker the
 gentleman in so doing has
 Ylis heard the widow s
 wail and the forth As
 to anti compromise I believe
 1 did not agree to
 go for a compromise did
 say that I had represented
 what i did say as
 well as reflected hostile legislation
 of frennsylvania which had led
 to the upon my party
 The language I upon that
 occasion was this Well sir
 desire only to refer to
 an occurrence whieh took place
 in Carlisle Pennsylvania A man
 froin my State went to
 to reclaün slave who had
 fled fronl hitn and was
 nnu dered in his to
 arrest his own slave Another
 gentleman went from Baltimore county
 in n ty district to
 the gentleman s State to
 reélairn his slave who had
 escaped and he was tnurdcred
 at Christiana while en deavoring
 effect the reclaination The gentleman
 in his speech says that
 I as sorted herc in
 mv place that the citizens
 of the borough Carlisle had
 murdered a citizen of the
 State of Aluryland in cold
 blood when he was in
 Sir I made no reference
 pursuit of his slave I
 said nothing about to the
 citizens of Carlisle a man
 being murdered in cold blood
 Far be it fl onl
 me to reflect upon the
 citizens of that bor lived
 tu noncr them for four
 years as a I havc
 a hiffli regard for student
 in college there them upon
 I have iiiiugled with most
 of cheni sad rcsuit and
 this feeling spread hc lightning
 s wing watched for something
 on the part of the
 free throughout the South until
 many people whb States to
 be compromised and thul I
 could find had aever heard
 his narnc or known his
 worth were ready nothing but
 if there was anything which
 was to in ingle tears
 over his untinwly grave as
 a Inartyr in their wrong
 I was sure we could
 compromise it The conunon cause
 acntleman when he made his
 statement said that Ithe facts
 above stau d in connection
 with the riot were h
 derived next day Croni hångelt
 and several of those citizens
 I alluded to a case
 I think of a requisitlon
 from I who had struggled
 by his side and these
 with the circrnn In the
 course of remark some the
 Governor stances attending his death
 having been the subject ot
 Cre thing was said about
 the Governor of Ohio not
 quont fä nily conversations it
 is scarcely possible for them
 i I delivering up criminals
 upon a requisition I to
 be luistaken or forgotten Mr
 Miller has doubtless heard the
 fact which now re mentioned
 and I believe mv remark
 was put in peat that
 the Itunii v entertained tile
 grateful feelings the Globe by
 the reporters that a similar
 case thosc citizcne of Carlisle
 who so Gobly battled in
 did not inquire into the
 merits of it occurred rue
 luajot it y of her
 people and to thu his
 defense in my own county
 and that in two instances
 afterwards poured forth iheir s
 yinpathies from overflowing But T
 tese feeliuus are not inconsistent
 with the kidnappers were indicted
 by the grand jury of
 deep and abiding conviction that
 the riot was the conse
 Chester county and a requisition
 for them was quence of
 hosttke legislation nor with the
 still Illore certain made upon
 the Governor of Maryland but
 he fhc t that the
 injuries then received were the
 direct und prox ilnat e
 cause of his death Yours
 sincerely I Ion Enwt N
 H SVEDSTER refused to give
 them up I believe it
 was at that point that
 the gentleman from Maryland inter
 J DIXON ROMAN rupted me
 and made this crimination against
 Mr WEBSTER It will be
 from Pennsylvania It is due
 to myself that 1 should
 908 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 14 state that when the
 gentleman referred to the Carlisle
 case I did not hear
 him I heard him speak
 of the Christiana case and
 I made the an svver
 that Mr Gorsuch of whom
 I know noth ing had
 been murdered by his own
 slaves I believe there were
 two of them and that
 they escaped to Canada Some
 eighteen or nineteen negroes were
 tried for aiding in the
 rescue but they were all
 found not to have been
 present If I had heard
 the gentleman speak of the
 Carlisle case I Should have
 responded pretty much as my
 colieague Mr JUNKIN did I
 was once em ployed by
 Mr McCkintock to defend him
 but I could not go
 Mr McClintock was indicted but
 he was acquitted on the
 ground that he was not
 a participator A number of
 colored persons who were indicted
 for the riot were convicted
 And sentenced to imprisonment and
 in all cases where the
 offense was proved there was
 punish ment Now 1 did
 not intend to criminate the
 State of Maryland any further
 than to say that we
 had as much to complain
 of as they had was
 a little astonished therefore that
 the gentleman from Maryland should
 have taken offense avid became
 excited at what 1 said
 I said nothing against Maryland
 except to state the fact
 that her Gov ernor refused
 to deliver up those kidnappers
 on the requisition of the
 Governor of Pennsylvania The gent
 eman may have supposed that
 I was opposed to cornpromis
 e and was therefore pye
 pared to say some hard
 things I am opposed to
 compromise until there is something
 to compro mise but i
 rneant to say it in
 gentle langt tacre 1 know
 that in this respect differ
 from many of my friends
 and colleagues I know that
 Jnany have the good fortune
 to be made of tnore
 pliable stuff indeed one half
 of the world evervwherc melts
 into the softest dough from
 the nape of the neck
 to the os coccvgis L
 Laugh ter Mr JUNK IN
 IVIr Speaker in answering the
 allegations of t he gentleman
 from N laryland I did
 not address rny remarks to
 him alone 1 have heurd
 this charge rnade against the
 people of Pennsylvania tilne and
 again since I have been
 a member ot this House
 I havc heard it aflirzned
 over and ovcr aryain we
 in Peuusylvania murdered two Marylanders
 who were in pursuit of
 their elaves and I see
 that a high official of
 the Slate of Maryland has
 deliberately put it in a
 printed pamphlet that Mr Kennedy
 was mur dercd by mob
 Now as I stated the
 othcr night the verv lawyer
 who conducted the fro n
 to eud ad mit s
 that the whole arnounted to
 nothing nor less than u
 riot arid when Mr I
 ixon Romaine alludes to the
 alleged murder ot MI K_cn
 nedy he carefully su ppresses
 the fact that not a
 single whi te ny u
 l was entyaged in tho
 transaction And yet this charge
 is against the citizens of
 nsyl vatua w her the
 very Ilia n who utters
 the knows that this thing
 M as donc by neoroes
 and by necrrocs alone If
 this thing tilliounted to dor
 why were not these black
 rnen tried fop the offense
 I hc only thing authorities
 could convict them of was
 riot and ft t that
 they were sent to the
 penitentiary and let Iner bserve
 that in irnposing that penalty
 the court intl icted a
 pun ishment which under Lhe
 lal v of Pennsylvaniu they
 had no right 10 do
 Thev had only 110 right
 to send t helü tl
 le county jail instead of
 t vhic h they were
 sent to t be peniten
 liar y for three and
 four vears although wcrc afterwards
 re leased bv the supptnne
 court on a writ of
 habeas I herc was but
 onc single whitc rnan corp
 us with l articipation in
 that riot and he was
 tried by an unpartial jury
 Slate of IVIary and was
 hQard there by her own
 counsel and he was acquittrd
 because there was 110 test
 ilüony iden ti incr hirn
 with the transaction Now I
 aver that the statemct t
 made by Mr iM i
 ier ill his lotter corresnonds
 with my own recollection of
 the facts because the thing
 occurred in rny own district
 too that they were convicted
 upon the adjudica tion of
 the courts of the State
 of Maryland her self which
 had settled in two or
 three decisions that when freedom
 was bequeathed to slave it
 was a specific legacy tæthe
 slave and if the ex
 ecutor acquiesced in it by
 suffering him to go at
 large it was a recognition
 and payment of the legacy
 That was the state of
 facté under which this conviction
 took place The negroes in
 ques tion were freed by
 their mistress at her death
 The executor permitted them to
 leave the State and go
 into Pennsylvania where thpy located
 and lived with their families
 for several years Afterwards by
 order of the orphan s
 courc of Frederick cou y
 these ne roes were ordered
 to be sold for payment
 of testatrix s debts and
 on this authority these alleged
 slaves were without any process
 whatso ever seized by the
 persons tried and carried back
 to slavery and this by
 the law of Pennsylvania was
 kidnapping not because they were
 seized without process hut because
 being free they were carned
 off without process of law
 The right of recapture we
 concede to the slave owner
 but when he exercises that
 right he must be sure
 they are slaves The Inen
 who carried them back were
 tricd for the offense in
 Pennsylvania pre cisely as they
 would have been tried in
 t hc cir cuit court
 of Frederick county The question
 of their freedom was involved
 in the issue and had
 to be tried I do
 not think it fair now
 for M ary land to
 turn round and accuse us
 o failing to do our
 duty because we followed out
 the rule of law settled
 in her own courts If
 we are wrong we were
 misled by their own courts
 and they should correct their
 own decisions and not expect
 us to do it for
 them Mr CURTIS I now
 call for the regular order
 of business Mr VVEIBSTER I
 desire to say a word
 in M r GROW I
 object That would render a
 rejoinder necessary Both sides have
 been heard now IMr I
 IUGHES It is due to
 my colleague to be to
 say a The SPEAKER The
 Chair thinks the gen tleman
 from Maryland has a right
 to be heard Mr GROW
 Then I risc to a
 point of order Let us
 know whether we havc any
 rules Tho SPEAKER The Chair
 will hear the point of
 order V Ir GROW My
 point of order is that
 no go n t ien
 an can take the floor
 on a personal ex a
 question of order On the
 adjournment of the House yesterday
 the time expired for which
 this bill was made the
 special order apd then the
 bill with the amendments went
 to the Speaker s 1
 predicate my point of order
 on the last table paragraph
 in Barclay s Digest page
 162 which declares that if
 a matter made a special
 order be not taken up
 or if taken up be
 left undisposed of on the
 day fixed thereafter it loses
 its spe cialty The SPEAKER
 The gentleman from Indiana is
 perfectly correct in saying that
 it loses its spew cialty
 but that is not the
 ground on which the Chair
 proceeds This is unfinished business
 and the rule declares that
 in the morning the unfin
 ishcd business of the precoding
 day shall be taken up
 not as a specialty but
 as the ordinary busi ness
 before the House Mr SICKLES
 1 ask that the 56th
 rule be read The rule
 was read as follows The
 consideration of the unfinished business
 in which the House may
 be engaged at an adjournment
 shall be re sumed as
 soon as the Journal of
 the next dav is read
 and at the saine tune
 cach day thereafter until disposed
 of and it from any
 cause ot hcr business shall
 intervene it shall be resumed
 as soon as such other
 busincss is disposed of And
 the consideration of ail other
 unfinished business shall be resumed
 whenever the class of business
 to which it be longs
 shall be in order under
 the rules Mr DAVLS of
 Indiana But it is not
 to be taken up after
 the expiration of the morning
 hour as I understand The
 SPEAKER Not after the morning
 hour expires but during the
 morning hour T hc Chair
 overrules the point of order
 It is very clear that
 this is the regular business
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana Has
 not the morn ing hour
 expired The SPEAKER No sir
 it has not At the
 expiration of the morning hour
 the special order will take
 precedence Mr DAVIS of Indiana
 Then when the morning hour
 expires I shall make the
 satne point of order The
 previous question was seconded and
 the main question ordered I
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana called
 for the yeas and nays
 on Mr CRAIG S amendment
 to the amendment The yeas
 and nays were ordered VI
 hc question was taken and
 it wos decided in the
 affirmative yeas 95 nays 62

 without the consent of the

 the Speaker proposes to decide
 that any gentleman has a
 right to make a personal
 expianation unless it affects his
 seat I will appeal from
 that decision rrhc SPICA KER
 The Chair is of opinion
 that tho gentleman from Pennsylvania
 is perfectly correct 1Mr WEBSTER
 very well 1 will not

 and soul for this grand
 A messaoe was received from
 the President of decisions of

 graceful acqui the United States
 by A J GLOSSBRENNER his
 escence in the voicp of
 the majority my coun object
 Let ail our energies be
 directed to the 910 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 14 peaceable
 solution of present difficulties But
 this must be done without
 the sacrifice of those prin
 ciples on which the hopes
 of mankind depend on which
 free government is based l
 hese we could not surrender
 if we would and tvvould
 not if we could I
 wili not despair so long
 as one ray of iight
 glimmers along the political horizon
 But if all effort at
 reconciiiation shall prove una vailing
 then loyal citizens everywhere in
 all sec Lions of the
 country must look the danger
 in the face and meet
 it as becomes men But
 J proceed to inquire what
 cause have the enemies of
 the Union to object to
 the peaceable and ordinary inauguration
 of the President elect He
 was selected by his fellow
 citizens from pure motives and
 as just exponent of their
 views of public policy That
 a change was necessary in
 the administration of the affairs
 of the country all impartial
 men admit after the fatal
 and over whelming disasters of
 the last few months What
 new idea does Mr Lincoln
 propose to adopt in the
 administration of the Government W
 hat new policy to inaugurate
 Must he not take care
 that the laws be faithfully
 executed and the Government sustained
 On the question of opposition
 to the extension of slavery
 in the Ter I ritories
 stands he not where Washington
 Fran k lin Jefferson and
 all their great compeers stood
 On the doctrine of adequate
 protection to Ameri can labor
 and productions we find him
 side by side with Clay
 and Jackson On all those
 ques tions that relate to
 the general improvement of the
 country Mr Lincoln moves in
 harmony with the leading minds
 of the age Faithful and
 patri otic in the past
 we have the right to
 expect the same in the
 future What cause have misguided
 men to oppose the installment
 of the newly elected President
 Why should it be deemed
 necessary that the choice of
 the people should purchase his
 way to the presidential chair
 by grants of rights to
 disappointed and rebellious men TV
 hydo riot the South arn
 l the North accord to
 Iiiln what has been accorded
 to others Have the opponents
 of the Republican party been
 so long in office that
 they have forgotten their obedience
 to the laws Candidates for
 President and Vice Prosidont have
 been elected beköre from the
 ame section of the country
 and have quietly med the
 duties of their respective ofhces
 Presidents have been elected before
 by a plurality und not
 a maiority of all the
 votes cast and no man
 has raised his voice against
 the constitutionality of an elec
 ion i hc issues were
 piairl the vote overwhelm ing
 and the resutt decided But
 it is said the southern
 mind regards the election of
 Mr Lincoln as a distinct
 declaration on the part of
 the dominant party that slavery
 shall be ultirnately extinguished in
 the slave States knowledge the
 supremacy of thc laws Then
 when order shall be restored
 and an outraged nationality vindi6ated
 I would hear their com
 plaints and give them the
 full measure of redress för
 any actual grievance So far
 at least as con tumacious
 persons are concerned the following
 sentiments attributed to Mr Lincoln
 apply in full force I
 will suffer death before will
 consent or advise my friends
 to consent to any concession
 or compromise which looks like
 buying the privilege of taking
 possessipn of the Govermnent to
 which we have a constitutional
 right be cause whatever I
 might think of the merits
 of the various beiOre Congress
 should regard any conces Sion
 in the face of menace
 as the destruction of the
 Gov ernment itself and a
 consent on all hands that
 our system shall be brought
 down to a icvei with
 the existing disorgan izcd state
 of affairs in Mexico But
 this tbing will here after
 be as it is now
 in the hands of the
 people and if they desire
 to call a convention to
 remove any grievances cmnplained of
 or to give new uarantees
 for the penna nenee of
 vested rights it is not
 mine to oppose Any other
 coursc will destroy the respect
 in which the Governmentis held
 at home and abroad If
 the representatives of the people
 submit to menaces and threats
 such submission is moral political
 and national death The nation
 could never recover from it
 It would invite attack from
 abroad and grant license to
 rebellion at home The plain
 path of duty in this
 crisis is the path of
 safety and dignity and patriotism
 Let us in sist that
 the honor of our flag
 shall be maintained a flag
 which is known and honored
 in every land a flag
 under which our new found

 I have heard much of
 late of State rights and
 State sovereigi ty I he
 national Governmcnt is assumed to
 be a mere agent and
 a very de crepit agent
 with far less power than
 the old Con federation From
 the declamation of gentlemen one
 would suppose it to be
 an abstraction a grand Yankee
 improvement upon the ciq cumloculion
 a how not to do
 it improved and per off
 e fected But remembering sir
 the past bistorv of country
 I am encouraged to think
 better other systern and to
 repudiate the idea which the
 argu ated in the Constitution
 as well as of necessity
 all requisite to the enjoyment
 or exercise of the express
 grants Within this limit the
 United States Government is supreme
 and so expressly declared to
 be in the charter itself
 Between the United States and
 the several States there can
 be no conflict of authority
 so long as each revolves
 in its appropi iate sphere
 Each is supreme within ils
 limits Neitheé has authority beyond
 heresy that a State has
 a right to secede or
 with draw from the Union
 at pleasure has no author
 ity or foundation All a
 tbeories as all practice of
 I Government s is affainst
 it Such a heresy s
 Iki ngat therootofall organization cannot
 make impression on the minds
 of reasoning mon It was
 an evil day for our
 beloved country when a weak
 old r nan proclaimed to
 the nations of the earth
 through the instrumentality of an
 important State paper that this
 mighty Government this giant Republic
 the very incarnation of power
 föared and respected by civilized
 and barbarous nations had no
 power to save itself from
 annihi lation No power to
 quell rebellion i Vlvata commentat
 v upon the work of
 our revered fathers That in
 the construction of a Government
 to take the place of
 a Conféderation expressly declared to
 be perpetual they should have
 neglected that which was essential
 to its very life must
 strike reflecting minds as an
 absurdity No right on the
 part of a State to
 secede secession rebellion and no
 power to suppress rebellion for
 this is the logic of
 this remarkable paper That which
 no law punishes is justified
 and the public mind de
 clines from toleration to demoralization
 I acitus saith of another
 age and people such was
 the state of their minds
 t hat the l vorst
 villainy a few dared more
 approved of it and all
 tolerated Alas that the language
 of the ancient historian should
 describe the condition of our
 country i this better age
 Can it be wondered that
 the diplomats of St James
 rubbed their astonished eyes as
 the might of the western
 world dissolvod before them like
 a mirage and Europe saw
 dismayed this serene mountain of
 refl lge quaking with t
 he throes of eruption such
 as convulse volcanic France or
 heaving Italy Sir I trust
 in the providence of God
 we shall hear a more
 reliable opinion re specting the
 powers of this Government on
 the 4th of March next
 That secession is rebellion is
 a fixed fact That rebellion
 in this instance if successful
 will be styled revolution is
 not so plain History has
 an awkward way of calling
 things by their right naznes
 as leaders of civil cornrnotion
 sometimes live long enough to
 discover and this world s
 history has not yct termed
 that revolution which was without
 cause and against a just
 Govern ment This commotion in
 the land has this breadth
 and no more A portion
 of the people of some
 of the States are in
 rebellion against the General Government
 They have gone so far
 in their insanity as to
 levy war against the United
 States They have set up
 organizations within and hostile to
 the United States They have
 seized the public property fired
 upon a steamer chartered by
 the Government and have beseiged
 the galle nt Anderson in
 his sea girt fortress And
 now in view of all
 this what do we propose
 to do The question is
 between the loyal citizens arid
 the disloyal citizens between a
 lawful Gov ernmentand an armed
 rebellion If not speedily adjusted
 one or the other must
 perish It will become a
 question of time They cannot
 exist together within the same
 territory None but I disloyal
 men think of dismembering this

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE ance to
 the Union the Constitution and

 done Ithere can be but
 one possible answer The power
 the authority and the dignity
 of the Government ought to
 be maintained and resistance put
 down at all hazard The
 duty of executing the taws
 and suppressing insurrections is without
 imitation or qualification it is
 No human government can exist
 without the power of ap
 plying förce and the actual
 application of it in extreme
 cases My belief is that
 it it should be avplied
 to South Carolina in the
 event of her secession she
 would be speedily reduced to
 obedience and the Union instead
 of being weakened would acquire
 additional strength It was the
 same illustrious man who said
 in the Senate in 1850
 Now Mr President I stand
 here in my place meaning
 to be unuwe d by
 any threats whether they ccnne
 from in dividuals or from
 States f should deplore as
 Inuch as any rnan living
 or dead that arms should
 be raised against the authority
 of the Union either by
 individuals or by States But
 after ali that has occurred
 if any one State or
 a por tion of the
 people of any one State
 choose to place them selves
 in inilitary array aøainst the
 Government of tlie Union all
 for trying the strength of
 the Government I am for
 ascertaining Whether we have a
 govern nent or not practical
 efficient capable of maintaining its
 atv thority and ot upholding
 the powers and interests which
 beft ng to a government
 Nor sir am I to
 be alarmed or dissuaded froin
 any such course by intirnations
 of the spill ing of
 blood It b ood is
 to be spi t by
 whose fault is it Upon
 the supposition I rnaintaiil it
 will be the lhult t
 those who choose to raise
 the standard of disunion and
 en deavor to prostrate this
 Govcrtnnent and sit when that
 is done so long as
 it pleases God to givc
 me a voice to ex
 press xnv sentimcnts or an
 arrn weak and as it
 nay be by age that
 voice and that ann will
 be on the side of
 my country for the support
 ot the crenerak authority and
 for inaintenance of the powers
 of this Union I care
 not what term may be
 applied to the preservation of
 the Union and the enforcement
 of the laws If to
 do this means f coercion
 then I am for coercion
 I take all the responsibility
 of saying here in my
 place as a representative of
 the people all the responsibility
 that attaches to the sentiment
 that the laws should be
 enforced by sea and by
 land with alk the power
 necessary to enforce them and
 that loyal citizens should be
 sustained and protected everywhere Can
 we do In all these
 seceding States there are men
 true to their allegiance to
 the General Govern ment Revolution
 for the moment has rolled
 over them and an armed
 force has silenced the voice
 of patriotism Presently when despotisrn
 the despotism of a mob
 the worst On God s
 footstool becomes théy will cry
 to us for help Shall
 we leave them to perisli
 They have rendered allegiance to
 the Union and by every
 tie of sacred duty honor
 and humanity we are bound
 to render them protection vqny
 other course would sink the
 Govermnent to perd ition Shall
 we stand idly by when
 our faithful custorn house officers
 postmasters pilots and other offi
 cers are arrested thrown into
 prison or made to suffer
 pains and penalties for the
 lionest discharge of sworn duties
 Shall we refuse to protectadopted
 citizens who renounced allegiance to
 for eicrn potentates and sovereiöns
 have taken an Allegiance oath
 of fealty to our Government
 entitles them to protection Shall
 this Govern ment which but
 lately extended its scepter across
 the seas to shelter here
 and there a humble man
 from the armed might of
 France or the crowned majesty
 of Austria when he invoked
 its aid by the cry
 I am an American citizen
 t on its own soil
 shall its ear be deaf
 to the chorus of its
 children s cries its arm
 shortened and impotent to aid
 Surely the nation that refuses
 is faithless If it refuses
 to protect its loyal citi
 to its trust zens from
 persecution confiscation and death it
 does not deserve the name
 of government If the Executive
 had promptly used his author
 ity to check disobedience in
 the present instance this rebellion
 which has now assumed formida
 ble proportions would have been
 checked or ad justed before
 the present moment This history
 will record That it was
 notdone is now world wide
 regret n lr Speaker in
 myjudgment all the complain ts
 of ail the sections can
 be adjusted writhin the Union
 without the sacrifice of any
 principle of essential with such
 conciliation as would be right
 and proper under existing circumstances
 For the sake of Maryland
 still true though be tween
 the upper and the nether
 millstone for gal lant old
 Kentucky with the stars and
 stripes flying at every cross
 road for Tennessee with the
 roar of her grand majority
 for the Union thundering in
 the ears of secession and
 even for Georgia with almost
 half her convention wrestlingforthe Union
 and Alabama now lifting her
 voice in indignant protestagainsttheerrorofher sons
 These States and others amid
 the besetments of disaffection display
 a love for the Union
 that entitles them to sympathy
 and honor and for their
 sakes we should be willing
 to make such an adjustment
 as can be made without
 the abandonment of princi In
 this spirit I shall proceed
 to the consider pie ation
 of such propositions as have
 been submitted to the House
 I come now to speak
 briefly of the prominent difficulty
 in the way of adjustment
 and that is the territorial
 question The South dernand what
 they are pleased to term
 protection to slave prop erty
 in the Territories of the
 United States as well as
 in all territory hereafter to
 be acquired rl he freemen
 of the North consider it
 of vital import ance to
 prevent the extension of slavery
 over territory now free And
 they cannot believe that the
 extension protection and perpetuation of
 African slavery would be beneficent
 to the country or advance
 the civilization of the people
 Much less will they consent
 to change the Constitution of
 the United States so that
 slavery shall predom inate over
 freedom On this point it
 seems to be the settled
 conviction of the country that
 we had better leave the
 Constitution as it is Prominent
 amono measures for the adjustment
 of our pres ent difficulties
 stands the Crittenden compromise More
 fortunate in its baptisrn than
 its conception this defective measure
 bears a faultless title The
 name of one held in
 affectionate regard and whom the
 people delight to honor introduces
 it auspi ciously to the
 consideration of that people and
 the lessons of the revered
 who are no more a
 Webster of the North and
 a Clay of the South
 have taught the people to
 respect a compromise But Mr
 Speaker paradoxical as it may
 sound the Crittenden compromise is
 not a compromise and it
 does not embody the views
 of Mr CR T TENDEN
 Looking further I find a
 third objec tion in the
 fact that it does not
 represent the senti ments of
 the people and these three
 objections I shall treat in
 a group before proceeding to
 others of a graver character
 I am bold to say
 that the resolutions do not
 express the sentiments of the
 people North South because in
 another and less objectionable form
 and under another name the
 prominent idea which they embody
 wus presented to the peo
 ple for their sanction and
 rejected by an over whelming
 majority It was first offered
 under the name of the
 Breckinridge platform to a convention
 of that party most favorable
 to slavery extension and protection
 at Charleston and re jectcd
 by a majority of that
 convention It was again brought
 before a Democratic convention at
 Baltimore and again rejected Let
 us bear in mind that
 the rejection of this platform
 carried with it the inevitable
 destruction of a powerful party
 long subservient to slavery and
 one which has never looked
 upon defeat with loss of
 place and spoils with any
 degree of complacency in tion
 as it is and Kentucky
 the home Qf the ven
 erable Senator rebuked _ihis monstrous
 claim to establish o despotism
 on the free soi l
 of America This sentiment then
 of Jhe Breckinridge plat form
 repugnant to the American by
 twenty two States trampled in
 the dust of de feat
 at a popular election is
 carefully disentombed from the overwhelming
 majorities beneath which it was
 crushed Its shapeless remains are
 com posed to new and
 decent form in the Crittenden
 resolutions and its faithful friends
 and dev04éd mourners demand for
 it an apotheosisin the Con
 stitution That which the people
 have solemnly pronounced unworthy of
 support even in the ephemeral
 form of a political platform
 it is now gravely proposed
 to incorporate in the Constitu
 tiorj where you and I
 may no longer vote upon
 and reject it but must
 swear fealty to and support
 Where rising generationsy with the
 generous en thusiasm of youth
 for the institutions of their
 beloved land must do it
 reverence wherc your sons and
 mine rnust bring the loyalty
 we have taught them and
 abase it to uphold the
 N rrong And this is
 called a compromise A compro
 mise is where conflicting parties
 relinquish reach the extreme of
 its position to meet the
 other upon middle ground Here
 the extreme views of extreme
 pro slave ry mm are
 advocated stavery in tbc Territories
 to be protected by Congress
 this right of protection to
 be inserted in the Constitu
 tion this amendment of the
 Constitution to be secure from
 future alteration and the whole
 to apply not only to
 our present possessions but all
 which we may hereafter act
 lire It is all here
 Not one jot or tittle
 abated Che old enemy with
 which we have wrestled for
 years is pre sented to
 us in all his unshorn
 proportions under the seductive cognomen
 of compromise Enter tain him
 and we are compromised indeed
 Is there anything more that
 has been or will be
 asked of us If so
 let it by all means
 be incor porated in the
 resolutions 1 have shown that
 the resolutions do not ex
 press the views of the
 people and I have said
 that they do not represent
 the Senator s own If
 Mr CRITTENDEN bad ever entertained
 them we should have foun
 im too just and too
 generous an adversary ever o
 have presente d them to
 us as a compromise It
 is because they are not
 his owY1 views or wishes
 that he offers and advocates
 them feeling a self abnegating
 zeal in sacrificing on the
 altar of peace the convictions
 of his own statesman like
 mind and the desires of
 his own heart His whole
 career every act of his
 public life bears witness that
 the resolutions are repug nant
 to the Senator himself That
 career that life have won
 for him the confidence of
 the people and impart a
 presticre to these resolutions which
 their merits cannot clainl His
 reputation gilds them with a
 luster not thcir own But
 Mr Speaker I summon a
 statesman from Kentucky now silent
 but potential to antagonize the
 resolutions of the Senator from
 Kentucky who dead has more
 power than the living whose
 voice always raised to save
 his countrymen from dishonor uttered
 these celebrated words And now
 sir coming from a slave
 State as I do r
 owe it to Inyself I
 owe it to irutl owe
 it to the subject to
 say that no earthly power
 could induce Ille to vote
 for a specific measure tor
 t he introducti011 of slavery
 where it had not beibre
 existed either south or north
 of that line Coming as
 I do from a slave
 State it is my solemn
 de liberate and well matured
 determination that no ptbwer order
 to form a just estimate
 of the consequences i no
 earthly power shall compel Ine
 to vote for the positive
 introduction of slavery either south
 or north of that line
 of that rejection Bat the

 may wéär away under the
 inevitable influence of cus tom
 association and interest until from

 preserve the ascendency of slavery
 over freedom in the Confederation
 This amendment to the Constitution
 then with a sublime indifference
 to the wishes or interests
 of a people aims at
 the nobler end of the
 pres ervation ofa party Sir
 what is all this but
 ma chinery to force the
 institution of slavery upon free
 men Methinks the effort to
 compel the people of a
 Territory to accept the Lecompton
 constitution should have taught us
 wisdom I do not propose
 to become a party to
 the renewed atiempt While that
 portion of article first of
 Mr CRIT TENDEN S proposition
 which relates to Territories now
 held by Lhe United States
 seems to me to be
 despotic the paragraph which points
 to all which shall be
 hereafter acquired is aggressive While
 willing to legislate for all
 the Iterritory of the United
 States Mr Speaker I naturally
 feel a mod esthesir ation
 in making laws for Cuba
 Mexico South America mountains of
 the moon or any other
 visionary probable or improbable posses
 sions comprehended undera term so
 vague The localities I have
 mentioned are not only not
 under the jurisdiction of the
 United States but are ac
 tüafly held by other Gov
 ments who might with justice
 resent this intrusion of covetous
 filli busterism Such an ideal
 style of legislation would seem
 to be not only unstatesmanlike
 but unprincipled The antecedent legislation
 which id thus proposed will
 hardly snflice to change the
 laws of Central America or
 Cuba should we hereafter by
 any possibility negotiate for the
 pos session of those interesting
 localities and if they become
 ours by less ceremonious process
 I hope our own Constitution
 will not testify to a
 premcditated theft Article six of
 the resolut ions provides that
 no I future amendrnent of
 the Constitution shall affect the
 five preceding articles nor the
 third paragraph of the section
 of t hc fourth article

 fathers framed the Constitu t
 ion they anticipated that tl
 le exio encips of a
 pro gressive people would demand
 modifications of that instrument With
 provident forethought they indicated the
 manner in which such amend
 merits should be madc Entering
 by the door left open
 for them these amendments propose
 to close that door forever
 and entrench then Isel ves
 as in a fortress against
 the besieo ino necessities of
 af tcr times No future
 amendment shali affect them And
 why do they claim to
 be more sacred than the
 Constitution itself Why is one
 clause that Consit ution elevated
 above its peers to share
 tho inviolable sanctity of these
 modern amendments Because they single
 out as the object of
 their peculiar care one of
 the multifarious interests of the
 land Without to examine the
 mer its of that interest
 which has it spired a
 lcvotion that surpasses pati iotism
 that interest to which Senators
 and Cabinets have transferred the
 fealty due to their country
 that interest which is pre
 I be amended provided some
 of the articles shall never
 be amended Sir II claim
 that such an amendmeht would
 be in direct antagonism with
 a fundamental principle on which
 the instrument was framed the
 equal protection fronL Ciol ability
 of I urge that when
 au the interests secttred by
 it these resolutions propose to
 stand unalterably for ever athwart
 the track of an advancing
 people the spirit of the
 Constitution itself interposes to protect
 the centuries of the future
 from these shackles which the
 present labors to forge Slavery
 is to have especial protection
 in the charter of our
 liberties It iS to be
 deified in an instrument in
 wrhich the fathers refused it
 recog nition as such But
 if entrenched in the Consti
 tution as property with protection
 above and be yond all
 other property witl it not
 follow or will it not
 be claimed that it will
 be entitled to pro tection
 everywhere not only in the
 Territories but on the high
 seas under our flag as
 well asin the free States
 of this Union As was
 shown by the distinguished gentleman
 from Maryland Mr Dnvls the
 people will never ratify the
 idea of extending slavery to
 free It is impossible to
 procure for thesc resolu tions
 txvvo thirds of this body
 or even a bare ma
 jority It is impossible to
 obtain a like majority in
 the other branch and three
 fourths of the States would
 never adopt them Let all
 friends of the Union abandon
 them as a useless impossibility
 now and forever Pause gentlemen
 of the Amer ican Congress
 pause before you ask of
 men as free as yourselves
 rso impossible a surrender of
 sacred convictions Mr Speaker I
 shall now briefly for the
 time allotted to me will
 not admit of extended discus
 Sion referto the measures of
 adjustment reported by the committec
 of thirty three These propo
 sitions or at least several
 of them have been re
 sponded to by the country
 and I believe will be
 sustained by a majority of
 this House as most equitable
 and reasonable in themselves Amoncy
 the resolutions reported is one
 in relation to perr sonal
 liberty bills so called It
 is said that some northern
 States have adopted measures for
 the purpose of preventing the
 arrest and surrender of fugitives
 from labor Although this objection
 is a mere pretext for
 disorder in the GGlf States
 inasmuch as they seldom or
 never lose a fugitive by
 reason of obstructive legislation yet
 good faith requires that any
 enactment of the character indicated
 should be promptly repealed not
 be cause anybody denu tnds
 it but because it is
 right in itself The committee
 have reported a resolu tion
 for that purpose and I
 trust it will be adopted
 They have also reported an
 amended fugitive slave law which
 inasmuch as it gives a
 right of trial by jury
 under certain circumstances to the
 alleged tugitive and provides for
 his return to the place
 from which it is claimed
 he escaped as well ns
 other wholesome provisions is an
 improve ment on the present
 law and well worthy of
 con sidefation The disposition of
 the territory of the United
 States south of 360 30
 vas and is the main
 sub ject of difiiculty But
 I will say to you
 gentle men of the border
 States and you gentlemen of
 the Democratic party that you
 have it in your power
 to quiet ail this agitation
 and I beseech you to
 come forward and do it
 Abandon extreme views Five up
 the Crittenden and other irnpossi
 bilit ics und let us
 unite our strength on the
 New l fexico measure reported
 from the committce of thirty
 three in the spirit in
 which it was offered by
 the distinguished gentleman from Massachu
 sects Mr Ann Ms This
 Territory except a small portion
 embraced in Indian treaties and
 which cannot be included in
 any State is all that
 remains to the United States
 south of 360 30 The
 moment we exclude the idea
 of future acqui sition or
 fillibustcrism this New Mexico pos
 constitution may pregctibe at the
 time of their admission United
 States Statutes at Large Thirty
 First Congress 1850 p 447
 Gentlemen of the South you
 were parties to the compromise
 of 1850 Will you execute
 the con tract we then
 rnade in good faith and
 by the pas sage of
 the enabling act reported by
 the gentle man from Ohio
 Mr CORWIN permit the people
 of New Mexico to make
 their constitution in their own
 way YVe gave this conffrcssional
 pledge to the people who
 went into that Territory Shall
 we not redeem the faith
 of the Government Gentlemen of
 the Republican party WI IO
 pro pose to execute the
 laws cannot refuse to exe
 cute the organic law of
 this Territory On an other
 occasion they submitted the same
 question to the people ofa
 Territory north of 360 30
 and have had no occasion
 to repent the submission New
 Mexico is said to have
 a population of one hundred
 and five thousand inhabitants admit
 it as a State then
 this whole question of slavery
 will be taken from Congress
 and the aeri tation will
 cease This measure then with
 such modifications as may be
 just and reasonable am ready
 to sustain If it shall
 not be adopted in my
 judgment the best plan would
 hereafter be to refer the
 whole subject to a convention
 of all the States The
 people made this Government and
 I know their ability to
 take care of it My
 own State will stand by
 the Union to the last
 She looks to no other
 future and desires none Moderate

 the report Mr HOWARD of

 special committee of five the
 following report in part The
 Clerk rcad as föllows riNhe
 sefeet committee of five appointed
 by the House on the
 9th of January 1851 respectfully
 submit the töllow int report
 in part Dn thc 26th
 of January the foilowing resolution
 was refOrred to said comtnittee
 Resolved That the select committcc
 of five be in structed
 to inquire whether any secret
 organization hos tile to the
 Governrnent ot the United States
 exists in the I and
 it so whether any official
 or etr ployé of the
 city of Washington or any
 employés or officers of the
 Federal Government in the executive
 or jadicial departments are members
 thereof Rhe connnittee entered upon
 the investigation under a deep
 sense of the i nportance
 and the intrinsic difficufty of
 the inquiry To prove the
 existence of a secret organfrz
 a having for its object
 the resistance to and overthrow
 of the Govennnent would in
 the vcr_y nature of the
 case a diflieult task if
 suet an organization really existed
 I the other Ilaud in
 a tinke of high exeitetnent
 conse queut upon revolutionary cvcnts
 transpiring all around us the
 very air fiiled with run
 ors and individuals illduigill t
 in the rnost extravagant expressions
 ot Wars and threaß it
 might well be thouÅht difficult
 to elicit such clear proof
 would enable the committee to
 pronounce autnorltatively I SATURDAY FEBRUARY
 16 1861 that no such
 organization existed and thus eontribute
 to the quiet of tbc
 public mind and the peace
 of tbc country The committee
 have pursued their labors with
 a determ ination on their
 part to ascertain the reat
 facts so far as possible
 And if sometimes they hove
 permitted inquiries and adtnitLed testimony
 not strictly within the rules
 of evi dence or within
 the scope of the resolution
 it is to be attributed
 to their great anxiety to
 elicit the real facts and
 to remove unfounded apprehensions FL
 hc extraordinary ex citcment existing
 prior to the late presidential
 e ection led disaffected persons
 of high and low positiOn
 after the result ofthat election
 became known to consult together
 on the question ot submitting
 to that result and also
 upon various modes ot resistance
 Among other modes resistance to
 counting the ballots to the
 in auguration of Mr Lincoln
 the seizure of the Capitol
 and the District of Colunlbia
 were discussed informally in tltis
 city and elsewhere But too
 much diversity of opinion seems
 to have existed to admit
 of the adoption of any
 well organized plan until some
 of the States commenced to
 re duce their theories of
 secession to practice Sinee then
 persons thus disaffected seem to
 have adopted the idea that
 all resistance to the Government
 it there is to be
 anv should have at Icast
 the color of State authority
 If the purpose was at
 any time entertained of forming
 an organ izat ion secret
 or open to seize the
 District of Columbia attack the
 Capitol or prevent the inauguration
 of Mr Lin coln it
 seems to have been rendered
 contingent upon the secession of
 either Maryland or Virginia or
 both and the sanction of
 one of those States Certain
 organizations in this District and
 in Maryland that prior to
 the election seem to have
 been only political clubs havc
 since assurned the character of
 military organ izations are now
 encaged in drilling and expect
 to provide theniselves with arms
 some from the Stato authorities
 and others from private subscriptions
 But so far as the
 com mittee lvcre ablc to
 learn their purposes while they
 sy npa tllized strongly with
 secession there is no proof
 that they intend to attack
 either the Capitol or the
 District unless the surrender should
 be demanded by a State
 to vvhich they pro fess
 a higher degree of allegiance
 Some of those companies in
 Baltånore profess to be drilling
 for the soie purpose of
 pre venting other military companies
 from passing through the State
 of Maryland Whethez these representations
 of the purposes of those
 companies be correct or not
 the com mittec have failed
 to discover any satisfactory evidence
 that they have any purpose
 whatever as a mere mob
 with out the sanction of
 State authority to attack the
 Capitol or any other public
 propert y in this District
 or to seize the If
 it should be admitted that
 any one of these or
 District ganizations were bostile to
 the Governrnent or entertained unlawful
 purposes they are in no
 proper sefise secret and are
 therefore not such as are
 contemplated in the resolution of
 the House The eonitnittee are
 unanimously of the opinion that
 the evidence produced belöre them
 does not prove the exist
 enee of a secret organization
 here or elsewhere hostile to
 the Government that has for
 its object upon its own
 re sponsibility an attack upon
 the Capitol or any of
 the pub lic property here
 or an interruption of any
 of the functions of the
 Government The committee submit herewith
 all the testimony taken upon
 the subject and ask that
 the same and this report
 be printed and that the
 cmnmittee be discharged from the
 fur ther consideration of the
 subject Mr BRANCH I present
 the following report It is
 brief I wilL read it
 as a minority report It
 is as follows myself Mr
 BRANc11 a member of the
 special committee of five raised
 on the 9th January by
 leave presents his views as
 töilovvs That he concurs entirely
 with the majority of the
 com mittec that the testimony
 adduced before the committee does
 not cstabiish the existence of
 a conspiracy or counbin ation
 or a purpose on the
 part of any persons to
 seize the public property in
 the District of Colurnbia or
 to interfere with the regular
 operations of the Govermncnt He
 thinks it has been notwithstanding
 the difficulty of provin a
 negative that no such conspiracy
 does exist cither ili this
 District or elsewhere It appearing
 from the testijnony of Lieutenant
 Gcneral Scot t taken before
 the committee that seven companies
 of artillery and one company
 of sappers and miners of
 the regular Army have been
 ordered to and are quartered
 in this city in close
 vicinity to thc Capitol under
 the mis taken belief that
 the public property in the
 District was or would be
 in danger and the conunittee
 being unanimously of the opinion
 that no combination or conspiracy
 or pur posc hostile to
 the Government or its property
 exi ts t he undersigned
 recommends thc passage of the
 res L OB BRANCH olution
 Mr HOWARD of Michigan 1
 move that the i report
 and accompanying evidence be printed
 Mr BRANCH Let my resolution
 be read The Clerk read
 as fallows Resolved Thot the
 quartering o troops of the
 regular Artny fu this District
 and around the Capitol when
 not ne cessary for their
 protection from a hostile enemy
 and dur ing the session
 of Congress ünpoiitic and ofiOnsive
 and it permitted rnay be
 destructive of civil iiherty and
 in the opinion of this
 louse the t cculnr troops
 now in this eity ought
 to be forthwith removed tl
 ereff0R1 Mr BRANCH I demand
 the previous ques tion on
 that resolution Mr HOWARD of
 Michigan 1 hope the gen
 NEW tleman will withdraw his
 demandfor the previous question for
 a moment BRANCH 1 Mr
 HOWARD of Michigan I Si1pposedthai
 the report i had the
 honor to I kia e
 mous so far aB it
 goes given my assent to
 anymembef cif the to Present
 the views Of la minority
 on any Subject we have
 acted on I am not
 aware that the com n
 mitt eO had the subject
 Of this resolution before them
 At an eventd they had
 no opportunityto vote on it
 Nov do I understand how
 there can be a minority
 report before the House I
 do not object to it
 but I deem it due
 to the committeet say that
 they have never been called
 to vote oheæ way or
 the other on this resölution
 Mr BRANCH In reply to
 the honorable chairman of the
 committee 1 will say that
 Irk lid not present the
 resolution as the vicws of
 the corn mittee I present
 it as a minority resolution
 I know the fact that
 the committee have not voted
 on the resolution I entertain
 the hope however that tlae
 members of the committee will
 vote foi it in the
 House The honorable chairman of
 the committee mistook me very
 much if he supposed that
 I presented the resolution as
 recommended by a majority of
 the committee Mr HOWARD of
 Michigan Letmeexplain what I did
 m can Unless the resolution
 camo here as a thing
 acted Oh by the corrirhittee
 it could not now be
 before this House exéépt mous
 consent The simple question i
 whether my friend from Notth
 Carolina offers tbis ieso ltatiöff
 as a member of the
 House or as something that
 has received the action of
 the committee and therefore privileged
 like the report Thé SPEAKER
 pro tempore The resolu tiÖri
 vvas received no objection being
 made Objec tion would have
 kept it out Mr HOWARD
 of Michigan Ifithad been stated
 that any membtr desired to
 submit a minor ity report
 the good understanding and good
 incr of the committee would
 not have denied that privilege
 Therefore I was unwilling to
 object but I do not
 think it properly here at
 this tim e at least
 so far as the resolution
 is concerned It ought to
 be introduced upon the gentleman
 s own motion as a
 member of the House and
 then it will be subject
 to objection Mr DA WES
 obtained the floor and said
 Does the Chair decide that
 the resolution is now before
 the House The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The Chair in timated
 to the gentleman from Mic
 higanüat the minority report was
 not in order and could
 n ot have been received
 e cept by general cöosent
 that the resolution accompanying that
 rep 0 t part and
 parcel of it would have
 been rejected and the Chair
 would have ruled it out
 of order if It is
 now re any gentleman had
 objected to it ccivcd and
 in the opinion of the
 Chair is now before the
 House Mr HOWARD of Michigan
 How could we havo known
 what it was until it
 was read It was read
 as The SPEAKER pro tempore
 part and parcel of the
 report Mr BRANCH Let it
 not be forgotten that I
 am still upon the floor
 Mr CRAIGE of Carolina 1
 object to debate unless it
 is in order The previous
 ques tion has bccn called
 Mr BRANCH I hope that
 no gentleman will object to
 my stating in response to
 what has faflen from the
 gentleman from Michigan that through
 all the deliberations of the
 committee charged as it is
 with as important a subject
 as was ever referred by
 this House to any commit
 tee there has been the
 utmost courtesy and kind ness
 of feeling among all the
 members pets ona uy And
 I will say farther so
 far as this investigation is
 concerned I am proud to
 say that every mem ber
 of the committee has exhibited
 the utmost candor and fairness
 and that there has been
 man ifested no desire upon
 the part ofany one to
 sup press the truth x
 or to make that appear
 to be true which was

 in making that declaratinq 914
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 14
 I have already called the
 previous question and I believe
 the Speaker understood it The
 SPEAKER pi ö tempore The
 gentleman from Massachusetts was upon
 the floor and ac quiescing
 in the remarks of the
 gentleman from NOrth Carolina the
 Chair did not interrupt him
 Mr BRANCH Does the Speaker
 decido that I have not
 the floor The SPEAKER pro
 tempore In the opinion of
 the Chair the gentleman from
 North Carolina had relinquished the
 floor Mr BRANCH Does th
 t I Called the previous
 question The SPEAKER tempore The
 Chair does not Mr BRANCH
 I called the previous question
 most distinctly ahd I mypeal
 to every member of the
 House to su ort that
 assertion The SPEAKÆÅ pro tempore
 The gentleman from North Carolina
 did demand the previous question
 but at the suggestion of
 the gentleman from Michigan the
 Chair understood him ex pressly
 to withdraw it Mr BRANCH
 1 yielded the only upon
 condition that I did not
 lose my privilege of in
 sisting upon the previous question
 and so I dis tinctly
 stated The SPEAKER pro tempore
 That did not reach the
 ear of the Speaker Mr
 DAWES Have the floor The
 SPEAKER pr o tempore The
 gentleman is reco nized Mf
 RANCH 1 ask the Speaker
 if he does not understand
 that i have called the
 previous questiön Mr DAWES Cannot
 I be protected in my
 possession of the floor Mr
 BRANCH Does the Speaker understand
 that the revious question has
 becn called The SBEAKER pro
 tempore In the opinion of
 the Chair the gentleman from
 North Carolina withdrew the demand
 for the previous question but
 if the gentleman insists that
 he desires or in tends
 to renew it an opportunity
 will be pre sented to
 renew it The gentleman from
 Massa chusetts is now upon
 the floor Mr BRANCH I
 not Ol rly did not
 intend to I give up
 my privilege but never intended
 to withdraw the previous question
 consented that the gentleman from
 Michigan so far as i
 was concerned might submit any
 remarks he desired but i
 never the previous question The
 SPEAKER tonpore The gentleman from
 North Carolina unquestionably withdrew the
 demand for the previous question
 at the sug gestionofthegcntleman from
 Michigan The gen tleman will
 have an opportunity to present
 again the demaild for the
 pi cvious question but at
 this time the gentleman from
 Massachusetts is upon the floor
 I desire to know then
 Mr BRANCH whether the previous
 question is not pending upon
 the resolution The The Chair
 thinks not Mr BRANCH Then
 suppose the Chair differs with
 me upon a matter of
 fact and upon a matter
 of fact there is no
 appeal But I do ap
 peal to every mcn lber
 whether I am not correct
 The SPEAKER pro tmnpo r
 e Thc gen tlernan from
 Massachusetts will proceed Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE 1 have to request
 the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr
 DAWES Why am 1 not
 permitted to proceed Mr TÖHN
 COCHRANE Will the man yield
 me a moment Mr DAWES
 In a fevv minutes The
 gen tleman from North Carolina
 assures the House that the
 utmost harmony good fealing and
 good understanding have prevailed in
 the eommittae from the beginning
 to the end of the
 investigation Clerk s desk either
 that which purports to be
 a minority report or the
 resolution which the gen tleman
 has appended to his minority
 report Mr McCLERNAND 1 wish
 to ask a ques tion
 just here Mr DAWES Not
 now It is through much
 tribulation that I got the
 floor and if I can
 retain it I will The
 gentleman from North Carolina rises
 in his seat and without
 the slightest inti mation to
 any of his colleagues upon
 the com mittee so far
 as I know commences reading
 a minority report after having
 induced the other members of
 the committee in their desire
 to have an unanimous report
 to yield as far as
 they could impressions whidh the
 evidence made upon their minds
 He closed his minority report
 with a res olution the
 first intimation any other member
 of the committee had of
 tho existence of the resolu
 tion It is then too
 late for anybody to object
 to its introduction He followed
 that up wiih a call
 for the previous question thereby
 cutting off every member of
 the committee froxn expressin his
 views upon that minority report
 or upon the resolution And
 this is offered by the
 gentlenmn after having confessed to
 the House that there has
 been the utmost harmony and
 good feeling in that committee
 from the beginning to the
 end I must confess Mr
 Speaker that I hardly ex
 pected when I yielded as
 my friend from North Carolina
 knows I did the strong
 impressions made upon my mind
 by the testimony produced before
 the committee from my desire
 in which thought I was
 met fully bv the gentleman
 from North Carolina to have
 a unanimous report from the
 committee that he would introduce
 such a resolution Mr BRANCH
 I desire to respond to
 the gen tleman in reference
 to this personal matter but
 I will interrupt him only
 at such point as is
 agree able to himself I
 claim the right to interrupt
 him but hc may select
 his own time Mr DIHVES
 The gentleman from North Car
 olina it seems to me
 fhi ed to understand the
 po sit iorl of the
 other members of the committee
 when I he states in
 what now purports to be
 a minority report that ib
 is proved according to the
 unani Inous opinion of that
 committee that no such conspiracy
 existed On tho contrary the
 unan imous conclusion to which
 the committee came was that
 it was not proved that
 any such con spiracy existed
 It was a Scotch verdict
 and nothing more which the
 comtnittee came to the unanimous
 conclusion to render in this
 case Under these circumstances the
 gentleman from North Carolina has
 fblt it his duty I
 have no doubt to introduce
 a resolution that these troops
 should be removed frotn the
 Districtof Columbia In my opinion
 sir the reason that we
 have not been able to
 prove the existence of such
 a con spiracy here is
 because of the very presence
 of setts has alluded to
 me personally and under the
 rules I have a right
 to make a personal expla
 nation in reply to him
 The gentleman from Massachusetts says
 that no member of the
 committee had ever seen this
 I have already resolution beforc
 presented it stated that I
 did not offer this resolution
 as being approved or sanctioned
 by any member of the
 committee but myself My name
 and my name alone is
 signed to the report that
 precedcd the resolution But I
 desire to ask the gentleman
 from Massachusetts a question Did
 I not in the committee
 in open session this day
 say to the committee that
 I desired to present a
 resolu tion reqtésting the President
 to remove the troops from
 this District but that 1
 knew I stood alone I
 in the Committee in that
 regard and that it was
 useless to present it to
 the committee because it xxvould
 be voted down and I
 would ask him fur ther
 whether he himself was not
 the first gentle man to
 speak out and say Ihat
 it was useless I I
 desire the gentleman from Massachusetts
 to respond to that question
 Mr DAWES Most certainly and
 that is the reason why
 I supposed that the resolution
 would never be heard of
 in the shape of a
 minority report Mr BRANCH Then
 the gentleman from Massachusetts has
 admitted the whole ground on
 which my vindication rests from
 the charge brought against me
 of a Nant of courtesy
 Mr DÄYVES Is this question
 debatable What has become of
 my motion to lay the
 reso lution upon the table
 The SPEAKER pro tempore The
 gentleman from Massachusetts suggests that
 he has made a motion
 to lay this resolution upon
 the table The gentleman from
 North Carolina desired to make
 a personal explanation as a
 matter of courtesy Mr BRANCH
 Not as a matter of
 courtesy but under the rules
 of the House DAWES 1
 do not object to the
 gentle man s explanation I
 only wanted to know what
 had become of my motion
 The SPEAKER The Chair will
 say to tho gentleman from
 North Carolina if he will
 suspend fora momcnt that no
 objection hav inff been made
 to the exercise of the
 right which he claims but
 which the Chair regards as
 a mere matter of courtesy
 the gentleman proceeded and the
 Chair feels it his duty
 novv to permit the gen
 tleman to proceed further Mr
 DAWES have no objection to
 the gen tieman s remarks
 I only want to know
 what becomes of rny motion
 The SPEAKER pro tempore It
 wiil come up at the
 proper time when the geutleman
 from North Carolina has ended
 his explanation Mr BRANCH It
 is very singular indeed that
 after the gentleman from Massachusetts
 has these troops in the
 District of Columbia which charged
 me with want of courtesy
 in presentinø prevented that conspiracy
 from ripening into fru l
 the resolution and then calling
 the previous ques II tion
 so as to prevent debate
 he should rise here Ition
 Sir the presence of those
 troops herc has enabled this
 cormnittee to present to the
 House now and after such
 remarks as he has made
 in i this report that
 that which to my mind
 it is per regard to
 myself personally should make a
 mo fec ly clear was
 at one time contemplated and
 tion which would cut off
 further debate and pre proceeded
 to some extent in its
 formation vv as It vent
 me replying nipped in the
 bud and stifled by the
 presence of The gentleman frorn
 Massachusetts is mistaken these txoops
 in this city The gentleman
 from if he supposes that
 I have claimed or desired
 that North Carolina could not
 have obtained I think the
 House should understand t bat
 this resolution from any member
 of the committee a sanction
 of I met the approbation
 of any other member of
 the the minority report whic
 h he has presented committee
 than myself I present it
 in behalf of As I
 said before in the desire
 to produce a myself The
 report is signed by myself
 alone unanimous report we yielded
 much and omitted il and
 was consented to by no
 other member at all to
 point out wherein the evidence
 showed that at T hc
 gentleman says that when the
 report of the k one
 time there did exist in
 the minds of verv chairman
 was read to the committee
 it Vas many disturbed and
 restless men in and abou
 t understood to be unanimous
 It was so under District
 in the borders of I
 v laryland and Vir stood
 1 expressly stated in the
 report accom ginia an intention
 if certain events transpired panyinT
 my resolution that I entirely
 concurred according to what chev
 believed was the tendency in
 everything contained in the report
 of the ma I of
 things to march upon this
 capital and seize jority of
 the cornmittee and 1 informed
 the com the archives I
 do not belicvc that there
 does mittee this morning the
 gentlenemn from Massa I want
 now to state to the
 House that when this I
 exist now any such conspiracy
 in the minds of chusetts
 being present and hearing everything
 men round about us here
 but it is because it
 has majority report was presented
 to the committee that occurred
 that I concurred in ali
 the com it was unanimously
 agreed to and each member
 become too apparent to nocn
 that discretion is the mittee
 had lone and only objected
 to the report of the
 committee in an anxious desire
 to have a better part
 of valor because events over
 which I because it did
 not go far enough and
 the gentle unanimous report yielded
 much of his ov rn
 im I they had no
 control have crushed it out
 I move man from Massachusetts
 used in response to me
 pressions and inclinations in reference
 to the tes to lay
 tl le resolution of the
 gentleman from North the very
 illustration which he has used
 here to day timony submitted
 to them A unanimous report

 in reference to tho Scotch
 verdict in the languaoe submitted
 by the chairman of the

 the privilege of a Now
 I submit to the House
 whether under all committee was
 agreed upon this morning in
 the personal reply to the
 gentleman from Massachu the circumstances
 confiÆsed and admitted by the
 setts a personal explanation committee
 No member of t he
 committee I ven I have
 a right to i gentleman
 from Massachusetts it does not
 come The rules of the
 I louse givc ture to
 say e vor heard of
 the papers which the it
 under the rules with ill
 grace from him to rise
 here and charge me gentlcman
 from North Carolina read from
 the me the right I
 he gentleman from Massachu with
 want of courtesy to any
 of the members of the
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 915
 com mittee I have already
 stated that through out the
 whole deliberations of the comrnittee
 the utmost frankness and candor
 and the utmost kind liness
 of feeling have prevailed among
 the mem bers I have
 taken no advantage of them
 in any way and they
 have taken no advantage of
 me I would not if
 I could take advantagc o
 foist on them anything that
 they did not approve I
 con curred in theii report
 from an earnest desire that
 the report should be unanimous
 I concurred in it with
 a statement at the time
 that it did not go
 as far as I desired
 it to go and that
 I de sire to have
 resolution passed requesting the President
 to remove the Federal troops
 from the District of Columbia
 The gentleman has ad mitted
 that Mr DAWES The gentleman
 from North Carolina has done
 just t his he has
 by the course he has
 taken unknown to the rest
 of the com mittee succeeded
 in getting a resolution before
 the House that it would
 not have been in order
 for him to have got
 before the House under the
 action of the committee Mr
 BRANCH Mr Speaker 1 do
 not think that in any
 instance since I have been
 a member of Congress the
 privilege has bcen dcnicd to
 a member of the minority
 of a committee to pre
 sent his views and in
 four such instances out of
 five they have been accompanied
 by a resolu tion or
 by a bill and I
 have never heard that a
 resolution or a bill thus
 brought before the House was
 out of order or was
 not legitimately before the House
 At any rate if it
 was not m order I
 read the report aloud from
 the Clerk s desk and
 the Clerk read the resolution
 by which it was accompanied
 I offered it in good
 faith and pressed it under
 the belief that it wag
 in order and that it
 was proper to pass it
 and neither the gentleman from
 Massach usetts nor any other
 gentleman made a point of
 order nor objected to Its
 reception When I called the
 previous ques tion I did
 so not from a desire
 to prevent any member of
 the committee from expressing his
 I said not a word
 myself of debate Views Instantly
 the chairman of the committee
 rose in his place and
 desired to make a remark
 I gave way to him
 and as the result has
 shown I lost 1 have
 the motion which I had
 made paid the penalty of
 my courtesy to the members
 of the committee and the
 gentleman from Mas sachusetts who
 has made all this complaint
 of me has also taken
 advantage of my courtesy and
 moved to lay the resolution
 on the table after the
 Chair had stated that I
 should have an opportu nity
 of calling the previous question
 Mr DAWES The gentleman from
 North Carolina did not I
 dare say hear my remark
 to him that I did
 not desire to cut off
 any remarks he might wish
 to make provided I could
 hold the floor and move
 to lay the resolution on
 the table I was perfectly
 willing as I had already
 done on those terms to
 hear thc gentleman from North
 Carolina SVhile I am on
 the floor I want to
 ask the gen It is
 tleman from North Carolina one
 question this by what sort
 of process is it that
 he has been enabled to
 produce a minority report oub
 of a unanimous report Mr
 BRANCH I did not hear
 the gentleman from Massachusctts Mr
 DAWES want to ask the
 gentleman by what sort of
 process it is that he
 has been enabled to manufacture
 a minority report out of
 a unanimous report We have
 a unanimous re I understand
 therefore port of the committee
 that the committee affree to
 the report from the beginning
 to the end of it
 and to all portions of
 it The gentleman says that
 he agreed to the If
 so then there is report
 with the rest of us
 no rninority report at all
 There was no impres Sion
 left on the mind of
 any of the committee to
 enable them to suspect the
 existence ofa minor ity report
 Yet under these circumstances it
 is that the gentleman thinks
 he has fairly and with
 courtesy to the committee produced
 a minority report here Mr
 BRANCH The gentleman from Massa
 chusetts asks me how I
 un able to manufacture a
 minority report out of a
 unanimous report The report which
 I have filed and which
 has been read to the
 House as the gentleman would
 well know If he had
 listened to it sets out
 by stating that I concur
 in all that tho conunittee
 has the only ol jeetion
 stated in the majority report
 I have to the report
 being that it did not
 go far I enough and
 I then go on and
 state in what I think
 the committee should have gone
 furthéf Mr DAWES If the
 gentleman agrees with the majority
 report in all its parts
 he then agrees that it
 shall stop with the resolution
 reported by the committee Mr
 BRANCH It is very obvious
 to the House how a
 minority report can be based
 on such a report The
 committee unanimously agree upon facts
 but they refuse to adopt
 what I conceive to be
 a proper sequence from those
 facts They acrree that no
 conspiracy exists or at least
 that none has been proved
 I state in the minority
 report that I concur with
 them in this tliat no
 conspiracy has been proved and
 that it is clear no
 conspiracy does exist I then
 go on to say as
 a natural consequence of those
 facts in regard to which
 the committee are unanimous that
 the troops that were brought
 here in consequence of the
 belief that there was a
 conspiracy ought to I think
 theie can be removed from
 this District be no diffculty
 on the part of members
 of the Elouse in seeing
 how I could concur in
 all that was contained in
 the report and still o
 further Mr LOVEJOY 1 rise
 to a question of order
 I do not wish to
 interpose so long as any
 mem bor has anything personal
 to explain but I merely
 yielded to the gentleman from
 Michigan Mr HOWARD to present
 his report If the remarks
 of the gentleman from North
 Carolina are to be considered
 as a discussion of this
 report then it seems to
 me they cover ground for
 which did not yield Mr
 BRANCH There is one other
 point of a personal character
 which I wish to refer
 to and tbcn I Nevill
 yield to thc gentleman from
 Illinois The SPEAKER The Chair
 wishes to suøgest to the
 gentleman from Illinois that after
 the motion was made by
 the gentleman from Massachusetts to
 lay this resolution on the
 table the Chair deemed it
 proper to permit the remarks
 of gentleman which were of
 a personal character somewhat The
 Chair designed and yet designs
 to confine this debate between
 the gen Lleman from Massachusetts
 Mr DAWES and the gentleman
 from North Carolina Mr BRANCH
 and when its personal character
 shall be dispose of the
 Chair wiil put the motion
 to lay on the table
 Mr BRANCH The only of
 a personal character which I
 desire to make is as
 to a statement made by
 the gentleman from Massa chusctts
 which I did not hear
 and which has just been
 brought to my attention The
 gentleman has stated as I
 am informed that members of
 the committee yielded somewllat their
 individual opinions in order that
 the report might be unan
 imous In regard to that
 I will state that I
 never saw the majority report
 till after it was written
 had no confercnce or consultation
 in which I participated as
 to what would be the
 character I neither suggested any
 alteration of thc report in
 the report nor was any
 made in it to suit
 my I now yield to
 the gentleman from New views
 York Mr DAWES 1 will
 state to the gentleman from
 North Carolina what I meant
 to say The SPEAKER pro
 tenvporc Does the gentle man
 from N lassachusetts withdraw the
 motion to lav on the

 The SPEAKER pro tempore Then
 ques tion is not debatable
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 claim

 New York is a member

 he will either rehew my
 motion or let do so
 I will withdraw it for

 gentleman withdraws his motion to

 Chair will recognize any gentleman
 who may address it Does
 the gentletnan withdraw his motion
 Mr DAWES Not except on
 condition that the gentleman from
 New York will renew it
 MY JOHN COCHRANE 1 presume

 the point raised The SPEARÉR

 Mr GROW I think the
 gentleman from New York does
 not understand the facts The
 gentle man from North Carolina
 spoke but of order by
 the courtesy of the House
 and could not there fore
 yield the floor to the
 gentleman Mr BRANCH I will
 say that the gentleman from
 Massachusetts only got the opportunity
 of making the motion to
 lay the resolution on the
 table by my extending the
 courtesy of withdraw ing temporarily
 the demand for the previous
 ques tion to enable the
 chairman of the committee to
 make an explanation ind I
 now ask the gentle Ilian

 prevent another member of the
 commi tee from making an
 explanation which he desires to
 make by in sisting upon
 the motion to lay on

 reply to the gentleman from
 North Carolina I will say
 that I have distinctly half
 a dozen times offered to
 give the gentleman from New
 York the opportunity of explanation
 by withdrawing the motion to
 lay on the gable if
 he would promise to renew
 the motion But have experienced
 sorne diffculty in getting e
 the floor and that difficulty
 warns me to hold on
 to the motion I have
 made unless I can have
 that assurance Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 Will the gentle man from

 and no debate allowed Mr
 McCLERNAND think we have had
 explanations enough upon this resolution
 Now ask that the question
 be put upon the mo

 upon the motiö n öf
 the gentleman from Massa éhüsetts
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 hope
 the gentle from MassachuSetts who
 has control of the floor
 upon this resolution will allow
 me to put to him
 one question The SPEAKER tempore
 The Chair will indglge the

 I have Go dispo sition
 not to listen to the

 Upon that condition 1 do
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE obtained the
 floor Mr BURNETT Mr Speaker
 1 claim the floor The
 gentleman from New York did
 not address the Chair at
 all after the motion had
 been withdrawn by tho gentleman
 from Massachusetts I was the
 only member who addressed the
 Chair and I ask that
 the floor shall be assigned
 to me The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The Chair rec ognized
 thc gentleman from New York
 Mr BURNETT The gentleman from
 New York tis I said
 did not address the Chair
 I say to the Speaker
 that under the rules of
 this House 1 entitled to
 the floor The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The Chair will suggest
 to the gentleman from Kentucky
 that the motion to lay
 the resoluti01j on the table
 was with drawn by the
 gentleman from Massachusetts upon the
 appeal of the gentleman from
 New York The gent léman
 from New York was upon
 the floor at the time
 hc had been recognized by
 the Chair atod when the
 motion Was withdrawn was enti
 tleditö the floor Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE There seems in deed
 to have been more excitement
 upon this col lateral point
 than there has Inen manifested
 in the discussion of the
 rnain question and indeed the
 main question is not one
 of so great significance that
 the equilibrium and equanimity of
 r asonable gentlemen upon this
 floor should be so disturbed
 that wc should in fact
 be so frightened from our
 propriety us to lead the
 country 40 sus CCt that
 there is something beneath t
 ques tion of so great
 importance and of such magnifi
 cent proportions that when disclosed
 we all should be horrified
 and astounded at the result
 There is however sir a
 significance in the res o
 ution which hås been submitted
 a gravamen which calls upon
 members to closely and accu
 rately scrutinize and considerately determine
 It contains sir a severe
 censure in my estimation upon
 the Lieutenant Geberal of the
 forces of the Unitcd Sttites
 and upon the Executive and
 it is in that viéw
 that I propose to address
 to tl iC House a
 few remarks at this moment
 I do not say t
 bat the gentlemai l from
 North Carolina was necessarily in
 error in preferring his minority
 report I do believe that
 within the strict rules of
 courtesy and order he is
 to be sustained in that
 regard in the course which
 he has taken but respecting
 the resolution with which he
 has closed his rernarks I
 think he has exceeded the
 proper limit to which the
 courtesy extended to hirn should
 havc bech carried The gentleman
 will allow me to say
 in this respect that rny
 re marks upon the presentation
 of that regolution of that
 grave nature which I have
 indicated that it is proper
 and it is due to
 every gentleman here who wishes
 to be heard upon it
 and especially to the members
 of that committee who are
 in some degree to be
 compromised by it to speak
 and utter his sentiments in
 very degree I should not
 hesitate to pronounce the report
 of the majority of the
 committee as coming strictly within
 the instructions given them for
 if I remem ber correctly
 the resolution conferring additional powers
 upon that committee directed them
 to inquire and examine iqto
 the existence or proba bility
 of an organization to interfere
 N vith the Federal rights
 the Federal powers and Federal
 property in the District of
 Columbia but whether tlie Lieutenant
 General of the military forces
 of the United States or
 the Executive or any other
 officer was justified in having
 invoked armed forces was not
 a question within the purport
 of these instructions or within
 the purview of the powers
 of the Æmmittce L herefore
 it is sir that I
 have taken the floor to
 say a word in that
 regard that I may not
 by my silence as 1
 am a member of the
 committee bc construed to agree
 fully in the opinions of
 the minority report and resolution
 submitted by the gentleman from
 North Carolina Mr BRANCH I
 deprecate as much as he
 does or any other gentleman
 the gathering of armed troops
 in the capital of the
 nation where legislators are accustomed
 to assemble and laws are
 enacted where free speech is
 not only toler ated but
 sustained in order to preserve
 that habit of freedom upon
 which freemen rely for their
 reputation their integrity and their
 honor dislike quite as much
 as my friend from North
 Carolina that the military note
 should be heard on the
 morning air I dislike quite
 as much as he does
 that bay onets should glitter
 in the sun I dislike
 quite as much as he
 does the spectacle of a
 regular army environing this city
 and giving the impres Sion
 that Congress is legislating under
 the dicta tion of myrmidons
 of a despotic captain I
 not only deprecate but I
 reprobate it But sir the
 cir cumstances are not such
 as justly to allow the
 con clusion he has drawn
 The evidence presented by the
 chairman of the committee is
 conclusive on this point if
 it be conclusive on anything
 that although there may now
 be no vestige of an
 or ganization threatening the District
 of Columbia and the Federal
 power here yet at no
 remote pe riod of time
 there were rumors and reports
 at tracting the attention of
 all of the active existence
 of such organizations It was
 deemed by those intrusted with
 the preservation of the public
 peace necessary to adopt precautionary
 measures If my recollection be
 accurate and I think it
 IS the question was put
 to the loader of the
 forees in this city why
 it was that reliance was
 placéd upon the regular troops
 instead of upon the militia
 of the Dlst rict And
 that he replied that under
 the circumstances of the thrcatened
 danger it was more wise
 and prudent to rely upon
 thc regular troops in the
 face of an insurrection than
 a militia hastily assembled for
 the reason that untrained troops
 could not evithstand without delivering
 their fire the hurling of
 missiles from an insurrectionary mob
 That answer and that policy
 were approved believe by a
 majorit y of the cmnmittee
 Mr BRANCH Will the gentleman
 from Now York state in
 justice to me that at
 all times dur I ing
 t ie proceedings of the
 committee I gave out nied
 the privilege then of denouncing
 it I desire to know
 whether the originatorof this inquisition
 appeared before it to state
 what facts and reasons he
 had for submittino the resolutions
 I am sat isfied that
 the whole inquisition originated with
 thöse connected vith the War
 Department with the Lieutenant General
 of the Army at whose
 suggestion it is known the
 military power has been concentrated
 at the capital of the
 Republic and now publicly declare
 what I believed at the
 time that the object of
 this futile and false inqui
 sition was either to furnish
 a pretext for bringing the
 troops here and thus afford
 the Lieutenant General a color
 of justification for such an
 ex traordinary act or else
 it originated with the Gov
 ernor of Maryland or his
 emissaries about this Capitol The
 Governor of Maryland is the
 only respectable man in the
 State who has had the
 auda city to libel and
 calumniate his fellow citizens by
 his published proclamation of the
 3d of January last He
 has proclaimed that he was
 in the pos session of
 information not accessible to the
 Legis lature or to people
 of the State and that
 there did exist in the
 State an organization of his
 fellow citizens armcd and prepared
 to invade the District of
 Columbia Mr LOVEJOY I insist
 on my point of order
 Mr KUNKEL Armed sir and
 prepared to capture this Capitol
 Cries of Order Mr LOVEJOY
 I object to these interrup
 ruptions and this prolonging of
 the debate I yielded only
 for the reception of the
 report The SPEAKER tenzpo e
 Does the gen tleman make
 the point that debate is
 not in order Mr LOVEJOY
 1 do The SPEAKER pro
 tempore The gen tleman yielded
 for the reception of the
 report and now that it
 is before the House it
 must be disposed of Mr
 LOVEJOY I yielded only for
 the recep tion of the
 report and not for action
 on it Mr KUNKEL 1
 hope 1 may be indulged
 in a fcw remarks The
 SPEAKER pro tempore The gentleman
 from New York has the
 floor and the gen tlcman
 froz n Maryland is speaking
 by his courtesy Mr KUNKEL
 1 thank the gentleman from
 New York for his courtesy
 Mr LOVEJOY I object to
 the gentleman from New York
 yielding to the gentleman from
 Maryland unless he yields the
 floor absolutely The SPEAKER tempore
 Does the man from New
 York yield to the gentleman
 from Maryland Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 leave the matter to
 the House Mr LOVEJOY I
 object to the gentleman yieldilig
 any further Mr KUNKEL I
 think the objection comes too
 late Mr COX 1 think
 so too Mr KUNKEL 1
 was upon the floor ad
 dressing the House by the
 courtesy of the gen tleman
 from New York The SPEAKER
 tempore The Chair de cides
 that the gentleman from Maryland
 having occupied the floor by
 general consent and the consent
 of the gentleman from New
 York is now entitled to
 the floor to speak for
 the remainilp tirne of the
 geritiernan from New York unless
 he desires to reclaim it
 Laue hter Mr JOI IN
 COCHRANE The gentleman from Maryland
 will hopc remember that I
 am that would move a
 resolution for the removal of
 under obligation to renew the
 motion to lay the the
 troops from this District if
 the conclusion of resolu tion
 on the table the committec
 was such as I thought
 it would be Mr KUNKEL
 resumed the floor Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE That has been the
 Mr DAWES point of order
 The uniform expression of my
 friend from North Car entleman
 from New York will understand
 that olina yielded him the
 floor merely to make a
 personal Mr KUNKEL Before the
 gentleman explanation and not that
 he rnight farm it out
 to New York moves to

 Senator from New Hampshire Mr
 HALE relative to the order
 of the Senate directing the

 a very short one The
 Secretary read the report as
 follows The Comntittee to Audit
 and Control the Contingent Expenses
 of the Senate to which
 was referred a resolu tion
 of thc Senate of 2d
 February 1861 as follows Resolved
 r i hat the reasons
 assigned by the Secretary of
 thc Senate his neglect to
 obey the order of the
 Sen ate rnade on the
 20th of March last in
 favor of Mrs E A
 and that he be Linn
 are insufficient and unsatisfactory instructed
 fOrLhwit 11 to executc the
 smnc report I hat the
 committee after careful c xmnination
 of the sub jecL is
 or the opinion that tbc
 reasons by the Secre tary
 of the Senate in his
 letter of the 29th January
 3861 for not Inakiug the
 payment directed by the resolution
 of the Senate are sufficient
 and satisfactory hut that the
 Senato having passed the said
 order the chairman of the

 ask for an appropriation to
 enable the Secretary of the
 Senatc to make the payment
 Mr JOHNSON of Tennessee The
 commit tee have instructed me
 to offer in the first
 appro priation bill that comes
 up an amendment appro priating
 the amount necessary to fulfill
 the order of the Senate
 There is no money out
 of which nessee and if
 there were an order of
 the Senate to pay a
 specific sum I think perhaps
 the Secre tary would pay
 it without question as there
 are manv precedents for such
 payments 2vfr JOHNSON of Tennessee
 The commit tee on an
 examination of the law did
 not con sider that the
 Secretary was authorized to pay
 it out of the contingent
 fund Therefore they sus tain
 him in his report giving
 the reasons for not paying
 it but they also authorized
 the chairman to propose an
 amendment to an appropriation bill
 so as to authorizé the
 Secretary to pay the amount
 which will be done on
 the first appro priation bill

 that comes up appropriat ing
 the amount Mr CRITTENDEN 1
 wish to say a word
 and I desire the ear
 of the Sehator from Tennes
 see The former order was
 indefinite as to the amount
 to be paid If it
 be as the Senate un
 doubtedly intended it should be
 the amount of constructive mileage
 due to Senator Linn then
 it amounts according to the
 Secretary s estimate to but
 twenty six hundred and odd
 dollars propose therefore that instead
 of what the Sen ator
 proposes the Senate make an
 order to pay to Mrs
 Linn 2 600 Mr FESSENDEN
 There must be a law
 for it Mr CRITTENDEN Iwas
 add that I there are
 on our records instances on
 instances of I such payments
 being directed out of the
 contin gent fund The contingent
 fund has been applied to
 such purposes over and over

 PRESIDENT The joint tion has
 been reported to the Senate
 I vit h amend ments
 The amendments were concurred in
 Mr HALE I wish to
 suggest that there wore fears
 expressed yesterday that a very
 large sum was to be
 taken out of the Treasury
 by this joint i resolution
 and therefore I move to
 amend it by fixing the
 following qualification to the amount
 to come in at the
 end of the resolution Not
 e xeceding in amount six
 months mail pay accord ing
 to the said order Mr
 GREEN I move to amend
 that amend ment So as
 to say the amount provided
 for by the contract Whatever
 the contract was if the
 service was performed according to
 the contract it should be
 paid for according to the
 contract Mr HALE I want
 to say t04hé Senator from
 Missouri if L can get
 his ear that I am
 friendly I think they have
 been very t o these
 contractors badly used and that
 they are entitled to relief
 but they do not ask
 as much relief as the
 Senator from Missouri proposes to
 give them because they do
 not ask anything for that
 western part of the line
 that was discontinued They only
 ask for that part of
 the line that is on
 this side Mr GREEN Let
 me interrupt the Senator If
 the parties are willing to
 take what he proposcs I
 of course withdraw my amendment
 The VICE PRESIDENT Does the
 Senator from Missouri withdraw bis
 amendment MF GREEN If the
 Senator says the parties are
 willing to take what he
 proposes I do M r
 HALE They agree to the
 modification i have suggested they
 ask nothing for the west
 ern part of the route
 Mr KING desire to know
 of the Senator from New
 Hampshire whether the service which
 these parties rendered was of
 their own volition and against
 the order of the Postmaster
 General or whether it was
 rendered at his request IVI
 HALE I thought i made
 it tolerably plain the other
 day Mr KING You might
 have done so but how
 was it Mr HALE There
 was a contract made for
 a mail running across the
 entire continent from the Atlantic
 to the Pacific Subseqüently a
 por tion of the route
 was discontinued Mr KING According
 to law Mr HALE Grant
 if you please that it
 was according to law I
 have not a word to
 say about that Then they
 entered into a new contract
 with Governor Brown who was
 Postm astet General discontinuing the
 central part of their route
 leav incr to them a
 part at each end to
 perform They entered into a
 new contract in which no
 such reservation as the Senator
 from New York seems to
 have ill view was made
 and they supposed and understood
 that the reservation of the
 Post master to curtail and
 diminish and alter their contract
 had been finished and in
 the new con tract there
 was no such qualification inserted
 but subsequently to that I
 think after Govemor Brown went
 out of office and Congress
 failed to make an appropriation
 a new Postmastcr Gen eral
 came in and he disturbed
 the subsequent arrangement made by
 Governor Brown I hcn it
 was that the inhabitants upon
 the route the cotnmanding general
 of the army in Texas
 and everybody interested in it
 made such represent ations that
 they went on performing the
 modified contract that was made
 after the first interruption It
 is for that service tl
 at by Governor Browm this
 joint resolution proposes to pay
 them Mr COLLAMER inquire whether
 the piece that was taken
 out was the middle piece
 between El Paso and Fort
 Yuma Mr HALE It was
 Mr COLLAMER the service per
 formed on the piece between
 Fort Yuma and San Diego
 Mr HALE That service was
 performed at first but afterwards
 it was entirely discontinued and
 this resolution does not propose
 to give them a cent
 for that Mr COLLAMER This
 then is for that piece
 from San Antonio to El
 Paso Mr HALE Filhat piece
 and it ought to be
 Mr BRAGG I should like
 to ask the Senator from
 New Hampshire what will be
 the amount to be paid
 to these parties according to
 his pro posed amendment He
 says six months pay I
 suppose the Senator is familiar
 with what the pay was
 Mr HALE I cannot state
 but I understand it will
 beöomewhercabout sixty thousand dollars Mr
 BRAGG I think we had
 better have that specific The
 report made by the committee
 esti mates that the pay
 will be in accordance with
 the last contract which the
 Séna tor made ith these
 parties w biche wäsæonp andi
 fifty nine thousandand gome hn
 ndted dollars a ear hr
 HALE Iam willing tcput in
 amamend ment limiting the amount
 Mr BRAGG I understand the
 amended proposes to give them
 this pay upto June 18Gl
 Mr HALE I do not
 undetstand that be the resolution
 Mr COLLAMER We have so
 amended it Mr BRAGG i
 should like to have lheamount
 made specific because we often
 pass bills appro priating more
 than we supposed at the
 time as it turns out
 afterwards Mr HEMPHILL There is
 a very wide dif ference
 between the r epört and
 the joint resolu tion I
 have nob read through allthe
 report but it appears to
 be very goes on to
 discuss the law on the
 subjeet of damages for the
 violation of conträcts by cutting
 up thelihe here and cutting
 it up there and thqenu
 mbetofihorses that wore lost and
 the stations t tbat de
 stroyed c but this joint
 resolution isfor the service actually
 performed it is notfor any
 ofthose damages The report and
 the joint resolutiou do not
 agree The report has nothing
 todo with t h e
 resolution The joint resolution is
 for service actually performed for
 trips actually run Per haps
 it would be more specific
 if it said the number
 of trips performed on that
 portion of the route which
 lies between El Paso and
 San An tonio Ihat is
 all that is claimed and
 perhaps it had better be
 amended in that way Mr
 CLARK Will the Senator from
 Texas allow me to inquire
 of him if he can
 tell what was performed and
 what is the amount of
 service to be paid for
 Mr HEMPHILL The be paid
 for is weekly trips for
 some months Tdo not know
 the number of months between
 El Paso and San Antonio
 The whole route extended from
 San Antonio to San Diego
 on the Pacific at first
 During the administration of Governor
 Brown all that portion of
 the route which lies between
 El Paso and Fort Yuma
 was Out off by him
 That left the line then
 with a small portion two
 hundred miles on the end
 from Fort Yuma to San
 Diego and about eight hun
 dred miles the cast from
 El Paso to San Antonio
 with five or six hundred
 mites between these two ends
 When Mr Holt came in
 he cut off the end
 from Fort Yuma to San
 Diego leaving only that por
 tion of the line which
 existed between San Anto nio
 and El Paso He afterwards
 cut down two or three
 hundred miles of that so
 as to leave only now
 in existence that portion of
 the line which extends from
 San Antonio to Comanche Spring
 All that is asked is
 for the trips performed be
 tween San Antonio and ELPaso
 and nommore The line was
 a weekly line and Mr
 Holt cut it down to
 a semi monthly Mr CLARK
 I did not inquire the
 extent of the route I
 want to know what extent
 Of ser vice they performed
 and what is the sum
 in dol lars and cents
 that we shall have to
 pay Mr HALE If the
 Senator from Texas will yield
 to me I will modify
 my amendmentin this way Not
 exceeding in amount 70 000
 I say that because I
 am authorized to say it
 Mr CAMERON I move to
 amend that by sa ing
 40 000 Ilr HALE You
 do not know anything about
 it Laughter The VICE PRESIDENT
 The question was upon the
 amendment of the Senator from
 New Hampshire which he proposes
 to modify so as to
 read not exceeding in amount
 70 000 The Senator from
 Pennsylvania proposes to amend the
 amendment by substituting 40 000
 Mr WIGFALL 1 did not
 Intend to trouble the Scnate
 with any remarks in reference
 to this matter because I
 supposed after the report was
 read which was asked to
 printed ten days or t
 xvo weeks ago and after
 thé explanationsvhich have been made
 so frequently on the floor
 that the Senate understood it
 Many of them L per
 ceive are troubled with the
 diseaseof not listen but as
 I have not spoken upon
 this subject of course i
 have no complaints to make
 The facts are briefly these
 some yea s ago these
 contractors undertook to make the
 experi 920 ment of carrying
 a mail overland to California
 They did carry it from
 New Orleans to San Diego
 I do not rnean the
 water portion of the route
 but they carried it from
 San Antonio to San Diego
 Then the Postmaster General after
 the Butterfield route was adopted
 cut them off from Fort
 Yuma to El Paso leavinga
 portion of their stock between
 Fort Yuma and San Diego
 and a portion of their
 stock between El Paso and
 San Antonio and cut ting
 them out of the intermediate
 portion These men had gone
 as pioneers they had built
 their owmstables and they had
 paid for their stock at
 their stables they had employed
 at extravagant prices men to
 carry the mail and take
 the hazard of being killed
 by Indians they had undertaken
 all this they had been
 pioneers and they had carried
 that rnäil faithfully They were
 obliged line was inter pay
 for a guard When their
 rupted I Say because I
 know they lost immensely ütpon
 the stock which they had
 first between El Paso and
 Fort Yuma and afterwards they
 lost immensely upon the stock
 they were obliged to sell
 behveen Fort Yuma and San
 Diego Then they got nothing
 for all the stables they
 had built or the posts
 they had established Finally Mr
 Hokt who wasa very economical
 Yostmaster General not caring two
 buttons what the Governmcnt spent
 only intent that it should
 not be upon the Post
 Offce that was all heseemed
 to have cared about willing
 that the Government migh E
 spend as much as it
 pleased thousands hun drcd s
 of thousands and millions provided
 it was saddled upon the
 Treasury so that he could
 make a Post Offce report
 showing that he had econo
 mizéd chose to discontinue the
 route between San Antonio and
 El Paso That route between
 Stin Antonio and Ei Paso
 was the only means of
 supplying seven military posts Hc
 discontinued that to semi monthly
 it was semi weckly before
 I hosc seven military posts
 had no other means of
 receiving communications from the Govern
 ment except by incurring greater
 expenses than keeping up this
 line by sending special messen
 gers General Twigcys under these
 circumstances called upon these men
 to carry the mail still
 The citizens in that section
 of the country not only
 those living In Texas about
 Ei Paso but all New
 Mexico for that was the
 only means by which they
 could get their letters and
 papers the citi zens of
 that section of the country
 generally called them to continue
 carrying the mails and the
 mails were delivered by the
 postmaster and tl ley wore
 carried Now they want to
 be paid Sor the actual
 trips under the original contract
 with Postmaster General Brown not
 for carrying the mail to
 Fort Yuma not for carryine
 it to San Diego but
 pro ratc adeerding to their
 original con tract with Post
 master General Brown for carrying
 the mail from El Paso
 to San Antonio Now one
 Senator pro poses that it
 shall not bc above 70
 000 Mr HALE That is
 by consent of the con
 tractors thernsclves Mr WIGFALL The
 Senator s is sufficient that
 tho contractors have agreed to
 take IL I suppose if
 t hey could not get
 anything else they would rather
 have an old suit of
 clothes They have becn kept
 here hammering at the doors
 of Congress for some considerable
 time past ever since I
 have been in the Senate
 at least and they have
 never been able to cet
 any compensation out of the
 Post Offce Department at all
 The Post Office Department was
 opposed to them Mr Holt
 had determined to break up
 the linc General I Twigrrs
 was dctcrmincd it should not
 be broken up They chose
 to take tbc hazards and
 carry it and Mr Holtdetermined
 that they should not be
 paid Finally Congress is about
 to adjourn and they are
 waiting now to take ariYthing
 they can get I suppose
 thev would take 70 000
 they would take ihey would
 take 50 000 they wouldtake
 40 000 they would take
 20 000 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 15 General with whom this
 contractwag made and who refused
 to pay this money Mr
 WIGFALL The contract was made
 with Postmaster General Brown and
 Postmaster General Holt refused to
 pay Mr CAMERON 1 Mr
 I loit Mr WIGFALL We
 differ in our estimate of
 him Mr CAMERON 1 did
 not rely much on Governor
 Brown while he lived but
 as he is dead I
 shall say nothing about him
 I think there were a
 great many errors in his
 administration and I think the
 administration of the Post Offce
 Depart ment under Mr Holt
 was one of the ablest
 wisest and most honest in
 tuy rec ollection He did
 all he could to cut
 down the enormous expend itures
 of his predecessor and showed
 that he desired to administer
 that Department as it ought
 to be administercd within its
 income The proposition of the
 Senator from New Hampshire to
 confine the allowance to 70
 000 with the consent of
 the applicants is an argument
 to rny mind that they
 are willing to take anythino
 they can get I look
 upon this as one of
 theclaims that are constantly upon
 us They come here asking
 several hundred thousand dollars and
 the Senator from New Hampshire
 who says he un derstands
 the case but 1 suppose
 he understands it very little
 more than 1 do or
 the Senator from Texas agrees
 to make it 70 000
 I propose to make it
 40 000 and look upon
 it as a gratuity I
 am sure they have been
 paid all they ought to
 have been paid under the
 contract if Mr Holt so
 reported and I believe he
 did It is always ungracious
 to talk against these private
 claims and I believe some
 of these gen tlcmcn belong
 to my 0 vn State
 but I am satisfied that
 if you commence by giving
 them what they ask or
 anything like it others will
 come on next year and
 we shall have millions to
 pay for the misdeeds of
 Postmaster General Brown and the
 Repartmentduringhis administration To gratify my
 friends I will say no
 more Mr CLARK I an
 I opposed to this claim
 I am opposed not only
 to allowing these parties 60
 000 but I am opposed
 to allowing them 40 000
 or any sum until they
 put their claim and their
 proof in a different position
 from what I understand it
 to be now The claim
 which these gentlemen make it
 seems to me stands in
 the I I do not
 outset upon suspicious circumstances know
 but that they may have
 a meritorious claim I do
 not say but they have
 I do not know but
 they are abused men But
 tho point that makc is
 this they came to Congress
 asking to be paid för
 servic es performed but they
 do not state what those
 services were so that we
 may know and pass intelligently
 upon the amount we are
 to pay and there is
 not a Senator here I
 think from the in quirics
 that I have addressed to
 some of them that can
 tell me the amount that
 is to be paid un
 less it is limited to
 40 000 or 60 000
 and not to 00 over
 that lieve it would take
 40 000 I did not
 understand it to be so
 and to my surprise I
 found that the Department allowed
 him one hundred and eigh
 teen or one hundred and
 nineteen thousand dol I examined
 that claim at two different
 ses sions Ido not believe
 half that arnount was due
 him and I do not
 mean to be entrapped in
 that way again if I
 can help it Then again
 sir we have got another
 matter Here is the resolution
 in favor of George E
 Fisher George E Fisher made
 a claim upon this Government
 in the first instance for
 about sixteen thousand dollars The
 Department or whoever had it
 in charge allowed him about
 eight thousand dollars He then
 came to Congress again and
 they doubled it to 16
 000 He pursued the claim
 and they doubled it ag
 n to 32 000 He
 still kept on and they
 brought it to 66 000
 At the last session my
 friend from Rhode Island Mr
 SIMMONS a man of the
 best intentioné in the world
 introduced a resolution that that
 claim after they had o
 ot 66 000 arising out
 of 16 000 should be
 settleä on principles of justice
 and equity and referred it
 to the Department They had
 got 66 000 it went
 to the War Department and
 that Department allowed 66 000
 more making it 132 000
 altogether on the principles of
 justice and equity Sensation in
 the galleries T hc House
 of Representatives have repealed that
 res olution this session and
 it has been before your
 committee and they will report
 that it shall be I
 may have voted for it
 but I repealed here will
 give my vote in a
 moment to repeal it and
 I have made up my
 mind that I will never
 cive a vote hereafter for
 any bill that does not
 state on its face what
 is demanded of the Senate
 The Senator from Ohio cannot
 tell me what these parties
 ask under this bill or
 how much it amounts to
 nor can anybody that I
 have found Now I am
 willing to examine these gentlemen
 s claim Let them propose
 it here let them state
 what they have done and
 what they claim to be
 paid for and I will
 examine it and if it
 is found to be a
 just claim I will vote
 to pay it but Ido
 not want to vote these
 sums in the dark I
 do not want to vote
 even the 40 000 proposed
 by the Senator from Pennsylvania
 Let us act intelli gently
 let us know what we
 are doing and not Mr
 President we have recently had
 some very ascfUl experience on
 that subiect in the sway
 of teaching Senators lessons We
 passed here I think at
 the last session a bill
 for the relief of Arthur
 Edwards Co to pay them
 for services performed and what
 was the result of it
 We had a veto oc
 the President we had to
 amend and cut down the
 bill and I think some
 gentiemcn felt a little ashamed
 of the part they had
 taken in that measure That
 was pay for actual service
 Then i aff9in afterwards we
 had a bill or resolution
 for the relief of De
 Groot Co That did not
 ask pay for actual service
 but asked that the claim
 might be settled on principles
 of justicc and equity I
 remember that I took partin
 that discussion and i do
 not feel ashamed of the
 part I took in the
 discussion but I do feel
 very much ashamed of the
 allowance that was rnade under
 it and would they would
 take they would take be
 glad to vote to repeal
 that to day and will
 give I do not see
 any justice in fixing it
 but as they my vote
 for its repeal the first
 opportunity I get I remember
 that the Senator from Louisiana
 Mr have agreed to 70
 000 I am willing to
 fix tllat limit bat I
 do not think the Senator
 from Penn SLIDELL at that
 time moved to amend that
 reso sylvania who admits that
 he does not know any
 i liltion so as to
 provide that the amount al
 owed thing about the facts
 should insist upon this pro
 should not exceed It had
 come from the crustean rule
 of possibly they may House
 of Representativcs at the close
 of the ses be entitled
 to 100 000 am willing
 to take sion and the
 friends of the measure were
 anxious be obliged to rescind
 and repeal the bills when
 we have passed them or
 have them vetoed because we
 did not understand what we
 were about This claim may
 be a just claim for
 aught I know I make
 this statement The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr FOSTER in the chair
 The Chair feels called upon
 toarrest discussion The hour of
 one arrived the special order
 must come up being thctlnfinished
 business of yesterday Mr WADE
 I move to suspend the
 special order and take the
 vote on this joint resolution
 I believe we are about
 to take a vote That
 is all I ask that
 there be a vote taken
 The PRESIDING OFFICER It and
 seconded that the special order
 of the day which is
 the tariff bill be postponed
 in order that discussion may
 proceed on the joint resolution
 before the Senate Mr SIMMONS
 If the Senate will vote
 immediately I will consent to
 Ict the special order o
 o by without a motion
 Mr KING I will move
 to lay this claim on
 the table Mr CLARK I
 will simply say that am
 will ing to forbear any
 remarks I might have to
 make in order to enable
 the tariff bill to come
 up or to let the
 vote be taken on this
 at once without any further
 discussion if the friends of
 the measure desire it Mr
 WIGFALL 1 so PRESIDING OFFICER
 The mo tion is to
 postpone the special order of
 the day for the purpose
 of continuing tho discuseion Mr
 SIMMONS ment but let it
 go over informally for the
 purpose of taking a vote
 Mt MT ADE By common
 consent we can take a
 vote on this matter now
 The PRESIDING OFFICER A motion
 is made by the Senator
 from New York to lay
 the that it should go
 through and not go back
 again joint resolution on the
 tablc That will come in
 and say it shall not
 be more t o the
 House of Representatives and we
 resisted I its order after
 this is disposed of The
 question Mr WADE 1 hope
 we shall have the vote
 Mr CAMERON I did not
 admit that I knew that
 proposition it was defeated and
 the bill is now on
 postponing the special order Mr
 SIMMONS I suppose if the
 motion to integrity and the
 intelligence of the Postmaster of
 the bill I had made
 that i did not be
 lay on the table fails
 you will not get a
 votc 1861 Mr WADE Yes
 we shall THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 The PRESIDINGOFFICER The question is
 on the motion to postpone
 the special order for the
 purpose of continuing the discussion
 on this bill Mr Mr
 WIGFALL Voting on it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Senate can
 vote to continue the bill
 but they cannot order the
 vote to be taken if
 any Senator wishes to dis
 cuss it It is moved
 and seeonded that the special
 order of the day being
 the tariff bill bepostponed in
 order to continue the joint
 resolution before the Senate Mr
 DOOLITTLE 1 understood there was
 a proposition to let the
 special order lie over in
 formally by unanimous consent The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair un
 derstood that to be objected
 to inasmuch as other motions
 were interposed Mr SIMMONS The
 Senator from New York moved
 to lay the joint resolution
 on the table and we
 have two or three motions
 I hope we shall go
 on with the special order
 Mr CAMERON I hope our
 friends here x vill not
 postpone so important a bill
 as the tariff bill for
 the purpose of discussing this
 doubtful ques tion The motion
 may postpone the tariff bill
 for the who c day
 It loses its place by
 this vote and will require
 another motion to get it
 up hope the Senator from
 Ohio will not put us
 in this po sition Mr
 CLINGMAN I hope sve may
 have fifteen minu tes Suppose
 by general consent we post
 pone the tariff bill for
 fifteen minutes If we are
 not done with this matter
 then that can come up
 Mr CAMERON What 10 we
 gain by that Mr CLINGMAN
 we may get this out
 of the way Mr CAMERON
 There is no haste with
 it It can wait until
 to morrcr v Mr BIGLER
 Let us have the yeas
 and nays on the motion
 to postpone The yeas and
 nays were ordered MI WADE
 I am as much in
 favor of the tariff as
 the Senator from Pennsylvania but
 when a thing has been
 discussed and taken the whole
 morning hour and when I
 know that if I call
 it up again we shall
 have to go through the
 same discussion again I think
 when we are so near
 the vote on it we
 ought to take it I
 think it will forward business
 and forward your tariff bill
 also Now one word about
 this joint resolution Gen tlemen
 say I cannot t oll_
 how much is due not
 pretend to do so but
 the bill is guarded at
 every point These men have
 performed certain services and the
 Postmaster General has all the
 vouchers to show exactly how
 much is due The PRESIDINGOFFICER
 The Chairwill suggest to the
 Senator that the question is
 on the motion to postpone
 which does not involve the
 merits of either of the
 bills Mr WADE I wish
 for but one moment to
 say that I do not
 think there can be any
 doubt that a just conclusion
 can be come to on
 this bill pro vided your
 executive offcers are honest If
 they are not I cannot
 warrant you anything and you
 cannot do business then If
 they will magnify a 16
 000 claim to 130 000
 it only shows that they
 do not act properly Mr
 GRIMES 1 should like if
 we are going into a
 discussion on this motion If
 so I shall follow the
 Senator from Ohio Mr WADE
 I am not going into
 it but the Senator from
 New Hampshirc Mr CLARK said
 1 could not tell how
 much was due I admit
 that because there is a
 contract for t his service
 and the bill leaves it
 to the Department to pay
 accord ing to the contract
 for the service actually ren
 dercd and they have all
 the vouchers before them to
 show what that was and
 I dare trust them with
 that That is all Mr
 I RUMBULL I want to
 say one word as to
 the considerations i vhicll will
 control my vote in this
 matter without expressing any opin
 ion as to the Giddings
 claim whether I shall vote
 for or against it My
 experience in the Sen ate
 since I have been here
 is that we have lost
 a great deal more time
 in these disputes about which
 bill should have the precedence
 than has table That is
 a test vote you cannot
 discuss it you are bound
 to come directly to a
 vote I we proceed with
 this bill We shall have
 a vote at once and
 it w ould have taken
 place long ago if the
 Senator from PennsylVania had not
 interposed with his tariff I
 think ho will never get
 tariff bill through by such
 a courge of policy as
 that There was nothing to
 do but take the yeas
 and nays when he began
 protesting here in regard to
 the tariff No debate was
 in order the motion was
 to lay this joint resolution
 on the table It would
 have been a test vote
 and decided very soon Nosv
 it is not because am
 opposed to the measure of
 which the Senator from Rhode
 Island has charge hut because
 I think itthe better way
 to dispatch the business of
 the Senate to hold on
 to a mcasure when you
 have got it in a
 position where you are ready
 to vote upon it and
 I t l link we
 shall find the tariff bill
 will sooner pass if we
 adopt that course and hold
 on to it for I
 shall vote with the Senator
 from Pennsyl vania to hold
 on to it When we
 have it under con sideration
 butl think we had better
 get rid of this joint
 resolution now and not take
 upto morrow with it Mr
 CAMERON I am always willing
 to be lectured by my
 friends and as the gentleman
 is with me on the
 tariff I am willing that
 he should say what he
 has said but I think
 it was not in very
 good taste notwithstanding it came
 from hirn This bill occupied
 the time allotted by the
 rules for its consideration The
 time came by the clock
 v rhen the tariff bill
 was in order and by
 the proper rules of the
 Senate that moment the hammer
 should have come down and
 the tariff bill should have
 been talccn up The true
 course in my view different
 frotn that of the Senator
 from Illinois is to take
 everything in order When you
 fix a particular bill for
 a particular hour on a
 certain day when that time
 comes take it up and
 dispose of it One good
 rule in business is to
 do one thing at a
 time and if we had
 fol lowed that rule in
 this case fThen we occupied
 all the time allotted to
 this bill we should have
 stopped and gone to the
 other Besides that tho motion
 of the Senator from Ohio
 is to postpone the tariff
 bill for the purpose of
 disposing of this That postponement
 puts it out of the
 way and puts it beyond
 the reach of its order
 If It was a mere
 motion to let it go
 by common consent and takc
 this up I should have
 made no objection but when
 there is danger of losing
 this important bill I cannot
 stand here quiet notwithstanding the
 gentleman says he is going
 to vote with me I
 have no great objection to
 his giving me a lecture
 The lecture I take in
 good part but I do
 not ap prove of the
 reasons The PRESIDING OFFICER Thequestion

 that the amount of the

 consequentiål damagej of which testimony
 has been produced that the
 surn is very large The
 Senator therefore wili perceive that
 he is It is 159
 530 60 agcording to ihe
 mistaken rcport of the comff
 ittee upon whose recommend anon
 we are asked to act
 here loa irp out ihc
 se consequential damages to which
 the Senator frÖm Texas has
 referred Now the question I
 wint to propound to this
 committee is this after giving
 us this report and saying
 that there is due to
 Mr Giddings from this Government
 directly and with out rcgard
 to consequential damages 159 530
 60 and acting upon the
 principle whicb they have attempted
 to enforce upon us here
 to day that we should
 regard the justice and equitH
 flEie claim solely and not
 its amount how iS it
 that they mw come in
 and proposc to pay Mr
 Giddings Only 70 000 Why
 do they ignore this amount
 ot 100 000 which they
 say is justly düé to
 him and yet they are
 unwilling to pay it Mr
 HEMPHILL 1 move to amend
 the amendment b inserting the
 words The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chairwill state to the Senator
 that a motion to amend
 can not now be entertained
 as the question is on
 an amendment to an amendment
 Mr HEMPHILL I will state
 the a mcndment I intend
 to offer It will be
 to this effect The joint
 resolution now reads 6 That
 George I I Giddings be
 paid for services on route
 8076 5 The amendment that
 I vv ill offer will
 make it read That George
 H Giddings be paid for
 services on that portion of
 route 8076 which lies between
 El Paso and San Antonio
 in Texas That would leave
 out all this other matter
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on the amendment to
 the amendment The amendment to
 the amendment w Us rejected
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 now is on the amendment
 offered by the Senator from
 New Hampshire to inscrt the
 words iot oxcecding in amount
 70 000 The amendment was
 agreed to Mr BRAGG It
 seems to me that with
 that amendment the resolution bears
 a contradiction upon its face
 The joint resolution provides That
 George II Giddings be paid
 for services on route 8026
 in accordance with the order
 of Postmaster Generat A V
 Brown of ptöljer 23 1858
 after deducti what where there
 IS a motion madc to
 lay it on the Pennsylvania
 to the amendment of the
 Senator ik ever has been
 received thereon up to June
 90 18611 922 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 15 Now what
 was that order I have
 tbe report of the committee
 before mc and iL appears
 that that order upon the
 new arraiigement then made by
 Mr Brown with these persons
 was to this effect ter
 General Brown dated 23d ot
 October 1858 whereby the service
 was discontinued from El Påso
 to Fort Yuma but was
 increased to a wcekly serviee
 fronrFort Yuma to of junction
 with the great overland mail
 to CaJitOrnia at the compensation
 iör this new and improv
 ed service of 196 448
 per year the service to
 Commence 1st January So sir
 the joint resolution as it
 came from theGHouse and as
 it has been press ed
 here day after day _
 proposed to pay Giddings the
 sum of 196 448 a
 year according to the order
 of Post master General Brown
 made on the 23d of
 Octo ber 1858 and the
 Senator from Iowa has already
 told us what the committee
 stated that sum would amount
 to continued up to the
 month of July 1861 that
 it would amount to one
 hundred and fifty thousand and
 some dollars We have had
 this resolution pressed day after
 day before the Senate for
 the allowance of that amount
 upon the basis which the
 committee have made here and
 upon a calculation which they
 gave at the end of
 their report that it will
 amount to that sum We
 were told this morning by
 the honor able Senator from
 New Hampshire that tlkese parties
 were willing to take six
 months pay in full What
 is that Why sir that
 would amount to 98 224
 being half the amount due
 to them according to the
 order of Postmaster General Brown
 of Oct6ber 23 1858 which
 was the basis upon which
 the resolution says the Department
 shall settle this claim We
 want to know what that
 will amount to and after
 a good deal of de
 bate on the subject at
 last the honorable Senator from
 Now Hampshire tells us that
 these parties will be content
 W ith 70 000 if
 we will agrec to put
 that in the bill Now
 Mr President it is a
 little extraordinary it strikes me
 and it goes to show
 how this kind of legislation
 gets through that after this
 reso lution is pressed here
 day by day involving an
 amount clear upon its face
 according to the re port
 of the committee of a
 hundred and fifty nine thousand
 and some hundred dollars then
 we are told further that
 the parties will be content
 with 98 224 and then
 after further discussion when the
 friends of the bill are
 pressed to let us know
 t he amount really involved
 we are told that the
 panics would be content with
 70 000 This is a
 wonderful falling off in a
 very short tirne I confess
 for myself that I am
 not at all satis fied
 about this matter It strikes
 me as very ex traordinary
 when parties come here and
 claim 159 000 and their
 claim is pressed day by
 day that thoy should first
 fall and agree to accept
 98 000 and then in
 a few minutes afterwards when
 the matter is further pressed
 that they should agree to
 take 70 000 I want
 to know really what is
 the amount due what it
 is that these par tics
 arc entitled to what they
 will be content with I
 arn willing to vote whatever
 may be really duc to
 them but I am not
 willing to vote in the
 dark I have not ycl
 heard from any gentleman as
 to the serviccs pcrformcd by
 these parties and as to
 the amount they are really
 entitled to It seems that
 therc is to be an
 amount hereafter to be ascertained
 in the way of damages
 Mr WIGFALL Thejointresolution excludes damages
 Mt BRAGG The report proposes
 to put this matter on
 the ground that they had
 madc a con tract and
 carried this mail at 196
 000 a year and that
 inasmuch as they performed the
 trips al though the Postmaster
 General directed a discon tinuance
 of part of the service
 the Government would pay for
 what had been done and
 continue the service at that
 ratc up to June 30
 1861 Then they reduced the
 amount to six months pay
 as I have stated and
 then down to and how
 much lower they will reduce
 it I should like to
 know Mr HALE It seems
 to me that the ground
 assumed by the Senator from
 North Carolina and my colleague
 goes upon the supposition that
 we have no use Of
 any accounting officers that the
 five hundred or a thousand
 accounting officers thal we have
 at the other cnd of
 the avenue are of uo
 use that we must do
 all their v york here
 The bill sends this matter
 there to be settled on
 principles of equity and justice
 That is all Now before
 I sit down I wish
 to say another word that
 I am sorry to be
 under the necessity of I
 am told that my colleague
 spokc in saying relation to
 a bill that was passed
 at the last ses Sion
 and suggested that some of
 us who took some partin
 it might regretitnow He seemed
 to think that in that
 matter there had been some
 unwise and injudicious action I
 m vas assailed for my
 action on that bill by
 a scurrilous and infamous sheet
 in Boston Mr CLARK My
 colleague will allow me to
 say that I did not
 for moment advert to him
 and I am sorry that
 anybody should so under stand
 me Mr HALE I did
 not hear the remark butl
 so told While I am
 up I will say in
 rc gard to that bill
 that if there is anybody
 on God s earth who
 has any repentance to indulge
 in on account of it
 I am not that one
 I acted on that matter
 with intelligence and the integrity
 I pro fess and I
 have never seen occasion to
 retract a single word that
 I uttered or a single
 act that I did in
 regard to it Mr CLARK
 I do not know that
 it is neces sary that
 I should repeat to the
 Senate that I had not
 the least allusion to my
 colleague or anything that hc
 said I have too much
 confidencc in him to suppose
 that he would actin the
 way indicated I want to
 make one remark in regard
 to the sug gestion of
 my colleague now that I
 and others seem to think
 we have no use for
 any accounting officers at the
 other end of thc avenue
 My ficulty is not of
 that kind I think they
 are of some service but
 what I want of those
 accounting of ficers is to
 state the account before we
 vote and then let us
 vote after they have stated
 it and not vote first
 and state afterwards Mr FESSENDEN
 Allow me to make asug
 gestion to my friend from
 New Hampshire The accounting officers
 act very well when they
 state accounts under legal provisions
 as they are bound to
 do but there is hardly
 an instance within my recollection
 since 1 have been herc
 where you have abandoned legal
 principles and allowed them to
 settle an account on principles
 of equity and justice as
 you call it thus giving
 them an unlim ited discretion
 that we have not had
 cause to re pent of
 it and will never vote
 for another bill giving that
 authority MI CLARK Is it
 in order now to movc
 to amend the bill Jurther
 The PRESIDING OFFICER It is
 still open to amendment B
 lr CLARK I move to
 amend it by adding thc
 following proviso Provided That the
 Baid amount shall be received
 by the said Giddings in
 full payment of all services
 perförmcd on said route and
 in full satisfaction of any
 claim for dam acyes arising
 out of any discontinuance of
 any part of the service
 on the same I offer
 this amendment so that if
 we pass this joint resolution
 it may settle the whole
 matter and he havc no
 further claim for any services
 or damages Mr WIGFALL and
 others That is already I
 with Mr CLARK I was
 not aware of it draw
 the amendment if the provision
 is in the joint resolution
 already Mr HEMPHILL Now 1
 move the amend take their
 seats and come to order
 and the busi ness of
 the Senate must be suspended
 until that is done Mr
 BRAGG 1 admit Mr President
 that the amendment is not
 a vital or material one
 If the Senacor from Texas
 had listened to what I
 said when I made a
 few remarks before I think
 he would have scen the
 propriety of the amendment that
 I offer I stated that
 these words applied to a
 mo_dification of the contract which
 Postmaster General made at that
 time and by which these
 contractors were allowed for weekly
 service over this route 196
 000 a year and the
 report and the resolution proposed
 to settle this matter at
 the Department in accordance with
 that modification of the contract
 which is called in the
 resolution an order but on
 reference to the report the
 fact appears to be that
 that order was a modification
 of the contra discontinuing the
 service on part of the
 route and increasing theservice on
 another If these words remain
 in the bill now they
 part contradict what follows because
 the Department cannot settle on
 that basis As I understand
 the provision now it is
 simply to pay to these
 par ties a specified sum
 in lieu of all the
 amounts they are entitled to
 under their contract and for
 dams It is to be
 received in full ages upon
 this route Mr HEMPHILL The
 contract of Postmas ter General
 Brown of October 1858 allowed
 him for the whole service
 between San Antonio and El
 Paso and between Fort Yuma
 and San Diego 196 458a
 year On the 14th of
 April 1859 Post master General
 Holt through his Assistant Mr
 Dundas reduced the service between
 San An tonio and El
 Paso from weekly to semi
 monthly and also between San
 Diego and Fort Yuma in
 the same way reducing the
 whole pay then to 120
 000 Afterwards on the 4th
 of February ment which I
 suggested some time since in
 line three after the word
 on to inscrt that ur
 tion ofthe and in line
 four after the word SIX
 lying between El Paso and
 San An I to insert
 tonio so that it will
 read That George H Giddings
 bc paid for services on
 that portion of thc route
 nunibcr 8076 lying between EI
 Paso and San Antonio c
 The amendment was agreed to
 Mr BRAGG I move to
 strike out the words in
 accordance with the order of
 Postmaster Gen t eral A
 V Brown of October 23
 1858 because 1860 that portion
 of the line which lies
 between San Diego and Fort
 Yuma was cut off entirely
 and 28 695 taken from
 the compeösation of 120 000
 leaving then the contract price
 for the service between El
 Paso and San Antonio 91
 405 As the joint resolution
 now stands he is to
 be paid for the trips
 that he performed on that
 por tion of the route
 according to the contract price
 of 91 405 If he
 performed the service for six
 months as I understand that
 a proposition has been made
 to pay for six months
 service he would be paid
 one half the amount of
 the annual pay so that
 it would not amount to
 more than 45 000 It
 may amount to something in
 addi tion but the idea
 which has been advanccd here
 that there will be an
 extravagant allowance cx ists altogether
 in thc imagination of Senators
 Tho amendment of M 1
 BRAGG was rejected The PRESIDING
 OFFICER If no other amendment
 be proposed the question is
 Shall the amendrilents which have
 been made be en grossed

 as to make the insert

 hemp 35 per ton IVIr
 SEWARD I wish to ask
 what the pres ent dutv
 is on unmanufactured hemp Mr
 SIMMONS Twenty four per cent
 Mr HALE How much a
 ton Mr ShMMONS About 50
 a ton This proposes 35
 dollars Mr POLK I wish
 to call the attention of
 the erly the value in
 market of Russian hemp was
 about double that of Manilla
 hemp and t pre sume
 it is so still This
 bill came from the House
 of Representatives with a duty
 of 30 on Russian and
 150n Manilla hemp The committee
 thought the Russian hemp ought
 to pay 35 and so
 they put 5 more on
 it and they thought ita
 very low duty We did
 not alter the other hemp
 duties at all supposing that
 they were made on a
 fair esti mate of the
 market value of the article
 Mr GWIN 1 observe that
 the duty is in I
 creased 5 a ton by
 the select committee beyond what
 the other House made it
 What was the reason for
 the increase Mr SIMMONS I
 have just stated perhaps the
 Senator did not hear that
 the committee thought 30 a
 ton on RuS ian hemp
 was not near a revenue
 duty not more than 15
 per dent and we thought
 we could get a little
 more duty on it and
 that is the reason why
 we proposed to add 5
 more Mr POLK i am
 not familiar with this Ma
 nilla hemp at all The
 hemp that I am familiar
 with mostly is American hemp
 I wish to know whether
 the proportion of duty on
 Russian hemp for instance at
 35 per ton is the
 same as that on Manilla
 hemp at 15 per ton
 or about the same Mr
 SIMMONS very neu 1 should
 think I have not looked
 at the prices current of
 hemp for a number of
 years but I dare say
 if you look in former
 tariffs which were based on
 the foreign prices you will
 find about that proportion I
 know what price Russian hemp
 used to be but I
 am not familiar with it
 lately The committee thought 30
 a ton was not near
 as much as the present
 law and that we ought
 to raise it to what
 revenue we could fairly get
 from it Tho amendment was
 agreed to The ncxt amendment
 was in section fifteen to
 strike out from lines seventeen
 to twenty one in elusive
 the following vords Weighing not
 over one pound and a
 halfper square yard or imported
 under the designation of gunny
 cloth or any other appellation
 2 cents per square yard
 weighing over one pound and
 a half per square yard
 And to inscrt in lieu
 thereof Valued at less than
 10 cents per square yard
 And in line twenty two
 to strike out 2 cents
 and insert 1 cent and
 after the word pound in
 the same line to insert
 the words over 10 cents
 per square yard 2 cents
 per pound So that the
 clause will read On cotton
 bagging ot any other manufacture
 not other wise provided iör
 suttable the uses to which
 cotton bazgiut is app jcd
 whether composed in whole or
 in part of hernp jute
 or tiax or any other
 Inateriai valued at less than
 10 cents per square yard
 I cent per pound over
 10 cents per square yard
 2 cents per pound Mr
 SIMMONS ldesire to modify the
 duty on the first description
 of bago ing by inserting
 5 do not think i
 cent instead of 1 cent
 a pound i cent is
 quitc a revenue tariff Mr
 POLK At what line will
 that amend menl of the
 Senator come in Mr SIMMONS
 In the twenty second line
 I desire to put the
 duty at 1 cent a
 pound in stead of I
 cent The amendment to the
 amendment was agreed to and
 theamendment as amended was adopted
 Mr POLK I should like
 to catl Lho attention of
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 to another ques I have
 received a letter which states
 that tion under the tariff
 as it now stands they
 have away of introducing hemp
 in winches as thc letter
 calls I believe it is
 hemp manufactured to a cer
 it tain point thus escaping
 thc duty I should like
 to inquire of the Senator
 from Rhode Island whether the
 duty on yarns 4 cents
 a pound on yarns will
 embrace all the stages of
 manufac It ture from the
 raw article up to cordage
 Senator from Rhode Island to
 that section Mr SIMMONS did
 not hear the Senator provides
 first that unmanufactured hemp shall
 II pay a duty of
 35 dollars per ton and
 nexr that say in what
 form that hemp came Was
 it in winches Maniila and
 Dthet hemps of India sha
 l pay Mr POLK Yes
 sir 1 think that is
 the ex I wish to
 know if the section I
 means that Manilla hemp shall
 pay only 15 a I
 pression Mr SIMMONS The tell
 as well ton when other
 shall pay 35 I never
 saw any of it as
 can IV lr SiMMONS That
 is what it means Mr
 POLK would ask the Senator
 whether The next amendment of
 sectioi seventeen line five to
 strikeout tbewofd and the yoi
 d iC plate occurs a
 second time to sti ike
 out the wo rå crown
 and after the word Cylindéi
 to strike out thewords and
 other and insert or broad
 so that the clause will
 read First on rough plate
 cylinder Or broad wind oW
 glä ssy not exceeding ten
 by fifteen cent pensqgare foot
 Mr SIMMONS 1 that per
 square fooC As it now
 is a prad tiéal reduction
 of the duties on the
 larger sizes Of glass We
 did not think of it
 at the time we were
 redüci ng the duty bv
 On the _large sizes of
 a higher cost we desire
 to have a duty I
 cent square foot as it
 was in the original bill
 Mr G WIN I desire
 to move an amendment td
 the whole of that Section
 When this snbject came up
 in the select committee we
 agreed üPdö an amendment to
 the seetion on some foets
 that were brought before the
 committee by myself I received
 a letter from one of
 the largest import ing houses
 in California on this subject
 6f the duty on glass
 in which it was stated
 I will add that our
 State consurnes at present foreign
 glass only the American being
 u neuited to ih quality
 and owing to its inferiorpackages
 totally unfitför transportation over ou
 r mountains and through our
 valleys and you can appreciate
 the injustice of compelling us
 to pay eastern roan ufaéturers
 higu prices for an artiOle
 go objectionabke I brought the
 subject befQre the Select commit
 tee and an amendment Was
 agreed upon in that committee
 I obtained a copy of
 that amendment and transmitted it
 to one of these gentlemen
 to lay before not only
 his own house but all
 thöse that were interested in
 itx and I received in
 answer a letter from which
 I read the following Your
 esteemed favox of the 30th
 ultimo has just reached me
 coverin r the proöosed amen

 ss I have telegraphed to
 you th åtthe rates to
 be reported by the select
 comrnittee are very satis factory
 Cbey arc more iä vorabie
 to our State thgn to
 par ties on this side
 as our principal consumpt ion
 is of srnail glass Our
 objection was not So much
 to payincr an inerease duty
 as it was to have
 our busil iess destroyea by
 tion The proposed rates will
 not destroy it Thén again
 having sent a copy of
 the bill as printed I
 recciVed another letter from the
 firm in which they state
 that Upon examining thc feport
 of the Senate select com
 mittee find the rates upon
 window glass largély advanced above
 the figures quoted in your
 esteemcd favor of the 30th
 uitnno For instance the printed
 report places sixes up to
 ten by fifteen at cent
 per square foot your letter
 cent I will not go
 on with the reading of
 this letter This is a
 subject of the greatest importance
 to us because we do
 not consume any American glass
 in California American glass is
 not packed so that it
 cun be carried through the
 interior of our country This
 duty as it was in
 the original bill and as
 it has been changed since
 it left the select committee
 is prohibitory I propose to
 offer pre cisely the amendment
 that agreed on the select
 committee to that whole I
 will send to the Chair
 The chairman of the select
 committee will recollect that I
 took a copy of it
 at the time I desiro
 to have the action of
 the select committee agreed to
 by the Senate The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question now before
 the Senate is 01 the
 amendment which has been reported
 from the select committee Mr
 G WIN move my amendment
 as a sub It is
 in fact what stitute for
 the whole section the committee
 agreed on originally The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The proposed amendment will
 be read for information The
 Secretary read it to strike
 out all of the seventeenth
 section after the enacting clause
 and to insert the following
 in lieu thereof That from
 and after the day and

 and all crown plate or
 polished and all other Window
 glass weighing over one hundred
 pounds per one hundred square
 feet shah pay an additional
 duty propor tionaté to that
 here_in provided for glass Of
 that weight The PRESIDING OFFICER
 This amend ment to strike
 out the seventeenth section and
 in sert the matter which
 has been read is not
 in order for consideration until
 the seventeenth sec ti on
 has been perfected by acting
 on such amend ments as
 have been or may be
 offered to it The first
 question now is on the
 amendment to the seventeenth section
 offered by the select com
 mittee Mr BIGLER 1 desire
 to in reference to this
 section that I thinlethe Senator
 from Cal ifornia is right
 to some extent We had
 this proposition as he offers
 it before the committee and
 at the time it seemed
 entirely satisfactory but subsequently we
 were called upon by the
 manu facturers of glass and
 show h that in reference
 to this first article having
 reduced it to cent we
 had made a serious mistake
 and that in fact our
 ratewas too low I do
 not now recollect whether the
 Senator from California was present
 at that meeting or not
 I presume he was not
 but I think a quorum
 of the committee was present
 I know I voted expressly
 to raise this rate from
 cent to cent Furthermore at
 the time and since man
 ufiicturers have been insisting that
 we should raise it to
 1 cent and the Senator
 from Rhode Island has suggested
 an amendmcntaccordingly There föi e
 in reference to this imported
 glass there v zas a
 difference between the importers and
 the man ufacturers those represented
 by the Senator from California
 insisting on cent while the
 manufac turers wanted 1 cent
 We fixed the rate at
 cent M impression is we
 had better let it rest
 there he PRESIDING OFFICER The
 first ques tion is on
 the amendment offered by the
 Senator from Rhode Islahd from
 the select committee to this
 section Mr SIMMONS I stated
 when I was up be
 fore that we had agreed
 to put this at cent
 1 did it after conference
 with some persons inter ested
 Since then I have seen
 a great many of these
 men and they tell me
 this enlargement of the size
 which is very considerable has
 a great deal td do
 with it and cent is
 a practical reduc lion of
 the ratc of duty that
 was fixed by the I
 believe myself that this sizc
 of from H o use
 ten to fifteen inches should
 pay a duty of 1
 cent a foot Before it
 was ten by twelve They
 in sistcd upon having the
 highest schedule on the large
 size increased I told them
 I would consent to increase
 it to I cent and
 I would move it but
 I would insist upon keeping
 the other schedules as we
 had reported them on the
 larger sizes But this is
 a kind of glass that
 they have been makinc r
 in this country More than
 halt of the furnaces are
 now closed up and I
 think I cent a square
 foot is as little duty
 on that as I ever
 recollect beföre tn any tariff
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The question
 is on the nmendment offered
 by the Senator from Rhode
 Island to the amendment of
 the select com in it
 tee T hc amendment to
 the amendment was agreed to
 and the arnci dment as
 amended was adopted Mr GWIN
 What is the question before
 the Senate is it on
 my substitute The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The amend ment offered by
 the Senator from California the
 Chair statcd at tbc time
 was not now in order
 for consideration inasmuch as the
 atuendment pro posed to strike
 out the seventeenth section and
 in sert what the Senator
 from California sent to the
 Chair and was read The
 seventeenth section proposed to be
 stricken out is open to
 amendment wish to oppose That
 amendment is an absolute prohibition
 of the importation Of these
 articles I have it from
 into the State that I
 represent It was agreed authority
 that 1 cannot question upon
 in select committee on information
 brought before that committee by
 those engaged in the importation
 of this article to reduce
 the duty to cent Afterwards
 without my ever hearing ihat
 the committee had met again
 it was amended In order
 that there might and the
 bifl reported not be any
 mistake about it I sent
 an abstract of precisely what
 the committee had agreed upon
 I sent precisely the action
 of the committee l had
 a copy made by our
 clerk and the answer was
 that it was satisfactory Subsequently
 when thc bill was printed
 I found it was changed
 from what was aoreed upon
 in the select committee at
 what I thought was the
 last meeting of that committcc
 My proposition is to amend
 it pre cisely as it
 was agreed upon in the
 selectcomtmttee when wc last met
 I have the very words
 from the clerk as it
 was drawn up Now this
 is an increase over the
 duty reported from cent to
 I cent The committee agreed
 that it should be cent
 I have reason to believe
 that this duty of i
 per cent is prohibitory We
 never import any American glass
 in California but this duty
 is so high that it
 will be prohibitory at least
 on this It is not
 so packed that we can
 particular glass consume it in
 our country I hope therefore
 that the amendment proposed by
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 will not be agreed to
 Mr TEN EYCK Mr President
 the manu facture of the
 commonest kind of glass is
 a busi ness in which
 many of my constituents are
 en gaged From information that
 I have received from the
 manufacturers I am satisfied that
 the amendment as now proposed
 by the chairman of the
 select committee to raise the
 duty upon this common window
 glass from of a cent
 per square foot to I
 cent per square foot is
 a matter of abso lute
 necessity for the protection of
 a very large number of
 persons who are engaged in
 that pur suit The amendment
 that is now proposed to
 make the duty 1 cent
 per square foot very nearly
 approximates to the duty that
 was placed upon this article
 under the tariff of 1842
 When the tariff of 1846
 came into opcration there were
 in the first and second
 conoressional districts of my State
 twenty four glass manufactories in
 success ful operation Under the
 present tariff there are but
 five Nineteen manufactories ot this
 descrip tion have gone out
 of existcncc under the opera
 t ion of the present
 tariff law I have been
 in förmed by gentlemen who
 are enttraged in this business
 who have had personal interviews
 with me thatunless this duty
 is increåsed to 1 per
 cent upon this kind of
 glass the duty as at
 present proposed will kill them
 to use their languacre Now
 sir there have been in
 the first and sec ond
 congressional districts of the State
 of New Jersey about a
 thousand operatives employed in this
 business and allowing five persons
 10 the I family there
 arc some five thousand people
 who i arc directly interested
 in the protection of this
 article in the first and
 second congressional dis tricts of
 that State alone if you
 reduce the duty upon this
 kind of glass as proposed
 by the Sen ator from
 California you absolutely extinguish i
 the fires of those furnaces
 you Glacken their hearths and
 you send these operatives wandering
 over the State seeking some
 other kind of employ ment
 for which they are not
 fitted The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will state that the
 question is not now on
 the amend mentoffcred by the
 Senator from California That is
 not yet in order The
 question is on the amend
 ment offered by the Senator
 from Rhode Island that is
 commonly called perfection before the
 from the select committee question
 can be taken on the
 substitute the Sen Mr GWIN
 That is precisely what 1
 am ator from California offered
 and there is an amend
 speaking about ment to the
 sevent eenth section offered by
 the The PRESIDING OFFICER After
 that Senator from Rhode Island
 frou i the select com
 amendment has been disposed of
 if no further mittee The
 question is on that amendment
 amendment be offered the question
 will then be i Mr
 GWIN Let us it read
 on inserting what the Senator
 from California has The Secretary
 read it in section seventeen
 line sent to the Chair
 Mr G VI IN I
 am speaking against the amend
 I eight to strike out
 twelve and insert SIX and
 after the word by to
 strike out mentproposcd by the
 Senator from Rhode Island cirrhteen
 and insert twenty four and
 in line l Mr president
 we all suppose that this
 is nine to strike out
 2 cents and insert a
 tariff for revenue and nota
 tariff for protection I cent
 so that the clause will
 read and when gentlemen get
 up and say If you
 do Above that and not
 exceeding sixtccn not add so
 much you turn operatives out
 of em inches cent per
 square iOot that IS no
 legitimate argument to ployment Mr
 GYVIN That is the very
 amendment I advance to the
 Senate on the question of
 raising i revenue Which rate
 will bring the most reve
 nue into the Treasury is
 the question we should consider
 I undertake to say when
 you prohibit the consumption of
 an article by levying a
 duty so high that it
 will not be consumed or
 imported you destroy the very
 object which this bill pro
 fesses to accomplish the raising
 of revenue This is a
 prohibitory duty to some sections
 of the coun try and
 it is proposcd to be
 inserted in the bill as
 the Senator from New Jersey
 said expressly to keep furnaces
 burning to keep operatives at
 work and not to put
 money in the Treasury That
 is the very reason why
 I am opposed to this
 bill because protection is the
 object and revenue a mere
 incident Here is a case
 in point m vhere the
 revenue is not to be
 considered at all The question
 is x vhether the furnaces
 shall burn and glass manuftwturers
 can make moye profit under
 the bill as I propose
 to amend it or as
 it is pro posed to
 be amended by the Senator
 from Rhode Island Sir I
 am willing to raise revenue
 to carry on the Government
 but never to lay a
 duty for the purpose of
 prohibiting the introduction of articles
 upon which we can collect
 customs in order to benefit
 certain manufacturing establish ments in
 this country Mr CAMERON I
 do not understand this as
 the Senator from California does
 I am vcry much inclined
 to think that his objection
 arises from the suggestions of
 persons opposed to the whole
 bill I doubt very much
 whether he has studied the
 subject or cares about it
 for he is opposed to
 a tariff bill I am
 in favor of raising revenue
 enough to support the Government
 and in laying the du
 ties would impose them in
 such a Nuvay as also
 to protect the industrial interestofthe
 country With the great demand
 on our Treasury now there
 is no diffeulty at all
 in protecting the laborers me
 chanics and manufacturers of this
 country if we lay our
 duties wisely and judiciously I
 think this bill does so
 in an emineßt degree I
 think of all the tariff
 bills we have ever had
 there has been more thought
 given to this than to
 any which has ever been
 before us While this will
 give us rev enue enough
 it will at the same
 time protect the labor of
 the country without any harm
 to any body I am
 not in favor of making
 any tariff bill merely for
 the purpose of revenue While
 Yev enue is the first
 object I am satisfied that
 here after with the great
 wants of this country if
 wisdom is used in getting
 up yoür bills our peo
 plc never can want protection
 Mr BIGLER I have no
 doubt whatever as to this
 duty on glass increasing the
 revenue al though I have
 no x vay of convincing
 the Senator from California but
 I will say to him
 that he has furnished himself
 the clearest evidence to my
 mind that this rate of
 duty is too low He
 reads from his correspondent an
 importer of the article who
 says that halfa cent a
 square föot is highly satisfactory
 Now I know that to
 the manufac turers who understand
 the business just as welt
 as the importers that rate
 was highly unsatisfac tory They
 insisted on 1 cent not
 only because it would increase
 the revenue but because it
 would give t bem some
 opportunity of reviving this busi
 ness After some discussion and
 before we had as thoroughly
 understood the subject as we
 ought to have done before
 the appearance of the New
 Jersey men here we agreed
 on cent butl think the
 Senator from Rhode Island was
 right in pro posing 1
 cent instead of cent Mr
 G WIN A word in
 rep y to the Senator
 from Pennsylvania My correspondent said
 that this was highly satisfactory
 it was nota prohib itory
 duty but see whüt he
 docs say The rates to
 be reported by the select
 committee are very satisfactory they
 are morc favorable to our
 State than to parties on
 this side as our principal
 consumption of small glass Our
 objection is not so Inuch
 to paying at increased dutv
 He does not object to
 that as it is to
 have our business destroyed by
 prohibition The proposed rates vvill
 not destroy it That is
 the reason thcy are satisfactory
 He does not want his
 business destroyed he does not
 object to an increase of
 duty paying revenue to the
 Government bat he does not
 want his business destroyed by
 a prohibitory duty Mr SIMMONS
 In order to satisfy the
 sen ator from California and
 the Senate that this is
 a very low duty and
 to show that we are
 not in creasing the duty
 in proportion to the increase
 the size of the glass
 to the same extent as
 hith 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 927 erto I will read
 the provision in the act
 of 1842 in reference to
 glass and the Senator will
 see hovy much the duties
 were there put up in
 consequence of the increase of
 the size merely On cylinder
 or broad window glass not
 exceeding eight by ten inches
 2 cents per square foot
 above that and not above
 that and not Qxceeding fourteen
 by ten inches cents per
 square foot Now S ve
 agreed at first to put
 cent on glass ten by
 fifteen inches bigger than that
 which paid cents a square
 foot under the act of
 1842 but when I came
 to look at the valuation
 I had in another bill
 I x vas satisfied there
 never was a tariff which
 if it was fairly administered
 put so low a rate
 of duty on glass as
 this Mr G WIN The
 greatest failure of a tariff
 that ever was enacted in
 this country was the tariff
 of 1842 It was a
 tariff that very soon brou
 ht the Government to such
 a condition that it haä
 to be modified and Congress
 substituted for it a tariff
 the most eminently successful that
 we ever had and that
 was the tariff of 1846
 which I am sorry was
 changed The duties under the
 tariff of 1842 would be
 prohibitory now The specific duty
 exacted under that tariff on
 many articles would be now
 absolutely prohibitory My only object
 in the amendment I propose
 is to bring revenue into
 the Treasury I have offered
 precisely the very amendment that
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 himself offered in the select
 committee in the very same
 words I have not changed
 it a particle Mr SIMMONS
 Have 1 not said half
 a dozen times that I
 was mistaken in that did
 it at the suggestion of
 the Senator from California I
 hold myself at liberty when
 I make a mistake to
 correct it I have stated
 that three or four times
 Mr G WIN I have
 never heard the Senator say
 it beiöre Mr SIMMONS I
 have said it three or
 four tillies Mr GWIN Then
 how did the bill happen
 to be reported in u
 different manner from that in
 which the select committee acyreed
 to it Mr SIMMONS In
 a subsequent meeting of the
 committee we changed this duty
 to cent a pound Mr
 G WIN I never heard
 of such a meeting Mr
 SIMMONS The Senator was notified
 every time the committee met
 and whenever we wanted a
 vote I had to go
 into another commit tee room
 to get him Mr G
 WIN No such notification was
 ever given me of any
 subsequent meeting when that x
 vas changed never knew anything
 of it until it wag
 brought to my notice by
 a gentleman in New York
 who informed me that the
 nmend ment agreed upon in
 committee had been changed in
 the bill as printed Mr
 SIMMONS It was changed by
 the com mittee Mr BIGLER
 It was I ask the
 Senator from California if he
 says the committee agreed upon
 cent with the facts before
 them Mr hVIN I do
 not pretend to say that
 we had agreed upon it
 in committee with all the
 facts ufactories in the United
 States and I think there
 are not many more manufactories
 in the Unitcd States than
 that number All that will
 come of this will be
 that we shall get cheaper
 glass and more revenue we
 shall bring the glass makers
 of Belgium of France and
 of Siberia into competi tion
 with the French and the
 English and per haps do
 a little something towards lifting
 up our own manufacturers in
 the competition Mr G WIN
 I ask that the amendment
 be read just exactly as
 it is go that we
 may under stand it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Secretary will
 again read the amendment of
 the Senatorfr om Rhode Island
 to the seventeenth section The
 Secretary read it as follows
 page 27 line eight after
 the word exceeding strike out
 twelve and insert sixteen and
 strike out eigh teen and
 insert t wenty four and
 in line nine after the
 word inches strike out two
 and insert one and a
 half so as to make
 the clause read Above that
 and not exceeding sixteen by
 twenty four inches cent per
 square toot Mr G WIN
 I have no objection to
 that thought the amendment was
 In the item above that
 fo raise the duty from
 to I cent a square
 foot Mr SIMMONS That is
 it Mr BIGLER The question
 pending I think is on
 the motion of the Senator
 from Rhode Isl and to
 strikeout cent and insert I
 cent The PRESIDING OFFICER That
 ment was agreed to Mr
 GWIN No sir that was
 the one I op posed
 1 have no recollection at
 least of its being agreed
 to The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr
 F00T The recollection of the
 Chair is confirmed by the
 Secretary r I he Chair
 s recollection is distinct upon
 it Any Senator however can
 have the question raised again
 by moving a reconsidera tlon
 The question now is on
 the amendment of the Senator
 from Rhode Island which has
 just been read Mr G
 WIN I hope the amendment
 raising the duty from ccnt
 to I cent will be
 reconsid ered That is the
 very amendment I am oppos
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The yeasand
 nays have been called for
 and ordered on the amendment
 which has just been read
 Mr HUNTER Asi understand it
 theamend ment which has just
 been read reduces the duty
 imposed in the original bill
 Mr SIMMONS Certainly it does
 Mr GWIN 1 am in
 favor of that Mr HUNTER
 The Senator from California will
 not vote against that WI
 iat he wants to do
 is to get a chance
 to try his amendment and
 I think we ought to
 reconsider the vote that has
 been given in order to
 enable him to move that
 as an amendment to the
 amendment of the com midee
 The PRESIDING OFFICER The amcnd
 ment of the Senator from
 California cannot be reached until
 all the amendments that shall
 be of fercd to modify
 the seventeenth section shall be
 disposed of as the amendment
 of the Senator before us
 Not knowing hat effect it
 would from California is to
 strike out the seventeenth have
 I consulted the parties themsel
 ves and they said that
 it was satisfactory that though
 the rate proposed was much
 higher than the present one
 they were willing to pay
 it but the rate in
 the original bill was prohibitory
 Mr BIGLER I have no
 doubt that this is below
 the average rate It is
 less than 20 per cent
 My calculation is that it
 is about 18 per cent
 It is less than the
 averacre rate of ad duties
 Mr GWIN Those who deal
 in the article II say
 it is a prohibitory duty
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Mr F00T
 The question is on the
 amendment offered by the Senator
 from Rhode Island Mr H
 VIN I ask for the
 yeas and nays to gee
 whether this is to go
 by default or not The
 yeas and nays were ordered
 Mr SEWARD 1 hope this
 amendment will be accepted I
 have listened with very great
 in terest to the debate
 and I am satisfied that
 when the subject shall have
 been arranged as is pro
 posed by the Senator from
 Rhode Island there will be
 no effectual prohibition of the
 manufacture I believe I have
 been in of any kind
 of glass manufacturing establishments of
 glass in a siri gle
 manufactorv in England in which
 rnore glass manufactured than in
 any twenty or thirty man
 section and insert other matter
 Mr HUNTER 1 ask will
 it be in order we
 have agreed to these amendments
 then to strike out the
 section and insert the amendment
 of the Senator from Culifornia
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Then it
 will be in order and
 not till thcn Mr GWIN
 1 withdraw the call for
 the yeas and nays for
 T am in favor of
 this amendment The PRESIDING OFFICER
 By common consent the order
 for thc ycas and nays
 will be recalled The Chair
 hears no objection The question
 is on the amendment which
 has been read Mr POLK
 As this bill stands before
 us and as I understand
 it the bill as printed
 contains ari amendment proposed by
 the select committee which is
 to insert three quarters of
 before one cent Mr SIMMONS
 That has been passed upon
 The three quarters were stricken
 out a nd it now
 stands at 1 cent a

 the committee was in line

 SIMMONS The lattér branch of
 th t amendment should be

 go over these different sizes
 precisely in proportiön to the
 duties on them We do
 not Wantto stil ke out
 that clausé The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Will the serf ator indicate
 What he want Stricken out
 Mr SIMMONS It iS all
 except the last item which
 ought not to be stnoken
 oub It should read That
 all rough plate cylinder or
 broad glass weighing over one
 hundréd pounds per one hundred
 square feet shall pay an
 addi i tional duty on
 the excess at the same
 rates as herein imposed PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Senator from Rhode
 Island proposes as the Chair
 under stands him that the
 portion of thé o iginal
 bill which this amendment of
 the committee proposes to strike
 out shall stand Mr SEWARD
 like to hear it read
 I want to know it
 will stand Mr SIMMONS 1
 will read it The ion
 should read thus Thatal rough
 plate cyl inder or broad
 glass weighing over one hundred
 pounds per one hundred square
 feet shall pay an additional
 duty on the excess at

 to stand and to strike
 out 3 cents pcr pound
 which the conimittee prou posed
 to msert so that this

 Mr SUMNER Allow me to
 ask if the con Bideration
 like that at this time
 is nota departure fi om
 the practice of the Senate
 I tho ught it wag
 oqp rule to go through
 with all the amendments of
 the committee before we took
 up amendments propösed by individual
 Senators The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair state that this is
 simply an amendment to an
 amendment offered by the committee
 and is in order in
 pu rsuance of the practice
 Mr SUMNER As 1 understand
 it it is a proposition
 to strike out a whole
 section The PRESIDING OFFICER Yes
 and to insert other m
 atter IVIr SUMNER 1 submit
 to the Chair that this
 is not an amendment to
 an amendment of the committee
 but it is an amendment
 to the bill Mr BIGLER
 The whole bill is before
 the Senate The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The commit tee moved a
 votiety of amendments to the
 seven teenth section and it
 is now moved further to
 amend that sectiön by striking
 out the whole of it
 and inserting what has been
 reåd and it is etrictiy
 in order and in pursuance
 of common practice Mr CRITTENDEN
 1 wish to make asingle
 inquiry It is impossible that
 we should all be ablo
 to enter into the details
 of such a bill as
 this I desire to know
 of my friend from Rhode
 Island what rate of increase
 he has imposed upon the
 present tariff and what rate
 ot percentage of diminution is
 proposed by the amendment of
 the Senator from California Mr
 SIMMONS i will answer the
 Senator from Kentucky As I
 stated the other day we
 intended that this bill should
 levy art averarre rate of
 duty of 20 por cent
 and we expected it to
 yield that on the whole
 importations Mr COLLAMER Not by
 duties Mr SIMMONS Some of
 it by preventing frauds somc
 of it by raising the
 rates of duty By these
 means we expected to bring
 the overture up from 15
 to betsveen 19 and 20
 per cent which would give
 the required revenue in our
 judgment Now wish to say
 one word about this partic
 ular arnendment Mr COLLAMER Allow
 me to suggest that the
 Senator fi orn Kentucky wanted
 to know how much it
 was pfoposed to increase the
 duties over the present rate
 That has not been answered
 Mr SIMLMONS Does he mean
 on this par glass Mr
 COLLAMER The whole bill 1
 stood M r CRITTENDEN No
 this section on glass Mr
 SIMMONS In sorne cases it
 reduces the present duty and
 in increases it but I
 wish to cali the att
 ont ion of the Senator
 from Cal ifornia to this
 fact that bo is striking
 out a variety of articles
 here that he hag never
 read and t hat he
 leaves no provision what ever
 for The truth is he
 has got a kink about
 him as to this little
 window glass and he will
 strike out all thc rest
 of the tariff to get
 in an alteration in the
 size of window glass That
 is all he proposes Mr
 BIGLERV 1 will say to
 the Senator from Kentucky that
 I have in my hands
 a table which I have
 made out in reference to
 the leading ar tic cs
 which shows the rates charged
 in the tariff of 1842
 the tariff of 1846 and
 the tariff of 1857 and
 those proposed in this bill
 i have these tables in
 reference to alt the loading
 articles to glass under tile
 tarifF of 1842 the rate
 was from to 6 cents
 per square foot under the
 tariff of 184G 20 per
 cent under the present law
 the act d 1857 the
 rate is 15 per cent
 and under it will range
 from 18 to 20 per
 the proposed bill cent as
 I can estimate the ad
 calorenL rule Our object was
 to make the dutiés of
 1846 the basis Me GWIN
 The Senator from Rhode Island
 says that there is nonsense
 in the amendment that am
 not at surprised for f
 have proposed Igot it from
 him Laughter He drew every
 tion against the estimates that
 are brought for line of
 it or his clerk did
 every solitary word in ward
 now when the Same ratio
 was shown a my amendment
 He is the man that
 handed me year ago when
 depression was not spoken of
 that as the action of
 the committee He says that
 I The amendment that have
 proposed is pre cisely what
 the committee agreed upon when
 I it was agreed to
 upon representations made by tee
 with the facts that I
 had wishing this altera tion
 he had already altered the
 bill in that way and
 read it to me and
 asked if that did not
 an swer the purpose It
 asked him for a copy
 in order that l might
 send it to those with
 whom I was in correspondence
 on the subject to ascertain
 if it met their views
 He and the original author
 of the bill Mr MORRILL
 had been together as I
 understood revising it and he
 said to me Here are
 the amendments that I propose
 Well said 1 give mc
 a copy I am in
 favor of it anyhow as
 it is a reduction but
 if itmeets the views of
 those whom I represent the
 import ing merchants of my
 State then I shall be
 saved the necessity of moving
 amendments to it was in
 favor of it of course
 in preference to the original
 bill I got the very
 words from the Senator himself
 He gave me a copy
 to send to my correspondents
 to ascertain if their views
 were met by the amend
 ment not that I proposed
 it I had propositions I
 there but I found the
 Senator with his bill pre
 out one word that ought
 to remain in the section
 If diere is Inore matter
 there than my amendment covers
 of I do not propose
 to strike out 1 have
 just precisely got the the
 whole section words the Senator
 gave me and I have
 offered them because preferred them
 to the original bill I
 do not want to mutilate
 the bill in any way
 What ever If it is
 nonsense it is the Senator
 s fault not mine Mr
 SIMMONS One word in reply
 I am not going to
 prolong this debate The remark
 I made was that the
 Senator had proposed to strike
 out the whole section So
 I understood the Chair to
 state the question and I
 understood him to move to
 strike out the seventeenth section
 and insert this instead of
 it The PRESIDING OFFICER That
 is the questi on Mr
 SIMMONS Then 1 say he
 out the duties on other
 wares and if he had
 read the section through he
 would not have proposed it
 and now he says he
 has put in just what
 I pro pared much better
 than it was as it
 came from the il posed
 I never proposed to strike
 out this sec House of
 Representatives and I accepted what
 he tion We had an
 informal meeting with the gen
 had done r got them
 to write down the words
 tleman who reported this bill
 in the House o I
 have them as written down
 and that is precisely Representatives
 and we enlarged these sizes
 and the amendment which I
 have now proposed and when
 the Senator from California came
 in there we had not
 passed upon them I believe
 but at nothing else It
 is no amendment of mine
 it is any rate I
 intended to propose them to
 the com his own The
 Senator from Pennsylvania stated just
 now mittee when we had
 a formal meeting and all
 were that the duties were
 at so low a rate
 that they present I stated
 to him what that gentleman
 would not amount to 15
 or 20 per cent Here
 is Mr may as well
 call his name an estimate
 of the duties they tu
 e 28 53 and 62
 per cent Here are the

 II 0 Mr BIGLER I
 do not take those estimates
 Will t he Smoator tell
 Ine on what they are
 based Mr GWIN They are
 made out by the Mr
 BIGLER They are madc on
 the present depressed prices not
 on the averacre Mr G
 WIN Did not the Senator
 ftom Vir oinia read yesterday
 the estimates that were Inade
 a year ago und those
 made now with scarcely an
 alteration in the figures except
 so fat as the amendments
 of the committee make the
 bill better had suggested and
 he sent to a committee
 room somewhere to get a
 clerk I do not want
 it to be understood that
 I have had one since
 I havc been on this
 business There are a good
 many smart ones about here
 as I discover Laughter He
 got a clerk to copy
 this proposition before it had
 been formally acted upon I
 believe we all said we
 should go for it I
 intended to go for it
 but when I carne to
 have the information which I
 ought to have ha l
 before I suggested it found
 that it was ruinous both
 to the revenue and the
 business of the country It
 is not an adequate duty
 at all The duty that
 I have now got in
 the bill of I cent
 a square foot is the
 only one that has been
 altered from the printed bili
 and there are but two
 items in the Senator s
 amend rnent varying from mine
 W lien we came to
 put this up and see
 the difference in sizes I
 was as tonished at the
 form of the bili as
 presented in this new shape
 On glass sixteen by twenty
 four inches we have 00t
 the duty down to I
 kept that there and when
 we cent a foot came
 to the cent duty we
 put it at 1 cerit
 fl he two species of
 glass w ere double before
 and we kept the rates
 double one quality at cent
 and the other at I
 cent This low duty is
 that which affects the coun
 try on all glass fron
 l ten to fifteen inches
 I think it ought to
 be 1 cent I do
 not think it is cent
 on the fair value I
 could read papers I have
 had u peck of sent
 and going into the calculations
 you would to mo not
 find one of the duties
 fixed in this bill stated
 the other day that was
 20 per cent on the
 fair market vaiue of the
 article Mr HVIN I am
 not going to detain the
 Sen ate about this matter
 The Senator now states the
 fact of the case and
 that is that I never
 pro posed one amendment about
 glass He said awhile ago
 that 1 had deceived him
 Mr SIMMONS I did not
 say any such Mr GWIN
 That 1 had madc representations
 there and that they changed
 the amendment be cause they
 found out that Iny representations
 I have rnoved this amend
 nent were not correct precisely
 as it was handed to
 me in manuscript by the
 Senator and the original aut
 hor of the bill He
 read it to me when
 I went there intending to
 ask for these alterations and
 I told him that it
 seemed to me that probably
 that met the case as
 than it was sent from
 the House of Representa it
 was presented to mc and
 I asked him tivcs Why
 does the Senator bring this
 objec il copy The Senator
 talks about rny clerk x
 nakit lg a copy Ithe
 Senator from Pennsylvania stated The
 last named sizes from five
 to ten pounds more i
 that he had a clerk
 to his committee and i
 said than onc hundred pounds
 per one hundred which will
 I had one I did
 not want the Senator from
 Rhode Encreos e the duty
 fE0in 5 to 25 per
 cont additional to 62 per
 Island to have the labor
 of copying these matters cent
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE THE OFFICIAL
 PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED BY
 JOHN C RIVES WASHINGTON D
 C THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D
 SESSION and the clerk of
 the Senator from Pennsylvania copied
 this and handed it to
 me under the cyc of
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 I wanted to ascer taimvhether
 the alteration which he and
 the ori ginal author of
 the bill made met the
 case My correspondent said it
 did meet the case though
 it was a larger duty
 than that now paid but
 they were willing to pay
 it The alteration now made
 is one that is injurious
 to the revenue and to
 their business paying a large
 revenue to the Govern want
 to restore the original action
 of ment the committee We
 all agreed to the first
 altera tion and the subsequent
 alteration I did not kl
 0W of until my attention
 was called to it by
 those interested My amendment is
 precisely in the words read
 by the Secretary but there
 is a portion of the
 section that should remain I
 take it for granted that
 the Senate is going to
 vote my amendment down and
 therefore I should like to
 have it pre cisely in
 the form 1 intended and
 that is the form in
 which the Senator himself handed
 it to me and I
 have never changed a single
 word in it It was
 not intended to mutilate the
 section at all There is
 a certain portion of the
 section that should be retaified
 That portion I wish to
 retain and I wish to
 give symmetry to it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Will the Sen
 ator from California indicate the
 portion of the section he
 proposes to strike out Mr
 G W i N move
 to strike out all of
 the seventeenth section down to
 the word pound in line
 twenty riine being all that
 relates to win dow glass
 and to insert what I
 have sent to the Chair
 which has been read twice
 MI SIMMONS I merely wish
 to make one explanation as
 the Senator from California seems
 to speak a øreat deal
 of this being in no
 y own handwriting That does
 110t happen to be so
 but I would as liefit
 had been so as not
 for if I had drawn
 it at a fu l
 meeting of the committee I
 should vote against it now
 The Senator had some papers
 tha t he wanted to
 call our attention to and
 I called him up to
 the table and showed what
 the mover of this bill
 in the other House had
 suggested as an improvement of
 it and he said he
 would take a copy of
 it and write to this
 I found on exaniination into
 the sub importer ject and
 I am not ashamed to
 tell it here that we
 were entirely mistaken and that
 the duties we proposed were
 entirely inadequate either for rev
 I wanted them alt ered
 enue or for protection and
 the committee did alter them
 on account of the mistake
 we had made and now
 the Senator wants to have
 that provision in which I
 was mis taken put into
 Chis bill in order to
 perfect it Mr GWIN Who
 deceived the about it I
 did not Mr SIMMONS Nobody
 deceived mc 1 did I
 was mis not say that
 anybody deceived rne taken i
 did not have the inforznation
 I ought to havc had
 and when I get it
 I always calculate to correct
 a mistake Now the Senator
 wants to point his finger
 to me and nwtke the
 Senate hold on to a
 mistake That is the difference

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 15 Mr

 Oh no I move that
 the Senate do now adjourn
 Mr FESSENDEN lhopeweshallgo through the

 motion was not agreed to
 there being on a division
 ayes eleven noes not counted
 Mr LANE Mr President perhaps
 it may not be in
 order but I hope the
 Senate will give its permission
 to order to be printed
 that we may have it
 to morrow an amendment which
 I propose to offer to
 this bill as a substitute
 for it I ask that
 an order be made for
 its printing The PRESIDING OFFICER
 If there be no objection
 the Chair will receive the
 motion of the Senator from
 Oregon and the question is
 on printing the proposed amendment
 which he of The motion
 was agreed to The next
 amendment was to strike out
 the thirtieth section of the
 bill which the Secretary proceeded
 to read Mr SEWARD As
 we are reaching an im
 portant question and it is
 aver y late hour of
 the day I move that
 the Senate adjourn Mr CAMERON
 I shall ask for the
 yeas and na s PRESI
 DING OFFICER This motion is
 not a debatable one The
 motion was not agreed to
 there being on a division
 ayes 12 noes 26 The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Secretary would
 realize if the term was
 only one month or Mr
 BIGLER If the Senator from
 New York ninety days It
 is only a delay The
 favor of desires to offer
 an amendment he should offer
 it the Government or the
 forbearance of the Gov now
 for if the Senate strike
 out and insert it is
 ernment will increase the revenue
 by increasing not amendable if
 the Senate agree to it
 in that the amount of
 importations Therefore it is that
 form I must stand on
 the amendment which I have
 Mr SEWARD Let the question
 first be taken proposed to
 insert two years in lieu
 of ninety on striking out
 that will answer my purpose
 da s Mr BIGLER The
 Senator a division PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question Mr SEWARD Yes
 sir is on the amendment
 offered by the Senator from
 Mr BIGLER He that The
 only New York to the
 amendment way is to erfect
 the text Mr SEWARD I
 will move to amend the
 Mr WILSON Is it in
 order to move to amend
 that amendment proposed by the
 committee in the thir The
 PRESIDING OFFICER It is not
 ty second line page 59
 by striking out ninety is
 an amendment to an amendment
 It is now in days
 and inserting in lieu thereof
 two years the third degree
 and cannot be amended Mr
 CLINGMAN I suppose the Senator
 in Mr LATHAM Mr President
 1 to two years wherever
 the words tends to insert
 say a word in relation
 to this provision in the
 bill 6 ninety days occur
 If the amendment of the
 committee is adopted Mr SEWARD
 Yes sir the constituency I
 represent will be greater suf
 Mr DOOLITTLE This is a
 very important ferers than probably
 any other portion of this
 amendment and upon it suppose
 we shali hear the views
 of Senators but it is
 late in the day I
 country and for this reason
 we are so far from
 the place of exportation that
 merchants there can am willing
 if Senators desire it that
 the other amendments from the
 committee be passed upon never
 regulate by any conceivable calculation
 I but as this is
 an amendment which involves the
 the questions of supply and
 demand Under the whole warehousing
 system I suppose it will
 present warehousincr system the merchant
 may lead to some discussion
 and we shall hardly get
 i send on his bill
 for goods to Europe he
 may get I thegoods and
 when they arrive if in
 consequence through with it this
 evening and therefore I rose
 of the plethoric state of
 the market he is unable
 I suppose this will I
 to propose an adjournment to
 sell he has the privilege
 of putting them into not
 be pressed to a vote
 to night the warehouses and
 can take them out and
 pay I Mr FESSENDEN I
 wish to suggest to my
 duties on them according to
 demand If you friend and
 to others that we are
 now within a compel the
 merchants of California to pay
 the a great deal of
 important matter to be acted
 upon I duties at the
 expiration of ninety days it
 wiil operate hard in both
 ways If there is no
 de mand for the goods
 and there is no opportunity
 of exportation then the merchant
 of course has to pay
 the duties and lay out
 of his money and have
 the goods on his hands
 If he tries to reg
 ulate on the other hand
 the question of supply and
 demand directly we will find
 that there will not be
 a suffcient quantity of goods
 m market to suit the
 demands of the people and
 the consumers themselves will be
 the sufferers so that it
 is a will proceed with
 the reading of the amendment
 fortnight of the time of
 adjournment and we have of
 the committee Mr LATHAM I
 will suggest that the Clerk
 some of the appropriation bills
 and other import ant bills
 and if we are to
 adjourn while this sub merely
 read the amendment of the
 committee ject is under consideration
 the moment a ques and
 not the portion proposed to
 be stricken out tion comes
 up that will lead to
 debate at half past The
 bill is before every Senator
 and he can see four
 o clock we shall not
 finish business that it for
 himself The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 reading must be done at
 this session and gentlemen may
 of the amendment so fat
 as it proposes to strike
 II make up their minds
 to it Mr WILSON I
 understand the Senator from out
 a certain section will be
 dispensed with by New York
 has moved to amend the
 bill by strik unanimous consent
 ing out ninety days in
 the thirty second line Mr
 HALE want to hear it
 read I doubt very much
 disadvantage to the merchants on
 one side of the and
 inserting two years The Secretary
 read the amendment to strike
 out all after the enacting
 clause of the thirtieth whether
 we had better touch this
 warehousinø case and to the
 consumer upon the other system
 at all but if we
 do I think we ought
 to be Senators will recollect
 that it takes six months
 section in the following words
 very liberal in regard to
 it The committee have for
 us to get goods from
 Bordeaux Liverpool and all goods
 wares or merchandise imported from
 any proposed ninety days i
 am willing to agree to
 Havre and other places of
 exportation and it an amendment
 to this effect to give
 one mstead i takes from
 ninety days to four months
 to get foreion countries and
 entered for warehousin y or
 depos ited in tile public
 stores in consequence of the
 duties not of two years
 for paying the duties and
 in regard goods comincr even
 from New York around the
 being paid shall be so
 entered or deposited subject to
 the I have no hesitation
 therefore in saying to the
 time goods stay in the
 warehouse to Horn following conditions
 to wit That the saine
 shall be with f drawn
 from the warehouse or public
 stores within thirty strike out
 six months and insert two
 years so that if this
 bill passes compelling the merchants
 days fronl the time and
 date of the entry for
 domestic con that the duties
 would have to be paid
 in one year to withdraw
 the goods in ninety days
 or pay the sumptioo and
 the duties thereon shall be
 duly paid in caeh and
 the goods might remain in
 the warehouse two duties it
 will be of inconceivable injury
 to all the at the
 time of such withdrawal or
 be thereafter prohibited from being
 withdrawn except for the purpose
 of exporta Y ears and
 be reéxported if they chose
 after one trade and all
 the commerce of California and
 be ion beyond tbe limits
 of the United States and
 in nocase II year and
 the duties be paid to
 them less I per so
 oppressive that there will be
 one general cry I think
 that from aH the merchants
 of that country for its
 im sholl any goods wares
 or merchandise as aforesaid so
 cent as is proposed by
 this bill imported and entered
 and deposited for warehousing be
 II would be liberal enotvh
 Hovzever I shall vote mediate
 repeal I trust that the
 friends of this entitled or
 permitted to be entered Cor
 domestic consump to strike it
 all out if it is
 necessary to do it li
 measure will let the warehousing
 system stand as Mr SEWARD
 If i should succeed in
 get it is speaking as
 I do for those who
 as I have time heretotöre
 mentionea Proeided rl hat goods
 wares j or merchandise which
 shall bave been withdrawn as
 afore ting this amendment of
 the committee amended stated will
 be the greatest sufferers by
 any charve said and which
 shall have been exported and
 lauded be I shall still
 be against the amendment itself
 and Mr CAMERON My rule
 in life is never to
 yond the jilliits of the
 United States may be frotn
 thence in favor of retaining
 the warehousing system just If
 the Senator take advice from
 my opponents duly reimported in
 the saine rnanner provided for
 in the i If I
 should fail in that I
 will offer this from California
 intended to vote for this
 bill I first instance Provided
 also I hat this scetion
 Shail not as It is
 apply to goods wares and
 merchandise imported from be amendment
 to modify this provision as
 favorably might be inclined to
 listen to him but be
 is going yond the Cape
 of Good Ilope or Cape
 Horn until the 1st of
 I as possible The whole
 value the whole utility to
 oppose it no matter what
 condition the bill Januarv 1861
 Provided further llhat all acts
 or parts of may be
 in and therefore I think
 all he says in acts
 relating to the subject matter
 herein enlbraced and Of the
 warehousincr system consists in the
 priv inconsistent therewith are hereby
 repealed And to insert in
 lieu thereof i ilege of
 importin5 goods and storing them
 for a relation to the
 bill is wrong Gentlemen on
 the considerable period of time
 so that a merchant other
 side of the House are
 continually talking may take advantage
 of the condition of trade
 in against protection This warehousing
 system is That on all
 0003 wares and merchandise remaininaon
 deposit in warehouse or public
 stores on the 1st day
 of different parts of the
 country and different parts protection
 for the merchants and especially
 for July A D 1861
 the dunes shall be paid
 within ninety of the world
 and having his goods in
 store may the foreign merchants
 I will make no speech
 on days thereafter and on
 afl deposited after the said
 1st day at any time
 within one two or three
 years draw the subject now
 but I will mention this
 simple of July the duties
 shall be paid within ninety
 days from the time of
 deposit The said goods on
 which the duties them out
 on paying the duties to
 the Government fact that if
 the duty was paid to
 day on the goöds It
 is no priv now in
 bondin the different warehouses of
 the Uni have been paid
 may be at any time
 withdrawn for con and then
 send them into market sumption
 and tnay be taken out
 för exportation beyond ilege to
 be able to keep the
 goods in store when ted
 States we should have in
 our Treasury about the limits
 of the United States at
 any time within six the
 duties have been paid Whenever
 the mer 10 000 000
 Those would relieve us months
 from the titne of the
 payment of duties thereon ii
 from all trouble We are
 now paying 12 or 14
 chant has paid his duties
 on the goods he wants
 to draw them out in
 order to sell Therefore it
 i per cent for the
 use of money which is
 justly due and on being
 so exported the dnties thereon
 shall be re funded deducting
 I per centutn but no
 duties shall be refunded on
 goods wares or merchandise withdrawn
 more to us from these
 goods Senators talk against is
 that I do not consider
 what is offered here Khan
 six Inonths alter the tinie
 the duties were 4id thereon
 i ninety days as any
 valuable extension of the giving
 protection to the manuthcturer and
 the la iMr SEWARD Is
 the question on striking privilege
 of the occupation of the
 warehouse and borer but when
 we come to this protection
 to out or insertin that
 nothing else than 8 period
 of two years will The
 PRESIDING OFFICER is a single
 be adequate to the objects
 has proposition to strike out
 and insert The Chair in
 view I can see but
 one objection to permit ting
 these goods to remain and
 the duties unpaid will further
 state that the original matter
 pro posed to be stricken
 out is first open to
 amend II for so long
 atime fnd that is that
 when this sys ment if
 any member desires to amend
 it and also the matter
 to be inserted is open
 to modifi cation Mr SEWARD
 Let the question bé taken
 on striking out Mr HALE
 It is not divisible tem
 first comes into operation there
 will not be a realization
 of the duties so that
 the Treasury will lose the
 advantage of an immediate supply
 but the bill goes into
 operation as a system and
 after the expiration of one
 or two years the Govern
 ment realizes all the revenues
 from the bill that it
 the merchant nothing is said
 about it My im pression
 is that this thing is
 more to the advant age
 of the owners of the
 warehouses in New York than
 it is to any Otlvr
 people Certainly the legitimate merchants
 of New York the men
 born raised and educated here
 whose capital belongs to this
 country have no benefit from
 it but it the foreign
 merchant or the agent of
 the foreign manufacturer who is
 benefited by it That is
 the whole history of the
 warehouses Senators talk about other
 countries protecting 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBn commerce by the warehouping
 system but they forget that
 in no country in the
 world are the for Cign
 products ajlowed to stay in
 bond except so of the
 country in which they are
 That is the system in
 England Their whole warchousinø system
 is for the benefit of
 the manufacturers of Great Britain
 Ours is for the benefit
 of the manu facturers of
 foreign countries I said I
 would not make an extended
 speech on this subject and
 I wili not but I
 desired to state this faci
 that if we had the
 money now due us on
 the goods in ware houses
 we should not be peddling
 our notes and bonds about
 the country Mr POWELL If
 the Senator from Pennsyl vania
 will allow me I desire
 to ask him if he
 sup poses this amount of
 merchandise would be in bond
 now but fbr our present
 system Mr CAMERON 1 have
 a right to expect it
 would for it is there
 brought in for the very
 pur pose of being stored
 there by persons abroad and
 I take it for granted
 it would be there but
 at all events it is
 there Mr POWELL 1 will
 suggest that the chants abroad
 never would have put it
 there if they had to
 pay the duty down Mr
 CAMERON That is a supposition
 of the Scnator Mr POWELL
 The reason why they leave
 it there is because they
 have the privilege of keep
 ing it there without charge
 Mr WILSON The Senator from
 Pennsyl vania says he has
 made it a habit not
 to take the advice of
 his opponents On a question
 of this kind think we
 ought to consider the opinions
 of everybody MI e have
 a bill here that some
 members in the Senate and
 some persons in the country
 regard as somewhat protective some
 by its effect in augmenting
 the commerce the trade of
 the country at home and
 abroad ay and by its
 effect in increasing the manufacturing
 of the country and the
 mining of the country It
 is this warehousing system I
 do not see in it
 what the Senator from Pennsylvania
 sees a conflict between the
 warehousing system and the manu
 facturing system If therc were
 I should have to choose
 between two interests both of
 which I favor The effect
 of the warehousing system is
 simply this to increase the
 commerce of the country but
 whenever commerce is increased there
 must be a corresponding increase
 in the country of the
 materials or the subject of
 commerce The ware housing systern
 enables the merchant to bring
 in foreign goods and wares
 and to hold them ready
 for all demands of the
 market of all parts of
 this extended country of all
 parts of this great conti
 nent and of the continent
 of Asia with whidh we
 are trading These articles if
 thus brought here and held
 lead to a domestic trade
 throughout the country Foreign trade
 in such articles being established
 then it follows as tho
 American manufacturer goes into this
 increased and extended market and
 brings his fabrics of the
 same character into the common
 stock while manufacture is stilnulated
 and the revenues increase the
 consumer in any part of
 the world gets the production
 so much cheaper That I
 think is the operation of
 the whole system I shall
 think it an injury to
 the manufactures of the country
 to strike down the commerce
 of San Francisco and thc
 commerce of New York and
 the commerce of New Orleans
 I believe it may be
 true that by our revenue
 sys tem wc may favor
 some foreien Inanufacturers at the
 cost of our own It
 is there that I take
 my what to the advantage
 of the productive interests departure
 from gentlemen on the other
 side of the of our
 country I do not think
 we ought to put Chamber
 who are opposed strictly to
 every prin this bill the
 interests or the prejudice if
 you choose to call it
 so of the shipping and
 the commercial interests of the
 country Sir if this bill
 should pass as it comes
 to us from the com
 mittee in my judgment it
 will array against it the
 strongest hostility of the shipping
 interests and commercial men of
 the country I think those
 who are in favor of
 the bill ought not to
 hazard the measure in the
 judgment of the country by
 thus arraying against it great
 and powerful Interests Now sir
 as to my own State
 I have no doubt at
 all it would be bettor
 for our manufacturing and mechanical
 interests to a considerable extent
 to go in favor of
 this bill as it comes
 from the com mittee But
 we have large commercial interests
 and a iarge shipping interest
 Some portions of our people
 believe that this bill as
 it now stands is a
 yainst their interests Many of
 the in iron in various
 mechanical trades and per sons
 enøaged in our shipping interests
 believe that this bill is
 against their interests There is
 in my Slate to day
 and there is in New
 England and there is in
 the country a large portion
 of the com munity that
 would prefin to rest under
 the tariff act of 1857
 I think the friends of
 this measure ought to extend
 this time at least to
 one year and I shall
 I shall vote ugainsl the
 proposition of so vote the
 Senator from New York increasing
 it to two years and
 vote for one year as
 I believe that to be
 O onable time I know
 that is the opinion of
 many persons in New Y
 ork and Bos ton importers
 and business noen engaged in
 the If that should bc
 voted down shipping interest I
 shall vote to strike out
 the whole section and leave
 the warehousing system precisely and
 ex shall do it because
 I believe actly as now
 is the permanent interests of
 the whole country will bc
 promoted by so doing Pass
 this bill strike out this
 warehousing system and in no
 y judg ciple of protection
 in a revenue bill In
 such a case I am
 willing as I have done
 throughout to increase the duties
 upon the foreign manufacture to
 that extent which will bring
 into action the wheels of
 our own industry and through
 the agricultural and mineral interests
 the rawr mate rial for
 manufacture I thank the honorable
 Senator from Massachu setts for
 his support upon this bill
 of this measure of mine
 upon the principle of its
 expediency and wisdom It is
 a great change a very
 considerable change in the policy
 of the country It occurs
 at a peculiar time under
 peculiar circumstances I think it
 is wise to advance and
 with that view I have
 not moved to dimil ish
 a single duty pro posed
 by the committee who have
 reportéd this bill not one
 Although solicited by my constit
 uents who are merchants and
 importers I have not moved
 for the reduction of the
 duty upon a single article
 As the bill stands it
 is a very large advance
 in the way of strengthenincy
 our own pro ductions agricultural
 and manufacturing I think it
 is enough without striking a
 blow at the most effective
 part of our system of
 commerce and I beg of
 the Senate to consider that
 in commerce is involved also
 another interest which in itself
 is a manufacturing one that
 is the interest in navigation
 It is not wise to
 haste too fast in a
 matter of this kind As
 I desire to bring tho
 question to a test of
 we extendéd the timer foinpayihg
 tthe to next July five
 months fföm considering it then
 there ärethreé YnönthSgiven after that
 befoi e a dime is
 to months fro m the
 1st of February and months
 after that to reship the
 goddg and the money back
 We did that because wedid
 note desire to Inconvenience merchants
 who have a IL ready
 goods in warehouse i especiallyiri
 the irres ent state of
 the market intended to suggegt
 to the Senator from California
 if he was favorable to
 the bill by the consent
 of some members Of the
 committee that we would extend
 this a ftey the 1st
 of July to four mohths
 and afte the duties were
 paid eightmonths thereaftei and that
 is the provision that was
 originally fixed in the ware
 house year The Senator from
 New York has told all
 the favorable things to be
 said on one side of
 this qtiestion without considering or
 seeming to have dreamed that
 there was an Other Side
 want to state both sides
 I think it Will be
 a gfeat venience to the
 merchants to have this time
 ex tended fürther than we
 have extended it So far
 simply as they would save
 the interest on the money
 that they would have to
 pay into the Treasury and
 sometimes it would be at
 high rates and I believe
 it is generally at high
 rates on the Pacific coast
 For that reason I haver
 a great deal stronger desire
 to accommodate the Pacific coast
 than I have these overgrown
 Cities on this side but
 at the same time I
 have a duty to do
 and I think the committee
 considered that we had something
 to do to protect the
 Trehsury of the United States
 The goods in warehouse accumulate
 precisely at the time when
 our neces sities are most
 pressing Now I will read
 thé amount of goods in
 warehouse in ordinarytimes For three
 years in ordinary times they
 did not vary 200 000
 from 22 000 000 This
 duty was changed ih 1857
 and by the 1st of
 July I do not know
 how much goods there had
 been there before for I
 had not examined it there
 Were 56 000 000 in
 warehouse on which there shdirld
 be paid 16 906 000
 duties Those duties were reckoned
 upon the tariff after it
 was modified and when I
 came to make the calculation
 on the whole 56 487
 000 at 30 per cent
 duty on the liquor it
 fell short 10 000 of
 the duties required upon those
 goods There must have been
 a depieda tion upon the
 revenue amounting to 10 000
 The whole amount of goods
 in warehouse the whole 56
 000 000 was liquor brandies
 spirits and wines That was
 the condition of it on
 the 1st of July 1857
 They are stored there for
 three years and we are
 without the duties The inter
 est on those duties is
 1 year and more too
 We lay without the duty
 when it was 100 I
 per cent and these people
 leave their liquors there and
 agc them and get them
 Beady for mar ket and
 Gy the time they get
 aged in about three years
 t hey fetch double what
 they would pay at first
 and it is a II
 at the expense Of the
 Treasury I do not think
 this Governmentisin a condition to
 lend these liquor deaiers half
 the capital on which they
 carry on their business and
 then turn around and hire
 it from them at 3
 per cent a month and
 be paid in their own
 money as has been often
 done this winter am willing
 to do anything reasonable I
 do not want principle I
 will with the leave of
 the Senate to distress merchants
 or to cripple commerce I
 change my amendment and make
 the term three think commerce
 is one of the leading
 interests of years instead of
 two years and that will
 bring us the country but
 I never in my life
 saw so exact back to
 the real question in issue
 whether we shall ing a
 set ofmcn as these commercial
 men and es not leave
 the warehousing system as it
 stands 1 pecially these German
 Jews Laughter They propose to
 so leave it are not
 satisfied with anything If you
 should Mr SIIVfMONS 1 think
 that is a better form
 give them three years they
 would claim five if in
 which to put the question
 because to reducc it it
 took that time to age
 their liquor from three to
 two years is praclically the
 same Now Mr President I
 would do anything in thincr
 The comm ittee have considered
 this sub II reason for
 the convenience of commerce We
 have ment you will array
 against this mcasurea deep ject
 The bill as it came
 from the Ho use only
 put off the collection of
 the duty for six months
 seated hostility that wili bé
 felt hereafter in the allowed
 one month We considered the
 peculiar although we needed the
 money and although country I
 do not think we ought
 to incur tllat I condition
 of the country as well
 as the condition we were
 paying 12 per cent for
 it rather than of the
 Treasury and I will suggest
 to the Senate disturb the
 markets of the country or
 to put any hostility if
 it can be avoided the
 considerations which presented themselves to
 body on uneasy conditions about
 paying this Mr SEWARD Mr
 President it is thc committee
 They were not unmindful of
 the duty I wanted these
 merchants to have two sea
 to live at all if
 onc does not learn something
 in life N lv first
 acquaintance with the subject of
 convenience of merchants and especially
 of the sons to take
 these goods out the present
 spring season to dispose of
 what they could and then
 to tariffs may be said
 to have begun some fourteen

 very formidable mittcc to hear

 to accommodate opposition if there
 has been any policy in

 W MEADE Mr MAYNARD 1
 am directed bv the Com

 a joint resolution for the

 executor of Richard W Meade
 and to ask that it
 be put upon i s

 sacre The joint resolution was
 read a first and second

 of R W Meade executor
 of Richard Meade deceased to
 the Court of Claims to
 be reheard on the proofs
 already in the case with
 any additional testimony and such
 further arguments as the claimant
 may offer under the rules
 of the court so as
 to decide it on the
 merits of the case Mr
 THOMAS 1 object Mt MAYNARD
 1 hope there be 0b
 jection The resolution is only
 to allow a rehear ing
 of the case On the
 examination of the matter the
 committee was satisfied that it
 came strictly 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 039 within the rules
 under which a court of
 chancery would allow the application
 for a rehearing EThe SPEAKER
 The gentleman from Ten nessee
 will observe that on this
 cali he basa right to
 have his proposition considered if
 it makes no appropriation Mr
 MAYNARD It makes no appropriation
 Thé SPEAKER Then it is
 in order Mr THOMAS I
 understood that this was a
 mere call for réference The
 SPEAKER No it is the
 regular call Mr THOMAS Then
 I hope my colleague will
 give me an opportunity of
 being heard for a few
 minutes on thYs subject Mr
 MAYNARD willingly yield the Aoor
 to my colleague to present
 his views I do not
 want to take any advantage
 of him or any other
 n uetn ber of the
 House but 1 think that
 justice to this claimant requires
 the adoption of the resolution
 Mr THOMAS had occasion when
 I was a member of
 the Committee of Claims some
 ten or twelve years ago
 to spend some two weeks
 in the examination of tlus
 claim and therefore am pretty
 familiar with the character of
 the case although many of
 the facts Pare not now
 fresh in my memory The
 case has undergone the ex
 amination of comrnittee after committee
 and Con gress after Congress
 and it has been uniformly
 after full and el orate
 investi yation rejected It has
 also been before the Court
 of Claims and there rejected
 This claim has been hanging
 about the lobbies of the
 House of Representatives to my
 own personal knowledge for twelve
 years and from history nearly
 thirty years After the parties
 had had over twenty years
 to prepare their case it
 was thoroughly examined iii the
 House of Representatives and was
 voted down by a very
 large majority It is now
 proposed after the Court of
 ClQims has given the matter
 a careful examination where both
 parties were represented by counsel
 to vefer it back o
 that court and to ask
 the court to devote another
 week or month to its
 investigation If my memory were
 clea me to state all
 the facts I h e
 no douMhat this resolution would
 bev ted wn by more
 than two thirds majority According
 to my recollection Mr Speaker
 this claim originated for breadstuffs
 furnished to the Spanish nation
 during the war of 1812
 14 It will be recollected
 that during that period the
 United States were at war
 with Great Britain and that
 Great Britain was at war
 with France Spain was the
 ally of our enemy Great
 Britain Mr Meade who was
 an American citizen had gone
 to Spain soille years before
 and had so far become
 a sub ject of that
 Government that he was actually
 an omce hölder in the
 city of Madrid He was
 a I dealer in produce
 and as such furnished the
 Spanish arrny with their breadstuffs
 during that war When peace
 was restored after the battle
 of Waterloo this Mr Meade
 had a settlernent with the
 King of Spain which showed
 the Spanish Govermnent to be
 in his debt to the
 amount of some 600 000
 and an acknowledgment of that
 debt was duly executed All
 this time the United States
 were ignorant that such a
 man as Meade I lived
 The first in formation that
 we had of him or
 his claim was when friendly
 relations were re stored and
 when our minister went to
 Madrid Our ruinister there received
 a written communica tion from
 Mr Meade who had quarreled
 with I the King of
 Spain and had been irnprisoned
 He applied to the American
 minister to have his rights
 adjusted Our minister interfered so
 far as to have Mr
 Meade released from prison He
 was re leased and returned
 to the United States After
 I the treaty for the
 cession of Florida Mr Meade
 requested our Government to send
 an agent to the Court
 of Spain to get the
 evidence of the indebt edness
 of that kingdom to him
 in order to lay ft
 before the commissioners who were
 required to make a settlement
 of the money to be
 paid by our Government to
 Spain for the benefit of
 United i States claimants Our
 Government not feeling it I
 rrhe i I to the
 Court of Claims where they
 hdd the beh efit of
 counsel and the benefit of
 thirty years ac cumuiation of
 testimony and it was there
 rejected am sorry sir that
 my colleague for whom I
 entertain so high a regard
 should be again at tempting
 to embarrass this Government with
 a further investigation of this
 claim I had n o
 idea that it was ever
 to come here again I
 have stated the facts from
 recollection but I believe that
 I have stated them accurately
 at least in substance am
 satisfied that it is a
 claim in regard to which
 this Government should not be
 furt her troubled I therefore
 move to lay the resolution
 the table unless my friend
 should desire to say something
 in regard to it Mr
 MAYNARD My colleague will recol
 lect that I have the
 floor and that he only
 held it by my courtesy
 Iam not surprised Mr Speaker
 from the statement which my
 friend and colleague has made
 of what he supposes to
 be the facts in connection
 with the claim that his
 mind should incline vainst it
 I hold in my hand
 the opinion of the majority
 of the Court of Claims
 and it is enough to
 say that they based their
 action on no such ground
 will state in a few
 words what are the main
 leading facts in the case
 and which have induced the
 Committee of Claims to recom
 mend the case to be
 referred back for a rehear
 Ing Richard W Meade had
 in his lifetime a claim
 arising out of a contract
 and out of personal in
 jury against the Government of
 Spain Fl hat claim was
 recognized by that Government and
 by a board of commissioners
 was certified as a claim
 affainst the Government to an
 amount some thing less than
 my colleague has thing over
 three hundred thousand dollars Ti
 hat was prior to the
 treaty of 1819 Wilh Spain
 By the tcrms of that
 treaty under which we acquired
 the now recusant State of
 Florida the United States undertook
 and assumed to pay all
 the claims which her own
 citizbns had against the Spanish
 Government including of course this
 clai After the ratification of
 that treaty Congress appointed a
 board of commissioners to pass
 upon such claims as we
 had assumed by virtue of
 that treaty Mr Meade presented
 his claims us fall ing
 within the terms of that
 treaty and in support of
 it presented the certificate of
 the Spanish Gov ernment liquidatin
 Y and adjusting it and
 fixing the arnount The commission
 recognized the claim as falling
 within the purview of the
 treaty and liable to be
 satified by this Government m
 pursuanceofit butsuspended iton the ground
 that they would not admit
 it upon the certificate of
 the Spanish Government of its
 liquidation and adjust ment and
 required Mr Meade to produce
 his original vouchers upon which
 the liquidation of the Spanish
 Government took place and which
 were delivered up to the
 custody of that Govern ment
 and distributed throngh its various
 depart ments This Mr Meade
 was unable to do He
 was not able to obtain
 them from the custody of
 the Spanish Government and produce
 them be fore the commission
 until the commission had ex
 pired under the act by
 which it was appointed r
 I he consequence was that
 the claim was lost It
 had been assumed by this
 Government as be tween the
 Spanish Government and the claimants
 The commission had required evidence
 of the char acter which
 I have rnentioned and which
 it was Impossible for him
 to produce pending the ex
 istence of the commission the
 result was that the claim
 was not allowed It is
 true that the claim came
 before Congress and that it
 has been examined and passed
 on by one House or
 the other again and again
 It went to the Court
 of Claims and it was
 therc considered and was decided
 by the inaiority adversely the
 minority of the court presenting
 at the same time in
 favor of the claim The
 decision of the major ity
 of the court was placed
 upon the ground that Mr
 Meade having once had a
 day in court and having
 failed to establish his claim
 before the com their duty
 did not make the application
 commissioners held their sessions for
 two years mission in accordance
 with their requirements had lost
 it by laches in this
 city They made their awards
 and dis l he Committee
 of Claims thought that to
 say tributed the 5 000
 000 pro rata among the
 claim ants whodid present their
 claims But Mr Meade the
 least the rejection of the
 claim was made upon u
 p o nan that the

 it is possible that in

 Ihave many times known a

 an evéry dåy practice Mr

 any friend if he knows
 how often this case has
 beeh by Congress I rcmcmber
 that it was once rejected
 upon the argumentof Silas Wright
 in the Senate I remember
 that it Wits rejected in
 thisHouse once upon the argumentöf
 Joshua R Giddiigs against it
 I remember that it was
 on another occasion rejected upon
 the argument of a gentleman
 whose nåme I do not
 now call to mind I
 know that this case has
 undergone the thorough inve tigationrof
 men of all sections and
 of all parties 11t has
 been rejected by the Court

 if my friend from I
 ennessee dan present iny fact
 X vliioh Witl throw any
 additional light on the subject
 I am willing that it
 shall again be considered but
 not otherwise Mr MAYNARD 1
 have not examined the congressional
 history of this claim but
 my im pression is that
 it has at various times
 received the favorable action of
 committees of both Houses of
 Congress The Committee of Claims
 how ever examined the case
 upon the record presented by
 the Court of Claims and
 they have reported thi resolu
 tion in accordance with what
 they con sidered to be
 well settled principles of legal
 piiae I move the previous
 question upon the tice I

 him why he has inserted
 into the resolution the pro
 vision that there is to
 be a rehearing upon the
 merits of the case Mr
 MAYNARD I can assure the
 gentleman that those vords were
 not put there to cover
 up or conceal anything more
 than appears in the If
 there is any objection to
 that phrase report ology I
 am perfectly willing that those
 words shall be stricken out
 Mr STEVENS of Pennsylvania the
 gentleman s attention to the
 phraséology be cause I knew
 that it has been generaliy
 construed to give the auditing
 offcers a sort of licentious
 discretion for any report they
 may make Mr MAYNARD perhaps
 should have had very highly
 technical ground because it will
 be read the report of
 the committee which accom who
 did not apply for any
 portion of it has since
 seen that upon the investigation
 of the c aim the

 will be seen by that
 come up and besieged Congress
 and since his death his
 representatives have been pressing the
 mcrits of it had not
 been inquired into It wasa
 port that the committee expressly
 forbore to claim till it
 was rejected so overwhelmingly that
 case in which the obligation
 of Spain to pay had
 express any opinion upon the
 merits Of the case they
 lost all hope in the

 following clause being u nder
 consideration For colnpellsation to postmasters
 2 728 734 Mr COLFAX
 said am instructed by the
 Committee on the Post Office
 and Post Roads to offer
 the following amendment Strike off
 28 734 and to add
 as a proviso to the
 clause just read Provided That
 no compensation shall be paid
 to post masters after the
 30th of Junc 1861 tor
 the delivery of free letters
 or papers to their recipients
 can explain this amendment in
 a few words By a
 singular anomaly in the post
 omce laws although postmasters receive
 no compensation for the delivery
 of public documents and franked
 speeches yet there are two
 branches of free mat ter
 for the distribution of which
 they do receive compensation out
 of the Treasury One is
 one cent for the delivery
 of free letters for which
 the Government receivesnopostagc The other
 grosvs out of the delivery
 of newspapers distributed free of
 postage in the county where
 they are published The postmasters
 are allowed two mills for
 the de livery of each
 of such papers which amounls
 to ten and one fifth
 cents per year for the
 delivery of weekly papers in
 the counties where they are
 pub lished while the Government
 receives no postage at all
 but carries such paper free
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Upon
 conference with the Post Offce
 Depart ment it was thought
 this would save 30 000
 a year The postmasters are
 required by lassv to distribute
 all other free matter for
 which no com pensation is
 received by the Department We
 want to make the law
 general that no compensa tion
 shall for the delivery of
 free matter The amendment was
 agreed to Mr WHITELEY 1
 desire to offer an amend
 ment to come in afterline
 thirty six in reference to
 the salaries of route agents
 I wish to call the
 attention of the chairman of
 the Committee on the Post
 Office and Post Roads to
 this fact two weeks ago
 we increased the salaries of
 the clerks in the Washington
 city post offce on account
 of the amount of documents
 which they are compelled I
 wish to call his attention
 to the fur to handle
 ther fact that last year
 upon his own motion the
 salaries of the route agents
 throughout the country were fixed
 at 800 each Now sir
 I de sire to say
 that the salaries of the
 route agents be tween Washington
 and Philadelphia and Wash ington
 and Richmond should be increased
 upon the same principle upon
 which the salaries of the
 clerks in the post offce
 here were increased The truth
 is they have more to
 do with the handling of
 documents than the clerks in
 the city post offcc I
 therefore propose the following amendment
 That the salaries of route
 agents from Washington to Philadelphia
 and from Washington to Richmond
 shall be 1 000 Mr
 COLFAX I am opposed to
 this amend ment because I
 believe that you can find
 plenty ot competent and experienced
 persons to perfbrm those duties
 at the present rate of
 compensation The gentleman is mistaken
 in saying that we rec
 ommended the other day an
 increase of the com pensation
 of the clerks in the
 city post office here What
 we did was merely to
 continue a law which was
 passed in 1854 upon the
 motion of Mr Rusk of
 Texas then chairman of the
 Senate Post Oflice Committee providing
 that there should be a
 small fund out of which
 clerks in the city post
 ofiicc of this city shall
 be paid forcxtra labor imposed
 upon them limiting the amount
 to 250 to each clerk
 The amount allowed to the
 clerks in post offices is
 based upon the commissions accrumg
 to that offce Now in
 a post offce like this
 where the mails both incoming
 and outgoing are mostly composed
 of free matter the revenue
 must be very much curtailed
 The enormous amount of free
 matter which passes through the
 city post offce requires the
 services of a larger number
 of clerks than is required
 by any other post office
 in the country collecting the
 same amount of post ages
 Mr x VHITELEY Do 1
 the gen tleman to say
 that the clerks in this
 office are paid by commissions
 I believe they receive a
 regular salary let their duties
 be what they may ri
 he truth in reference to
 these documents is that most
 of them are put up
 here in bags and carried
 di rectly to the railroad
 when the route wrents have
 i all the trouble of
 them Mr COLFAX The clerks
 in the post office here
 receive a regular salary I
 concede but the number of
 clerks must be regulated by
 the amount of money which
 can be paid them out
 of the com missions of
 the office Where almost the
 entire amount of the nails
 outgoing and incoming are composed
 of free matter the number
 of cferks must be diminished
 if their salaries are limited
 by the amount of postages
 accruing In recommending the other
 day the continu ation of
 the old law of 1854
 we only acted upon the
 recommendation of the Post Office
 Depart ment which was concurred
 in by the committee of
 the Housc unanimously But the
 Post Offce Department has not
 asked for an increase the
 salaries of the route aøcnts
 and I do not think
 it necessary Mr FLORENCE I
 desire simply to say to
 the chairman of the Committeeeon
 the Post Office and Post
 Roads that an amendment to
 pay the same percentage to
 the route agents not to
 exceed 250 which is paid
 to the clerks in thc
 city post offce here ought
 to pass The clerks here
 get 1 200 and 1
 400 a year while the
 route agents get only 800
 I only ask that the
 same degree of justice shall
 be extended to the route
 agents greater degree and they
 are more entitled tö the
 250 than thc clerks are
 The clerks in the p6ét
 omce receive most of these
 documents packed in I do
 not at all mean to
 detract from their bags I
 do not mean to say
 that they are not labors
 entitled to thc 250 but
 I do mean to say
 and say it to the
 chairman of the Committee on
 the Post Office and Post
 Roads that these route agents
 are entitled to it in
 an enlarged degree for they
 take the documents in bulk
 take them out of the
 wacons at the cars and
 have harder work in ref
 erence to them than the
 clerks in the post offce
 have It is but manifest
 fairness that this amount should
 be accorded to them at
 the rate of one mill
 per pound not t o
 exceed in all 250 The
 gen tleman from Indiana who
 has given so much at
 tention to this matter will
 see the fairness of his
 proposition and I hope he
 will agree to it When
 thawgentleman goes into the Post
 Offce Depart ment and I
 may say without any eulogy
 that I hope he may
 bo permitted to do so
 he will have a better
 practical knowledge of these matters
 and I know he will
 agree to this proposition as
 soon as he investigates it
 Mr STANTON 1 would like
 to try the periment of
 equalizing the other pay I
 would route agents and provide
 move to strike out that
 the clerks shall not receive
 more than 800 Gentlemen talk
 about equalizing but they always
 equalize up while I would
 rathcr equalize down Mr WI
 IITELEY wo equalized last year
 For instance the upon these
 very route agents route agents
 between Philadelphia and Washing ton
 were receiving 1 000 And
 upon the motion of the
 chairman of the Cornmittee on
 the Post Offce and Post
 Roads they were cut down
 to 800 There is another
 consideration in reference to this
 matter worthy of consideration These
 route If their aaents have
 really to live in two
 cities home is in Philadelphia
 their odd nights are spent
 here Ilhus they are subjected
 to a great deal of
 extra expense and as I
 said before they perform the
 bulk of the labor in
 reference to these documents All
 our books are packed in
 bags and if they go
 to the city post offce
 at all they are merely
 handed to the pavement and
 placed in the mail wagons
 The clerks in the city
 post omce have nothing to
 do with them The route
 I agents have the handling
 of them altogether think it
 nothing more than just and
 fair to give to thosc
 who do this labor 200
 a year more than they
 now receive or rather as
 I have rnodified the amendment
 to say that their salaries
 shall not begin to gaged
 in handlilig th esé mäils
 tliö will find will be
 that then poßtmastérs iin lotbet
 omces besides that avWashingtöii city
 pWiWapÉIy for an increase of
 pay with tice All the
 route agents have ithäse bulky
 bags of documehtsis to cars
 from the mail messengerSj Who
 yasgidt åv üt ting them
 on the cars th Y
 u e pile u there
 and when they arrivema t
 are thrown outwithout any extra
 care as Ikhov from personal
 observation because they ri6t handled
 with as much Care as
 bags of lét ters is
 it needful that they should
 be All the roüte agents
 have to do with these
 bags Of documents ig to
 assist in putting them on
 the cars and in taking
 them off I can see
 no reason for this proposed
 increase of salary Mr HUGHES
 1 think it very bad
 policy to pay inadequate salaries
 incommensurate with the labors androsponsibilities
 connected with the charge of
 the duties of an offce
 and Lknow that the duties
 upon these two routes are
 very oner ous and responsible
 Allow Ime to Say Iii
 con nection with my first
 proposition thåt I haverno question
 that if you were to
 put up all under this
 Government at public auctiöh to
 the lowest bidder you would
 find men who would discharge
 for 500 a year the
 duties of omees for Which
 we now pay 2 000
 being dear at that You
 will find many a man
 v ho will fill the
 dffée of President of the
 United States for 1 000
 a yea if you will
 give it to him and
 he will make per haps
 100 000 annually by the
 bargain and so It is
 in my judgment the with
 all our ofices worst possible
 policy that the Government could
 I adopt to pay low
 salaries for important servicess i
 It is anti democratic not
 in a party but in
 a gen eral and political
 sense I am always in
 favor of paying a good
 fair salary to every man
 whö charges duties under the
 Government in propor tion to
 their importance and responsibility I
 am satisfied that it is
 the best possible bond for
 fidelity that you can exact
 froin your public om I
 know that offcers of the
 engineers ate cers placed upon
 their honor and with very
 inäde quate compensation They give
 rio bonds arid yet millions
 and millions of dollars are
 disbui sed simply upon tho
 honor of the offcer and
 upon his commission with the
 greatest economy and hon esty
 These route agents have not
 only Very Ileavy physical labors
 devolved upon them but very
 grave responsibilities I would wish
 to pay the route agents
 upon all the more important
 lines exceed 1 000 giving
 the Postmaster General far larger
 salaries than they now receive
 and I power to raise
 them from 800 to 1
 000 if he do hope
 that the House will agree
 to increase the salaries of
 the agents upon these two
 routes to sees fit Mr
 COLFAX Mr Chairman oppose the
 amendment of the gentleman from
 Ohio Mr STANTON to reduce
 the salary of these clerks
 in the Post Office The
 CHAIRMAN That amendment was not
 received Mr COLFAX In reply
 to the gentleman from Delaware
 and the gentleman from Pennsylvania
 I will state what they
 very well know that the
 E route agents are off
 duty part of the time
 while the clerks in the
 post office are on duty
 all the time the whole
 year round So that that
 argu ment falls The gentleman
 shakes his head as much
 as to say that the
 route agents are not off
 duty part of the time
 He is aware that there
 are always upon every large
 mail route a surplus of
 route agents and they alternate
 Mr WHITELEY Not between here
 and Philadelphia and I am
 old that they even have
 to run on Sundays Mr
 COLFAX I know that as
 a general rule there is
 a surplus of route aoents
 because men cannot go over
 a route every day distributing
 mail matter handlino heavy bags
 stdnding on their feet all
 the time without relaxation Mr
 WI II I ELEY I
 am told by these agcnt
 s I know nothing about
 the matter personallv that there
 are no extra agents upon
 the route be tween here
 and Philadelphia and Then they
 are sick they have to
 pay a man to go
 in their places the small
 amount asked for by the
 gentleman from Delaware Mr FLORENCE
 1 desire merely to say
 to and Post Roads that
 the route agents between this
 city and Philadelphia are empioyed
 all their time There is
 artrain that leaves this city
 at twenty minutes after Six
 o clock in the mormng
 and they are occupied till
 two o clöCk p m
 They leave Philadelphia next day
 at twelve o clock and
 are occupied till six o
 clock p m Then there
 is a night lines which
 leaves Philadel phia at eleven
 o clock at night and
 arrives here at six cPclockin
 the morning and they are
 occu pied the whole night
 Then sir they work séveh
 days in the week and
 are not exempted from work
 on Sundays There is also
 a slower line that occupies
 several hours a day leaving
 here early in the morning
 and reaching Philadelphia at half
 past three o clock Now
 I ask nothing more in
 relation to this matter than
 that a simplc act of
 justice shall be done to
 these men and that the
 same allowance shall be made
 to them as is made
 to the clerks in the
 post offce who manipulate the
 same docu Ehe gentleman from
 Indiana suggests ments that the
 postmasters along the route may
 ask the same compensation Sir
 they are not entitled to
 it because they do not
 handle this entire amount of
 documents that pass through the
 hands of these route agents
 and is distributed by them
 along the out of their
 own salaries Mr COLFAX Onc
 word further upon this I
 route This is not a
 propositiomto increase the subject Iam
 surprised at the st itement
 ofthe gen tlenhan from Delaware
 in reference to the route
 give these six or eight
 persons the same compen from
 Washington to Philadclphia and from

 The whole clerks here for
 the reason that they manipulate

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 15
 the question of reduction ofcompensation
 as sug gested by the
 gentleman from Ohio Mr STAN
 TON If the gentleman desires
 just at this partic ular
 time to reduce the compensation
 of all the officers in
 the er4ployment of the Government
 throughout the country am sure
 it will not make any
 difference to any friends of
 mine forl suppose I shall
 receive very little consideration in
 relation to such matters aftera
 few days butl tell the
 gen tleman candidly that I
 would not vote for any
 such reduction 1 agree with
 the gentleman from Maryland that
 in order to secure the
 necessary talent and ability the
 Government must pay fur compensation
 to its offcers and I
 have always pursued that policy
 here and I have been
 sus taincd for a long
 time by _ my constituents
 in so doing Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE 1 would to vote
 for the amendment of my
 friendi but his re marks
 have left me somewhat in
 doubt He declares that he
 apprehends great danger to his
 friends I would recompense his
 friends on ac count of
 any danger they are in
 but I do notknow the
 precise nature of it Me
 also remarks that these gentlemen
 are em played every night
 for seven days in the
 week Now if my friend
 intends and I believe he
 does to express that they
 arc employed both day and
 night then the more willingly
 will I vote for his
 amendment I ask him whether
 Iam justified in drqwing that
 conclusion Mr FLORENCE If the
 gentleman from New York had
 started on a proper foundation
 I might be to answer
 all his questions but the
 gen tleman cannot have criven
 attention to the business in
 hand or he would not
 have credited to me the
 inauguration of a suggestion which
 was made by the gentleman
 from Delaware Mr WHITELEY I
 was merely the first lieutenant
 merely training in the company
 of that gentleman I was
 only aiding him in effectinga
 just purpose The gen tleman
 remarks about me saying that
 these men worked every night
 in the week I did
 not say so I said
 that they were employed day
 and night for seven days
 in the week Laughter Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 am perfectly
 sat isfied I shall vote
 for this amendment Laughter The
 amendment was not agreed to
 Mr COLFAX I am requested
 by the Post Offce Department
 and authorized by the Post
 Offce Committee to offer the
 followirp amend ment Rnd be
 it further enactcd That the
 third section of the act
 making provision for the postal
 service in Calitörnia Oregon and
 Washington approved July 27 1854
 be and the is hereby
 repealed and that all dead
 letters which may accumulate in
 the post offices in said
 States and Iter ritory after
 the 30th of June next
 shall be returned to the
 General Post Otfiee at Washington
 under such regulations as die
 Postmaster General nay lirect By
 the present law the dead
 Ictters which ac cumulate on
 the Pacific coast are sent
 to San Fran Cisco where
 they are opened in a
 dead letter branch offe e
 and the money letters are
 returned to the persons that
 sent thcnl It has been
 found by experience that that
 is a rather poorly paying
 experiment A letter from the
 Postmaster Gen eral which have
 here states that it costs
 3 000 a year to
 perform that service and that
 only sev enty three valuable
 letters per quarter are re
 turned He therefore asks that
 that section of the law
 be repealed and that the
 dead letters of the Pacific
 coast be sent here just
 as all other dead letters
 are The letter from the
 Postmaster General is as follows
 POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT February 4
 1861 SIR My attention has
 just been called to the
 operation of the dead letter
 office in San Francisco California
 tor the last quarter ended
 31st December The whole number
 of letters received there was
 20 299 Foreign letters returned
 to Washington unopened 964 Whole
 number opened 19 335 Of
 the number onc hundred and
 fifty nine were preserved as
 valuable and eighty Si f
 returned to Washington leav ing
 only seventy three returned to
 writers on the Pacific coast
 The expenses of the offce
 for the quarter were 675
 There seems to no good
 reason why these dead letters
 should not now be returned
 to this Department saving near
 vantage in having them opened
 in San Francisco is in
 returning somewhat sooner to the
 writers the very small number
 of valuable letters only seventy
 three last quarter originally mailed
 on the Pacific coast Under
 existing regulations the letters from
 the larger otices would be
 returned regularly three months after
 the date of advertising or
 two months if the law
 be changed as not all
 be allowed to accumulate to
 the end of a post
 office quarter so that but
 little comparative Iy would be
 added to the weight of
 the nails each trip I
 submit a section repealing the
 law of 1854 and provid
 ing för the return of
 all dead letters to this
 Department which if approved you
 will please add to the
 pending bill No 714 i
 have the honor to be
 very respectfully yours c HORATIO
 KING Acting Postmaster General Hon
 SCHUYLER COLFAX Chairman Committee Post
 Offce and Post Roads House
 of Representatives The question was
 taken and the amendment was
 agreed to I desire to
 Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois offer
 an amendment to the first
 section to come in at
 the end of the tenth
 line merely directing the Postmaster
 General to reexamine the causes
 of the discontinuance of mail
 routes Mr QUARLES Have we
 not passed from that section
 and is it not too
 late to offer this amendment
 The CHAIRMAN The gentleman from
 nois was deprived of the
 opportunity of present ing his
 amendment and therefore itmay be
 offered now Mr SHERMAN I
 do not waive the point
 of pertinency I shall raise
 the point that the amend
 ment of the gentleman from
 Illinois is not in order
 Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois On
 what grounds Mr SHERMAN On
 the ground that it changes
 existing law Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois Not at all Let
 the amendment be read Mr
 GROW I suppose the gentleman
 from Illinois is not particular
 to have his amendment offered
 at this point of the
 bill and would as lief
 bring it in at the
 end of the bill M
 r WASHBURNE of Illinois That
 will be satisfactorv The Clei
 k read the next section
 of the bill as follows
 SEC 2 Rnd be it
 further enacted That if the
 revenues of the Post Office
 Department shall be insufficient to
 meet the appropriations ofthis act
 then the surn of 5
 391 350 63 or so
 much thereof as may bc
 necessary be and the same
 is hereby appropriated to be
 paid out of any money
 in the I reasury not
 otherwise appropriated to supply deficiencies
 in the revenue of the
 Post Office Department for the
 year ending the 30th of
 June 1862 Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 offer the follow ing
 amendment as an additional section
 SEC and be it further
 enacted That the Postmaster General
 be and is h ereby
 authorized and empowered to advertise
 for and to receive proposals
 specifying for what con pensation
 the round trip and in
 what description of steam vessels
 as to structure speed and
 dimensions a United States mail
 to and fronl San Francisco
 in Califor nia and Shanghae
 in China monthly is otlbred
 to bc car ried and
 delivered The tivne for receiving
 such proposaks to be limited
 at the discretion of the
 Postmaster General and to be
 advertised in such public newspaøers
 as he shall designate Such
 proposals to be opened by
 the Postmaster General and to
 be by him together with
 his report on the saunc
 transrnitted to the next Congress
 at the opening tl ereof
 Mr COLFAX I must reluctantly
 raise a point of order
 on the amendment offered by
 my Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1
 am alittle uncer tain myself
 as to whether the amendment
 is in order but it
 is of so beneficial a
 character that I presume it
 will be admitted The CHAIRMAN
 The amendment is notin order
 Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois I
 offer the following amendment And
 the Postmaster is hereby directed
 to reöxamine the causes för
 the discontinuance or curtailment of
 postal ser vice on inland
 routes since the 4th of
 March 1859 and to restore
 all such parts of said
 service as can be restored
 with due regard to tile
 public interest and the circumstances
 of each case where such
 discontinuance or curtailment was on
 contracts yet in force or
 have taken effect on the
 making of new contracts Protided
 however That the res toration
 or increase of service hereby
 contcinplated shall be with the
 assent of the contractor in
 each case in pur suance
 of his contract Mr SHERMAN
 1 raise the point of
 order that this changes existing
 law Besides know that if
 the amendment were adopted by
 the House it would robably
 defeat the Post Office bill
 Mr VASHBURNE of Illinois like
 to have the gentleman from
 Ohio state in what respect
 the amendment changes existing law
 and why its adoption should
 defeat this bill Mr SHERMAN
 1 suppose it changes exist
 ing law otherwise the gentleman
 from Illinois would not desire
 to offer it Mr GROW
 By the law as it
 stands now the Postmaster General
 can reexamine this mat ter
 and restore the increased service
 The amend ment therefore does
 not propose to change the
 law It simply requires the
 Postrnaster General to go over
 the matter again and if
 in his judg ment the
 increased service ought to be
 restored to restore it The
 CHAIRMAN The Chair thinks that
 the point of order is
 well taken Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois 1 will mod ify
 my amendment so as to
 make it in order offer
 It as a proviso as
 follows Provided This appropriation is
 hereby made on condi tion
 that the Postmaster General shall
 reexamine the causes for discontinuance
 Ec Mr SHERMAN 1 submit
 that that change does not
 vary the matter and that
 the amendment is not in
 order Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 1 would like to ask
 the gentleman from Ohio What
 was the position which he
 took in regard to the
 proviso to the Army bill
 in the Thirty Fourth Congress
 Mr SHERMAN 1 in favor
 of that pro viso and
 am yét but am not
 in favor of this pro
 viso Mr They occupy precisel
 the same ground Mr dROW
 one thing 1 think is
 that the body which appropriates
 nioney can put a limit
 on that appropriation There is
 no question in my mind
 but that this is clearly
 in order Whether the House
 ought to pass it or
 not is for its own
 judgment Whether the limitation is
 a proper one or not
 is a matter which goes
 to the discret ion of
 the body that appropriates money
 It is not a matter
 for a point of order
 The ob ject of this
 amendment is that the money
 appro priated shall be expended
 in a particular way otherwise
 it shall not be appropriated
 at all Therefore a condition
 of this kind is always
 in order Mr SHERMAN 1
 to say that in 1854
 in the instance to which
 the gentleman refers the amendment
 was ruled out of order
 but the de cision was
 overruled by the House Mr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois Did not
 the gehlleman from Ohio vote
 for overruling the de cision
 of the Chair Mr SHERMAN
 Undoubtedly Mr GROW I think
 the gentleman from Ohio is
 mistaken I think the amendment
 was first ruled to be
 in order but that afterwards
 when Mr HOUSTON was in
 the chair it was decided
 by him to be out
 of order Mr SHERMAN Not
 at all The amend ment
 was first ruled out of
 order by Mr Leiter when
 in the chair and overruled
 by the House The CHAIRMAN
 The Chair is of opinion
 that in its present shape
 the amendment cuts pretty close
 but he will decide it
 to be in order r
 he question is upon the
 amendment Mr SHERMAN I hope
 the amendment will not be
 adopted for it may just
 as well be under stood
 now that its passage by
 this House will bring on
 again the same quarrel with
 the Senate which nearly defeated
 the Post Office appropria tion
 bill in the last session
 of Congress I have no
 doubt that the Senate will
 insist upon the de feat
 of the amendment if it
 is adopted by the House
 to the defeat of the
 bill itself I trust therefore
 that without regard to the
 merit of the amendment at
 this late period of the
 session the House will not
 insist upon entering upon this
 contest with the Senate which
 in my judgment will as
 I have said possibly defeat
 the bill alto gether but
 that the amendment will be
 voted down WASHBURNE of Illinois
 The gentle man from Ohio
 can certainly have no conception
 of what tha amendment really
 is It is not an
 amendment directing the Postmaster General
 to restore this service but
 it is merely a proposition
 to direct him to reexamine
 all these cases and act
 upon his own discretion as
 to what routes the public
 interest requires the service to
 be restored Now sir I
 do not know by what
 authority the gentleman from Ohio
 speaks when he says that
 this amendment which is just
 in itself in which his
 constituents and the constituents of
 every member of this House
 are interested I say I
 do not know upon what
 authority the gentleman says this
 amendment if adopted will haye
 the 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 997 effect of defeating the
 passage of the bill W
 hy sir there is no
 similarity between this amendment and
 the one on which the
 quarr el between the Senate
 and House grew up in
 thö last session That wasa
 peremptory requirement upon the part
 of Congress that tbe Postmaster
 General should reéstablish this service
 And let me tell the
 gen tleman that two thirds
 of the members of the
 House at the last session
 voted half a dozen times
 for that amendment Yes sir
 the members of this House
 representing the people the men
 at the cross roads who
 are the sufferers from the
 curtailmen t of the mail
 service two thirds of them
 have voted halfa dozen times
 for the absolute res toration
 of this service It is
 true that amend ment gave
 rise to a good deal
 of feeling The Postmaster General
 came into this House and
 en deavored personally to induce
 members of the House to
 vote against it Finally as
 the last sands of the
 session were running out the
 amend ment was defeated by
 the act of a committee
 of conference and the House
 receded I am sorry to
 say from thé high position
 it had assumed in defense
 of the rights of the
 people Sir we are here
 ready to vote away millions
 upon millions of dollars for
 almost everything but when you
 come to consider the question
 of mail service upon the
 little routes for the benefit
 of our constituents you say
 the proposition must not be
 adopted and that the Senate
 will defeat the whole appropriation
 bid if it is Now
 sir I hope this amendment
 will be adopted It is
 simply saying to the Postmaster
 General You shall examine these
 routes one by one and
 shall determine in each case
 what the public interest demands
 and whether there shall be
 a reéstablishment of the mail
 service or not Mr Chairman
 I speak feelingly in this
 matter in reference to my
 own district In the last
 Con gress I had some
 statistics prepared showing that m
 that district the maii facilkties
 uvere cut off to some
 twenty eight thousand dollars yet
 that dis trict paid into
 the Treasury beyond the expenses
 of the post offces a
 surplus of 22 000 while
 in certain other districts in
 another part of the country
 not paying 4 000 into
 the Treasury the mail service
 was not curtailed or interfered
 with at all Now sir
 I have heretofore been in
 favor of the Congress of
 the United States if this
 House of Representatives would hold
 the purse strings of the
 nation sayirp to the Postmaster
 General You shall restore these
 routes every one of them
 but in the condition which
 the Treasury is in at
 this time I am willing
 to leave the matter where
 this amendment leaves it in
 the discretion o the Postmaster
 General after examining the routes
 with reference to the wants
 of the people to restore
 them or not as he
 may see proper Bat suppose
 the House refuse to adopt
 the amendment and a member
 comes before the Post master
 General and asks for the
 restoration of service on a
 particular route he will be
 told that the matter has
 already been decided upon by
 the Department that the question
 has once been de terrnincd
 and that according to the
 rules that govern the Department
 he cannot take up the
 case Mr MAYNARD 1 wish
 to ask the gentle man
 from Iiiino occupying as he
 does a high position in
 his party whether he is
 prepared to say the new
 Postmaster General vy ill feel
 himself bound by the action
 of his predecessor in this
 I decision made by his
 predecessor it will in my
 judgment materially Weaken coxifidcnce in
 the new Administration Mr GROW
 Yes there is a good
 deal that requires reéxamination Mr
 PHELPS 1 have yet to
 learn that the Execu tive
 Departments actin the manner indicated
 by the gentleman from Illinois
 in adjudicating upon the matter
 of putting mail service upon
 the post routes of the
 country During my expe ricnce
 from time to time the
 Post Office Depart ment has
 refused to increase the service
 upon par ticulat routes and
 afterwards tlke service has been
 increased but ncver have I
 met with the oujec tion
 that a particular Postmaster General
 declined to increas e the
 service upon a route because
 his predecessor had so declined
 or because the Post master
 General had previous to that
 time exam ined and decided
 the case I submit Mr
 Chair man that the Postmaster
 General has it now in
 his power if he desires
 to increase the service upon
 that route if in his
 judgment the interest of the
 publicdemandit Butif this amendment be
 adopt ed it will be
 construed by him into an
 instruction to restore the service
 upon all those discontinued rou
 tes under the action of
 the Postmaster General in 1859
 whether it is required by
 the public inter est or
 not This amendment was discussed
 during the last session of
 Congress and came near leading
 to the defeat of the
 Post Offce appropriation bill at
 that time and I shall
 be sorry to see any
 such amend ment placed upon
 this bill A new Administration
 is soon to be organized
 and the gen tleman from
 Illinois is one of the
 friends and supporters of that
 Administration If that Administration act
 with partiality in deciding upon
 questions like these then it
 will be partial on behalf
 of its political supporters and
 friends Therefore sir it seems
 to me that the gentleman
 from Illinois is the last
 gentleman who in advance ought
 to express distrust of the
 gentlenaan who may occupy the
 position of Postmaster General in
 the incoming Administration I say
 that the amendment of the
 gentleman from Illinois which is
 now pending does exhibit distrust
 of the abil ity and
 the integrity of the person
 who is to fill the
 offce of Postmaster General for
 the next four years Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri Mr Chairman
 I think with the gentleman
 from Illinois that the chairman
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Means has not read
 the amendment or else he
 would not make the objection
 he does Mr SHERMAN 1
 have heard it read Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri This amendment
 is scarcely akin to the
 amendment of the last ses
 Sion of Congress upon which
 the House and the Senate
 differed so much My colleague
 and the chairman of the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 forget that the amendment of
 the last session was i
 an absolute order upon the
 Postmaster General to restore the
 routes that had been discontinued
 Mr PHELPS 1 am aware
 that there is a dif
 ference of phraseology between the
 amendment now pending and that
 adopted at the last session
 of Congress I give it
 as my opinion that if
 this amendment be adopted it
 will be construed as mandatory
 upon the Postmaster General Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri can assure
 my colleague that if the
 head of the incoming Admin
 istration shall select for Postmaster
 General a fair minded and
 reasonable gentleman there will be
 no such construction as that
 he states put upon If
 the President elect should the
 amendment ple u pon the
 inland routesæhieb have beén dig
 continued Mr MAYNARD man that
 the ampndment does expvess ion
 of our own instead of
 leaving the réSiö aEiOi of
 service on any route that
 has beeh discontiåüed to théns
 discretion o f the upon
 an examination of ill the
 facts broughttffhisrnog tice I recolie_ct
 thaVI applied tosthe master General
 under this Administa ätionj torre
 store service tupon a 90S_t
 route in my which had
 been discontinued After the åOtsof
 the case had been presented
 he declined totestoi e the
 service On the death of
 Governor Brown application was made
 to his successor Thé case
 was reopened and upon a
 reéxamination the er vice was
 restored I do not know
 why the De partment cannot
 do the same thing in
 referenge to every post route
 where service has been discon
 tinued I think that we
 should leave it to the
 discretion of the Post Offce
 Department to decide after a
 review of the facts in
 each case whether service shall
 be restored or not Mr
 JOHN COCHRANE 1 ing amendment
 to the amendment The Clerk
 read as follows and proudedfurthér
 That this appropriation hereby made
 on condition that the Postmaster
 Genera I examine and inquire
 for what compensation the round
 trip and in what description
 of steam vessels asto structure
 speed and dimensions the United
 States mails to aid from
 San Francisco in California and
 Shangbae in Clijna monthly can
 be carried and delivered rand
 to refort to the next
 Cön gress at its opening
 his opinion thereof Mr WASHBURNE
 of Illinois 1 make the
 point of order that that
 amendment is not ger mane
 to my amendment The CHAIRMAN
 The Chair sustains the point
 of order Mr STANTON Mr
 Chairman me that the statement
 of the gentleman from Illi
 nois is a very extraordinary
 one He alleges that when
 the Department once decides against
 restoring a service the usage
 will not permit the matter
 to be reopened for reexamination
 That is a most extraordinary
 propositiön that in the chang
 ing business and population of
 this Ob untry a Postmaster
 General cannot at any time
 determine under the necessities of
 the country for or against
 the restoration of any service
 without regard to a previous
 decision of the Department made
 on a different state of
 facts Certainly the gentleman must
 be mistaken If the gentleman
 from Illinois shall accomplish anything
 by the amendment which he
 proposes it will simply be
 to cast the imputation on
 the Post Offce Department that
 he has no confidence that
 it will do its duty
 or in other words that
 has to be spurred up
 to it by the action
 of the two Houses I
 am sorry that my friend
 from Illinois should here in
 advance undertake to amend an
 appropriation bill which does not
 take effect until the 1st
 of July next in such
 a way as to indicate
 a want of confidence in
 the incoming Administra lion I
 have heard rumors that there
 was dissat isfaction to the
 new Administration in certain quarters
 butthe gentleman is the last
 one in whom I would
 have anticipated finding any such
 feeling Laughter Mr WASHBURNE of
 ffllinois 1 have no doubt
 that my advice expressed through
 a vote of the House
 in regard to the duty
 ofa Postmas ter General would
 be received and that consid
 eration given to it to
 which it is entitled Mr
 STANTON 1 will not cast
 such an im putation upon
 the incoming Administration as to
 respect Mr WASHBURNE 0f111inois Ibeheve
 by the rules of the
 Department when a matter has
 once been decided il is
 not to be reopened It
 is not considered as within
 the rules for one offcer
 to revise the opinions of
 his predecessor in regard I
 say therefore to these matters
 of business that when a
 member of this House goes
 to the Department and applies
 for a restoration of ser
 vice on a particular route
 he will be told I
 vly predecessor acted upon these
 routes and if this amendment
 shall be voted down he
 wikl be told also that
 the House of Representatives also
 sustained my predecessor in that
 action when the matter was
 brought deliberately before them they
 decided that there was to
 bc no restoration of mail
 service in thc country Mr
 MAYNARD 1 made my inquiry
 a mo ment ago for
 the reason that if it
 is to be under stood
 that the Postmaster General under
 the new Administration is in
 no case to reéxamine any
 take as I hope he
 will my friend from Indiana
 I give any vote that
 will indicate that this House
 has Mr COLFAX I will
 bc responsible that he will
 an apprehension that the Post
 Office Department will not do
 its whole duty without a
 special and never give the
 amendment any such construction extraordinary
 act of Congress The contest
 at the last session of
 Congress I re Now Mr
 Chairman i very much hope
 my member very well was
 one between the Senate headed
 by the President and Postmaster
 General friend from Indiana Mr
 COLFAX will be ap and
 this House and the people
 who desired to get their
 letters and papers by mail
 I believe that the amendment
 of he last session ought
 to have been enacted into
 law I believed then asl
 do now that the service
 which has been discontin ued
 ought to be restored When
 I heard the pend I
 ing amendment read I did
 not suppose that any gentleman
 upon this floor or any
 gentleman in the United States
 would object to having the
 matter reviewed and service restored
 wherever the pub lic interest
 and the condition of the
 Treasury I hope that the
 amendment will would permit it
 be adopted and that justice
 will be done the peo
 pointed Postmaster Generaf and I
 will cast no such imputation
 upon him have no apprehen
 Sion that anybody will be
 charged with the duties of
 that Department who will need
 any such insti gation on
 the part of Congress Whatever
 reason there may have been
 for the adoption of the
 amend ment at the last
 session when the Administration had
 a year to run there
 is none for it now
 because a change in the
 Post Offce Department is unavoid
 able There is no reason
 now to apprehend that the
 Postmaster General next year will
 not do his duty without
 this amendment Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois Mr Charr 038 man
 I will detain the committee
 for a moment only I
 understand the argument of my
 friend from Ohio He is
 opposed as he was at
 the last session of Congress
 in every possible shape to
 the people getting their mails
 The objection that the amendment
 is a censure upon the
 incoming Administration has no founda
 tion The amendment notifies the
 Postmaster General that we desire
 hillb as an executive om
 cer of this Government to
 reexamine certain eases in his
 Department and to act according
 to his dis eretion The
 idea that it is any
 reflection or any censure upon
 the incoming Administration is cer
 tainly unworthy of the distinguished
 gentleman from Ohio Mr COLFAX
 Mr Chairman 1 differ with
 my friend from Illinois in
 regard to one portion of
 his remarks He is right
 in saying that where one
 Pogtmaster General has decided upon
 a mat tor of damages
 his successor in the Department
 cannot reopen it except by
 authority of a new law
 but he is wrong in
 regard to the practice in
 cases for the extension or
 restriction of postal service in
 the country At the last
 session of Congress I coöperated
 with my friend from Illi
 nois deeming that the conductofPostmasterGen
 eral Holt had bcen unwise
 although I have al ways
 insisted that he acted with
 the very best motives Whether
 he had the right under
 the strict letter of the
 law of 1836 to cut
 down this service or not
 and the uniform practice of
 the Department for over twenty
 years has author ized it
 his wide spread razeeing of
 the postal service deprived many
 communities of long en joyed
 postal facilities while it bankrupted
 many worthy and effcient contractors
 say here now so that
 the committee of which I
 am chairman shall not be
 subjected to censure that wherever
 a contractor has laid before
 us evi dence that by
 this act unexpected as it
 was and I say it
 without any offense somewhat arbitrary
 in its character they had
 been bankrupted for they have
 generally proposed to carry the
 mails and wait for their
 ay until Congress should make
 an appropriation we have felt
 it our duty to rec
 ommend to Congress an approprit
 tion to such contractors You
 have passed one such bill
 to day for the relief
 of Hockaday Ligget and I
 think when you sum up
 the amounts saved to the
 Department by the curtailment of
 the postal service and place
 in the opposite scale the
 amount paid to contractors who
 have been bankrupted by this
 restriction and the amount you
 ought to pay them for
 many of them have not
 come here and presented their
 claims you will find that
 it was a losing experiment
 I believe that a large
 portion of that service could
 have been dispensed with but
 the action was too sweeping
 I believe that any Postmaster
 General 5 without instruction from
 this House ought to revise
 all the decisions and where
 the necessities of the country
 require the restoration of the
 service in whole or in
 part it should be given
 to them and I have
 no hesita tion in saying
 so by this amendment though
 I think it needless But
 I tell the gentleman from
 Illinois if he apprehends that
 under this instruc tion a
 large portion of the service
 will be restored he will
 have to put his amendment
 in the shapc it was
 last session containing an additional
 ap propriation because this deficiency
 of 5 391 350 contained
 in the second section of
 this bill is de signed
 to cover only the present
 service You may direct the
 Postmaster General to increase the
 service as much as you
 choose yet you must in
 the same bill give hhn
 the means to do so
 He cannot go to any
 material amount beyond the ap
 propriations contained in thc bill
 as the gentle man must
 be aware The CHAIRMAN appointed
 Mr BARR and Mr ELY
 as tellers The committee divided
 and the tellers reported ayes
 sixty six Mr SHERMAN I
 propose that thc count by
 tellers be discontinued with the
 understanding that we shall have
 a vote upon this amendment
 in the House No objection
 being made the count was
 dis continued Mr COLFAX Upon
 the recommendation of the Postmaster
 General in his annual reports
 I offer the following amendment
 and be it further enacted
 That the amounts foUnd due
 upon contracts for overland mails
 authorized by Congress shan hereafter
 be paid from the Treasury
 of the United CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 15 States out of
 any money therein not otherwise
 appropri ated instead of the
 revenue of the Post OMce
 Department upon the certificate of
 the Postmaster General and the
 Postmaster General shall report the
 amount thereof at the opening
 of the next session of
 Congress Mr SHERMAN upon that
 amendment It changes the existing
 law Mr COLFAX Before that
 pointisdecided l desire to state
 that the amendment merely changes
 in accordance with the views
 of the Postmaster General the
 fund from which the money
 shall be paid The Postmaster
 General has said and very
 properly as our postal service
 to California IS over a
 large intervening desert and we
 do not derive much way
 revenue therefrom it cannot be
 expected that it shall be
 self sustaining and there fore
 the expense ought to be
 paid out of the Treas
 ury instead of out of
 the revenues of the Post
 Ofiice Department The amendment does
 no more than to change
 the place where the money
 shall be paid In the
 end it comes out of
 the Treas ury The amendment
 accords with the desire expressed
 over and over again in
 the Postmaster General s report
 that the California service should
 be paid out of the
 Treasury of the United States
 it being only a burden
 upon the Post Ofhce De
 partment Mr SHERMAN 1 think
 the amendment is out of
 order We ought to be
 able to tell what our
 post oflice service cost Mr
 COLFAX Does the Chair rule
 the amend ment out of
 order The CHAIRMAN 1 10
 does Mr COLFAX 1 must
 an appeal from that decision
 The question was put Shall
 the decision Of the Chair
 stand as the judgment of
 the committee and it was
 decided m the affrmative Mr
 COLFAX I will state to
 the Chair con fidentially that
 I think the noes had
 it by the sound but
 rather than risk breaking up
 the com mittee for lack
 of a quorum I will
 not msist on a division
 I am also instructed by
 the Committee on the Post
 Office and Post Roads to
 offer the following amendment and
 bc it further enacted That
 the provisions of the third
 section of the act entitled
 An act amendatory to an
 act regulatiug the Post Office
 Department approved March 2 1827
 be and the same arc
 hereby applicd to all post
 routes which have been or
 may hereafter be established in
 any town or city by
 the Postmaster General by virtue
 of the tenth section ot
 an act cntitled An act
 to reduce and mod ify
 the rates of postage in
 the United States and for
 other purposes approved February 27
 1851 I ask the clerk
 to read a letter from
 the Post master General which
 I send up The letter
 was read as follows PosT
 FFICE DEPARTMENT APPOINTMENT OFFICE January
 14 1861 SIR By direction
 of the Postmaster General I
 have the honor to transmit
 the inclosed draft of additional
 section to the present laws
 of the Department and to
 request your cooperation in advancin

 Very rcspcctt ully your obedient
 servant 110RA i10 KING First
 asststattt Postmaster General Ilon SC
 IICYI ER COLFAX Chairman Committee
 on the Post Office and
 Post Roads I louse of
 Representatives Mr COLFAX By the
 law of March 2 1827
 it is declared that no
 person other than the Post
 master General or his authorized
 agent shall set up any
 foot or horse post for
 the conveyance of letters and
 packets upon any post road
 which is or may be
 established as such by law
 and that every person who
 shall offend shall incur a
 pen By the act of
 March 3 1851 the Post
 master General is authorized to
 establish post routes within all
 cities and towns where the
 post masters arc appointed by
 tho President and Sen ate
 In accordance with that law
 the Postmaster General has declared
 the streets and alleys in
 various cities of the Union
 post routes This act of
 the Postmaster General has been
 resisted in Philadelphia but has
 been acquiesced in by the
 private letter expresses in New
 York Boston and other cities
 The only question is whether
 the lav r of 1827
 shall be carried out and
 authorize the Postmaster General to
 establish those post routes and
 to prevent persons carrying letters
 over those routes unless authorized
 by him so that the
 Gov ernment can have the
 letter carrying in these cities
 in their own hands as
 they should have The amendment
 was agreed to Mr PERRY
 offered the following amendment And
 whenever serviee has been actually
 performed by the contractor upon
 any curtailed route since the
 4th day of March 1859
 notwithstanding the order of curtailment
 the Postmaster General shall pay
 for the same as if
 no such order had been
 made deducting from such payment
 any allowance the contractor may
 have received on account of
 the curtailment ofthe service under
 his contract Provided however That
 the Postmaster General shall be
 satisfied from the testimony before
 him that the service for
 which compensation is above provided
 was performed in good faith
 and in the advancement of
 the public interest Mr SHERMAN
 I raise a point of
 order upon that amendment The
 CHAIRMAN The Chair sustains the
 point of order and rules
 the amendment out of order
 Mr SHERMAN 1 move that
 the committee rise and report
 the bill to the House
 The motion was agreed to
 So the committee rose and

 Offce Department for the year
 ending the 30th June 1862
 under consideration and had directed
 him to report it back
 to the House with sundry
 amendments with a recommendation that
 it do pass Mr SHERMAN

 UNION Mr SHERMAN the motion
 to postpone t he special
 order The House then as
 the regular order of busi
 ness resumed the consideration of
 the special order being the
 report of the select committee
 of thirty three upon the
 present disturbed state of the
 country on which Mr VANDEVER
 was en titled to the
 floor Mr VANDEVER Mr Speaker
 it with no small reluctance
 that I obtrude myself upon
 the attention of the House
 at this time but the
 Important issues depending and the
 large in terests which the
 constituency that I represent in
 com mon with the whole
 American people have in these
 issues impel me to lay
 aside all scruples and state
 some of the considerations which
 will control me in the
 vote that I may soon
 be called 1 bélieve this
 is the first time in
 upon to cast our history
 v rhen we have been
 called upon to sanction the
 incorporation of new guarantees for
 slavery in the Constitution I
 desire to say and I
 believe I express the opinion
 of the peo ple that
 I represent when I say
 that I am for maintaining
 all the conditions in t
 be bond as our fathers
 nominated it But this demand
 for new guarantees is made
 upon pain of a dissolution
 of the Union if it
 shall be refused This we
 have heard in the discussion
 upon this floor and elsewhere
 Now sir whatever might be
 the dic tates of my
 own judgment in reference to
 this matter it seems to
 me that conujliance under the
 circumstances would not be a
 froe act it would at
 all events to some considerable
 extent be re garded as
 a concession under menaces and
 con straint and coercion I
 understand is what gentle men
 on the other side very
 much deprecate But sir in
 addition to this I call
 attention to the declarations which
 have been recently made in
 the public journals and which
 I believe have been repeated
 upon this floor that unless
 these demands are assented to
 we may reasonably ex pect
 that the incoming Administration will
 be crippled for want of
 money to carry on the
 Gov ernment that the men
 who hold the purse strings
 those who control capital will
 withhold supplies from the Government
 in this the day of
 its neces sity Sir I
 believe I speak the sen
 timent of the people of
 the Northwest v rhen I
 say calmly and deliberately that
 we are not to be
 intimidated by threats or influenced
 by bribes A patriotic con
 stituency in the State of
 Iowa will faith fully fulfill
 and observe all their constitutional
 obligations they will observe all
 the guarantees in the Con
 stitution as it exists to
 day but neither traitors nor
 Shylocks shall exact from us
 more Sir the issue now
 presented in this demand for
 new guarantees for slavery was
 but a few short months
 since settled by a verdict
 of the Ameri In May
 last a national Democratic can
 people convention assembled in the
 city of Charleston South Carolina
 and as we all know
 this demand was made there
 aiid rejected We know that
 a portion of the committee
 on resolutions in that body
 reported favoring new cruarantees and
 pro tection for slavery in
 the Territories of thc Uni
 ted States These resolutions were
 voted down E and thereupon
 the advocates of new ffuarantees
 and of the protection of
 sla very withdrewr from that
 convention and nominated a ticket
 of their own The remaining
 portion of that convention being
 a majorityofit declined to indorse
 any such I monstrous doctrine
 Afterwards at Baltimore they nominated
 a separate ticket and the
 two factions of the party
 went before the country upon
 that issue A few months
 later the issue was settled
 by the people at the
 polls and the claim for
 new guarantees repudiated by them
 as it had previously been
 in the Charleston convention for
 President the honorable Senator from
 Illinois received something less than
 one million four hundred thousand
 votes Thus this claim for
 new guarantees and protection was
 rejected by the Democratic party
 at the polls as well
 as in convention But this
 is not all for if
 you add to that the
 vote of the so called
 Union men the supporters of
 the Bell Everett ticket who
 went to the country on
 the Constitution the Uniön and
 the enforcement of the laws
 declining to sanction the demand
 made by the minority por
 tion of the Democratic party
 but resting them selves upon
 an especial hostility to the
 claims of that faction and
 charging it before the southern
 people with a design to
 break up this Union when
 you add their vote to
 the vote of the con
 trolling section of the Democratic
 party you will find that
 the men who claim new
 constitutional guarantees wcrc in a
 minority even in the South
 itself l heir claim was
 not only rejected in the
 Democratic convention and in the
 country at large but itwas
 repudiated by their own section
 And when you superadd to
 all this the whole vote
 cast for Abraham Lincoln it
 will be found that of
 the four million votes cast
 not one fifth were in
 favor of this claim of
 a faction for new guar
 antees for slavcry in the
 Territories of the Uni ted
 States Such is the verdict
 of the American people yet
 the issue is again prcscntcd
 to us on the floor
 of this House and in
 the other end of the
 Capitol as though the perpetuity
 of the Union now depended
 on our yielding to the
 current and granting the demand
 of those men who have
 failed to procure an indorsement
 of the people Mr HARms
 of Virginia Will the gentle
 man from Iowa permit me
 to ask him a question
 Mr VANDEVER Yes sir Mr
 HARRIS of Virginia 1 ask
 the man whether the doctrines
 of the Chicago plat form
 have not been repudiated by
 nearly a mil lion majority
 of the American peoplc Mr
 VANDEVER The gentleman can him
 self enligl kten the House
 on that particular point if
 he desires to do so
 but that is not within
 the line of my argument
 Mr Lincoln like many other
 Presidents has only a plurality
 of all the votes cast
 Mr HARRIS of Virginia I
 prefer that the gentleman himself
 should answer the question T
 hc linc of his argument
 is that he ought to
 ad herc to the Chicago
 platfonn because only mi nority
 of the people were in
 favor of the demand to
 protect slavery in tbc Territories
 Mr VANDEVER 1 have said
 nothing about the Chicacro platform
 Mr HARRIS of Virginia 1
 ask the gentle man whether
 a majority of the people
 of the coun try have
 not by their votes repudiated
 the Chi cago platform Mr
 VANDEVER 1 not said anything
 about the Chicago platform Mr
 HARRIS of Virginia Butl wish
 to bring you to that
 very point Mr VANDEVER 1
 have been paying my respects
 to the Democracy I will
 soon reach the Republican side
 of the question Now as
 I said thß revolutionary cabal
 as it has since turned
 out to be N vhen
 it retired from the Charleston
 con vention Mr CLARK of
 Missouri May 1 bc allowed
 Mr Speaker to interrupt the
 gentleman Mr VANDEVER Yes if
 it will not come out
 of my time The SPEAKER
 It must come tleman s
 time unless it is otherwise
 specially I stipulated Mr VANDEVER
 Then 1 cannotgiveway rl here
 is no objection on this
 side i Mr RUS Y
 to the gentleman having his
 time made up of the
 gentleman s time Mr VANDEVER
 Then 1 un less the
 gentleman thinks I have misstated
 the fucts I only wish
 to Mr CLARK of The
 revolutionary cabal as it has
 since turned correct the gentleman
 s statement as to a
 matter out to be thus
 foiled received at the polls
 for i of fact its
 candidate and platform in November
 less than Mr VAN DE
 VER I always give way
 for nine hundred thousand votes
 throughout the correction length and
 breadth of this whole country
 while I Mr CLARK of
 Missouri The gentleman that faction
 of the Democratic party which
 re has undertaken to state
 the question on which the
 i mained in possession of
 the convention and convention that
 nominated the Democratic candi Güthern
 maiit I otddfinåfi y fdf
 the nomination of Judge DöuÉIaS
 The question tof the protectioh
 of the Territories seems not
 to be well undeiStööd byvthbß
 gentlémåntfrörn Iowa It was a
 mootéd question in that cOhV
 Yfä tion whether the Cönstitution
 carried the Territories or whetlier
 slaVerywas institution Those who support
 éd Judge tDoug 4 las
 preferred to leave that to
 the some of uskholding that
 under the Conststutiön we had
 a right to carry slaves
 into Tefritoriés and some holding
 thåt it depended on lödauegis
 lation The gentleman theiefore is
 in error when he supposes
 that this issue was made
 in that eon vention There
 was no such issue As
 a matter of propriety as
 a matter of safety as
 matter rof policy i we
 wanted protection by the Constitution
 The Crittenden proposition is to
 give that protece tion and
 to give qüieb tom the
 cöuntry North and South on
 that great questiön VANDEVER 1
 do not think tleman has
 varied the proposition mateiiä llyfröm
 what I stated it to
 be I think the country
 isu eJI satisfied to day
 as to What was the
 propositionsof the minority at the
 Charleston convention It was based
 on the resolutions introduced by
 the Senator from Mississippi in
 the Senate of the United
 States Mr Calhoun himself made
 the samö demand for specific
 pr0tection and guaran tees for
 slave property in the Territories
 which no other property had
 My friend from Missouri says
 he was in favor of
 leaving it to the people
 of the Territory but the
 minority of the Charles ton
 convention would leave it neither
 to the peo ple nor
 to Congress but claimed that
 it was guar antied to
 them independent of the people
 and Congress of the United
 States I ain justified therefore
 in making the declaration that
 the turning point in that
 convention was on the qües
 tion of protecting slavery in
 the Territ6riee gardless of the
 wishes of the people of
 the Terri tot y or
 the power of Congress to
 exclude it I now come
 back to the point at
 which I was interrupted The
 issue having been thus ftiirly
 made to the country having
 been decided against slavery protectiomsts
 in their own section in
 their own Democratic convention being
 in a hope less minority
 in the country these men
 nov seek to present this
 question again for our considera
 tion Since the election they
 have been busily at work
 by their insidious wiles and
 misrepresent ations Mr HARRIS of
 Virginia I ask in all
 cour tesy to interrupt the
 gentleman Mr VANDEVER 1 give
 way HARRIS of Virginia 1
 want to ask the gentleman
 one question Mr VANDEVER Objection
 has been made to the
 extension of my time Mr
 HARRIS of Virginia The gentleman
 from Iowa states that a
 large majority of the Dem
 ocratic arty refused Mr CANDEVER
 1 yield 1 have submitted
 the facts on which I
 base my judgment The gentleman
 may not come to the
 same conclu Sion that I
 came to This minority I
 say having succeeded in breaking
 up the Democratic convcn tion
 and shattering into fragments the
 Demo Oratic party now turn
 their attention to breaking up
 the Government By their most
 insidious wiles and misreprescntations they
 have succeeded in firing the
 southern heart with enmity to
 the people of the North
 and hostility to the Govern
 ment And now what do
 they ask Why only that
 the majority shall submit to
 the minority If that policy
 is to be pursued they
 may with just as much
 propriety ask that the joint
 action of the two Houses
 of Congress had the day
 before yesterday shall be reconsidered
 and that the name of
 Abrahan l Lincoln of Illinois
 shall be stricken from the
 rccord and that of John
 C Breckinridge of Kentucky inserted
 in its place as the
 choice of the American people
 for Presi dent of the
 Unit ed States for four
 years from the 4th of
 March next For myself have
 to say that if the
 Union is only to be
 preserved On such terms it
 can never be preserved by
 my vote never will consent
 to have that flag which
 floats from the dome above
 our heads the stars and
 stripes struck to the pitiful
 flag Of a secession minority
 Those with whom 1 stand
 the patri otic men of
 this country planted on thc
 impreg_nable position of right will
 stand which subsequently nominated as
 its candidate il date for
 President divided I was in
 that conven there though they
 should be but a handful
 against 940 TIID CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 15 a multitude will
 look Sumter like defiance in
 the ftce of their opponents
 and die if need be
 with the last vestige of
 the American Union Mr MAYNARD
 Will the gentleman allow me
 to ask him a question
 ME ALDRICH 1 object to
 these intcr ruptions There is
 but one gentleman who has
 a Érescriptive right to interrupt
 and ask ques tions and
 that is the gentleman from
 Arkansas Mr HINDMAN I will
 permit him to do ii
 ILaughter Mr HINDMAN have a
 few questions to propound to
 the gentleman Mr VANDEVER Now
 Mr Speaker in respect to
 the propositions made to amend
 the Federal Constitution so as
 to afford new guaran tecs
 and Trotection to the peculiar
 institu tion of the South
 I cannot as they are
 made under these circumstances vote
 for any of them Sir
 under these circumstances compromise is
 out of the question with
 me If at a future
 time a conven tEon should
 assemble upon the 8 pplication
 of the States of this
 Union as prescribed by the
 Con stitution in that convention
 for my part I would
 meet our brethren from the
 slaveholding States in a spirit
 of mutual forbearance ond conciliation
 and if possible forever quiet
 this slavery con troversy But
 at this particular period of
 time when the public mind
 is excited in the last
 expir i nø aøonies of
 this Congress the alternative is
 pre sented by a minority
 smarting under the sting of
 defea of concession or a
 dissolution of the Union and
 a hopeless bankruptcy of the
 national Treas ury Under such
 constraints I will not consent
 to compromise Mr NIAYNARD 1
 to ask the gentle man
 th is one question wi
 th his permission wheth er
 the statement he has presented
 has been one that was
 quite fair and candid towards
 us of the border States
 vho during the last summer
 bore the burden of the
 conflict against the men who
 supported Breckinridge and who did
 more to overpoxrver him in
 the Stutcs where he was
 the strongest than any others
 I ask him whet her
 it was necessary in the
 statement he has madc for
 his constituents and the country
 to place us in the
 condition he hasJ lone I
 appeal to his fair ness
 and candor to say whether
 he has done us justice
 Mr VANDEVER 1 say in
 replyto the gen tleman from
 rrennessee that truth no respecter
 of persons I have no
 desire to do injustice to
 him or his political friends
 in the border States for
 I am ready to say
 that whatever may be the
 judgment of posterity upon the
 acts of those of us
 who have been participators in
 the scenes of this day
 the names of those who
 upon this floor and at
 home among their constituents in
 the slaveholding States have heroically
 fought the battle of the
 Union and Constitution aøamst fa
 naticism and treason in their
 own section these names say
 will be cherished in grateful
 re men brance whether the
 Union endures or not Mr
 MAYNARD I concur with the
 gentle man that truth is
 no respecter of persons but
 persons ought to be respecters
 of truth and it is
 for that reason that I
 put the question whether the
 gentleman from Iowa had done
 justice to us Union znen
 of the South in respect
 to the propo sition submitted
 by the distinguished Senator from
 Kentucky Mr VANDEVER I am
 endeavoring to serve the cause
 of truth when I show
 that for good jectionable in
 form than either of the
 others but it goes to
 the same extent in effect
 Mr MAYNARD The gentleman from
 Iowa will remember that the
 Crittenden proposition comes not from
 the supporters of Breckinridge but
 from the Union men of
 the South Now I him
 whether it is quite fair
 to impute to the Union
 men of the South the
 responsibility for the sentiments of
 Breckinridge and his supporters Mr
 VANDEVER The gentleman and his
 friends some of them in
 this emergency have regarded it
 as their duty to support
 principles which they have heretofore
 repudiated establish ing new uarantees
 for the protection of slavery
 in the Territories south of
 360 30 Now sir for
 my self I say that
 there is a principle in
 this matter and that I
 will never yield one iota
 in guaranty ing the protection
 of this Government for slavery
 anywhere That is the difference
 between the gentleman and myseff
 But Mr Speaker I desire
 to offer another con sideration
 in respect to the report
 of the commit tee of
 thirty three though by the
 way there is another peculiarity
 both in the Crittenden and
 in the border States proposition
 to which wish to allude
 I mean that portion of
 the plan Which proposes to
 protect the domcstic slave trade
 I do not recc lcct
 the precise tcrms in svhich
 it is expressed I shall
 not on this occasion under
 take to inquire into or
 discuss the power of this
 Government over the inter State
 slave trade I shall not
 on this occasion ask whether
 there is any power in
 the Congress of the United
 States or anywhere in this
 Government to abolish that slave
 trade But sir in the
 Crittenden proposi tion is a
 distinct recognicion of the right
 of transit with slaves from
 one slave State to anothei
 and what I fear is
 that when it shali once
 be adopted whcn that proposition
 shall once be incorporated into
 the Constitution the claim will
 be Spt up and maintained
 that the slave trader has
 the riffht to carry his
 slaves from Virginia or any
 other border State to Texas
 or any one of the
 cotton States by way of
 New York or somc port
 of the North for shipment
 And further I think there
 is rea son to fear
 that when that provision shall
 become a part of the
 organic law of the land
 it will give the slave
 trader the right to traffic
 in his property I wherever
 hc shall see proper that
 it will reéstab 1ish the
 slave pens in this city
 which were abol ished as
 an abomination by the compromise
 legis lation of 1850 or
 perhaps what worse yet transfor
 them to New York and
 other northern ports to first
 outrage and then debauch and
 de moralize public sentiment and
 vastly inflame the slavery agitation
 under which wc now groan
 But in regard to the
 report of the committee of
 thirty three I must conföss
 that I approach the subject
 with a great reluctance Certåinly
 no 11 un upön this
 floor entertains a higher opinion
 of the patriotic services o
 the gentleman from Ohio Mr
 CORWIN chairman of the select
 committee than I do None
 will more sincerely accord to
 him the full meed of
 praise for his anxious desire
 to allay tbc existing exc_itement
 in the country and to
 restore peace and harmony once
 more in all sections throughout
 the length and breadth of
 the land But sir I
 submit that the committee have
 fallen into a grave error
 in the resolutions which they
 offer These pcsolutions recognize the
 ex istcnce of personal liberty
 laws upon the statute books
 of tho North which are
 Supposed to in fringe the
 Constitution of the United States
 reasons under the circumstances now
 existing I These resolutions denounce
 the invasion of one cannot
 concur in the proposition of
 the Senator from Kentucky which
 provides for the protec tion
 and guarantee of slavery in
 the Territocies of the Union
 or in any proposition which
 shall in effect set aside
 the verdict pronounced in the
 late election Mr MAYNARD still
 the gentleman does not answer
 my question Mr VANDEVER Now
 Mr Speaker the Crittenden proposition
 recognizes and protects slavery south
 of the line of 360
 30 in all the Ter
 ritories of the Union The
 border State propo Bition does
 the same thing not in
 such definite or specific language
 but it just as effectually
 protects and maintains slavery sot
 uh of that line by
 saying that there shall be
 no power in Congress or
 in the Territorial Legislature or
 in the people of a
 Territory however much they may
 desire it to prohibit slavery
 in such Territory The propo
 sition of the committee of
 thirty three is less ob
 State by the citizens of
 another State with a hos
 tile intent they deplore the
 practice so prevalent in some
 States of failing to protect
 the citizens of other States
 traveling or temporarily sojournin therein
 All such evils are to
 be deplored by good citizens
 of whatever section The committee
 however propose nothing to remedy
 the evil The resolutions propose
 to neither prohibit nor command
 anything in reference to the
 personal liberty laws or other
 evils complained of The report
 only advises the States to
 revise their legis lation in
 these particulars In my humble
 judgment Mr Speaker at this
 particular juncture what we most
 want is a dis tinct
 and prompt recognition of the
 authority of the Constitution and
 the laws enacted in pursu
 ance thereof as supreme and
 paramount to any State legislation
 If that be readily and
 fully ac knowledged the remedy
 will soon be found for
 the unauthorized and illegal action
 of States whether it be
 secession ordinances or personal lib
 erty laws Nullification in whatevei
 form must be met and
 overthrown These personal libefty laws
 passed by the northern States
 wre never désigned to conflict
 with the Constitution of the
 United States or to nullify
 an act of Congress pursuance
 of the Constitution They passe
 signed sir to protect their
 own citizens were from being
 kidnapped and to guard against
 vio lent seizures If the
 States which have personal liberty
 bills upon their statute books
 have vin fringed the Constitutiori
 of the United States or
 nullified any legislation of Congress
 upderit then the courts can
 correct the error I ncvei
 heaed of an instance in
 which any citizen or considerable
 number of citizens of the
 North have claimed t hat
 the courts could not declare
 upon the constitution ality of
 personal liberty bills They in
 the North that it is
 the_ right aid the lutly
 ö Lhé States to obey
 the duly renderéd _judgmeh_tg of
 ihé courts runderstand that they
 haye always been willing to
 submit their laws to the
 adjudication of the courts But
 history furnishes a memorable instance
 in which one of the
 States of the Union upon
 the application of the people
 of another Staté rcfu d
 to test the validity or
 constitutionality Of theit own laws
 in their own courts lillude
 sir to be case of
 South Carölina when Mr Hoar
 WAS Seit there as a
 commissioner on thé part of
 Massa chusetts to test the
 constitutionality of a låw of
 South Carolina she refused to
 submit to the orbit rament
 of the courts and dröiie
 Mr Hoar from her limits
 I repeat then what I
 have said that the Constitution
 and the laws passed in
 pursu ance thereof must be
 recognized as paramount and supreme
 to State laws béfore We
 can arrive at any full
 settlement of Our present diffculties
 and this the committee irfa
 great meaSure seem to have
 lost 9ight Of The committee
 which upol_l us The President
 of the Üni téd Stdfés
 lin a recent message depl
 oh ed the secession of
 Std t es as a
 great evil Hts argument Avas
 an able ohe against the
 right of secessiön but he
 proposed no remedy for it
 he acknowledges no remedy for
 it And like the President
 I say it witli great
 re spect the committee while
 deploring unauthor ized acts assert
 no power in the Government
 to repress such acts but
 only request the States to
 desist All I have to
 say is that any pian
 of com promise or settlement
 which doe not recognize the
 paramount po vér Of the
 Constitutiön and laws will not
 feach the evils so much
 complained of Without a fundamental
 recognition of the superior authority
 of the Federal Constitution this
 Union becomes a mere myth
 and the Gov ernmerft a
 sham I regard the slavery
 question as secondary in importance
 to the pretended right of
 peaceable secession ctaimcd by States
 now in open rebellion against
 the Government and actively at
 work in citing other States
 to like treasonable practices It
 is no time to staunch
 the blood from a wound
 caused by the slavery agitation
 while this assassin of seceSsion
 and rebellion Stands with drawn
 dagger and uplifted arm to
 inflict a yet more fatal
 blow at the very Government
 itself Make concessions now in
 order to preserve this Government
 Four years hence when we
 come to inaugurate another President
 new concessions may be demanded
 Thus a black mail or
 ran som may be regularly
 lovicd by one section on
 another at each recurring presidential
 election if not oftener as
 the price of the Union
 It is all folly then
 to think of compromises and
 conces sions at this time
 Nothing less than the life
 of the Union is demanded
 and every instinct of self
 preservation requires that the terms
 should be rejected and the
 Government sustained I say that
 the question of all other
 questions which has now to
 be settled is the right
 of seces sion I appeal
 to gentlemen who favor a
 southern confederacy whether any Government
 eredted upon such a foundation
 could endure It requires no
 prophet s ken to foretell
 the speedy downfall of a
 confederacy formed upon the specifie
 recog nition of the right
 of secession It would pass
 away with the breath of
 any State however small that
 might for any cause howevef
 trivial declare that it severed
 its connection Such a confederacy
 would be hourly and daily
 in imminent danger O f
 being broken into a thousand
 fragments In such a confederacy
 selfishness will be the overruling
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE motive
 of all the States If
 Louisiana or Florida or any
 other State finds it io
 be her interest to remain
 then she will do so
 and if not she will
 secede Any factious community under
 the ad mitted right of
 secession might withhold from all
 the other States the enjoyment
 of the advantages ofa unyotr
 because she was unwilling to
 accept them herself It seems
 to n ne that superadded
 to ail the pelicans crocodiles
 snakes and other descriptions of
 reptiles adopted as the insignia
 of such a dissolving view
 confrderacy there should be a
 portrayal of the dog in
 the manger of the old
 fable I know that it
 is objected by our friends
 on the other side of
 the House that in the
 position we assume we do
 not recognize the sovereignty of
 the States Now sir I
 desire to make a distinct
 declaration that there is no
 Slate in this Union that
 ever did in the whole
 period of her past his
 tory possess one single particle
 of distinct sov ereignty or
 distinct nationality There is no
 sep arate sovereiguty All the
 sovereign ty that any State
 of this Union excepting it
 may be the State of
 Texas ever had it derived
 from and through the Union
 We know very well that
 even after the annexation of
 the State of Texas her
 sover eignty had to be
 vindicated in a long and
 bloody war between the United
 States and Mexico Let us
 fora moment appeal to history
 What were the thirteen States
 originally Nothing mote than colonial
 dependencies of Great Britain Every
 one must admit that But
 the oppressions of the mother
 country became intolerable and the
 people of these thirteen colonies
 formed a Union Unitedly they
 resisted the a oressions of
 the mother country unitedly they
 declared their in dependence that
 of right they were free
 and independent and united they
 waged a long and fierce
 war against Great Britain which
 was finally closed by a
 recognition of that independence which
 has ever since been the
 pride and boast of the
 American people Mr HIN DIV
 IAN Will t he gentleman
 permit me to call his
 attention to a fact that
 he seems to forget The
 treaty between Great Britain and
 the colonies merely recognized the
 independence of each one of
 the thirteen colonies by name
 It did not recocrnize our
 independence as a nation or
 a league Mr VANDERVER These
 United States did not separately
 negotiate with the mother country
 Unitedly they declared their independence
 and unitedly they negotiated the
 terms of the treaty The
 same authority that commissioned George
 Washington to lead the armies
 of the United Col onies
 authorized the commissioners to treat
 with the mother country for
 the independence of the United
 States of America and when
 in the treaty of peace
 the colonies were enumerated it
 was for the purpose of
 recoo nizing and acknowledging their
 united independence and not their
 separate national existences The allegiance
 the colonies owed to Great
 Britain was thus transferred to
 the United States of America
 Now sir what was the
 next step After the acknmvledgrnent
 of our independence for the
 pur pose of forming a
 more perfect Union the Con
 stitution of the United States
 vas ordained By whom It
 was ordained in the name
 of the peo ple of
 the United States The very
 mcn who had put their
 hands to the Declaration of
 our Inde pendence a fin
 v years before pledging their
 lives and their sacred honor
 to mai ltain it the
 men who by their heroic
 deeds in battle and their
 moderation and firmness in council
 had achieved our liberties and
 our right to a separate
 and in dependcnt nation then
 gathered themselves in council again
 and framed a Constitution which
 X vas ordained in the
 name of the people of
 the Uni ted States I
 say then that every particle
 of sov ereiznty which any
 one of those thirteen original
 States has to day was
 derived through the Union and
 from no source whatever The
 alle giance which they once
 owed to the mother coun
 try was transferred to the
 United States and they owe
 their allegiance to day to
 the United States Now I
 submit if we shall consent
 to this dis memberment and
 acknowledge their independ ence of
 this United States Government how
 know but that England may
 claim to have some irnerest
 in these absconding States Why
 sir one of the conditions
 of the treaty which acknowl
 edged our independence was that
 the navigation of the Mississippi
 river should forever remain free
 How know we if the
 independence of the States which
 have gone out shall be
 acknowl edged but that France
 or Spain may have some
 thing to say in reference
 to that matter because they
 too have an interest in
 the navigation of the Mississippi
 river They may claim that
 their sovereignty reattaches because their
 cession v ras made to
 the United States of America
 Think you that England is
 going to consent to any
 se rious interruption of her
 trade and commerce with the
 people living upon the headwaters
 of that great stream Wili
 she consent that a colony
 of freebooters to call them
 by no more opprobrious term
 shall exercise control over the
 mouth of that river even
 should the United States relin
 quish its jurisdiction I commend
 these con siderations to the
 attention of all whom it
 may concern Now what is
 the pretext for this crusade
 against the Union which i
 must be permitted to say
 is one of the most
 treasonable and wicked under takings
 ever projected against this or
 any other Government and which
 I honestly believe de serves
 and will receive the just
 judgment of Hea ven upon
 the heads of its guilty
 authors What is the pretext
 That a party has succeeded
 in electing a President of
 the Umted States a party
 that believes in the ancient
 policy of restricting slavery in
 territories There is no claim
 of a right to interföre
 with or attack slavery in
 the States Such design is
 expressly disclaimed and condemned by
 all parties But in reference
 to the common domain we
 are in favor of the
 an cient policy Our opponents
 ask us to consent to
 incorporate into the Constitution new
 guarantees which shall reverse the
 past action of the Gov
 ernment and if we do
 not they threaten to break
 up the Government Let me
 call the attention of gentlemen
 to the condition of the
 Territories when we formed this
 Constitution From the Northwestern Territory
 out of which has been
 carved so many States slavery
 was excluded by the act
 of the Govern ment That
 restrictive policy was adopted before
 the Constitution Who consented to
 it The people of Virginia
 The statesmen of Virginia of
 that day sanctioned that policy
 If at that day they
 saw no good reason for
 not consentino to the ratification
 of the Constitution merely because
 slavery was not protected or
 guarantied in the Territorics of
 the United States why should
 such cruarantee and protection be
 made a condition for the
 continuance of the TJnion now
 The ordi nance of 1787
 excluded slavery from the North
 west The new Constitution did
 not remove the restriction and
 nobody then thought that it
 should A Constitution guarantying the
 right to extend slavery into
 Territories would then have been
 rejected by men of ali
 parties no good reason for
 changing that policy Virginia ceded
 the Northwest Territory to the
 Un ited States and she
 had a special reason for
 agreeino to the exclusion of
 slavery therefrom We hai just
 emerged from that revolutionary struggle
 in which she had made
 great sacrifices She had become
 impoverished by the sacrifices made
 to achieve our liberties Many
 old Virginia families with a
 numerous progeny growing up around
 them impoverished by the burdens
 of the Revolution looked to
 the Northwest as a field
 for enterprise upon which their
 offspring reared in refinement might
 retrieve their broken for tunes
 At home labor was despised
 because as Mr Mason expressed
 performed slaves it and with
 the yearning tenderness ofa mother
 Virginia determined to redeem that
 territory from the bliaht of
 slave labor regarding it as
 the heri tage OF her
 own children It is such
 a policy and such an
 example which the Republican party
 of to day propose 10
 emu late and follow Mr
 HAMMOND said truthfully in an
 address to his constituents made
 at Beeéh Island in 1858
 that All the measures of
 which the South coinplains she
 herself inaugurated In the Inatter
 of slavery Washington and Jefferson
 sct the evil e xunple
 the North have bor it
 fro m them Now passing
 from that period of our
 history and cormng down to
 1820 there is another signal
 instance in which the power
 of Congress to ex clude
 this institution from the Territories
 was asSerted and the people
 of the South themselves acquiesced
 in the exercise of that
 power that was the act
 of the South Passing from
 that time and ter vening
 we come down to 1845
 when we atö quired Texas
 One off the very conditions
 upon which she was annexed
 to this Union and one
 of the States is found
 in these And in such
 State or States aS shall
 be formtd outbf said territory
 north ott said Missöuri comptorniseliliej
 sla very or involuntary servitude
 except fbr grime 4han be
 prohibited That was a southern
 measure indorsed by Cal houn
 in 1845 and the greaemeasure
 Xitthe Dem ocratic party Texas
 came into the Union upen
 an express recognition of a
 power in Con gress of
 the United States to exclude
 this institu tion not only
 from the Territories but from
 her o wn limits and
 not a voice was raised
 against it It was a
 southern measure and the resolution
 was framed by southern man
 Passing from that period we
 come down to 1850 when
 we were again called upon
 to compro mise this question
 and this condition upon which
 Texas was admitted was again
 expressly reaf firmed Congress then
 passed a series of com
 promise measures one of which
 gave to Texas to reconcile
 her to a change of
 bound aries It was expressly
 into that act that it
 should not interfere with the
 condiLiöns upon which Texas was
 originally annexed to the United
 States was in the na
 ture of a ransom for
 the recognition of this great
 privilege of the Government to
 exclude this inni tution from
 the Territories of the UnitedStates
 and was a part of
 the compromise measureS of 1850
 Then we come down to
 1852 when thæ two great
 parties of the country in
 their con ventions mutually pledged
 themselves to abide and stand
 by those compromises as a
 finality Who let me ask
 has receded from these com
 promises and agreements thus solernnly
 made You gentlemen I answer
 on that side of the
 Hall the South herself A
 gentleman from North Carolina Mr
 WINSLOW the other day while
 commen ting upon the alleged
 wrongs of the South spoke
 of the action of tlue
 North and character ized it
 by the term punic fait
 h I respectfu ly submit
 that like examples of punic
 faith can be found upon
 the part of no people
 of any section of this
 country or of any country
 as are found in the
 memorable cases to which have
 alluded Sir if this Union
 is to be broken up
 and this vrar is to
 be waged I can only
 say in theeloquent words of
 Henry Clay whose ashes sleep
 in t he district of
 the gentleman from Kentucky Mr
 SIMMS who addressed the House
 the other day that it
 will be a war in
 which you will have no
 sympathy for all mankind will
 be against you But sir
 some gentlemen say that the
 cause of our present troubles
 is not so much the
 attempt to exclude slavery from
 the Territories of the United
 States and the failure to
 execute the fugi tive slave
 law as it is this
 everlasting discussion of the slavery
 question among the people of
 the North and I call
 attention to that remarkable declaration
 to be found in the
 President s last an nual
 message a declaration unparalleled by
 any expression in any American
 State paoer that I have
 ever seen that the agitation
 of the slavery question has
 at length as he says
 produced its malign Influence on
 the mind of the slave
 inspir ing in his bosom
 the hope of freedom He
 makes that charge upon the
 Republican party Now sir that
 charge is as old as
 the Government itself It was
 made against the very system
 inaugurated by the founders of
 our Government that they had
 avowed heresies in the Declaration
 of Independ once calculated to
 inspire in the hear_Ls of
 the oppressed of every nation
 this hope of freedom such
 is the complaint of every
 despot on the face of
 the earth this day I
 reply in the language of
 McDowell of Virginia This hope
 of freedom is a lamp
 lit up in the soul
 of the slave by the
 hand of the Deity it
 is allied to his hope
 of im mortality and can
 never be extinguished i a
 species of atheism to attempt
 to extinguish it Now I
 vlr Speaker I have a
 word or two to say
 in conclusion for I perceive
 that my hour has nearly
 expired In my humble judgment
 all the wrongs of which
 the South complains to day
 can be redressed in the
 Union Let them recognize t
 the power and authority of
 this General Govern II ment
 Let them resort to the
 constitutional guar 942 antees that
 they have They have appealed
 to the Supreme Court to
 recognize their right to take
 their slaves into the Territories
 and as they con strue
 the decision of that court
 it has already decreed that
 they have all they ask
 for under the form of
 the present Constitution I he
 court has decided in their
 favor and yet they seem
 inclined to distrust that decision
 and ask us to give
 epe cific guarantees in the
 Constitution itself for the future
 fidelity of the court To
 such terms I If we
 can risk the court with
 cannot consent out guarantees you
 gentlemen certainly ought to be
 willing after the intimations it
 has given in your favor
 Mr HINDMAN 1 ask the
 gentleman if the Dred Scott
 decision anathe Chicago platform do
 not conflict with each other
 in his judgment Mfr VANDEVER
 The Chicago Flatform so fat
 as I knox v was
 never designed to conform to
 the dogmas expressed by Judge
 Taney as the opinion of
 the court ill the Dred
 Scott case PDRSONAL EXPLANATION Mr
 DE JARNETTE obtained the Boor
 Mr DAWES the gentleman from
 Vir ginia yield to mc
 a moment to make a
 personal explanation Mr DE JARNETTE
 1 will sir Mr DAWES
 Mr Speaker during the dis
 cussion yesterday afternoon I sought
 the floor at one time
 to make a little more
 specific what I had said
 in relation to the course
 of the gentleman from North
 Carolina Mr BRANCH on the
 committee of five Mr DE
 JARNETTE The gentleman from North
 Carolina is not now present
 and I suggest to the
 gentleman from Massachusetts the pro
 priety of waiting till he
 returns to the Hail Mr
 DAWES I do not propose
 to say any thing that
 will render it Ylecessary for
 the gentle man from North
 Carolina to be here I
 merely desire to do exact
 justice to the gentleman from
 North Caroiina which I failed
 to do in the course
 of the debate yesterday because
 I could not get the
 floor Mr DE JARNETTE 1
 hope the gentleman from Massachusetts
 wili be as brief as
 possible Mr DAWES I will
 In the course of the
 debate yesterday I used these
 words which I afterwards sought
 to make a lit E
 le more clear but failed
 to do so The gentternan
 Carolina rises in his seat
 and witnoul the slightest intiiuation
 to any of his colleagues
 upon tike cmnmittee so thr
 as _know eoilitncnces reading a
 minority report aftor having indüeed
 the other mernbers of the
 committee in their desire to
 have an unaniunous re port
 to yiéld as far as
 they could impressions wkiiell the
 evidence nade upon their ininds
 I sought to say afterwards
 that the induce ment was
 brought about simply in this
 way The gentleman from North
 Carolma well understands that other
 members of the committee held
 views somewhat difi erent from
 those of the report while
 the other members of the
 committee also knew that he
 entertained views somewhat diflin ent
 from the report and each
 was influenced by the others
 to yield somewhat their own
 private views and thus come
 to what each supposed was
 to be a unanimous report
 That is ali i desired
 to say and I am
 obliged to t hc gentleman
 from Virginia for his courtesy
 in allowino mc to say
 it STATE OF UNION AGAIN
 Mr DE JARNF TTE resumed
 the floor Mr McCLERNAND If
 the gentleman from Virginia will
 give way for that purpose
 I will move an adjournment
 Mr DE JARNETTE i am
 much obliged to the gentleman
 from Illinois but prefer to
 cro on now The SPEAKER
 The gentleman from Vir ginia
 will proceed Mr JARNETTE There
 times Mr Speaker when I
 am contemplating thc history of
 my country its rise proo
 ress and rapid devol opnlent
 when the picture becomes so
 pleasing and I am so
 filled with hope and delight
 that I am lifted above
 the raging elements which have
 now so nearly destroyed it
 and from such a stand
 point view the grandest system
 of govern ment ever yet
 devised by human agency for
 the happiness of man have
 gone back to the earliest
 period of our history when
 a few bold hearts first
 penetrated the dark forests to
 find the home of the
 savaøc CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 15
 and share with him his
 freedom sooner than sub mit
 to the tyranny and oppression
 of the Old World They
 were guided by the sparks
 of lib erty x vh
 ich they had seen emitted
 by the concus Sion of
 the dynasties of the Old
 World which as they arose
 were carried by the winds
 of heaven to the shores
 of America It was here
 sir guided by the Unseen
 and protected by the arm
 which they never felt but
 to praise they reared an
 altar of liberty around which
 soon stood the oppressed of
 every land who soon so
 replenished its fires that its
 flames licked the clouds the
 bright effulgence of which cast
 a shadow under the thrones
 of tyranny and I oppression
 throughout the earth rn viewing
 it from this stand point
 I have seen no North
 no South I have looked
 upon the whole and been
 proud that all of it
 was my coun try I
 have forgotten and expelled from
 my mind all grievances of
 which the South now so
 justly complains and viewed my
 country as it should be
 and not as it is
 Mr Speaker I am proud
 of what it has already
 accomplished but with the eye
 of faith I penetrate the
 distant fu ture and behold
 one hundred million freemen whose
 sublime destiny it is to
 break the chains of tyranny
 to feed the hungry and
 clothe the naked over the
 earth Sir we have reached
 that point in our national
 progress when every step we
 take is felt through out
 the earth The eyes of
 the world are upon us
 To us belong the jealousy
 hate and envy of the
 dynasties of the earth This
 they will not admit even
 to themselves or to each
 other but the foot of
 oppression is raised the reins
 of Gov ernment are loosed
 and the oppressed through out
 the earth begin to recover
 their long lost lib erties
 This is what our free
 institutions have accom plished this
 is what we haveaccomplished with
 out regard to any other
 object than our own development
 Still the eyes of the
 world are upon us our
 movements are watched and felt
 throughout the world When we
 stepped from the banks of
 the Mis sissippi to the
 Pacific ocean the carth moved
 heavily on its axis because
 its balancc was dis turbed
 All Europe felt the shock
 and now feel and know
 that another center must be
 found around which they in
 turn must revolve Nor was
 its influence col ifined to
 Europe it penetrated is thus
 effectually keeping the huge paw
 of the Russian bear fromithe
 rich feast in the East
 Thus for nearly two hundred
 years has Eng I land
 enjoyed uninterru ptedlythe trade of
 the eight hundred millions of
 Asia Since the purchase of
 Louisiana by the United States
 England has been uneasy Napoleon
 I when he sold that
 country west of the Mississippi
 tou gave as a reason
 that he could not hold
 It ngland to guard her
 trade in the East that
 would with her immense navy
 take it that he wished
 the young giant of America
 to possess it because he
 knew that we at no
 distant day would break England
 s power by possessing that
 trade I will not stop
 herc to show all the
 impediments which England has thrown
 across our path to prevent
 our march to the Pacific
 She began with a proposition
 for the joint occupancy of
 our Pa cific shore That
 was agreed to but it
 soon re salted in her
 claim to the only harbor
 on that coast ovvned by
 the United States The right
 of search which she asserted
 and which resulted in the
 war of 1812 was instituted
 with the view of breaking
 the prestige of our power
 and giving her the oc
 cupation of Astoria the only
 harbor on the Pacific The
 war commenced by the seizure
 of that port by England
 and it was the last
 point yielded when the treaty
 of peace was made at
 Ghent Failing in this she
 now holds all the South
 Americmi States under bonds which
 they dare not disregard to
 prevent an American vessel in
 time of war from enterinø
 their ports even for shelter
 When the transit of Isthmus
 is found practica ble she
 appears at that point and
 undertakes to control that When
 in 1850 we proposed to
 con struct a railroad to
 the Pacific she in mediately
 II begins the construction of
 a road from Newfound land
 to Puget Sound and has
 throueh the polar cold constructed
 fifteen hundred miles of that
 road And still more recently
 impelled by the spur of
 our rapid advancement she has
 purchased an Asia to the
 Celestial Empire aroused the slum
 bering millions in their strong
 walled cities and I caused
 their gates to creak under
 the accumulated F rust of
 centuries Indeed far beyond in
 the remote kingdom of Japan
 a hundred million more were
 aroused to shake off the
 dust of centuries and again
 to walk island in the
 Pacific in our track to
 India upon which she is
 this day building a Gibraltar
 almost in sight of our
 shore All this sir will
 avail not she is striving
 against what the finger of
 destiny has written for our
 ac complishment Sir civilization knowledge
 and commerce started in the
 East They have pro m
 essed and are progressinø Nuvestward
 When ihey shall have reached
 the uttermost verge of the
 Pacific shore they must retrograde
 and the sub lime destiny
 of returning these blessings to
 their ancient seats will be
 ours Sir the genius of
 America has left the rock
 bound coast of New England
 and taken its position on
 the shore of the the
 Pacific and there it will
 work out our mighty destiny
 by placing in our control
 the trade of the world
 Mr Speaker can there be
 a heart so dead as
 the earth not to beat
 with exultant pride when contemplat
 It was that step which
 if this Union were not
 incr such a destiny for
 his own native land Sir
 doomed to perish would make
 this country the since I
 have been thus hopeful of
 the destiny of center of
 the trade of the earth
 by giving us the my
 country I have known that
 the accomplish control of the
 trade of the eight hundred
 million ment of that destiny
 could be hastened or delayed
 people of Asia a trade
 which has been enjoyed by
 mutual good omces good feeling
 and fraternal by Europe for
 more than six hundred years

 and South or the re

 so fruitful that it has
 in verse turn made every
 nation which en jQyed it

 watched with much anxiety the
 storm cloud which I have
 seen gatherino and time the

 It was to accommodate that
 trade that Colum advancing from
 the North for ten years

 voyage ofdiscovery he wished have

 the North societies organized with
 no other object than to
 employ men to excite your
 own people to war on
 your brethren of the South
 It cannot be slavery that
 you war on because slavery
 exists in its worst form
 in sight of your own
 shore in Cuba I have
 never heard of your sending
 an emissary to Cuba though
 you have more frequent inter
 course with Havana than you
 have with any of our
 ports Who ever heard that
 you have ever made an
 effort to rob a master
 on that island of his
 slave Who ever heard one
 word said by your most
 malignant Abolitionist against slavery as
 it exists anywhere else except
 with your brethren of the
 South From their hands you
 have received nothing but kindness
 In return you send emissaries
 educated among you to rob
 poison burn and with the
 assassin s dagger to murder
 our people For twenty years
 we have submitted to this
 we loved the Union because
 we have been taught to
 love it It was the
 work of our fathers and
 if it could be preserved
 in the spirit in which
 they made it it would
 live fresh in eternal youth
 and exempt from mutability and
 decay But sir it exists
 no longer Its spirit has
 fled and when in the
 spirit land from the tomb
 it shall arise to testify
 against the authors of its
 untimely fate The South with
 conscious innocence will await the
 sentence because it will be
 just and the North will
 be pronounced guilty of the
 deep damnation of this taking
 off I have known Mr
 Speaker for ten years that
 dissolution must come I have
 seen the irrepress ible conflict
 between labor and capital at
 the North and known that
 it could but result in
 favor of the former inasmuch
 as that labor possessed the
 rev olutionary power there to
 wit the elective fran chise
 Wherever sir there is free
 competition between Inbor and capital
 and that laboris armed with
 the unrestricted right to vote
 the labor Being always in
 the majority musk sooner or
 later so control the law
 making power as to hold
 the cap ital subject to
 its will That labor has
 for many years past controlled
 the law making power of
 New England It has now
 gained control of the law
 making power in many States
 west of the Hudson and
 in the last presidential contest
 it aspired to and obtained
 the control of the law
 making power of this Governrnent
 Wherever there is free competition
 of labor and capital and
 that labor vindicates its power
 to control the Gov crnment
 liberiy cannot longsurvive Buttheworst t
 form of despotism will exist
 as long as there is
 capital left upon which it
 can féed When this fails
 the onkv result which can
 follow is for such a
 people to return to barbarism
 Thus societv at the North
 is now preTnantwit h Its
 only salva the seeds of
 its own destruction tion is
 a stronger Government and a
 restriction of the elective franchise
 This is not speculative theory
 but fact it is not
 wild imaginings but history The
 standing armies of the World
 are maintained to keep labor
 from warring on capital not
 by controlling the law making
 power for that labor has
 not the elective franchise and
 hence cannotaspire to theforms of
 justice to legal ize its
 robberies but those armies are
 maintained I to pfotect that
 capital from mob violence TV
 hat protection has your capital
 from the legalized rob bery
 to which it is even
 now soznetimes subjected Does not
 this free labor now set
 at naught your State decrees
 if they are annoying to
 it Has it not scaled
 the ramparts of the Federal
 Govern ment destroyed the Constitution
 enthroned the higher law in
 its stead and justified such
 action by alleging that their
 own State laws which they
 had made to screen thentselves
 required them to despise the
 authority of the General Government
 It is the free suffrage
 and free labor of the
 North which now controls the
 press the bar the schools
 It is the free labor
 of the North and the
 pulpit which has invaded the
 sanctity of God s altar
 and compelled its ministers to
 acknowledge its divinity by dethroning
 Jehovah and worshiping Beelzebub It
 is the free labor at
 the North which has invaded
 the highest judicial tribunal of
 justice destroying its prerogatives and
 teaching men to despise its
 decrees Sir it has so
 shattered the framework of society
 that society itself exists only
 in an inverted order at
 the North Capital at the
 North for a long time
 waged an unequal contest W
 ith labor It looked then
 to the Gov ernment and
 found that impotent for aid
 For momentary security it seemed
 to sympathize in the Objects
 of the fanatics and to
 point to the institutions of
 the South as fit objects
 for attack Fatal delusion They
 introduced the Trojan horse into
 their counting houses but drove
 away their best customers by
 their efforts to en slave
 them At the South our
 new republic will have no
 snch element of discord Capital
 there owns all labor which
 from its nature so lowers
 the man as to make
 him unfit for society and
 self govern ment Thus capital
 and labor in our new
 repub lic will work in
 beautiful harmony and it is
 thus that African slavery furnishes
 the only basis upon which
 republican liberty can be preserved
 You znuy ask me if
 we have not free labor
 at the South I answer
 yes in its natural form
 not warring on capital but
 sustained by it We are
 proud of that labor It
 is enlightened it con stitutes
 the main pillar in our
 structure It is the sword
 of our defense because it
 is elevated and I dignified
 by the conservative influence of
 African slavery It will thus
 in our new republic be
 the only place on the
 globe where frec suffrage and
 free labor constitute conservative elements
 in the structure of republican
 liberty It will be there
 alone where free labor will
 not be in antagonism to
 capital because capital owns the
 on r lab0i which can
 be oppressed by it and
 because labor being the capital
 will be as such carefully
 pre served Thus African slavery
 constitutes the keystone of the
 arch which supports the only
 structure which free labor together
 with free suffrage will as
 long as labor éfxhe South
 slavery been assailed and now
 chai you have göt itin
 the course of ultimate resolved
 to use your power and
 we are determibed to resist
 your authority What cause you
 allegefor thus warring on us
 Have we of the South
 ever withheld a right given
 you by the Constiputiou a
 wrong Have we not contributed
 to suc ccss and rejoicedin
 your prosperity Did not Virginia
 rhay God bless her m
 this hour in order to
 destroy jealousy between the North
 and South and give peace
 to the country give to
 the North the empire of
 the Northwest And now in
 this hour of her peril
 she turns her eyes to
 that powerful empire the fruit
 of her womb hu munity
 would apply the full breast
 of that vouthful exuberance to
 the mouth of its afflicted
 parent but tyranny would Nero
 like march to the throne
 over the prostrate form of
 its own mother You too
 Nero like when Capitol is
 being consumed by the torch
 which your own hands have
 applied are reveling amid the
 ruins which you made In
 the name of an outraged
 and oppressed people in the
 name of freemen who know
 their rights and will defend
 them and in the name
 of a just God I
 charge you to let this
 parricidal sin pass from you
 You are now about to
 assumc the reins of Government
 over what you have left
 of the American Union You
 as you know have acquired
 that power pledged to the
 accomplishment of a single object
 the ulti mate extinction of
 our cherished domestic insti tution
 African slavery Before we surrender
 the authority by which you
 are to govern us we
 only ask that you WiM
 give us guarantees by which
 you cannot deprive us of
 that protection which the Constitution
 of the United States as
 interpreted not by us but
 by the Supreme Court guaranties
 to us This you refuse
 to do You obtain power
 by pledges to war on
 the institutions of the South
 We ask you to throw
 away the weapons which you
 have drawn for our destruction
 before we yield to your
 authority This you contemptuously refuse
 to do and then sir
 in the memory of Virginia
 s his tory you appeal
 to her to preseroe the
 Union Then sirs beware Virginians
 will defend their liberties and
 preserve unrestricted the sovereign ty
 I of their State I
 hcy and the galla nt
 men of the South will
 not survive their liberties They
 were I born freemen and
 will never die slaves While
 all propositions for an honorable
 adjust ment have come from
 the injured outraged and insulted
 section we of that section
 have felt that they should
 come from the assailing party
 We not and cannot destroy
 It must not be supposed
 have felt this to be
 wounding to our pride and
 by the people of the
 North that the free labor
 of I in sonle degree
 tarnishing to our honor How
 the South can ever desire
 to disturb the relation ever
 it was a sacrifice upon
 the altar of our coun
 try and it was cheerfully
 made We owed this of
 master and slave on the
 contrary they will and must
 from ncccssity defend it as
 it is alone to the
 memoi y of our fathers
 we owed this to on
 the profit of slave labor
 that free labor finds our
 generous constituents who would give
 their employment and lives in
 peace and plenty It is
 lives to preserve the Unitn
 in its primitive purity we
 owed it to humanity to
 prevent our land from thus
 that African slavery elevates and
 dignifies the free labor of
 the South by freeing it
 of all menial being torn
 incivil strife and drenched in
 fraternal service Thus relieved that
 labor constitutes a blood We
 have discharged every duty that
 valuable social and political element
 in our Re honor patriotism
 and fidelity to our people

 but surrender the liberties of

 If then the merit of
 your opposition to slavery this
 House when they return to

 to compensate for the ruin
 and havoc which they have
 created To them will belong
 the responsibility of disrupting this

 will be attached the awful
 re sponsibility of exciting thirty
 million of the hap pieSt
 people On God s earth
 to forget that they are
 brethren and with all the
 destructive machmery of grim visaged
 war to destroy each other
 in civil strife On them
 will fall the cttrses of
 millions at the North whose
 trade they have destroyed and
 whose homes they have made
 desolate It is on you
 Republicans will fall the curses
 of the wid owed mother
 vv ho can no longer
 find bread for hZr starving
 children Go to your crowded
 cities not to the gilded
 palaces of your merchant princes
 but to the lanes and
 alleys and when you hear
 tl k e cries of
 thousands frantic with hunger and
 despair and behold here a
 mother with her inno cent
 children clasped around her in
 the agony of death from
 starvation and there another tearing
 her bosom because it can
 no longer afford nour ishment
 to her dying infant you
 will see the re sultofyourdevotion
 to your party platform You
 will have saved your party
 but you vill havb lost
 your country You will have
 vindicated your devotion to the
 negro by disregarding the voicc
 of humanity and the decrees
 of Heaven This is what
 you have already done If
 then the pros pect of
 Civil war which you have
 created has done all and
 much more than all this
 what I ask must be
 the misery agony and death
 which twenty five million brave
 people will inflict on each
 other Sir when the flames
 of civil war have swept
 over our once happy land
 from St John s to
 the Rid Grande and from
 the Atlantic to the Pacific
 when your cities and ours
 no longer resound with the
 busy hum of industry because
 they vvill be the first
 victims which the relentless mouths
 of cannon will dernand when
 OUE beauliful country where innocence
 resides and virtue sits enthroned
 shall return to its primitive
 occupants because nothing save the
 hyena can live amid such
 scenes of desolation and death
 then you will behold the
 work of your own hands
 If you have not yet
 seen enough to make you
 pause before you de clare
 war on the South and
 thus invoke on your heads
 the wrath of humanity and
 the vengeance of Heaven those
 of you who survive when
 it shall have been ended
 Will witness a scene which
 will melt your hearts though
 they may be harder than
 adamant When you are called
 on to witness the procession
 of ten rni ITion mourners
 and hear their cries for
 those Who have fallen in
 battle and hear that mighty
 multitude with one voice proclaim
 you the author of all
 their affiction you will in
 deed cry that the rocks
 may hide and the hills
 may cover you from their
 sight All this will you
 inflict on your country and
 yourselves sooner than let slavery
 alone It is an institution
 for which you are not
 re sponsible and about which
 you know nothing You say
 it is wrong and you
 will put it the course
 of ultimate extinction because slaves
 are some times treated with
 cruelty That they are some
 times but rarely treated with
 cruelty I will admit but
 such acts are punished by
 law and punished by society
 with great severity Still i
 know that there is more
 humanity there is more unalloyed
 contentment and happiness among the
 slaves of the South than
 any laboring population on the
 globe Where else but at
 the South are the laborers
 nursed when sick and taken
 care of when they get
 too old to work Where
 but at the South is
 it the interest of capital
 to provide food for the
 families of laborers when they
 are young and helpless It
 then being the interest of
 capi tal that the slave
 and his fa_mily should be
 well cared for in sickness
 and in health what stronger
 reason can be given that
 he will not be abused
 It is this interest in
 his labor that you would
 de prive him of After
 you do this have you
 not deprived him of his
 home and all the comforts
 he now enjoys Will you
 give him another home and
 provide him other comforts You
 know you not You will
 not do this to your
 neighbors of your own race
 and the starving poor among
 you but you will stand
 by and see the negro
 whom you is that you
 would abolish an institution which
 is sometimes oppressive go home
 and abolish your banking system
 go home and destroy your
 magnificent churches because some of
 your min isters have been
 bad men and go home
 and abol ish the institution
 of marriage_ because I know
 that for every master who
 cruelly treats his slave there
 are two white men at
 the North who torture and
 murder their wives Away then
 with such sickly sentimentality We
 know that it is not
 because you love the slave
 or desire to benefit his
 condition that yo uthus war
 on the South be cause
 when you have enticed him
 from his happy home we
 have seen you like the
 crocodile mingle your tears with
 the blood of your victim
 We know it is done
 to keep the northern mind
 in agitation never permitting it
 to settle down on your
 own productive elements of domestic
 dis content But for this
 agitation at the North so
 ciety could not stand the
 shock The revolution ary element
 at the North constitutes no
 part of that societv That
 element now controls the law
 making power and thus has
 the semblance of justice for
 its action It is thus
 that the capital of Boston
 is held subject to its
 command As to the best
 means of defense against this
 mighty power which knows no
 control but its will society
 at the North is divided
 There are those who to
 avoid offense have declined to
 take part in local elections
 as shown by the thousands
 of slumbering votes in the
 States east of the Hud
 son There are others who
 still having hopes of controlling
 it have joined in and
 desire sö to direct it
 as to prevent any disaster
 to themselves or the country
 For several years they did
 hold the reins of restraint
 and so checked its move
 ments as to prevent injury
 But now it has burst
 the dams and levees with
 which you for a time
 restrained it and by its
 resistless flood sweeps away and
 destroys all who oppose it
 Commu nities at the North
 or even their State govern
 ments cannot resist its march
 Nothing at the South can
 now resist it but State
 sovereignties and each State must
 throw this protection around their
 people or they are lost
 I have Mr Speaker attempted
 to show the apprec tion
 of those I represent for
 the Union I know of
 none who would not even
 rejoice to per petuate it
 as it was made by
 our fathers I have shown
 that it was not because
 they loved the Union less
 but their liberties more that
 they have made up their
 minds to leave it unless
 you give them such guarantees
 as will insure safety I
 have shown you that the
 South has never though smart
 ing under insults and injuries
 retaliated because she has observed
 the restrain ts of the
 Constitution That instrument has never
 been wounded by a southern
 hand or agency It has
 always been held sacred by
 our people and now finding
 that they cannot live peaceably
 with you of the North
 they will quietly leave your
 company They have made no
 threats they propose no violence
 to you In secession they
 assail no one threaten no
 one it is a remedy
 which is purely defensive and
 not aggressive because it is
 passwe and not active Your
 party desire to get rid
 of slavery because you say
 that the moral influence of
 the world is against slavery
 and by your contact with
 it you are compromised We
 propose quietly to relieve you
 of any contact or association
 with it Thus to preserve
 your refined sensibilities we propose
 to take slavery out of
 the Union and give you
 relief And now that the
 cotton States have done this
 and the border slave States
 are going to fol low
 their example and thus do
 what you have been tryins
 to do for twenty years
 you get into a violent
 rage and call the gods
 to witness that you will
 whip us into submission because
 x ve will not let
 you do it in your
 own way If you of
 the North would pause and
 reflect for one moment you
 would see the ridiculous position
 in which you thus place
 yourselves before the world But
 you will not you cannot
 stop You are impelled by
 a power which you cannot
 resist It is the power
 of England exerted on the
 revolutionary element of the North
 s vhich cannot and will
 not permit you to pause
 now that the object which
 England so devoutly wishes for
 is so near its ac
 complishment This Union must be
 destroyed or England will soon
 lose her hold on the
 trade of Asia England made
 every effort to check our
 advancement and development because she
 knew we were now her
 Only rivals for commerce Since
 the declaration of Sir Robert
 Peel made in advocacy of
 the appropriation of 100 000
 000 to emancipate the negroes
 in the West Indies that
 this was the best investment
 ever made for the overthrow
 of American institutions England has
 continued to agitate this abolition
 of slavery with a view
 of destroying our power by
 dividing us England knows that
 our commercial tonnage is greater
 than her own and is
 rapidly increas ing and that
 the time for decisive action
 has come By her gold
 as well as by agitating
 this anti slavery sentiment she
 has obtained great ascendency over
 the revolutionary elements of the
 North No man doubts that
 vast sums of England s
 gold drawn from the attenuated
 fingers of her slaving poor
 are sent here to keep
 alive the flames of fanaticism
 in which alone the po
 litical salamanders of the North
 can live The visits of
 Fred Douglass and William H
 Seward to England sometimes become
 necessary to keep alive and
 excite the sometimes slumbering masses
 of their followers England by
 way of a spur to
 their movements occasionally confers the
 honör of knighthood on some
 sable swain and by way
 of variety insults our minister
 for the amusement of the
 gentleman from Africa This sir
 is not the result of
 an abolition senti ment in
 England as abundantly shown by
 her unwillingness to force Spain
 to execute a treaty long
 since made to abolish slavery
 in all her pos sessions
 Nor is it because she
 respects the rights of men
 or their freedom because she
 is to day engaged in
 the cooly trade by which
 she consigns white men to
 the most cruel and perpetual
 bond age But it is
 because by this means atone
 she can hope to break
 the power of her most
 danger ous rival for the
 trade of the East Cannot
 the people of the North
 now on the verge of
 the pre cipice stop one
 moment for reflection Would it
 not be better for you
 to live on terms of
 equality and friendship with those
 who were once your brethren
 at the South Can you
 show in what particular England
 after she through your in
 strumenta ity has disrupted this
 Union will be benefited by
 trading with you Are you
 not England s rivals for
 most of the goods sold
 in the States She you
 declare by your tariff bill
 can manufacture the articles which
 we consume thirty five per
 cent cheaper on an average
 than you can and hence
 you by that bill will
 compel us to give you
 thirty five cents in every
 dollar to ena ble you
 to meet her at your
 own factories If this tax
 should be continued in our
 new con federacy the trade
 of England will be no
 more restricted than it is
 now How will it be
 with you Instead of receiving
 the thirty five per cent
 which you propose to give
 yourselves in this new tariff
 you will have to pay
 that much duty Thus you
 will receive on all goods
 sold at the South thirty
 five cents in every dollar
 less than you would receive
 if you had not destroyed
 the Union We then being
 now the consumers of the
 noi th ern manufactures and
 the North no longer being
 protected in our markets she
 will be driven to abandon
 manufacturing only for the northern
 States except such articles as
 those where the cost of
 the raw material constitutes the
 chief ele mcnt of its
 manufacture This is shown more
 conclusively in a correct analysis
 of the elements constituting the
 cost of manufacture In all
 manufactures the elements of cost
 are thus enumerated and classified
 first the wages of la
 bor second the interest on
 capital and third the value
 of the raw material labor
 forty per cent capital fifty
 per cent and the raw
 mate rial ten per cent
 This I believe is found
 cor rect except in coarse
 fabrics In such the raw
 material enters as the chief
 element of cost as in
 coarse cotton Our factories having
 the advant age of ten
 per cent in the cost
 of cotton can for this
 reason clothe the operatives in
 the English factories for in
 such a fabric the raw
 material constitutes a very large
 part of its value The
 English manufacturers pay but half
 what we pay for labor
 and capital and those two
 ele ments constitute ninety per
 cent in cost of the
 fab rics sent here You
 of the North cannot compete
 with them It is thus
 that you lose and Engiand
 gains by your folly Agarn
 you can never in duce
 England to remain hostile to
 the South be THE CONGRESSIONAL

 CAMPBELL CYRUS ALDRICH Managers on
 thå part of the House
 of Representatices Mr PEARCE I
 propose now very briefly to
 explain to the Senate the
 operation of this report It
 is proposed that the Senate
 recede from their disagreement to
 the amendment of the House
 of Representatives to the second
 amendment of the Senate Thc
 second amendment of the Senate
 appropriateS 3 000 for miscelianeous
 items in the contingent expenses
 of the Senate The House
 add to that appropriation these
 items For additional police for

 Sen ate 096 97 and
 for additional pojiee för the

 To supply deficiencies in the

 the said sum shall be
 added to the rniscellaneous itenl

 in Wind er s building
 und Ibr cleansing repairing and
 furnishing the same 3 508
 55 The House concur in
 the Senate s fifth amend
 ment with an amendment This
 amendment relatcs to the Kickapoo
 land office The appro priation
 was for the sum of
 12 857 92 for the
 paytuent of extraordinary exl enses
 clerk hire offce rent fuel
 c allowed under the act
 of 1856 by the Interior
 Department but subject to the
 approval of Congress The effect
 of the amendment of the
 committee of conference is to
 reduce the amount by so
 much as is asked for
 offce rent fuel c The
 object of the law of
 1856 was to the Secretary
 of the Interior to au
 thorize certain extraordinary expenses The
 com mittee did not consider
 office rent and fuel as
 extraordinary expenses but ordinary and
 ncccs sar_y to be provided
 for as in other cases
 that is by the registers
 at their own expense T
 lint was therefore stricken out
 Then they provide that the
 charges for tho extra clerk
 hire Shull be there being
 proof before the committee allowed
 o the cxtraoédinary amount of
 work performed As there was
 sorne difficulty at that land
 office arising in regard to
 the amount of compensation allowed
 these clerks it is provided
 that the Sec retary of
 the Interior shall determine upo
 i the fairness of the
 charge and then it was
 thought the repeal of the
 advisable to recommend also seventh
 section of the act of
 1856 which for thc first
 time allot ved the Departmentof
 the Interior to estimate for
 and conditionally to sanction these
 extra allowances for clerk hire
 It was thought that that
 act tended very mucb to
 induce persons holding offices of
 this sort to run up
 expendi tures of this kind
 There are various ways in
 which it could be perceived
 that it was to the
 in terest of the registers
 and receivers to employ extra
 clerks and claim these extra
 allowances It was lhought best
 therefore to repeal it especially
 as it was understood thal
 the law had Ylevu been
 recommended by the Department of
 the Interior or the Land
 Office but had by some
 inadvert ence crept into the
 appropriation bill of that I
 he sixth amendment relates to
 compensation for carrving the mail
 by way of Panama to
 Mr Vanderbilt under a cortract
 made with the Post master
 Genera which no doubt the
 Senate recol lect The effect
 of the amendment of the
 House Of Represéntatives was to
 strike out the last para
 graph of that amendment which
 in fact by some oversight
 was a mere duplication of
 the former part and allowed
 pav for the same service
 twice We agreed therefore to
 recommend to the Senate ment
 on the part of the
 House The last was the
 itcm which appropriated 300 000
 for carrying out the conditional
 contract made between the Navy
 Department and Ambrose W Thompson
 and the Chiriqui Improvement Company
 This subject has been much
 discussed before the committee We
 have been debating it for
 three days There were various
 considera tions all of which
 it is not necessary to
 mention Two however I will
 mention The House of Representatives
 seemed to be inflexibly opposed
 to It first upon the
 ground that the state of
 the Treasury absolutely forbade their
 making any ap propriation for
 this object at this time
 and then there seemed to
 be a doubt whether it
 was not absolutely necessary in
 order to secure the Uni
 ted States fully in the
 advantages intended to be The
 message further announced that the
 House had aereed to the
 report of the committee of
 con ference on the disagreeing
 votes of the two Houses
 on the bill H R
 No 866 to supply deficiencies
 in the appropriations for the
 service of the fiscal year
 ending June 30 1861 ENROLLED

 that the S eaker had
 signed an enrolled bill H

 con olidated land omces TERRITORY
 OF DAKOTA The PRESIDENT pro
 tempore The hour of half
 past twelve o clock having
 arrived it is in cumbent
 on the Chair to call
 up the special order for
 this hour which is the
 bill S No 502 to
 acquired by that contract that
 the assent of the provide
 a temporary government for the
 Territory New Granadian Government should
 be given to of Dakota
 and to create the offce
 of surveyor it I liere
 have been somc indications in
 an opin eneral therein The
 bill is before the Senate
 as ion of the suprcrne
 court of New Granada that
 in Committee of the Whole
 the assent of that Government
 ought to be bad Mr
 G WIN ask the consent
 of the Senator It wag
 thought advisable that this should
 be ob from Missouri to
 allow me to make a
 report from tained in order
 to make secure the privileges
 in the Committee on the
 Post Offcc and Post Roads
 tended to be acquired by
 this contract It appeared i
 I as I want to
 have it printed for early
 considera very certain that the
 harbors to which this con
 II tion tract relates were
 excecdingly fine harbors easy of
 access of great depth of
 water and with gen erally
 bold shores that there was
 coal imme diately on their
 border and within a very
 short distance quite accessible and
 that this coal would be
 valuable for the purposes of
 our steam marine in the
 Gulf of Mexico and in
 the Caribbean sea It s
 vas therefore admitted by the
 committee gen era ly that
 it was desirable the United
 States should obtain these privileges
 if it could be done
 wit_h perfect prudence but the
 objections which I have mentioned
 svere all powerful with the
 com mittee of the House
 of Representatives and the Senate
 committee felt that they were
 not justified in insisting upon
 a measure of this sort
 as an amendment to the
 deficiency bill which might jeopard
 the bill as we were
 assured it would ccr tainly
 do We thought that upon
 an independent Incasure inserted in
 an appropriation bill we had
 not right to sacrifice the
 bill in order to force
 the other I lousc to
 a compliance with that amend
 ment We tl longht too
 that the contract would not
 be destroyed by the refusa
 to appropriate the money at
 this time aud that when
 the additional security contemplated h
 v the objcction of the
 com mittee could be had
 it would Ge quite competent
 to Congress at the ilext
 session to ratify this con
 tract and secure the privileges
 intended to be obtained by
 it Mr GREEN I call
 for the special order of

 us take this vote this
 cannot be voted Mr GREEN

 necessary to have the bills

 with ctniess some one desires

 copy of the terri torial
 bill which we passed the
 other day we all understand
 it Mr GREEN Certainly it
 is Mr DOUGLAS Do I

 further announced that the I
 louse had concurred in the
 amendments of the Senate to
 Mr GREEN I have already
 got that marked the joint
 resolution H R No 62
 for the benefit to change
 it I move in the
 nineteenth line of of George
 H Giddings PRINTING OF DOCUMENTS
 the first section to strike
 out the words State of
 Oregon and insert rcrritory of
 Washing ton and in the
 twentieth line to strike out
 the The message fl u
 ther announced that the House
 State ofOrégon and I will
 explain why that is had
 ordered on the 15th instant
 at twelve o clock This
 was drawn from an old
 model furnished to i and
 fifty five minutes the peint
 ing ofa memorial me by
 my predecessor when Oregon carne
 up to I of the
 Legislature of the Iterritory of
 Karlsas the sumrnit of the
 Rocky N lountuins l üt
 since asking an appropriation of
 money for the payment Oregon
 was admitted as a State
 the remainder of of claims
 awarded to citizens of Kansas
 by the Oregon Territory was
 attached to the Territory claim
 commissioners of Washington and it
 is therefore necessary for 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE us to
 say Washington instead of Oregon
 in fixing the boundary The
 amendment vas agreed to Mr
 KING The usual practice of
 the Senate has been to
 present petitions as the first
 thing in order in the
 morning hour and I move
 to post pone this bill
 for a few minutes for
 that purpose or if there
 be no objection I will
 present my peti tions without
 making that motion Mr GREEN
 1 have objection I want
 to get through with this
 bill Mr KING I move
 to postpone the present order
 of business until an opportunity
 can be had for the
 presentation of petitions memorials and
 reports Mr GREEN we a
 special order yes terday and
 I think we can get
 through with it in I
 hope therefore the Senate will
 half an hour vote down
 the motion of the Senator
 from New York Mr KING
 we ought to have this
 little cour tegy of being
 allowed to present these papers
 We do not x Vant
 to bring them here morning
 after morning to be presented
 The usual practice has been
 to allow petitions to be
 presented as the It is
 first in order I do
 not want to first thing
 postpone the bill if I
 can help it but as
 the pre sentation of petitions
 is objected to 1 must
 make the motion Mr LATHAM
 I call for tho yeas
 and nays T ho yeas
 and nays were ordered Mr
 GREEN I want to know
 who will kill the territorial
 bills for I shall never
 call them up agam Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 desire simply to
 say one word I dislike
 very much to disagree with
 my friend from New York
 but we havc this strug
 gle almost daily and waste
 away the morning hour It
 will take ten or fifteen
 minutes to debate the question
 and take the yeas and
 nays W c have the
 territorial bills up They are
 important They were assigned for
 this hour We are in
 the midst of them Now
 comes in a motion to
 post pone thern and to
 bring in other things If
 the Senator from New York
 had had the floor upon
 a bill I should have
 insisted on his retaining it
 until he was through We
 lose much time by this
 course and I hope he
 Will not persist Mr KING
 It will be necessary to
 have some more definite rule
 such as they have in
 tho House of Representatives if
 thc practice which we have
 been falling into lately be
 persisted in by the Sen
 ate T herc is a
 scramble for the floor in
 the morning which we ought
 not to have here MT
 e should do business a
 great deal better by going
 on in regular order The
 PRESIDENT pro tempore The Chair
 re quests Senators to refrain
 from loud conversa tion which
 so seriously interrupts the body
 in its business Mr KING
 1 think it much better
 we Mr GREEN In the
 ninth section sixty sixth line
 I move to strike out
 Oregon and In the tenth
 section four insert Nebraska teenth
 line to strike out Oregon
 and insert Nebraska This is
 in relation to the fees
 of the clerk and marshal
 so that they shall receive
 the same as offcers in
 Nebraska Terrttory The amendment was
 agrced to Mr GREEN On
 consultation with the chair man
 of the committee in the
 House of Represent atives have
 agreed to move to strike
 out in the the words
 in the forty fifth line
 ninth section after the word
 dollars down to the fiftieth
 line I will read the
 words to be to the
 word 6 and stricken out
 Except that a writ of
 error or appeal shall be
 allowed to the Supre mc
 Court of the United States
 from the decision of tho
 said supreme court created by
 this act or of any
 judge thereof or of the
 district courts created by this
 act or of any judge
 thereof upon any writ of
 habeas corpus involving the question
 of personal freedom The existing
 law covers the entire case
 any how and therefore there
 is no necessity for this
 clause Mr DOUGLAS 1 should
 be obliged to the Senator
 from Missouri if he x
 vould point my at tention
 to what existing law there
 is that covers that provision
 if it be stricken out
 Mr GREEN The remainder of
 the same section is And
 cackl of the said district
 courts hall have and exer
 cise the same jurisdiction in
 ail cases arising under tbe
 Constitution and laws of the
 United States as is vested
 in i the circuit and
 district courts of the United
 States and the paid supremo
 an l district courts of
 the said Yerritory and the
 respective judges thereof shall and
 inn y grant writs of
 habeas corpus in ail cases
 in which the same are
 grantable I by the judges
 of the United States inn
 the District of Co lumbia
 That covers the same thing
 precisely Mr DOUGLAS I am
 nol satisfied that that does
 cover it The one provides
 for an appeal to the
 Supreme Court in the case
 of an issue in vol
 ving personal freedom The other
 provides for of habeas corpus
 Onc is a matter of
 habea corpus and the other
 a matter of appeal They
 are entirely diffCnrent matters This
 pro vision of the bill
 has a history During the
 pendency of the compromise measures
 of 850 It was suggested
 that unless this provision was
 inserted in the territorial bills
 if a person was mistaken
 thereau y necessitytor ihat appeal
 in case of habeas fib
 of the same section At
 says that corpus shall be
 tried in a II cases
 and the rightofrappeal shall exist
 in all cases as it
 now exists inr täht District
 of Columbia Is not that
 satisfactory That is the reason
 that 1 made this motion
 thought the bill as it
 stood ilooked like a sort
 of multiplication of unnecessary wordS
 rl liig amendment involves no
 quesoon between the northern and
 southern States between the slavery
 and the anti Slavery sentiment
 I t is simply for
 the purpose of simplifying the
 bill and bringing it down
 so that we can comprehend
 it with legs tautology than
 has heretofore been found in
 ter ritorial bills Mr DOUGLAS
 I only desire the Senate
 to understand preciSely what they
 are asked to do I
 shall not argue its but
 simply to it the I
 do not think that I
 am attention of the Senate
 mistaken as to the effect
 Of it The amendment is
 to strike out these words
 Except that a writ of
 error or appeal shalFbe allowed
 to the Supreme Court of
 the United States from of
 the said supreme court created
 by this act or of
 any judge thereof or of
 the district courts created by
 this act or of any
 judge thereof upon any writ
 of habeas corpus What else
 involving the question of personal
 freedpm It is where there
 is a case of habeas
 corpus in valving personal freedom
 that the appeal is aim
 lowed by the original bill
 The objection used to be
 that inasmuch as an appeal
 could not be takcn to
 the Supreme Court of the
 United States except where the
 amount in controversy was 1
 000 and the slave might
 not be worth If the
 local court decided against his
 freedom when it came up
 on a writ of habeas
 corpus tliequestion could not come
 before the Supteme Court Of
 the United States Toobviate that
 we provided thut the slave
 might appeal to the Supreme
 Court of the United States
 and try the question of
 freedom there Now this is
 a proposition to repeal so
 much of the law as
 gives the alleged slave the
 right of appeal when the
 decision is madc against If
 tho other sided the him
 in the local court Chamber
 or this side desire to
 deny that right of appeal
 a right that has existed
 since the clause was inserted
 then for the express pur
 pose of giving it all
 I have to do is
 to ask for the arrested
 as a slave who claimed
 his freedom he yeas and
 nays on the adoption of
 this amendment could not get
 an appeal to thc Supreme
 Court of I repeat the
 next clause does not covsr
 the ques the United States
 to have thc qucstion tried
 for tion the next clause
 relates merely to th yright
 the reason that the value
 of the slave might not
 to issue writs of habeas
 corpus and does not give
 be 1 000 and hence
 he could not avail himself
 the right of appeal when
 the decision is fwainst In
 order to enable a of
 the benefit of the right
 the person claiming his freedom
 The simple person claimed as
 a slave but who claimed
 toe be free to bring
 his suit for personal freedom
 and II question in in
 åis amendment is whether to
 have an appeal to the
 Supreme Court of the ii
 you deny tn the alleged
 slave claiming his freedom the
 right to appeal or not
 I ask for the I
 yeas and nays on the
 amendment United States this provision
 was inscrtcd i presume the
 Senators who wrere mombers of
 the The yeas and nays
 were ordered I body at
 that day will recollect the
 aroument upon Mr GREEN I
 merely wish to make this
 It was adopted according to
 my recollection should take this
 business in its order It
 will take it remark am
 sa tisfiedexwi h it in
 or with it out but
 a few moments probably to
 dispose Of the unanimously after
 the necessities of it had
 been do not see the
 object of the arnend I
 have moved the amendment at
 the instance of petitions and
 reports and then this bill
 connes up as pointed out
 the chairman of the Committee
 on Territories of a matter
 of course Petitions and other
 business I ment striking it
 out Is it to deny
 to a person I know
 it will not amount to
 the other House I am
 disposed to let the who
 is claimed as a slave
 but who claims that he
 have been crowded out is
 free the privilege of appeal
 if the local court a
 feather cither way for the
 law covers the case Senato
 decide the question but in
 my judgment it expedites the
 business to do things in
 their decides against his freedom
 That seems to be II
 a the Senator thinks a
 slave ought to have this
 priv I the cffcct cannot
 see any other unless some
 i ilege of appeal do
 not think so If one
 is order Mr G T
 VIN Before this vote is
 taken I will reason for
 striking out be given As
 it now is wrongfully held
 in slavery and wants to
 claim the state that I
 am as anxious as any
 member Of this I a
 person claimed as n slave
 has a right to brirw
 b right to appeal to
 the court he ought to
 have it body to pass
 the territorial bills but I
 have a his suit for
 freedorn and if the local
 court decides but not so
 with onc ivho is rightfully
 held in sla against him
 he has the right of
 appeal This report from the
 Committee on the Post Office
 very However I am perfecily
 willing for it to and
 Post Roads to make on
 a question Of amendment takes
 away thc right of appeal
 in the be strickcn outs
 or perfectly willing for it
 to be consequence to my
 State and to a portion
 of these event of the
 local court deciding aoainst him
 Territories at least and that
 is in regafd to the
 Why should that appeal be
 taken away We j retained
 The law covers the case
 already if assage through Congress
 of a systen l of
 over inserted it ten yoars
 ago for the express purpose
 tology and therefore I am
 content in either and mails
 All I want is to
 make my report and of
 giving the right of appeal
 in such cases case have
 it printed so that it
 can come up for consid
 i I should certainly like
 to know some reason for
 Mr DOUGLAS One word more
 1t cannot eration i consider
 it due to the committee
 that striking it out of
 this bill be allowed to
 go off on the ground
 that i am they should
 have it broughtup and considered
 at Mr GREEN The Senator
 is a little mistaken wishing
 to give a slave and
 not a free man the
 The clause that I propose

 fthe slave if you please
 to call him BO as
 well as where it is
 against him Suppose the court
 in the Territory decides that
 the man is free then
 the person claiming to hold
 him as a slave may
 take an appeal just as
 a person who should be
 decided to be a slave
 m lght take an appeal
 the decision being against him
 Now the object of striking
 out these words is to
 take away the right of
 appeal as understand it in
 both cases It is not
 allowed in other cases in
 the United States An appeal
 is not allowed from the
 decision of a United States
 judge in the State of
 Illinois on questioninvolVing personal freedom
 either by the person who
 claims to hold the slave
 or by the slave himself
 to the Supreme Court of
 the United States Tl his
 is an innovation upon the
 general I was not in
 the law The object is
 evident committee but it is
 apparent that the object of
 striking out the clause is
 to leave that class of
 cases just where they are
 left in all the States
 There was another clause of
 the Kansas Nebraska bill which
 is not in this bill
 that my colleague has alluded
 to and I think he
 has confounded ihe two together
 There was a clause in
 that bill which al lowed
 an appeal to the Supreme
 Court of the United States
 in all cases without regard
 to the value in controversy
 where the title to slaves
 was involved That clause is
 notin this bill at all
 and that clause has nothing
 to do with the one
 which we are now considering
 It is not necessary for
 me to imaøine what the
 reasons were for striking it
 out but that is an
 entirely distinct matter The matter
 in con tröversy here has
 nothing to do with that
 case for it is simply
 giving appeals to the Supreme
 Court of the United States
 in habeas corpus cases That
 ig not done anywhere else
 and there is just as
 much necessity for it in
 the States as there svould
 I merely wish to have
 the be in the Territories
 mattcr understood Mr DOUGLAS My
 colleague has shown the propriety
 of having the bill read
 and I shall now be
 under the necessity of calling
 for the reading of the
 entire bill He discloses the
 fact that an other important
 provision v hich has been
 usual in I erritorial bills
 and uniformly inserted from 1850
 down is omitted in this
 one These tsvo provisions the
 one he has last called
 attention to m regard to
 the tillc to slave property
 and tl KXt in regard
 to questions of personal freedom
 were both inserted in 1850
 after full debate upon the
 ground that if the master
 of a slave brought a
 suit in the Territories for
 the recovery of his slave
 and the decision of the
 local court should be wrainst
 him he might appeal and
 if on the con trary
 the person who was alleged
 to be a slave brought
 his suit for personal freedom
 he might appeal It was
 to give Supreme Court the
 right to hear the decisions
 of the local courts upon
 th at point Mr TRUMBULL

 thereon and on so exported
 have not been presented to
 the Senate This bill itself
 as a whole is a
 very great change of the
 present mode of conducting much
 in the business of the
 country dependent upon the revenue
 law and great changes in
 business are undesirable I remember
 very well when this Narehousinm
 sys tern was adopted It
 was a subject of very
 grave and serious discussion and
 debate some years It has
 operated vell for before it
 was adopted the mercantile classes
 This bill in all its
 pro visions bears upon the
 commerce of the country and
 in my judgment it would
 be well in levying the
 increased duties which we are
 compelled to do for revenue
 if vy e should relieve
 that class from what they
 may consider a very great
 injury to their business by
 leaving them the warehouse system
 as it is Let it
 alone and leave it to
 them so as not to
 interrupt in that vv ay
 their business I They have
 been in the habit of
 imporling a large amount of
 goods and storing them in
 the ware houses which whenever
 they are wanted by the
 country arc taken from the
 warehouses and the duty paid
 If they are to be
 reéxported of course the revenues
 of the country and the
 interests of this country particularly
 are not effected except that
 our own people have had
 the carriace over the sea
 and the transportation of them
 and the increase which that
 has given to their commerce
 I hope therefore that the
 warehousing system will be left
 undisturbed I have no disposition
 however to extend the discussion
 on this matter unnecessarily I
 believe it is pretty well
 under stood by the Senate
 and I hope thc amendment
 of my colleague will prevail
 Mr GRIMES 1 should like
 to have the Sen ator
 inform us what is the
 character of the goods that
 are generally left in the
 warel ouses over the period
 of one year For whose
 benefit or for what particular
 branch of trade is this
 warehous ing to be used
 I understand from the Senator
 from Rhode Island that almost
 the whole amount of goods
 that are kept in warehouse
 over twelve months arc liquors
 Mr SEWARD Oh no Mr
 GRIMES I understood him to
 say so Mr KING They
 remain with other goods undoubtedly
 but there are all sorts
 of goods Mr GRIMES The
 Senator from Rhode Island said
 they were nearly all liquors
 that remain there over a
 year Mr SIMMONS desire to
 say a word on I
 am notgoing to detain the
 Senate this subject The Senator
 from New York yesterday stated
 that this warehousing system was
 a great advantage to the
 commerce of the country that
 a large amount of these
 goods in the warehouse were
 reshipped and thus added a
 great deal to the carrying
 trade I took the pains
 this morning to find out
 what proportion of the foreign
 goods were réexported i find
 that from 1821 to 1826
 the importation of foreign merchandize
 bore a proportion of twenty
 I two per cent to
 the whole imports Mr SUMNER
 During what time Mr SIMMONS
 From 1821 to 1826 twenty
 two per cent of the
 foreign goods vas reshipped in
 our own vessels From i827
 to 1837 thirteen i and
 a half per cent were
 reshipped From 1837 to 1841
 there werc cight pot cent
 reshipped and since this warehousino
 system has come into op
 eration there were but five
 and three fourths per cent
 The amount reshipped is not
 one quarter what it was
 before we had this system
 merely a plan to get
 credit on duties nothing Mr
 GRIMES What was the character
 of the goods Mr SIMMONS
 In 1857 the first year
 I took there were 56
 487 000 in warehouse as
 I stated yesterday the duties
 on which would amount to
 i There x vas but
 one schedule of 30 per
 cent and that was on
 wines brandies and I liquors
 and there were not enough
 of those the warehouses at
 30 per cent to make
 out the the duties thereon
 Shakl be retUnded E duties
 by 10 000 I tl
 kink it is a kind
 of place The message further
 announced that the House deducting
 onc per centum but no
 duties shall be refunded had
 ordered to day at twelve
 o clock and sixteen on
 goods wares or merchandise withdrawn
 morc than six months after
 the time the duties were
 paid thereon minutes the printing

 Mr KING This proposition Mr
 President ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED was
 the subject of some debate
 yesterday but Themesage fuFthevannounced that
 the Speaker there are considerations
 connected with it which where
 hey quarter this corruption fund
 They can take it out
 and change the liquors as
 they II have a mind

 not desire to embarrass commerce
 I am willing to crive
 as Inucll time as an

 can afford to rive credit
 for this i is sirnply
 a plan to give credu
 011 the duties 1 i
 am willing to give it
 for three months or five
 have no particular so i
 months or six months 1861
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE licitude about
 it 1 do not want
 to hurt com mcrce but
 i do not think this
 Government is in a condition
 to give three years credit
 on duties and hire money
 at 12 per cent ourselves
 That is the only objection
 I have to it Mr
 SEWARD Mr President 1 did
 nothear and if I had
 I should not perhaps have
 the facts with which to
 enable me to answer the
 statement of the honorable Senator
 from Rhode Island about the
 relative amount of the goods
 that are reshipped after being
 kept in the public warehousv
 I sup pose that depends
 on the fluctuations m trade
 owing to the peculiar circumstances
 and condition of t he
 country Bat rise to rnake
 another point and that is
 that the credit which is
 given is nota credit because
 if there were no such
 privilege allowed as receiving these
 goods into thc store houses
 to be kept there would
 be only the quan tity
 of goods imported into the
 country at any one time
 which the of the market
 at that time should require
 and it would be an
 im portation into different ports
 instead of into two or
 three prominent ports wh ich
 are the great entre pots
 of foreion commerce such as
 New York New Orleans and
 San Francisco The goods are
 brought here and deposited in
 these warehouses chiefly for the
 purpose of beinrr reéxported to
 for eign countries without paying
 any duty or being sent
 coastwise to other ports iii
 the United States There is
 on the part of the
 merchant every burden necessary and
 every indi lcement is of
 fer ed to him to
 pay the duties as soon
 as hc can advantageously seik
 the goods either in out
 own markets or in foreign
 countries for in the first
 place he has to lay
 out of all the interest
 on the capital which is
 in vested i the goods
 in the next place he
 has to pay insurancc upon
 the goods he has to
 take the risk of the
 market and he has besides
 that to bear the loss
 in the deterioration the depreciation
 of the goods Since stress
 has been laid upon the
 fact that a considera ble
 amount of foreign goods which
 arc imported aud deposited in
 these warehouses are wines and
 liquors it is proper to
 state that he has to
 suffer a loss of not
 less than 5 per cent
 per annum upon an averacre
 of all the liquors which
 he has in store by
 waste from evaporation and deterioration
 of the article Mr MASON
 Mr President r gather from
 the character of this bill
 and the tenor of the
 de bate of its advoc
 ates that it is avowedly
 now a tariff for protection
 for revenue as incidental but
 for protection primarily I am
 very little convers ant with
 mercantile matters the arcana of
 trade and there are arcana
 about it but I am
 at some loss to know
 in what way this great
 end of pro tcctior i
 is to be attained by
 abolishing the ware house system
 It is to be attained
 in some way I do
 not doubt incidentally it is
 to be attained at the
 expense of the great importing
 mercantile the protection of the
 laws after he come s
 here finds it desirable to
 bring any portion of his
 prop erty with him he
 should do it and do
 it v ithout let or
 hindrance But this Government obtains
 a portion of its revenue
 upon importations which It has
 a right to do The
 policy of that law goes
 no further than this if
 property of any kind iS
 brought into this country either
 to be enjoyed here or
 still more to be sold
 here the Govern meat makes
 an exaction upon it That
 is the whole policy of
 the revenue laws fairly adminis
 tered and fairly expounded If
 it is the purpose of
 the importer to sell it
 or to enjoy it here
 as property then the Government
 imposes an exac tion in
 the form ofa duty but
 if it is not brought
 here for that purpose or
 if being brou ht here
 it is not used for
 that purpose then demand upon
 what principle of morals or
 political ethics can the Government
 exact a duty merely becausc
 it is brought in Nor
 is such the policy of
 the laws as I understand
 them The Government in other
 words is only interested in
 taking care that its revenue
 laws shall not be evaded
 but shall be complied with
 Now what are its revenue
 laws what is its revenue
 policy The revenue policy only
 is that if property is
 brought here from abroad either
 for sale or consumption in
 this country the duty shall
 I deny then absolutely that
 the be imposed mere fact
 ofbringing property here gives the
 Gov ernment thc right to
 exact a duty when under
 the existing laws if I
 understand them correctly after the
 duty is paid if the
 merchandise is reéx ported there
 i a drawback the whole
 policy of the Government being
 not to exact the duty
 unless the merchandise is sold
 consumed here Now what is
 the policy of the warehousing
 system l he merchants understand
 their interest and their occupation
 in life far better than
 understand it and regulate it
 for their benefit by legislation
 As vvas said by the
 Senator from New York abolish
 the warehousing system and tbc
 result will be that vou
 restrict trade to this extent
 nothing will be brought in
 that is not brought into
 an exacted market where there
 is a sale for it
 because otherwise the merchant would
 not only be losing thc
 benefit of so Inuch capital
 as was used in paying
 the duty but at the
 same time he would be
 losincr the fruit of the
 dcad cap ital upon his
 hands in form of merchandise
 Then I should say this
 is for the benefit of
 trade We ace all interested
 in that We are all
 inter ested in having what
 the political economists call emphatically
 a market some place where
 any trader can co with
 a knowledge that he can
 buy there at any moment
 anythinff that is for sale
 in any part of the
 world That the character of
 London as I understand it
 I hat makes London II
 the great market of the
 world built up by this
 very interests of the country
 The reasons that have system
 of deposi called warehousing A
 man been assigned by honorable
 Senators on the other side
 for abolishing this system are
 not only not satisfactory to
 my m nd but without
 intending any offense which I
 do not those reasons seem
 to me evasions The honorable
 Senator from Rhode Island who
 has charge of this bill
 chiefly Mr SIMMONS spoke of
 it as giving a credit
 for the goods thus warehoused
 and that that credit should
 not be too extensive The
 Senator from Pennsylvania Mr CAMERON
 spoke of it as a
 right to exact the payment
 of duties å debt and
 to illustrate it he said
 that if this right of
 the United States werc enforced
 by law now we could
 exact at once the ordinary
 customs upon the whole amount
 of im I take issue
 with portations now in warehouse
 I say there is no
 debt no due no him
 at once can go to
 London witli tbc knowledge that
 he can I buy in
 London any kind of merchandise
 which can be found in
 any part of the world
 That can only bc by
 the merchants being allowed to
 bring mcrchandise into the port
 in advance of any de
 mand in the market So
 it has been as I
 understand in New York It
 is done at great cost
 to the importer for he
 not only loses the outlay
 for the freight and the
 insur ance but he loses
 the outlay as was well
 said here of the interest
 upon the capital that is
 in vcsted But yet they
 do it and they do
 it because the trade authorizes
 and calls for it However
 for some hidden reconditc schcmc
 of protection that is to
 be taken away Commerce is
 to be taxed in some
 way for some cause yet
 undisclosed and i restricted and
 embarrassed in its operation for
 I the purpose in some
 mode of benefiting the tnan
 right either in fair political
 ethics or in the exist
 ing law making provision for
 the payment of I ufacturer
 I cån view it in
 no other light and I
 duties none whatever Certainly in
 political can see no propriety
 in the world in denying
 to the merchants the liberty
 of making a deposit on
 quantity thereany objection to its
 posited in the country on
 that aceount If there be
 a policy to prohibit it
 let it be done butkif
 i4 beallowed to come I
 cannot in the range of
 my comprehension see why it
 should not be allowed to
 remain on deposit here as
 well as abroad will it
 diminish the revenue i cannot
 appreciate at all th nuggestions
 of honorable Senators t htü
 the Government i8 delayed in
 the cpliecLion pf i e
 revenue No revenue attaches no
 revehue ought to attach until
 it is used in the
 couritryfor sale or consumption and
 until then it is a
 bare de 1 deny therefore
 that the revenue is posit
 affected by itin the slightest
 degree If there be any
 reason why this burden should
 be thrown upon the importing
 Interest the commercial in terest
 for the benefit of the
 manufacturer let it be disclosed
 for it has not been
 disclosed so far as understand
 it Mr CLINGMAN Mr Presidents
 as 1 un derstand the
 advantage of this warehousing sys
 tem it is to prevent
 Injury from extreme priced If
 you do not have it
 a nd goods are very
 low the importers may be
 ruined they get no remuneray
 tion If on the other
 hand goods should be highs
 the consumers suffer By taking
 a poktion of the goods
 therefore that come in at
 plentiful time and depositing them
 in warehouse the result is
 that before prices get very
 high they are with drawn
 It prevents theextreme vibrationsoftradg either
 high or low It is
 upon the same principle that
 you have a reservoir of
 water by takingouta portion of
 the water when it is
 plenty you get It on
 deposit as it were and
 it can be distributed when
 you want a large quantity
 in time of fil c
 This is a sort of
 balance wheel which prevents the
 extreme vibrations of trade from
 high to low and therefore
 is advantage to the communi_ty
 If you destroy it the
 consumers are liable to suffer
 When there is a gFeat
 scarcity in the market of
 course the consumers suffer and
 that benefits the manufacturers back
 upon commerce för by having
 the ware housing system goods
 are imported and depose ited
 and they are sold at
 such times as the com
 munity need them If you
 destroy that system of course
 you discourage importation you throw
 the consumers upon the hands
 or at the mercy of
 the home manufacturers in high
 priges very well understand therefore
 that the protec lionist or
 rather the prohibitionist the men
 who want to prevent foreign
 trade desire to break down
 this warehousing system but it
 is obviously for the benefit
 of the consumer It enables
 the consumer to get goods
 on cheaper terms and at
 the same time protects the
 merchant from ruin I hope
 therefore we shall ously low
 prices have no change in
 the system Mr B GLER
 i do not rise for
 the purpose of discussing the
 merits of this question or
 tracing its particular operation I
 desire to remind Sen ators
 however that prior to 1854
 the time al lowed for
 storing goods was one year
 The law of March 1854
 extended it to two years
 have longer making altogether three
 years been under the impression
 that the original law was
 suffcient for the protection of
 commerce and I am quite
 disposed to reinstate the original
 law and to go back
 to the original policy on
 this sub ject While I
 shall not vote for the
 amendment of the Senator from
 New York I desire to
 say that I will vote
 for the amendment intended to
 be offered by the Senator
 from Massachusetts which limits the
 time to one year and
 brings us back to the
 originai warehousmg system Mr G
 WIN Mr President the reason
 the time was extended in
 1854 was because expe rie
 nce proved that it would
 be beneficial to the country
 and beneficial to the revenue
 of the coun try to
 extend the term under this
 warehousin y system It was
 a new experiment in this
 coun morals the property in
 the country brought here by
 the importer is as much
 his absolute property after it
 arrives here as it was
 before it came here entirely
 free from any duty qualifying
 the condi What is there
 in the policy of the
 world in the policy of
 any fair nation in its
 Intercourse with the world to
 prohibit or to impose conditions
 upon the bringing into the
 country of property International cour
 erty is There is nothing
 tesy the civilization of the
 age the duty between man
 and man would require that
 if a foreigner who is
 allowed to come into this
 country and has our shores
 and keeping that deposit there
 as long try The law
 establishing it passed in 1846
 and is said that those
 up to 1854 it had
 been found to be eminently
 suc as their interests justify
 it I low the fact
 may i deposits consist of
 liquors be I do not
 know I do not know
 sir how far the deposit
 of liquor of various kinds
 may exceed i in amount
 the deposit of other merchandisa
 al though I think it
 highly probable thatitdoesexceed them for
 the simple reason that mostof
 the mer from another country
 no matter what the prop
 II cliandise remaining on deposit
 would be subject to annual
 decay or loss while the
 very loss of the liquor
 improves it in value We
 ali know that very great
 additional value is commonly given
 to it by that very
 evaporation which diminishes the ccssful
 but not so successful as
 it was thought it would
 be by extending the time
 The Senator from Rhode Island
 has stated that the exportation
 was only 5 per cent
 of the ware I will
 state that the reéxportation house
 goods of articles imported into
 the United States has in
 creased ahnost double under that
 system to what It has
 proved a great benefit to
 it was before the shipping
 interestofthe country It has proved
 a great benefit to the
 cities where the goods are
 stored The Senator has frequently
 alluded to 950 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 16 the amount
 of liquors in store What
 objection is there to that
 Y hen they are in
 store they pay storage and
 we know the longer they
 re main in store the
 better they are They pay
 duty upon what they put
 in storehouse and not on
 the quantity they take out
 while in England they only
 pay duties on what they
 take out They are enhanced
 in value by the time
 they re main in store
 and our merchants get the
 benefit of the störage Altogether
 there never has been a
 system that has proved so
 beneficial to the com mercial
 interests of the country As
 far as my own State
 is concerned nothing could be
 more fatal toits prosperity than
 the de stulction of this
 warehousiDgzsystem It is just laying
 the foundation of an extensive
 trade along the whole of
 the Pacific coast of North
 and South America and we
 shall soon extend our trade
 to Asia The hundreds of
 millions of inhabitants who surround
 the Pacific ocean will be
 supplied more or less from
 San Francisco in time That
 trade would be greatly promoted
 by this ware housing system
 San Francisco will become the
 depot vv here goods may
 be stored and from which
 they will be taken to
 the thousand islands of the
 Pacific ocean and the hundreds
 of millions of inhabitants in
 Asia and the whole of
 the countries north and south
 of us in North and
 South Amer ica i look
 upon the dcstruction of thc
 Warc house system as one
 of the most fatal blows
 that could be struck at
 the prosperity of California I
 certainly feel greatly obliged to
 the Senator from Rhode island
 for extending the time now
 in the bill of the
 House but I am utterly
 opposed to disturbing the present
 system under which our commerce
 has so prospered at all
 The merchant princes of this
 country the sails of whose
 ships whiten every sea and
 every ocean and whose ships
 co ld not have carried
 the com merce of our
 country through those occans and
 those seas but for the
 benefit of this law were
 characterized yesterday by the Senator
 from Rhode Island as German
 Jews I think the Sen
 ator has done them great
 injustice I believe those merchant
 princes who are carrying our
 commerce everywhere are as necessary
 to civilization almost as Christianity
 itself The Senator from Virginia
 said the other day that
 the destruction of this warehousing
 system would be almost as
 bad to the city of
 New York as the shelling
 of it by a foreign
 enemy I may add it
 would bc more fatal in
 its effects because from war
 you can recover but when
 commerce is oncestri cken down
 you cannot renovate it I
 believe we are now the
 first com mercial nation in
 the world in point of
 tonnaae q nd it is
 attributable in a great degree
 to the ware housing system
 If we should retrograde at
 all others our competitors will
 take our place and we
 shall never overtake them again
 I believe our failure to
 have steam connection and lines
 of steamships conveying our mails
 along the Gulf of Mexico
 and the whole coast of
 South America on the Pacific
 and Atlantic has given Great
 Brit ain a great advantao
 e over us there in
 the trade with Central America
 and South America owing to
 her policy of accommodating trade
 and sending steamships conveying the
 mails and thus in creasing
 her commercial relations with that
 sec lion of Ehe country
 I firmly believe that nothing
 can be more beneficial to
 the commerce of the country
 than the retaining of this
 warehousincy It is of great
 importance to my own system
 section of the country Mr
 CAMERON Mr President nothing is
 more oasy than to deal
 in generaiitics easy to talk
 about merchant princes and hun
 dreds of millions of people
 and an immense com I
 merce but when you come
 to the facts these words
 are very easily changed This
 warehous ing system has added
 but very little to the
 com merce of the country
 The whole amount of foreign
 goods exported during the last
 year from warehouses was but
 a Inere trifle benefited by
 giving thern a reasonable time
 tol Mr SIMMONS No sir
 I x vill make no
 mo keep their goods in
 bond and after that reason
 able time let them go
 out This is a bill
 for rev enue its whole
 operations are based upon rev
 enue the country is now
 in need of money and
 you must pass this bill
 or something very much like
 it or your country will
 be bankrupt Mr SEWARD 1
 believe the amendment is to
 insert three years The PRESIDENT
 pro tempore The amend ment
 is to insert three years
 in place of ninety Mr
 POWELL If I understood the
 Senator from Rhode Island arightamomentago
 he stated that a large
 proportion of the goods now
 in store in the Arehonse
 was liquors Mr SIMMONS 1
 did not saythegoods now in
 warehouse bccause I do not
 know what they I said
 that of the goods there
 on the 1st of are
 July 1857 they must have
 been nearly all liquors because
 they could not amount to
 the duties on them without
 they were in the 30
 per cent sched ule Mr
 POWELL I will state to
 Te Senator that on a
 little investigation of the statistics
 of this matter I think
 there are more goods now
 in store in the warehouses
 in the city of New
 York than the value of
 the wines brandies and liquors
 of every kind imported for
 the last three years We
 import annually about 10 000
 000 value of liquors of
 all kinds There is now
 at this mo ment in
 store in the warehouses in
 New York 30 000 000
 of merchandise The Secretary proceeded
 to call the roll Mr
 DOUGLAS when his name was
 called said I desire to
 say that i would prefer
 a little shorter time but
 I prefer this amendment to
 tak ing the short time
 specified in the bill and
 there fore I vote yea

 So the amendment to the
 amendment was agreed to The
 PRESIDENT The question recurs on
 the amendment of the committee
 as modified which is to
 strike out the section which
 has been read and insert
 the matter which also has
 becn read as modified on
 motion of the Sen ator
 from New York Mr SEWARD
 I movcafurthcr amendment to strike
 out in the thirty seventh
 line the words six months
 and to insert threo years
 is on the same principle
 as the last amendment The
 Secretary read tho amendment to
 strike out in the thirty
 seventh line the words six
 months and to insert three
 years so that the clause
 will read The said goods
 on which the duties have
 been paid be at any
 titne withdrawn Or consumption and
 jnav be taken out tor
 exportation beyond the limits of
 the United States at any
 tirnc within three years frcnn
 tbc time of the pay
 Inent ot duties thereon The
 amendment to the amendment was
 agreed to Mr SEYVARD In
 linc forty one I move
 to strike out six months
 and insert years tion about
 it until I see how
 it reads as amended I
 I think it is very
 bad I will not offer
 any amend ment until the
 bill is printed as it
 has been amended so that
 I shall see how it
 then reads Mr SEWARD 1
 do not care about it
 but 1 would like to
 bring the bill back by
 striking out all that refers
 to the warehousing system If
 the Senator will indicate those
 portions of the bill I
 will move to strike out
 all that relates to the
 ware housing so as to
 leave the warehousing system believe
 it is section thirty just
 as it is The PRESIDENT
 pro tempore The Senator from
 New York moves to amend
 the bill by strik ing
 out all that part which
 relates to the ware housinff
 system understood to be section
 thirty Mr SEWARD It the
 present law in force The
 amendment was agreed to The
 next amendment of thc sclcct
 committee was to insert at
 the end of the bill
 as an addi tional sect
 ion the following SEC 33
 Rnd be it further enacted
 That when merchan dice of
 the same Inaterial or description
 but Gf different values are
 invoiced at an average price
 and not otherwise provided for
 the duty shali be assessed
 upon the t vnole invoice
 at the rate the highest
 valued goods in such invoice
 are subject to under this
 act The word vaiued where
 used in this act shall
 be construed and understood as
 mean ing invoiced or appraised
 Mr HUNTER In regard to
 this amendment I will suggest
 to the Senator from Rhode
 Island that there is an
 ambiguity in this amendment meaning
 invoiced or appraised It rnay
 be invoiced at one price
 and appraised at another The
 appraisers sometimes raise the price
 It ought to be one
 or the other to accomplish
 his object It seems to
 me it v rould be
 better to use the words
 value where used in this
 act shall be construed the
 foreign value as now ascertained
 by existing laws 1 suppose
 that is what he wants
 the for ei yn value
 as now ascertained by existing
 law As it stands there
 is an ambiguity The invoiced
 price may be one thing
 and the appraised price another
 Mr SIMMONS The Senator has
 got at what we mean
 We think that an invoice
 is the value unless it
 is undervalued and the appraisers
 put it up Then it
 is appraised and that is
 the value It means tho
 value in the invoice or
 what the ap praisers make
 it if they raise rt
 That is what it means
 now but if you can
 put the meanino in a
 better form of words I
 have no objection Mr HUNTER
 1 do not think it
 means that nosv As to
 the meaning it will have
 it will de pcncl on
 the Treasury construction whether it
 shall be one thing or
 the other but the two
 things are different Appraisers put
 the value up very often
 Mr BIGLER On that point
 I will state that seeing
 the ambiguity of the term
 valued as used in the
 original bill I went to
 the Tt easury Department and
 consulted Mr Guthrie the agent
 of the Treasury Department and
 he told me the term
 invoiced or appraised would meet
 the case and be understood
 by the Department to be
 the foreio n value or
 the foreio n invoice at
 least that they regarded that
 as correct and the an
 praised value where the appraisers
 the invoice wras not correct
 That is the way I
 un derstood it sir The
 amendment was agreed to The
 next amendment of the select
 committee was to insert as
 a new section at the
 end of the I he
 amendment to the amendment was
 agreed SEC 34 flnd be
 enacted That all goods wares
 to I aud Inerchandise actuallv
 shipboard and bound to the
 Mr SEWARD I move in
 line thirty three United States
 within fificcn days after the
 passage of this to strike
 out ninety days and insert
 three act and all good
 wares and Inerchandise in reposit
 in warehouse or public store
 on the 1st day of
 Aprii 1861 shall be subject
 pay such duties as provided
 by law beföre The amendment
 to the amendment was agreed
 l i and at the
 timo of the passage of
 this act and all good
 in to warehouse at the
 time this act takes effect
 on which the The PRESIDENT
 tempore The question lessened its
 provisions may be on recurs
 on the amendment of the
 committee as li payment of
 the duties herein provided The
 amend ment was agreed to
 nothing in comparison with the
 commerce of our amended The
 amendment as amended was agreed
 to coast The truth is
 the whole benefit of this
 The PRESIDENT pro tonpm e
 The amend warehousing system has

 to move to strike menis
 reported from the select committee
 have terests of the foreign
 manufacturer and not to the
 out the entire section in

 distress you with a speech
 because I think in cases
 of this kind with a
 decided majority in favor of

 always injured by speaking and
 I 1 only rose to

 com merce of t he

 thiuk it will be houses
 It is a mere incumbrance

 Yes sir The PRESIDENT That

 On Paris white and pipe

 ninth section on page 14
 to strike out the words

 to make the duty on

 and its salts is put
 at 1 25 per I
 move to strike out the

 A near me suggests that
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 moved to add to the
 duty on iron raising the
 ad valorem from Is be

 Mr SIMMONS Not on iron
 but on manu factures of

 excnpted in every schedule section

 this rnattet thereof saving nevertheless
 the full eff ct and
 operation I over as we
 had raised the duty on

 we thought we ought to
 put up the manu system

 HUNTER 1 am not asking
 the Senator laws imposing duties
 on imports and for other
 purposes approved the 6th day
 of August in the year
 1846 and the for the
 reason but for the fact
 Did he report floor to
 read a letter which I
 have received on that subject
 The PRESIDENT pro tempore Chair
 will receive a demand a
 divrsion The Chair is uhwilling
 that the Senate should féel
 itself bouid by any prematUre
 decision of tho Chair The
 Chair will receive the call
 for a divisipn on the
 amendment Mr WADE Before the
 question is put as the
 vote is to be tak6n
 over again l will saya
 few words on my amendment
 do not wish to de
 lay the Senate by making
 a speech op this subject
 but I will barely say
 that the culture of flaxseed
 is a great and growing
 interest in many parts of
 our western country and in
 the Slate of Ohio my
 constituents are very deeply interested
 in it I do not
 ask for the amount of
 protection t hat was formerly
 given this article i_n previous
 tariff bills Under the tariff
 of 1842 the duty Was
 20 cepts a bushel Under
 the tariff of 1846 it
 per cent ad oatorem Under
 the tariff of 1857 by
 a bare mistake it came
 in free It was not
 intended to be so It
 is about the only thing
 that our farmers in the
 West have any protection on
 at all There is a
 large importation pf flaxseed that
 could better be raised in
 our country and it ought
 to be raised here This
 amount of duty in my
 judgment ought to be put
 on It is no more
 than it should be and
 I think it will only
 make a fair competition between
 our country and foreign countries
 The importation is very large
 i know there is u
 little difference in interest be
 tween the manufacturers in this
 part of the coun several

 the smne that as coming
 from the committee try the
 makers of oil along the

 SIMMONS I propose on page

 eighty eigh t to strike
 out 25 and insert 30
 so as to make the
 clause read On all manufactures
 of iron not otherwise provided
 for 30 per centum ad

 word lead where it first
 occurs I move to insert

 as to read On white

 lead and litharge ceru per

 seventh line of that sectioh

 move to insert t chron

 potash and to strike out
 those words in the next
 line Mr HUNTER Do the
 Senator from Rhode Island to
 say that these are amend
 ments of the committee which
 ho is offerin r now
 not of the entire Mr
 SIMMONS No sir I am
 merely transposincy some of committee
 these things to a specific
 duty where they were left
 undct an ad valore nL
 one Mr HUNTER Did 1
 understand the Senator agreed to
 in a full meeting I
 would offer them as little
 suggestions of my own Mr
 HUNTER I thought it wasa
 commit tee of five but
 it seems it is only
 onc of three Mr SIMMONS
 1 told you that if
 you pre ferred to take
 the amendments from me person
 ally I would offer them
 us my amendments The PRESIDENT
 pro tempore The amendment offered
 bv the Senator from R
 hode Island is to strike
 out the words and 25
 cents in lines thirty onc
 and thirty two of page
 14 so that the clause
 will read On morphine and
 its saits 1 pcr ounce

 sometimes imported as juice The
 amend nunt was agreed to
 Mr WADE I have an
 amcndment to pro pose Mr
 SIMMONS 1 shall get along
 as fast as Mr WADE
 Let me offer my amendment
 I while you are looking
 for yours Mr SIMMONS very
 well Mr WADE On page
 fifteen line twenty six of
 section ten I move to
 strike out ten go that
 the clause will and insert
 sixteen read On flaxseed and
 linseed 16 cents per bushel
 of fifty two to say
 that they were amendments of
 the com i pounds mittee
 Mr SIMMONS Amendments that two
 or I Mr SIXT MONS
 I believe th9s tirticle is
 now I free and the
 duty imposcd in the bill
 is a pretty threc of
 he committee have scen and
 agreed to If this were
 an original question I Mr
 HUNTER heard of them arge
 one Mr SIMMONS doubt you
 will object to should agree
 to the duty suggested by
 the Senator but as it
 passed the I louse of
 Representatives at them IVh HUNTER
 I think we ought to
 have 10 cents and as
 this article constitutes the return
 carao of most of the
 ships that go to California
 9 been consulted The committee
 ought to have and then
 across to India f suggest
 whether one been summoned in
 regard to them Mr SIMMONS
 I move them then on
 my jump to 10 cents
 a bushel is not about
 enough to own account as
 having been to me to
 carry it to now I
 am disposed to meet the
 gen eral views of the
 Senator from Ohio to do
 every perfect the bill This
 amendment does not change the
 duties at all on these
 articles but only makes thing
 we can to encourage the
 raising of flaxseed them specific
 f am only proposing to
 insert in this country but
 this is a pretty high
 move all some things that
 were omitted in the bill
 The at once present amendment
 is to put chromate and
 bi i I Mr WADE
 I would inquire of the
 Senator chromate of potash at
 3 cents a pound instead
 of whether there is any
 difference between flaxseed 15 per
 cent which is just what
 the percentage and linseed Mr
 SIMMONS There is none Mr
 HUNTER 1 should like to
 hear that The PRESIDENT put
 the ques amendment read The
 Senator makes what tion and
 announced that the amendment was
 i agreed to amendments he
 pleases it seems manufacture oil
 cheaply but we being the
 pro ducers are interested in
 having a duty upon the
 raw material There is hardly
 aoything in the whole West
 that can in the nature
 of things re ceive much
 protection and this article being
 one on which we can
 have an advantage I think
 it is no more than
 right that we should have
 it not ask to put
 on it as great an
 amount of duty as was
 formerly given In the tariff
 of 1857 linseed and flaxseed
 were supposed to mean different
 things and this led to
 a construction at the Treas
 It was a ury which
 brought flaxseed in free It
 was not intended Under the
 tariff mistake I have Of
 1842 the duty was 20
 cents a bushel inquired of
 gentlemen representing the West and
 they say that they will
 be satisfied with 16 cents
 a bushel although they believe
 that it really ought to
 be 20 I hope the
 amendment will be agreed to
 fixinz the duty at 16
 cents i Mr TEN EYCK
 1 regret to be called
 upon to take any position
 antagonistic to the position assumed
 by my friend from Ohio
 but in different sections of
 the Union there are different
 interests I do not mean
 to prolong this discussion because
 I am not perfectly familiar
 with the subject but I
 beg leave to call the
 attention of the Senate Lo
 an extract or two from
 a letter which received from
 a very respectable house the
 house of J C Moore
 Co of Jersey city on
 this subject These persons are
 engaged in the manufacture of
 oil and in the manufacture
 of this seed in one
 way or another and in
 a letter recently received by
 Ille and which I wras
 in search of when the
 Chair put the question before
 they say tbat they would
 be satisfied with duty of
 10 cents per bushel on
 linseed that that would be
 satisfac tory both to the
 manufacturers and dealers but to
 raise the duty to 16
 per cent would destrov their
 business and greatly diminish the
 revenue This letter was written
 by a gentleman with whom
 I am familiar William M
 Force one of the mem
 bers of the firm a
 reliable man fully acquainted with
 his business and a gentleman
 who would not say anything
 that was not strictly in
 accord ance with the truth
 I believe that the raising
 of this duty in the
 mode proposed now by the
 Sen ator from Ohio will
 have the effect of prejudicing
 this business and decreasing the
 revenue which we desire to
 raise for the support of
 the Govern ment Mr HARLAN
 I desire io call the
 attention of the Senate to
 one Or two facts in
 addition to those stated by
 the Senator from Ohio I
 have a little abstract before
 me of the revenue received
 on linseed and flaxseed for
 the last eight or nine
 952 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 16 years from which it
 will that the amount received
 in 1847 8 was 21
 238 This gradually increased until
 in 1857 8 the revenue
 derived Was 600 764 but
 in consequence of the inad
 vertence of which the Senator
 from Ohio spoke the revenue
 under the present tariff on
 this article has run down
 to 67 a year Sixty
 seven dollars and thirty five
 cents was the total amount
 received in 1859 60 wc
 imported in 1858 59 flaxseed
 to the value of in
 1859 60 thus showing that
 the present tariff on this
 article amöun_ts to nothing as
 the law now stands It
 appears that in 1855 56
 the One other fact amount
 of flaxseed imported Was 1
 102 545 bush els the
 valuation of which was 1
 009 381 1856 57 the
 amount imported was 1 696
 294 bush us and the
 valuation 1 741 260 This
 shows that the valuation has
 been in the neighborhood of
 about 1 per bushel At
 20 per cent then thc
 duty would be 20 cents
 per bushel The Senator from
 Ohio proposes to make it
 16 cents on the bushel
 or about 16 per cent
 being 20 per cent less
 under the proposition than it
 was hitherto previous to the
 committal of the mistake to
 which he has alluded Mr
 SIMMONS I agree most fully
 with the Senator from Ohio
 and the Senator from Iowa
 that this is a proper
 subject of taxation and that
 we should get revenue from
 it and that is the
 ob ject we had in
 fixing it at 10 cents
 a bushel The mapufacturers have
 been for four years in
 importing this article without any
 duty the trade is very
 large and it is a
 mere question of how far
 we shall go I do
 not hesitate to say that
 the proposition of the Senator
 from Ohio is not an
 extravagant duty on this article
 Some times it will be
 rather high sometimes low ac
 cording to the market price
 but at the same time
 there is an immense amount
 of this trade I have
 the returns of last vear
 showing that there were imported
 bushels and we did not
 raise more than about 500
 000 bushels in this country
 You cannot expect to supply
 this country with 2 000
 000 bushels in a short
 time There were 1 500
 000 gallons of oil imported
 last year Tillere is a
 duty on t hat oil
 of 16 cents by this
 bill That I think will
 help you That is a
 good duty on the oil
 and if the Senator had
 offered this amend ment for
 15 centsa bushel on the
 flaxseed I should voted with
 him but as he and
 I are so much in
 favor of compromise perhaps we
 can affree to it in
 that way Mr WILSON lhope
 the Senator from Ohio will
 not press this amendment This
 kind of seed has come
 into the country free for
 some years A large business
 bas grown up under it
 That business has to meet
 the rival y of other
 nations Now the bill proposes
 a duty of 10 cents
 per bushel That I think
 is enough At any rate
 I hope we shall start
 on that but I candidly
 be licve that if this
 amendment be adopted the im
 portations will be diminished to
 a great extent As has
 been shown plainly and clearly
 the amount produced in this
 country now is utterly insignif
 Icant and I think that
 to start at this time
 with the large duty proposed
 by the Senator from Ohio
 would be injurious to the
 interests of the country So
 far as my own State
 is concerned I know it
 would be Inrgely so Mr
 WADE I am not going
 to prolong this discussion but
 I would admonish gel tlemen
 that in making up this
 tariff bill we ought to
 endeavor to be as liberal
 as wye can The State
 of the Sen ator from
 Massachusetts gets something out of
 it I do not place
 it on any such so
 do other States local basis
 at all say the duty
 which I pro pose on
 this article of flaxseed is
 less than is im posed
 upon almost any other article
 in thc bill It will
 not amount under my amendment
 to morc than 16 per
 cent hardly that as a
 general rule and it is
 an interest that can be
 promoted the article can be
 produced in the West to
 any amount whatever and if
 there is any home production
 that ought to be encouraged
 it is this The Sen
 ator from Rhode Island admits
 all that I know very
 well that in consequence of
 the mistake which was committed
 in the tariff of 18573
 by which this article came
 in entirely free of duty
 there have been large importations
 here and manufactories have sprung
 up along the Atlantic coast
 which are now interested in
 keeping it free and keeping
 us down in its production
 as has been done but
 it is altogether wrong urüust
 and unequal I hope my
 amendment will prevail Mr GRIMES
 called for the yeas and
 nays and they were ordered
 The Secretary proceeded to call
 the roll on the adoption

 the amendment was agreed to
 Mr POWELL 1 move to
 amend the bill by striking
 out ail after thc word
 unmanufactured in the sixth line
 of the twelfth section to
 the word provided in the
 thirty fourth line and insert
 Shali be subject to a
 duty of 20 per cent
 ad valorem The section as
 it stands admits free of
 duty all coarse wool and
 subjects to taxation that alone
 If this bill should pass
 of the finer qualities which
 I very much fear I
 think our marlufactur ing friends
 will have the advantage of
 us They manufacture this coarse
 wool and hence I sup
 Pr0hSeet e the Mississippi or
 in this Union but grows
 if it is the ob
 more or less of this
 coarse wool ject of gentlemet
 l to protect the great
 laboring interests of the country
 svhile they are taxing it
 for the benefit of other
 interests I hope amendment will
 prevail to place a t
 ax of 20 per centum
 ad on all wool As
 the bill stands it is
 only the finer wool which
 is taxed wool that is
 consumed but little by the
 manufac turing interests of this
 country for I believe that
 the higher descri ptions of
 cloths are manufactured to a
 very limited extent in this
 country I think the farmers
 of the country who raise
 coarse wool should have this
 protection against the coarse wools
 of South America The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr BRIGHT in the
 Chair Will the Senator state
 his amend ment again Mr
 POWELL Thetwelfth section now reads

 out all this complication and
 makc it read simply All
 wool unmanufactured and all hair
 of the alpaca u runanut
 actured shall be goat and
 otller like animals subject to
 a duty of 20 per
 cent illn ad calorejn Mr
 BINGHAM I suppose an amendment
 to that amendment is in
 order The PRESIDING OFFICER Yes
 sir Mr BINGHAM I move
 to amend by strik ing
 out in the eighth linc
 of the twelfth section quently
 enters free under the present
 tariff J have sent to
 the Treasury and got a
 statement of the quantity of
 wool imported for the last
 three years For thc year
 ending June 30 1859 there
 was im ported free wool
 to the value of 4
 363 121 and for the
 year ending June 30 1860
 wool to the value of
 4 450 658 free Rating
 that wool at 20 cents
 a pound the importations of
 free wool un der the
 present tariff amount to over
 22 000 000 pounds for
 those two years At the
 same time the quantity introduced
 which paid duty amounted only
 for the entire two years
 to 1 788 299 pounds
 The duty altogether collected in
 the year ending June 30
 1859 was 19 639 92
 and for the y car
 ending June 30 1860 93
 958 56 Thus it is
 seen that of the vast
 amount of wool which is
 im ported into the country
 nearly the whole of it
 comes free under this system
 of valuation which introduces the
 wool in the dirt into
 this conn try The Australian
 wool most of it very
 fine which comes directly in
 competition with the wool produced
 in this country after it
 is cleansed IS received by
 the manufacturer entirely free of
 Now sir the capacity of
 this country to pro duce
 wool as the Senator from
 Kentucky says is perfectly unlimited
 The great western coun try
 and portions even of the
 southern country the mountainous districts
 of Virginia and Tl en
 nessee and Kentucky and especially
 the great prairies of Iowa
 and Illinois and Texas and
 Mis souri have unlimited capacity
 for the production of wool
 and if you are going
 to protect anything if you
 lay a heavy duty on
 the woolen goods that are
 produced in this country and
 I believe this tariff increases
 the duty on woolen goods
 way not do little something
 for the benefit of the
 agli culturist the man that
 consumes the goods and pays
 the duty This together with
 the article of flaxseed is
 about the only thing that
 the farmers of this country
 are to be protected in
 at all The present system
 of introducing this wool free
 of duty in the dirt
 and then cleaning it and
 bringing it into competition with
 the wool of this country
 of course is opposed to
 the production If this country
 could not produce of wool
 here wool enough to supply
 ail the manufacturers and I
 have a large quantity for
 export besides there might be
 a necessity for introducing it
 free but that is not
 the case Even in Michigan
 now it is the second
 article of our production Next
 to wheat is wool and
 in Wisconsin Illinois Iowa and
 all those great States of
 the West an unlim ited
 quantity of wool can be
 produced And the coarser wools
 the common wools the Leicesters
 and the South Downs come
 directly into com petition with
 this free wool I have
 no objection to paying a
 duty to help to protect
 the manufacturer but while that
 is done give us a
 little protection for the wool
 lama wook producer I am
 a wroo raiser myself and
 i am willing to go
 into competition with all the
 world in the raising of
 wool if you will give
 me the privilege of going
 where I please to buy
 my cloth but if you
 tax the cloth in this
 country and make our farmers
 pay a high price for
 it give them a little
 benefit in an inducement to
 raise wool The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The amend ment offered by
 the Senator from Michigan is
 first in order that being
 to perfect the section before
 the question shall be taken
 on striking out Mr SiMMONS
 I concur in most of
 what has been said in
 reference to encouraging the growth
 of wool and the growth
 of flaxseed I do not
 keep many sheep but I
 would like to encourago farming
 as much as I can
 This bill was framed in
 the House of Representatives after
 a great leal of intercourse
 and arrantrement between those who
 used wool and those who
 raised it and there was
 a great deal of irritation
 there in regard to it
 They finally quieted down on
 all sides i believe shall
 exceed 18 centé per pound
 wibh this arrangcmpnt the words
 G It puts wool valued
 at and and I wish
 to call the attention of
 the Sen ator from Kentucky
 to that That would leave
 the duty on all wool
 valued under 24 cents a
 pound at 3 cents a
 pound He proposes to levy
 an ad valorun duty I
 object to that bccau e
 there is more deception more
 fraud in the im portation
 of wool than of any
 other article T hc wool
 that comes to this country
 is brought from Australia and
 Buenos Ayres and from other
 for eign countries in the
 dirt and nearly the whole
 of it is valued under
 18centsa pound and conse between
 18and 24 cents a pound
 at 3 cents a pound
 duty and that above 24
 at 9 cents If I
 were n wool grower I
 would rather have a high
 d nty on the fine
 article A sheep that grows
 wool worth on y 18
 cents a pound is not
 fit to be kept in
 the United States I would
 not have such sheep We
 put 9 cent s a
 pound duty on wool worth
 from 24 cents up to
 whatcver amount it may go
 but such wool it is
 well enough known is from
 35 to 60 cents a
 pound in this country and
 we want to courage the
 growing of that woo This
 coarse 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 953 dog 5s hair kind
 of wool that comes from
 Buenos Ayres and of Australia
 is very poor stuff and
 it is not good policy
 to undertake to raise it
 here I agree that there
 is some fine wool from
 Australia which comes in in
 the dirt and in that
 way may get in at
 a valuation of between 18
 and 24 cents The present
 is that all wool above
 20 cents a pound pays
 a duty and below 20
 it is free It is
 found tbat there is a
 good deal of management to
 get in the wool under
 20 cents 1 Was for
 having 16 cents t he
 limit so as to catch
 everyt hihg imported that was
 fit fbr manufactur ing but
 in the House of Representatives
 a com promise was made
 putting the limit at 18
 cents All the wools that
 we have had any information
 about that come at all
 in competition with the American
 wools are between 18 and
 70 cents That between 18
 and 24 pays a duty
 of 3 cents a is
 very dirty and I sup
 pound under this bill pose
 by the time it gets
 to be cleaned wool it
 is subject to the 9
 cents a pmtnd duty I
 fear that we shall get
 into a very unfortunate diffculty
 with the other House by
 making this amendment I agree
 with what the Senator from
 Michigän says that the wool
 ought to pay a duty
 which comes in and interferes
 with our woot but it
 does pay a good duty
 if it is over 18
 cents a pound under this
 bill and I trust the
 arrange ment in the bill
 will not be disturbed I
 think I cun satisfy anybody
 that the getting in of
 these coarse wools free of
 duty where they really are
 coarse for blankets gives us
 the cntire control of the
 market for blankets which would
 go from us if we
 did not have it so
 The Senator from Mich igan
 says we have not taken
 carc of the wool in
 terest but we have increased
 the duties on the manufactured
 article Sir we have not
 increased the duties on woolen
 goods We have rathcr low
 ered them but we put
 a pound duty on woolens
 equivalent to the duty paid
 on wool sc that the
 manufacturers should notcomehere and say
 You I have raised the
 duty on wool and lcft
 us out in the cold
 There is just the same
 additional duty put on the
 woolens as on wool That
 has been adjusted If you
 go to altering it it
 will force the If the
 committee to readjust the whole
 matter Senator had had this
 bill to manare as long
 as f have had and
 as many people to satisfy
 as have had first on
 one side and then on
 the other he would find
 that it was somewhat tt
 oüblesome to reconcile all parties
 but the provision as it
 is ili the bill finallv
 reconciled ali parties in the
 other House and trust the
 amendment wil not pre Mr
 POWELL The Senator from Rhode
 Isl and objects to an
 amendment of this section cause
 he says those who are
 interested in the consumption and
 use of these coarse vools
 from South America have settled
 on it as it is
 in this bill Now I
 suppose there is not a
 Senator here but fully understands
 the nature of the contest
 It is a con that
 is going on about this
 tariff bill test of capital
 concentrated against diffused labor I
 am certain that none of
 the great agricuiturul interests of
 the country were in the
 counsels of thc Senator when
 that section was settled upon
 If they were their voice
 to have been of but
 little avail for their interests
 are not looked to nor
 cared for The Senator says
 that he wishes to keep
 out this coarse wool and
 to encourage t If that
 is the object why not
 American wool tax it That
 is the best way to
 ke ep it out for
 the solicita tions of these
 agents about this tariff I
 do not complain of that
 It is proper that hill
 those gentlemen should look to
 their interests but venture to
 say no man has been
 interrupted a moment by any
 agentof the great fanning in
 terest of this country 1
 hope Senators will come up
 and vote in such a
 manner as to protect this
 great interest of the people
 I shall do it when
 ever I have an opportunity
 Mr DOUGLAS Mr President my
 constit uents have the same
 interest involved in this ques
 tion as those of the
 Senator from Michigan and the
 Senator from Kentucky and I
 am as anxious to protect
 the wool interest as they
 canbe but certainly I do
 not agree with them in
 the position they have taken
 I believe the amendment pro
 posed by the Senator from
 Michigan would be injurious to
 the wool grower and if
 we are to look at
 the question us one of
 protection to the wool grower
 I prefer the bill as
 it stands to the amendment
 proposed either by the Senator
 from Michigan or the Senator
 from Kentucky I ap prehend
 there is no wool less
 than 18 cents a pourud
 at a foreign port that
 comes in competition with one
 pound of American wool That
 cheap wool is one that
 we do not produce one
 that we cannot produce and
 yet the introduction of those
 coarse wools creates a market
 for ow wools of a
 better character r l hey
 are necessary to be mixed
 with each other for certain
 manufactures and hence we encourage
 the market for the wool
 that we do produce by
 making any that does not
 come in competition with it
 free of dut y and
 allowing them to be mixed
 thus increasing the manufac ture
 of the article at home
 I would have no ob
 jection to amending t he
 bill by adding that wools
 ofa certain value of the
 finest quality may come am
 willing to allow those under
 15 and in free 16
 cents and those over a
 certain higher limit to Put
 your duty between thosc two
 and be free then you
 will protect cvcry wool grower
 and make an additional market
 for every pound of wool
 made in America This is
 the result of my examinations
 and re flections upon the
 su12ject The theory proposed by
 the Senator from Kentucky that
 all these du ties ought
 to be ad valorem is
 a beautiful theory i think
 the theory is just and
 if the I admit it
 practice were as good as
 the tbeoi y I would
 not listen for an instant
 to anything but an ad
 valorem duty But I suppose
 if you will take the
 pains to inquire and in
 vcstigate this question you will
 find that there is a
 yreater departure from the ad
 talorenu principle under an ad
 oalorenb tariff than there is
 under one of specific duties
 I suppose it is no
 longer secret and no man
 informed on the subject wili
 pretend to question any longer
 that it ma y be
 sa d to be the
 constant habit of for Cign
 ilnpot ters to make false
 invoices sustained by an affidavit
 on which the purchaser in
 this country can cheat the
 Government out of one half
 go specific duty except wheyeal
 think fit is essential to
 correct fraud and to protect
 some Amei icän interest Cither
 from fraud or combina tion
 but iri a II such
 cases I am pre ared
 to voæ for it Now
 sir in regard to this
 item of wool itis Said
 that very fine wools may
 bé brought inmi ed with
 dirt and other filthy substances
 to the price below 18
 cents and then when it
 ig cleaned it is worth
 45 cents Werall know és
 peeially those Of us who
 investigate the question that those
 tricks have been played and
 there is a provision iri
 this bill that guards against
 them That provision is wherever
 there has béeri any admixture
 with inferior material of any
 kind so as to bringthe
 price below 18 cents the
 very high est duties shall
 be paid charging 9 cents
 duty in that case in
 order to prevent fraud That
 is the best guarantee that
 I can get against frauds
 in re card to coarse
 wools Then I come back
 to the pointfrom Which il
 started that the free list
 so far 08 these coarse
 woolens are conéerned is beneficial
 to the wool grower instead
 of iniurious I am not
 surprised that some Senators look
 with a little amazement at
 such a declaration for I
 thought it was an ab
 surdity when I first heard
 the propositiozr ad vanced but
 an investigation has satisfied me
 itis clearly so I do
 not intend to go into
 the discus sion of this
 tariff question that I havc
 not been able to i_nvestigate
 thoroughlyas would like I have
 endeavoredto examine it and I
 have I think I have
 got along as made some
 progress well as some Senators
 and perhaps a little better
 I have learned enough about
 it to know that I
 know scarcely anything about it
 at all and aman makes
 considerable progress on aquestiön of
 this kind when he ascertains
 that fact I feel that
 we are striking great interests
 in the dark While we
 are trying to protect and
 save one branch of industry
 we are striking a deadly
 blow a t hn other
 A tariff involves two conflicting
 princi ples which are eternally
 at war with each other
 Every tariff involves the principles
 of protection and of oppression
 the principles of benefits and
 of burdens Every duty levied
 upon the import atioo ofa
 foreign article which comes in
 compe tition with our home
 production is a protectiön to
 that extent Every duty levied
 upon a raw material which
 we do not manufactuie here
 is a tax upon the
 manufacturer of that article here
 Thus you find that by
 protecting one interest perhaps you
 will oppose another For instancc
 If I am engaged in
 the manufacture of pig iron
 I Vant a duty that
 will protect my interest You
 give it to me and
 then a man eneaged in
 another branch of the iron
 business comes and says that
 the picr iron I manufacture
 is his raw material and
 by protectinM me and my
 manufacture of that article you
 put a tax on his
 raw material to his injury
 He has been injured Ato
 the Same extent th at
 I have been benefited and
 then he wants the duty
 I have seen the evidence
 of that I re gret
 to say in this very
 city You cannot now protection
 on another point to make
 up for the loss on
 the raw material Thus when
 you at order a dress
 from Paris v lt hout
 getting a letter tempt to
 discriminate for the purpose of
 benefit for payment at one
 price and an invoice sworn
 incr one you are striking
 a blow at another The
 to at about half the
 price to pay the duties
 on I can find the
 evidences of that in every
 departmcnt great difficulty is so
 tb adjust these conflicting of
 this Government and call my
 witnesses in principles of benefits
 and burdens as to make
 one every branch of the
 Government not that they compensate
 for the other in the
 end and give have been
 parties to the fraud They
 order the equal benefits and
 equal burdens to every class
 article and as a matter
 of course a false invoice
 of the community I take
 it for granted that is
 vv hat we are aiming
 comes with a false affdavit
 sustaining it and then I
 am afraid that the bill
 does not at in t
 his bill a bill with
 double price for you to
 pay for it I fully
 concur in the remarks made
 by the Sen I do
 not expect it to be
 put in ator from Michigan
 on this subject and f
 would thinking that you wouid
 pay them a good price
 accomplish it such a shape
 that I can vote for
 it but I am de
 readiiy accept his amendrnent in
 the place of the for

 and false I Mr BINGHAM
 Mr President the wooi that
 interest of thc country That
 greatest interest of I is
 imported free of duty is
 almost all the wool that
 the country has had no
 lobby agents here Charn oaths
 For this reason whilc I
 indorse the the bers of
 commerce have heen here to
 protect the ory of an
 ad duty I cannol close
 my eyes is imported and
 that amounts to nearly twenty
 great commercial interests of the
 country the to the fact
 that it is ascriesofunmitigated frauds
 five million poundsayear Now if
 tbc agricultural agents of your
 shipping interest are here your
 and we musl try to
 arrive at the practical honest
 interext is not to receive
 any benefit from this tariff
 manufacturing interests are here Senators
 can importation cven if we
 have to put specific duties
 scarcely remain quiet in their
 chambers at night in some
 cases to prevent these frauds
 I will not as it
 now stands iL is merely
 nominal it does not 954
 amount to anything Let us
 either tax all wool I
 somethinæ or strike all the
 tax out Phe Senator from
 Rhode Island says that wool
 in this country that is
 not worth 18 cents a
 pound is not worth raising
 It is that very fraud
 in valuation that I am
 opposed That valuation of wool
 under 20 cents a pound
 is all a fiaud It
 is brought to this country
 from Australia in the dirt
 and a great deal of
 it is brought from Buenos
 Ayres and when it is
 cleaned it comes in com
 petition with the finest wool
 produced inethe Uni ted If
 you are going to tax
 foreign wools lay a duty
 on them am a producer
 in a small way in
 Michigan of fine wool 1
 do not ask any protection
 for that and II do
 not care anything about it
 We get a very good
 price for wool it is
 a very good business and
 I want to see the
 farming interest flourish and tarn
 their attention more to the
 production of wool so as
 to supply the entire manufactures
 fthe United States We have
 the capacity to do it
 Now what I propose is
 to lay a duty on
 all wool of 3 cents
 a pound On this wool
 valued under 20 cents a
 pound it amounts to 12
 per cent That is not
 prohibitory That is not so
 excessive in its amount of
 taxabion as to affect the
 manufacturers in the slightest de
 It only aids and helps
 and encourages the production of
 wool in this country Thisduty
 on the finer wools is
 all a fraud it is
 all a deception and t
 his introduction of wool under
 20 cents a pound is
 all a fraud and a
 deception because it is fine
 Wool that is introduced chiefly
 I have been myself in
 woolen manufactories m western New
 Y uk two hundred miles
 from the seaboard and seen
 them making fine cassimeres from
 wool that came from Australia
 because they would not pay
 40 cents a pound for
 American wool I know what
 I say about that for
 I have seen it Mr
 CAMERON 1 only word to
 Buy and I shali occupy
 no time I think the
 Senator from Michigan and the
 Senator from Kentucky mistake the
 interests of the am icullurist
 on this question Thetrueprotection for
 t he wool grower is
 protection for the manufacturer of
 these goods The state of
 business is now such that
 there is not a single
 manufactory of broadcloth in the
 United States Under the tariffof
 1842 manufactories of that article
 grew up and the finest
 broadcloths in the world were
 made here I repeat there
 is not now a single
 manufactory of that kind in
 the United States The gentleman
 speaking of his wool reminds
 me of the contest that
 there used to be in
 my State in favor of
 protection for coal Our coal
 operators were constantly tal king
 about protection Many of us
 them told that the way
 to protect their i coai
 was to protect the iron
 and thus make a market
 for their coal They have
 all become con vinccd of
 it As our iron business
 flourishes so docs the coal
 business and as the wool

 I wish to do willing
 to vote for any amendment
 them no injustice but they
 will vote for any thing
 that is proposed provided it
 will divide us and destroy
 the bill Had wc not
 better take the bill as
 itis relying on our own
 friends and fix any thing
 wrong in ib next year
 when we shalt have a
 majority here and can correct
 all that is wrong That
 seems to be the true
 way of getting at it
 and if all will adhere
 to that we shall pass
 the bill to day and
 give gladness and prosperity to
 this country everywhere Mr WILSON
 Mr President we are ad
 monished to day to take
 care of the interests of
 the farmers The farmers are
 a very strong class of
 men in this country and
 I never knew any body
 bold enough to make an
 attack upon them It is
 a very easy thing to
 talk n great deal of
 the interests of the farmer
 for they are stroncr and
 they are powerful but I
 tl link that any man
 Who will study the revenue
 system of the country for
 a generation will come to
 the conclusion that the agricultural
 interests of the country are
 promoted I more indirectly than
 directly promoted by in creasing
 the commercial the manufacturing and
 the mechanical interests and thereby
 indirectly promoting the interests of
 the farmers of the country
 Now sir we were told
 four years ago when the
 tariff of 1857 was before
 us and a proposition was
 made to admit wool duty
 free under 20 cents a
 pound that it would hostile
 to the interests of the
 wool growers of the country
 and some of them came
 here and protested against that
 change Commercial men men who
 have studied and mastered this
 whole question who understand it
 in all its bearings and
 relations in our own coun
 try and in all the
 commercial and manufacturing countriesin the
 world came here with facts
 they came here with this
 declaration that the intro duction
 into tllis country of the
 cheap wools of Buenos Ayres
 and Australia and other portions
 of the world worth less
 than 20 cents a pound
 instead of diminishing the prices
 of the wool amendments now
 pending The amendment of the
 Senator from Michigan is first
 in order as that proposes
 to perfect the section and
 then the amend ment of
 the Senator from Kentucky which
 pro poses to strike out
 No amendment can now be
 received as in order Mr
 WADE I believe I represent
 thé greatest wool growing State
 in the Union That Interest
 has been thriving under the
 present tariff I do not
 know but satisfactorily but I
 do not now wish I
 am satisfied with to raise
 the duty on wool that
 in the original bill if
 it can be carried out
 honestly and fairly but I
 have reason to believe and
 do believe that under the
 tariff as it stands a
 large amount of wool cont
 es into this country free
 which really and honestly ought
 to be sub jected to
 a duty All that I
 desire is to correct that
 to have it honest to
 have wool come under 18
 cents per pound that is
 really worth no more I
 am willing that should come
 in free than that but
 I fear that wool worth
 more than that is fre
 quently mixed up with foreign
 substances for the very purpose
 of reducing it below that
 amount in order to bring
 it in free Mr FESSENDEN
 That is provided for in
 this bill Mr WADE I
 know it is attempted to
 be provided for and the
 only objection I have to
 the provision of the bill
 is that it is exceedingly
 diffl cult to prove under
 it the intention for it
 must be done with a
 certain intent There are words
 in I it which seem
 to me to render it
 very dificult to I make
 the proof I will read
 this clause ProciBed That any
 wool of the sheep or
 hair of the al paca
 the goat and other like
 animals whic shall be im
 ported in any other than
 the ordiaary condition as now
 and heretofore practiced or which
 shali bc changed in its
 char acter or condition for
 the pu rpose of evading
 the dutv or which shall
 be reduced in value by
 the adtnixture of dirt or
 any foreign substance to 18
 cents per pound or less
 shall be subject to pay
 a duty ot 9 cents
 per pound anything in this
 act to the contrary notwithstanding
 Now sir who can prove
 when it comes in that
 it was done for the
 purpose of evading the duty
 grown in our own country
 would increase the the intent
 with which it was done
 demand for our own wool
 and increase its price Four
 years of experience proved their
 declara tions to be true
 and why does it sir
 The woolen manufactories of the
 country iöul years ago were
 nearly all closed It has
 been stated here to day
 that the manufactories of broadcloth
 have ceased nearly altogether T
 Ele manufacturers of wool in
 nearly all their departments were
 ruined and their mills closed
 throughout the whole country By
 admitting these wools fourths of
 which are have had somc
 experience endeavored to frame cheap
 coarse wools when cleaned of
 dirt some I fine wools
 I grant are admitted among
 them but the great mass
 of that wool is of
 a cheap coarse character such
 as we do not raise
 in our own country by
 admitting those woolsduty free the
 manufacturers were able to open
 their mills turers in this
 country flourish so will flourish
 the and enlarge their business
 and increase their de wool
 growers of the country They
 cannot pre ii ruand our
 own wools and uuderthc operation
 and they of this systetn
 woolen manufactories have in tend
 to cxport any wool it
 is useless can havenomarketunlcss they
 have manufactories creased in valuc
 and importance and the prices
 of t hcarticle at home
 Fifty years ago the people
 of wools in this country
 for four years past haw
 of the South came here
 with precisely the same ruled
 higher than they ruled the
 four years pre proposition as
 the Senator from Michigan now
 ceding This result was predicted
 in these Cham makcsaboutwool in
 regard to their cotton Thcy
 bers four years ago as
 certain and inevitable asked Congress
 to impose a duty of
 3 cents a and I
 bclicve to day that if
 you cbange this if pound
 upon all cotton that might
 be imported you strike out
 the admission of Lhese chcap
 wools There was not a
 single ounce imported but we
 vou will ckosc to a
 large extent the woo en
 mills gave them the protection
 It was never needed bt
 the country and you wiii
 by that means re duce
 the price of your own
 native wool and so it
 will be in regard to
 wool I rose however more
 for this purpose than Now
 sir I concur entirely whal
 the Sena Mr FESSENDEN They
 do to prove it IVII
 WADE that Mr BIGLER The
 fact itself will be conclu
 sive Mr CLARK Look the
 next clause Mr WADE I
 have looked at it and
 it seems to me it
 does not do away entirely
 with the ob jection I
 have in connection with others
 who an amendvnent which will
 entirely obviate my objection It
 would not be for the
 interests of the wool growers
 of the State of Ohio
 to injure the manufacturers Their
 interests in my judgment ace
 identical The more wool they
 can be induced to use
 up the more it will
 be for the interest of
 the farmer who supplies them
 with that article I do
 not desire to do anything
 in this bill that shall
 workto their disadvantage but thcn
 I want the duty so
 fur as it tends to
 their protection an honest one
 that wool that is really
 of a higher value than
 the bill provides for under
 that condi tion shall not
 be imported by mixing it
 up with foreign substanccs as
 Iam told is frequently done
 Indeed the provision here presupposes
 that that is frequently done
 and it undertakes to provide
 against it and to exclude
 it in the same way
 t aat I do Now
 sir if the amendment that
 shall offer should that of
 the Senator from Michigan fail
 can be shown not to
 be better calculated to any
 other to say that this
 constant change of its tor
 from Illinois has said upon
 this point We effect the
 sarne purpose than the bill
 theu I will provisions by
 our own friends is going
 to destroy W raise loss
 than seventy million pounds of
 wool in be content with
 the bill as it is
 for I say again the
 bill I his bill has
 been prepared by a com
 our own country I think
 but a little more than
 I i it is no
 part of my purpose to
 place any disad mittee of
 gentlemen conversant with the subject
 sixty millions We import from
 twenty to twen vantacre to
 our own manufacturers for I
 think men from different sections
 of the country every ty
 five million antiually A large
 portion of it in their
 interest is the same as
 that of the producer one
 Of whom has had his
 mind upon it for a
 year fact nearly all of
 it except a portion of
 the very Mr BIGLER I
 will sng est to the
 Senator or more and they
 must understand it better than
 fine and costly wools of
 which we raise very from
 Ohio whether if we vvere
 to strike out the we
 who are here little a
 large portion of it is
 of that cheap char ti
 l vords fbL the purpose
 of evading the duty have
 never scen any legis ii
 lation made in the body
 that is useful at ail
 you acter demanded by the
 manufacturing interests of in the
 seventeenth line that would not
 be satis must trust your
 committees and we have had
 an the country and by
 the importation of it the
 mills factory to him Then
 it would leave it standing
 able committee on this subject
 in addition to ii are
 enabled to go on and
 enlarge and to purchase upon
 the naked fact that the
 wool had been mixed that
 we have had a select
 committee cxanuning our own wools
 and that too at high
 prices and i with foreign
 substances this question and cach
 of them tried to guard
 the experience has shown that
 instead of these wools Mr
 WADE I am disposed to
 think that reducing the price
 of our own wools they
 have would work the very
 change I wrish to effect
 interests of the country The
 gentleman from Ohio has altered
 one item already It has
 given increased those prices by
 being brought into the Mr
 SIMMONS I wish to make
 a single re some offense
 probably to some friends of
 the bill country free and
 being mixed in the manufacture
 mark in reply to N
 vhat fell from the Senator
 from although that proposition may
 be right If we of
 our own better sort of
 wools Kentucky He said this
 bill was made under the
 makeumother amendment it may give
 offense to Mr WADE Is
 it now in order to
 move to influence of delegations
 from big cities and he
 somebody else We have but
 a majority of two i
 amend the amendment ventured to
 say that had not consulted
 with or throe and our
 opponents on the other side
 are The PRESIDING OFFICER There
 are two farmers and if
 I had I would not
 have made such 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 955 a bill
 as this I want that
 Senator to understand that I
 am a farmer myself and
 raised wool before he wras
 born He thinks it a
 fine business to get up
 here and arraign people that
 are making tar iffs and
 accuse them of being leagued
 with great capitalists in the
 central cities and against labor
 Sir I have labored quiteas
 many years as he has
 and when he finds Inc
 leaguinm tvainst labor and in
 favor of capital it will
 be time enough for him
 to accuse me of it
 I said this duty was
 agreed to by delegations of
 farmers or the men repre
 senting them and manufacturers and
 members of the committee They
 had the subject up over
 and over again and finally
 agreed upon this and they
 agreed to bc satisfied with
 it last year could see
 any way in the world
 to benefit any leading interest
 in this country I would
 do it in stanter but
 I will tell that Senator
 loud as he naay talk
 about the interest of farmers
 the prop osition he makes
 would be ruinous ten times
 as bad as this bill
 He proposes a duty of
 20 per It would be
 invoiced cent ad t atorem
 on wool so that you
 would not get 2 Cents
 a pound on it W
 c put a duty of
 9 cents on this wool
 that we think comes mostly
 in competition with the wool
 of the United States As
 to those vvyools that do
 not come in competition but
 enable our coarse woolen manufacturers
 to make descriptions of blankets
 and coarse goods that they
 could not otherwise make we
 let them in free If
 there is anything wrono in
 it I svould go as
 far as any body to
 try to avoid it But
 for these manufac tapers there
 would be no demand for
 that wool at all in
 this country and I can
 tell Senators we make the
 best wool of any country
 in the world to make
 warps of Pennsylvania and Obio
 raise the best woot of
 any part of the world
 to make a warp for
 goods better than is raised
 anywhere in Europe but they
 make better wool in Europe
 to make filling of it
 will fell better than ours
 1 have known woot growers
 to ship wool to Liv
 crpool to sell to English
 manufacturers for warps while we
 were importing wool to make
 filling of I will not
 enlarge upon this subject but
 I be lieve my friend
 from Michigan who desires to
 guard this bill against frauds
 will reach his pur pose
 by leaving it as it
 is If you should stop
 this importation of coarse wool
 which is now let in
 free you would kill all
 the mills because it is
 let in free all over
 the world We have only
 put a duty of 10
 per cent on blankets above
 the duty on the 6
 cents a p lnd T
 herc are a good many
 things that get in in
 order to make these coarse
 articles which you cannot touch
 The PRESIDING OFFICER Is the
 Senate ready for the question
 on the proposed amend ment
 Nir GWIN 1 should like
 to hear it read in
 line eight of section The
 Secretary read it twelve to
 strike out the words shall
 exceed 18 from Kentucky inasmuch
 as that is to strikeout
 have under provisions or this
 bill If Sepa the section
 and the Senator from Ohio
 proposes tors want tode troy
 what an amendment to perfi
 ct it The amendment have
 undertalcento give the growing proposed
 by the Senator from Ohio
 will be read The Secretary
 read the amendment on page
 19 to strike out the
 first proviso in the following
 words Provided That any wool
 of the sheep or hair
 of the alpaca the goat
 and other like animals whicheshail
 be im ported in any
 other than the ordinary condition
 as now and her tofore
 practiced or which sball be
 changed in its char acter
 or condition for the purpose
 of evading the duty or
 which Shail be reduced in
 value by thc admixture of
 dirt or any foreign substance
 to 18 cents per pound
 or less shall be subject
 to pay a duty of
 9 cenos per pound anything
 in this act to the
 contrary notwithstanding And to insert
 in lieu thereof That all
 imported wool which shall contain
 a larger ad mixture of
 dirt burrs yo k grease
 or other substance otller than
 fine wool than good mcrchantable
 wool ofa similar quality aud
 fineness the growth and producc
 of the United States shall
 be reduced in weight to
 the extent of such excess
 and duty shall be levied
 on such imported wool according
 t its value per pound
 when so reduced in weight
 Mr WADE I believe that
 better effects the object that
 wus intended by the committee
 than their own provision I
 do not want to alter
 svhat they intend to cffect
 but it seems to me
 this amendment would be better
 At any rate let us
 have a vote upon it
 Mr CHANDLER Mr President 1
 consider this the most important
 amendment that has becn offered
 I know something about this
 imported I have seen wool
 importcd free valued I wool
 under 18 cents a pound
 that was actually worth 60
 cents a pound after it
 was cleansed and a very
 large proportion of the wool
 that is imported free under
 18 cents a pound is
 actually wool that comes I
 in competition with our best
 grades of western wool Now
 sir this proviso of the
 committee does not reach the
 case You cannot prove that
 they intended fraud The wool
 is imported in the dirt
 and it is very dirty
 it is mixed and it
 is wonderfully mixed but there
 is every grade and there
 is every grade of dirt
 Let the wool be re
 duced to its proper weight
 when cleaned and you will
 have an absolute bardo fraud
 Without that you have no
 bar I hope this amendment
 will be adopted I hope
 that cvcry friend of the
 bill will vote for it
 for it is the only
 safeguard that has yet been
 offered against fraud Mr SIMMONS
 1 will not detain the
 Senate long but I desire
 to correct a little misapprehen
 Sion on the part of
 the Senator from Michigan The
 committee did not insert this
 proviso in the bill It
 was in the bill as
 it came from the House
 but should vote acrainst altering
 it This taking the wool
 in the custom house and
 cleaning the yolk and the
 dirt out of it to
 find how much per I
 hope friends of the woole
 can vote for it growers
 will vote agamst it Mr
 POWELL The Senator Island seems
 to be the cham pion
 of the fai ming have
 rio idea that the amend
 nent interest here I propose
 will rsatisfy the manufacturing interest
 but I do think it
 will satiéfy ihe fatmérs Vlioße
 it will be adopted Mr
 CHANDLER Letr the amendment be

 I move to amend by
 striking out the whole of

 send to the Chair Mr
 BIGLER we have a right
 to do that now as
 the Senator from Ohio proposes
 to strike out the wbolc

 HUNTER Oh no The proposition
 voted down was to impose
 a duty of 3 cents

 23 So the amendment was
 agreed to Mr GREEN 1
 think it is impossible to
 get through with this bill
 to day and I move
 that the Senate adjourn 0K
 no It is Saturday evening
 Mr BIGLER We had better
 go on an hour The
 question being put on the
 motion to ad jonrn there
 were on a division ayes
 12 noes 21 Mr GREEN
 That is quorum The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FOSTER in the
 chair It is sumcient that
 the Senate do not adjourn
 Mr BAYARD But you cannot
 go on with business without
 a quorum Mr HALE How
 many voted Mr BAYARD I
 submit that unless it ap
 pears that there is a
 quorum of the Senate on
 any question which is brought
 before it we can proceed
 to no other business until
 a quorum is The PRESIDING
 OFFICER we can take no
 vote without a quorum but
 it does not require a
 uorum on a question of
 adjournment TRUMBULL 1 ask for
 a recount 1 think there
 is a quorum in the
 Senate The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 motion is that the Senate
 do now adjourn The question
 being acyain put there were
 on a division ayes 12
 noes 25 So the motion
 was not agreed to Mr
 MASON I wish to offer
 an amendment to this bill
 and but one If the
 policy of the bill be
 to prohibit the importation of
 any matter men tioned in
 it it has been effccted
 I doubt not by the
 clause which I shall propose
 to amend or If the
 policy of the bill be
 to depart from the usual
 spirit of taxation to impose
 taxes upon necessa nes and
 to exempt luxuries it is
 effected by the clause to
 which I shall advert I
 propose to amend the bill
 in section six on page
 7 from lines thirty eight
 to forty three the tax
 on cigars The bill imposes
 a graduated tax upon cimars
 taxing very heavily thosc that
 are cheap and proportionally exempts
 from tax those that are
 expensive and costly The bill
 provides I take the printed
 amend ment as I understand
 the amend ment proposed by
 the committee was adopted On
 cigars o all kinds valued
 at 5 or under per
 thou sand 20 cents per
 pound over 5 and not
 over 10 40 cents per
 ound and over 810 60
 cents per pound and in
 addition t nereto 10 per
 centum ad valorem My attention
 has been called to that
 because the section of country
 from which I come is
 deeply interested in the tobacco
 product I never had inquired
 into it before particularly but
 I was sur prised that
 they could take tobacco from
 Virginia and Kentucky to Germany
 and there manufacture it into
 cigars and bring them back
 and sell the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 16 Mr BIGLER We
 were yesterday on the warehousing
 subject Mr MASON Who ever
 heard in this coun try
 of cigars being valued by
 the pound I mean who
 among the consumers I had
 not the most remote idea
 how many cigars by the
 tale would be measured by
 a pound nor has anybody
 else I doubt whether there
 is a Senator on this
 floor unless those who have
 prejected this bill who have
 any idea how many cigars
 make a pound They are
 sold by the thousand or
 by the hun dred or
 by the dozen Mr POLK
 I am under the impression
 that the Senator from Virginia
 is mistaken The pound portion
 was struck out believe and
 now the valuation is by
 the thousand Mr MASON I
 take the bill as it
 is here the amendment is
 in italics Mr BIGLER The
 Senator from Virginia is Mr
 MASON The anmendment has been
 adopted values them at so
 much a pound My attention
 was drawn to it to
 see how the tax would
 work The bill taxes cigars
 that are valued at 5
 or under per thousand 20
 cents per pound in the
 first place as a specific
 tax and then 10 per
 cent ad catorem additional I
 put myself to the trouble
 of inquiring and I found
 that the cheapest cigars that
 are imported are those I
 think chiefly from Germany and
 far the larger portion of
 cigars that are brought from
 Germany are at prices from
 2 50 to 3 per
 thousand Now as the bill
 stands with the amendment of
 the committee cigars valued at
 2 50 or 3 per
 thousand in Ger many are
 taxed 20 cents a pound
 and of these cigars a
 thousand weigh about thirteen pounds
 Then the tax upon them
 by weight is 2 60
 a thousand Puttnng their value
 at 2 50 and the
 larger number of cigars I
 believe are imported at that
 rate the ad valorem tax
 of 10 per cent is
 25 cents more so that
 these cigars which cost about
 2 50 in Germany are
 taxed here 2 85 or
 114 per cent Mr TRUMBULL
 1 should like to inquire
 of the Senator from Virginia
 if he understands this 10
 per cent to apply to
 the cheaper cigars According to
 the grammatical construction of the
 bill as it is I
 do not know what may
 have been the intention of
 the framers it seems to
 me the punctuation makes it
 clear that the 10 per
 cent ad valorem only applics
 to the higher priced cigars
 Mr MASON I read the
 text and certainly in construction
 whatever may have been intended
 the ad valorcm tax applies
 to all the classes of
 cigars here mentioned It reads
 thus On cigars o all
 kinds valued at 5 or
 under per thou sand 2
 jcents pcr pound over 5
 and not over 10 40
 cents per pound and over
 10 60 cents per pound
 and in addition thereto 10
 per centum ad valorem The
 punctuation will hardly affect the
 construc tion but that would
 make a matter of very
 little moment This 10 per
 cent ad valorem is a
 very small tax in proportion
 to the tax by weight
 T h ns it would
 result that these cigars costinff
 2 50 a thousand in
 Germany would be taxed 2
 60 by weight and 25
 cents by the ad valorem
 percentacre making 2 85 or
 114 per cent Ci gars
 that cost over 10 a
 thousand are taxed 60 cents
 a pound and in addition
 thereto 10 per cent cigars
 at prices that brought them
 within reach ad calorenl At
 the rate of 13 pounds
 to the thou of the
 humblest smoker I know enough
 of to sand that would
 make the whole tax at
 12 80 bacco and the
 consumption of tobacco to know
 at 60 cents a pound
 or about 125 per cent
 that like tea and coffee
 it has become neces I
 speak of these cheap cigars
 as a necessary to made
 is the cheapest kind of
 tobacco that can be flavor
 even when cigars are brought
 here from Cuba at 50
 a thousand at 25 per
 cent while the necessary of
 life to the poor man
 is taxed from 114 to
 125 per cent Where is
 the justice of it It
 is covered up by chargirv
 so much per pound but
 the result is the same
 to tax the necessary to
 urohibition and to tax the
 luxury in the most lenient
 and indulgent manner I move
 as this policy has to
 be carried out by an
 amendment in line thirty nine
 of the sixth section to
 strike out the word five
 and insert the word three
 in line forty as part
 of the same amendment to
 strike out 20 and insert
 It will then read On
 cigars of all kinds valued
 at 3 and under per
 thou sand 10 cents per
 pound If that is adopted
 I shall pursue it by
 reducing pro ratc the rest
 of the taxation Mr CAMERON
 1 think the Senator from
 Virginia has made a mistakc
 in the basis of his
 calculation I do not believe
 a thousand cigars can weigh
 thirteen pounds I believe if
 he had said three pounds
 he would have been nearer
 right certainly not more than
 four pounds That takes off
 two thirds of his calculation
 The rea son for taking
 these low priced cigars is
 this the I whole cigar
 making business of this country
 has been carried to Germany
 because those people there make
 a false cigar a cigar
 mixed up With ingredients which
 are not tobacco They will
 use a little tobacco but
 worthless articles arc put in
 besides and they are sent
 here for actually less than
 tobacco can be bought for
 The cigars are actually sold
 here at a less rate
 per thousand than tobacco can
 be sold for in this
 country Yet the tobacco goes
 there and comes back in
 the shape of cigars Iom
 not willing to admit that
 this is a necessary though
 some mav think it is
 but whether it is or
 not poor people in this
 country formerly made their living
 by making cigars The poor
 women the widows and the
 orphan children of the coun
 try made cigars out of
 which they supported themselves before
 this business got into foreign
 hands and this worthless article
 is made abroad and then
 they cheat us in the
 invoice just as the Senator
 from Illinois a little while
 ago said the great wrong
 in this whole system of
 ad calorems x vas the
 cheating connected with it the
 false in voices and the
 false swearing This mak ing
 is part of that business
 I tell you they will
 bring the cigars here notwithstanding
 the duties you place on
 them and sell them for
 less than they can be
 made for in this country
 regardless of the cost of
 the tobacco and there has
 been more fraud in the
 article of German cigars than
 in any other article which
 has been brought into this
 country I know more about
 the poor peo pte of
 this country than the Senator
 from Vir ginia and perhaps
 more than any other man
 here I know all their
 wants all their sympathies all
 their feelings I know they
 have no interest in that
 which he advocates r heir
 interest on the contrary is
 to give as much labor
 as possible to our own
 people The honest poor of
 this coun try ask no
 boon but to be allowed
 to work and get proper
 wages for it Give them
 work and they will sustain
 themselves regardless of any surroundings
 they may have They ask
 nothing more Mr MASON I
 have no doubt in the
 world that the tobacco out
 of which these inferior cigars
 are sary an absolute necessary
 We might dispense the poorer
 people just as much so
 as a pipe is with
 teaand coffee as far as
 nutrition is concerned ncccssary to
 those who cannot afford even
 the indulgencc of a cheap
 cigar and live without them
 and we mightdispense with It
 is a necessary tobacco as
 far as nutrition is concerned
 and live quite as much
 so as tea or coffee
 How is it with without
 it but it has entered
 into such general those who
 can afford greater indulgence W
 c use among all classes
 the wealthv and the poor
 know that cigars cost in
 Cuba wheFe the higher as
 to have become as essentially
 a necessary as flavored tobacco
 is raised every imaginable price
 these eastern products of tea
 and coffee It is a
 from 5 to 500 per
 thousand necessary to the poor
 man an indulgence to the
 Several SENATORS Oh no From
 5 to 50 more wealthy
 class a necessary to the
 poor man Mr MASON I
 dare say some are sold
 at 5 that he may
 have the tobacco an indulgence
 to or 10 or 20
 a thousand but I know
 from cor the wealthy class
 that he may indulge himself
 in rect information that cigars
 are sold in Cuba at
 flavor Those who projected this
 bill tax the I I
 100 200 and 4DÖ per
 thousand depend necessary of the
 poor comparatively exempt ent upon
 weight No Dependent upon flavor
 I the indulgence of the
 wealthy as will show to
 know that tobacco in the
 State of Virginia raised you
 and in the most e
 y traordinary manner in the
 same county and the same
 year and sold at Who
 ever heard of cigars being
 rated by the tho sallie
 market by planters within ten
 or twenty pound They are
 not rated so in the
 market miles of each other
 will sell some at 8
 and some Mr BAYARD The
 English tariff imposes a at
 80 a hundred by the
 hogshead That is owin duty
 on the pound to the
 flavor Yet this bill taxesthe
 luxury of those Mr MASON
 But we are not in
 England who can afford to
 indulge their palate in this
 high got from any place
 We do not smoke except
 in pipes in my country
 Tobacco is raised in Virginia
 I do not know that
 it is made into cigars
 for any consumption at home
 but I do know that
 the tobacco which is sent
 from this country to Europe
 is consumed in Europe after
 being subjected to their process
 of manufacture under circumstances which
 lead to this result that
 a hogshead of tobacco which
 would cost 10 in Richmond
 Virginia will pay a duty
 of 1 200 at Liverpool
 to the British Government then
 be sold to the consumer
 at less than 10 a
 hundred or 10 cents a
 pound Yet those who consume
 that tobacco consider it as
 much of a necessary as
 those in this country who
 drink their coffee at morning
 midday and night What sort
 of cof fee The cheapest
 kinds of West India coffee
 that hardly to those whose
 palates have been otherwise educated
 would be considered at all
 but to them it is
 a necessary absolutely a necessary
 So with tobacco 1861 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBD The honorable Senator
 says he would not con
 sider it a necessary Perhaps
 I would not or per
 haps I might It would
 depend on whether we had
 been accustomed to its use
 We all know that such
 is the consumption of tobacco
 through out the world that
 the potentates of Europe have
 been enabled to speculate on
 the necessities of their poor
 and make them take it
 in the most d ragged
 deteriorated and injurious form because
 they will take it and
 derive a large revenue from
 it Now as to the
 Senator s idea that the
 poorer people who use these
 inferior cigars are not in
 terested in having cheap cigars
 leave t hat issue with
 him as an ordinary question
 of political economy I take
 it for granted they can
 better determine from their earnings
 whether they can afford to
 buy cigars that are brought
 in from Ger many and
 bought there at 2 50
 a thousand cheaper than they
 can afford to buy those
 that arc manufactured by the
 labor around them I have
 moved in this matter because
 really looked on these cheap
 cigars as a necessary and
 found that they had been
 prohibited and that the more
 expensive cigars had been treated
 very len icntly by the
 rate of duty because cigars
 at 15 a thousand pay
 but 25 per cent under
 the impo sition here I
 speak in round terms You
 pro hibit the necessary by
 expensive taxes and ad mit
 the luxury under the small
 tax Now to the weight
 Mr BAYARD I wish to
 understand the hon orable Senator
 if he will allow me
 to interrupt him Mr MASON
 Certainly Mr BAYARD understand him
 to say that it takes
 thirteen thousand of these cigars
 to make a pound I
 doubt it very much Mr
 MASON I did not say
 that it takes thir teen
 thousand of these to a
 pound but that there are
 thirteen pounds of these cicrars
 to a thou sand It
 is just the very opposite
 of what the Senator supposes
 The Senator from Pennsyl vania
 doubted the estimate Mr BIGLER
 The German cigars run about
 six pounds to the thousand
 and the other from ten
 to twelve pounds to the
 thousand Mr MASON What were
 the Senator s sources of
 information Mr BIGLER My friend
 from Rhode Island who actually
 weighed thcm during thc sittings
 of our committee Mr MASON
 I will tell you the
 sources of information I had
 I had no more idea
 of the number of cigars
 it would take to make
 a pound than the honorable
 Senator has of how much
 mo lasses it would take
 to make a yard Laughter
 One is as much confounded
 as the other tained through
 a friend of mine the
 information from a German impor
 ter in Baltimore The re
 ply of the importer was
 that the German ciffars which
 were sold at 2 50
 to 3 a thousand weighed
 about thirteen pounds to the
 thousand Mr SIMMONS I do
 not wish to prolong I
 should think that anybody who
 this debate read the original
 bill and read the amendments
 would understand the object of
 the committee in In the
 original bill classifying these cigars
 cigars were all taxed at
 50 cents a pound no
 mat ter what they cost
 MT e have rnade three
 stages and put 20 cents
 a pound on the very
 low ciTars costing 5 a
 thousand and under 40 cents
 a pound on those between
 5 and 10 a thousand
 and 60 cents a pound
 with an addition to that
 of 10 per cent on
 those above a thousand becnose
 we knew there were some
 of these very costly cigars
 and we thought we could
 very well put a little
 ad talorem duty on them
 in addition to the specific
 duty Now sir the Senator
 from Virginia has taken an
 hour to show that we
 put the lowest rates on
 the highest cigars that is
 that 60 cents is lower
 than 20 That is the
 amount of it He trics
 to make it out that
 20 cents is more than
 60 cents by pound weight
 When you come to the
 ad tol orenb duty in
 this case if I understand
 the structure of the sentence
 it applies only to the
 highest cigars That is the
 way I have been taught
 to read But perhaps I
 did not study in the
 right school and I never
 went to school much anyhow
 Now I will tell you
 about the weight of the
 cigars The Senator from Pennsylvania
 is mis taken about my
 weighing them One of my
 col leagues on the select
 committee was the Senator frorn
 Vermont Mr COLLAMER He is
 about as accurate in everything
 he does as any man
 I ever knew You hardly
 ever hear him utterasen tence
 here that does not come
 in form as if it
 had been weighed forty times
 over in balance He weighed
 these cigars and told me
 the result of the specimens
 he got Then the minister
 from Ger i many camc
 in herc occasionally and called
 my attention to the enormity
 of this 50 cents a
 pound duty In order to
 get at it I askeg
 him the weight of the
 cheap cigars and he said
 that he thought they weighed
 about six to eight pounds
 a thou I sand He
 wanted me to make another
 stage in this matter as
 the Senator from Virginia does
 He thought it would do
 much to conciiiateforeign nations by
 our taking off these duties
 If I had one to
 an importer of cigars I
 should have ex pected him
 to weigh the heaviest ones
 he had to show how
 enormoüs these duties were but
 I thought that the distinguished
 representative of that country to
 our Government was a man
 of honor that I was
 safe in assuming that he
 told me about what the
 fact was I did not
 calculate to go all over
 the city and find out
 what was ria ht to
 put on the 5 a
 thousand cigars I supposeä they
 would weigh about eight pounds
 to the thousand and that
 would make a duty of
 1 60 which would be
 a little over 30 per
 cent I agree that this
 is over our average rate
 If they did not weigh
 more than six pounds to
 the thousand it would be
 less I thought the use
 of these cigars and especially
 the cheap ones was one
 of the greatest vices that
 the young men were subject
 to You see boy going
 along the streets now eleven
 years old with a cio
 ar in his mouth I
 never did th rash mine
 much but if I caught
 one of them at it
 when he was young think
 I should be tempted to
 depart from my usual rules
 of discipline Laughter I he
 Senator from Virginia says this
 is a neces sary So
 is liquor to some people
 We put 75 cents a
 gallon on brandy That is
 as necessary to some people
 as bread I am not
 a very strong temperance man
 myself but I certainly would
 put about as high a
 duty on liquors as I
 would on tobacco and I
 chew tobacco every day and
 when I cannot get good
 I have to chew bad
 I have crot into such
 a foolish habit that I
 cannot very welldo without it
 and I have some sympathy
 for those who get addicted
 to vices bull do not
 want to coax them into
 them by regulating the tariff
 The minister from Germany told
 me that these cheap cigars
 weighed from six to eight
 pounds to the thousand Mr
 TRUMBULL TvVhatdid the Senator from
 Vermont say Mr SIMMONS He
 weighed some Habanas and they
 weighed a pound to the
 hundred These German cigars however
 are the meanest kind of
 cigars and the lightest kind
 and the cheapest kind and
 they have the lowest duty
 on them thought there would
 have been so much noise
 about it I believe I
 should have let the House
 duty of 50 cents a
 pound stand but I thought
 we might very welk reduce
 that and graduate it ac
 cording to the quality of
 the articles My pur pose
 has been all along to
 try to periict this bill
 so that there could be
 no more paper calculations about
 its being 160 per cents
 but it does not make
 any difference what you do
 I believe if you put
 these cigars at 5 cents
 a pound somebody would make
 it out that the duty
 was 400 per cent and
 and if it was 40
 cents they would make it
 out 20 per cent if
 that suited thcm They can
 cipher anything Anybody who reads
 the amendment will know that
 the committee intended to grad
 ing the geneml mode of
 assessing d tw he should
 be p teparedto informrthe mode
 will former mode said to
 him as uppose other Senators
 iVill say that had not
 the most remote idea how
 much a thousand cigars wot
 ild I know the experience
 of our countey has beeh
 that cigars are purchase at
 home as well as abroad
 by the tale not by
 weight and yet he comes
 in here and confounds in
 the assessing of his duty
 the weight of cigars and
 the number To get the
 information necessary L sought it
 in the mode i have
 stated L got it from
 an importer of these cheap
 cigars do not know that
 I ever saw one of
 them but it was reported
 that ittook thirteen pounds in
 weight to make a thousand
 I knew adso what the
 Senator seems to be or
 as surnes to be incredulousof
 i that tobacco like teæ
 like wine like brandy is
 valued notby its weight not
 by its balk but by
 its flavor ItokNtheSenator what had
 seen in my own State
 two hdgshéad8 of tobacco raised
 in the same county inithe
 same year on two different
 plantations within two miles of
 each other one hogshead selling
 at a hundred and the
 other at 80 800 per
 cent dif ference What made
 that difference Mr SIMMONS do
 hot mean the accuracy of
 these statements at all Mr
 MASON ido not understand that
 but l understood the Senator
 to assign very little weight
 to the fact that flavor
 discriminated the value and yet
 it does and I said
 what happened to have heard
 from gentlemen who have been
 conversant with the markets in
 Havana and have been curi
 ous in their cigars I
 am not so Mr CAMERON
 If the Senator from Vir
 ginia will allow me I
 state that I am informed
 by one of our doorkeepers
 who was ill the cigar
 business that the average weight
 is about seven and a
 half pounds to the thousand
 Mr MASON know nothing about
 the door keeper or what
 his business is when he
 i at home but I
 suppose the weight of the
 cigar will depend upon the
 quality of the tobacco in
 it I stated what I
 happened to hear incidentally that
 in the prices that are
 paid by the very wealthy
 peo ple for their indulgencies
 they paid as high as
 500 a thousand for their
 cigars During this winter not
 in reference to this billin
 the slightest degree certainly before
 I knew there was such
 a provision in the bill
 and the gentleman to whom
 I referred had no kno
 wledge of it a friend
 of mine gave me a
 cigar a single one of
 an importation at 500athousand They
 are discriminated by their flavor
 entirely yet the scheme of
 this bill is to impose
 a tax on the poorer
 class who use the cheaper
 cigars to the exemption of
 the more wealthy class who
 can afford to indulge in
 this whirn this taste which
 the Senator seems to be
 incredulous about Mr CLINGMAN 1
 do not we be able
 to finish this bill to
 day and I move that
 the Senate adjourn The motion
 was not agreed to there
 being on a division ayes
 11 noes 24 Mr BAYARD
 I am by no means
 sure that I shall not
 vote for the amendment of
 the honor able Senator from
 Virginia to reduce the duty
 on these cigurs one hulf
 They are fixed in the
 bill at varying rates according
 to the valuation and his
 proposition is to reduce the
 duties one half I think
 he has fallen into some
 errors in his state I
 do not believe that under
 any circum ment stances the
 flavor of cigars ever made
 the cost uate these duties
 according to the value of
 the I in Cuba anything
 like an approximation to the
 article I never heard of
 any cigars at 500 to
 the thou sand that the
 Senator speaks of They v
 rould be 50 cents apiece
 If a man smoked them
 as much as some men
 smoke he would want 1
 000 000 I do not
 know but income to find
 him in cigars I have
 got so that I that
 there are such cigars never
 dispute any extravagant statement which
 is made when a tariff
 is up The Senator tries
 to make out that we
 impose a lower duty on
 the amount he states I
 do not think that cigars
 ever cost in Cuba dependent
 upon their flavor I a
 thousand much less 500 I
 do not mean to say
 that men may not pay
 that for fancy cigars put
 up in boxes which have
 no value allowing themselves to
 be fooled into the payment
 of ex travagant sums in
 that way mean to gay
 that the flavor of thé
 cigar will not vary its
 price in the island of
 Cuba I think know something
 about it so as to
 make it exceed over 60
 or 70 t highest priced
 cigars well if there are
 any a thousand at the
 outside dependent on the flavor
 cigars at 500 a thousand
 the pound duty would independent
 of any particular mode of
 making the be 1 50
 and the 10 per cent
 in addition would cigar and
 the mode in which it
 is put up and all
 the contrivances that men resort
 to in order to be
 50 making the duty 51
 50 on 500 never heard
 of any such cigars before
 That please thc eye If
 you chooSe to indulge in
 the story was not got
 up until this bill was
 made and luxury of the
 eye connected with the form
 of the cigar and the
 mode in which it is
 prepared and I hope we
 shall not alter it for
 that Mr MASON I think
 we have a right to
 ex all that in preference
 to the flavor of Course
 you peet that when a
 Senator brings in a bill
 chang must pay for it
 but as regards the mere
 question 958 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 16 of then ralue
 ofa cigar occasioned by the
 difference do not suppose in
 any case it would exceed
 60 or 70 a thousand
 at the outside and doubtxhether
 it would ever go over
 60 Apart from that there
 is a principle involved in
 this matter Though it is
 true that tobacco has become
 an artificial want and therefore
 in that sense a necessity
 as 1 admit to the
 country at almost all classes
 smoke thatis not a reason
 why when you are imposing
 a duty for the purpose
 of revenue if you find
 that spurious articles have been
 introduced into the country which
 are not tobacco and may
 be more injuri ous you
 should not in your legislation
 lay a heavier duty on
 the spurious articles than upon
 those which are really and
 intrinsically what they are represented
 to be Now mv impression
 is that the vast amount
 of these cigai s that
 are called German cigars are
 anything but tobacco The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The question IS on
 the amendment ofthe Senator from
 Virginia Mr MASON I ask

 December 1777 that said I
 Yancey served in the war
 of the Revolution not i
 less than three years apart
 of this time as a
 pri vate and a part
 as a quartermaster It is
 impos Sible to say how
 long he served in each
 capacity and it is somewhat
 doubtful that he ever acted
 as quartermaster though there is
 evidence that a man of
 the same name did so
 serve The widow ap plied
 for a pension under the
 act of 1836 as early
 as 1839 but from the
 doubt as to his services
 as quartermaster the Pension Office
 suspended the decision of the
 case The committee allow a
 pen Sion to the widow
 of eighty dollars per annum

 1839 to the period of

 years I served as first
 lieutenant in the company Qi

 Jenkins in the one hundred
 and thirty eighth regiment and
 eleventh brigade of the militia

 the service of the United
 States and joined his company
 of riflemen on the 7th
 day ofSeptember 1814 and marched
 with said company to Sackett
 s Harbor and continued in
 actual service of the United

 COMMITTEE OF TIIOLB Mr TAPPAN
 I now move that the
 House go into a Committee
 of the Whole House on
 the Private Calendar The motion
 was aereed to The House
 accordingly resolved itself into a
 Committee of the Whble House
 on the Private Calendar IVIr
 WASHBURNE of Illinois in the
 The CHAIRMAN This day the
 Committee of the Whole House
 on the Private Calendar has
 under the order of the
 House been made an ob
 jection day The Clerk will
 therefore proceed to call the
 Calendar at the point where
 the call ceased on the
 last objection day being at
 House bill No 5795 for
 the relief of Thomas F
 Bowler of New Mexico Mr
 WINSLOW oforder I understand the
 Chairman to say that the
 call of the Calendar would
 be resumed where it was
 left off on the last
 objection day I submit that
 this being objection day by
 special order the call of
 the Calendar ought to be
 commenced with thc first bill
 upon the Calendar Such I
 believe was the understanding of
 the House this morning when
 this was made objection day
 in the Committee of the
 Whole House on the Private
 Calendar The CHAIRMAN The Chair
 is not aware vvhat was
 the understanding of the House
 He has proposed on this
 occasion to proceed with the
 call under the rules and
 practice of the House Therefore
 he has directed the Clerk
 to begin the call where
 it was left off on
 last objection day Mr WINSLOW
 That would bc a correct
 proceeding if we were now
 in Committee on the Private
 Calendar upon one of the
 objection days set apart by
 the rules But such is
 not the case hope We
 are not v acting undera
 special order that there will
 be no objection to carrying
 out what I thought was
 the cyeneral un lerständing and
 that is to begin with
 the beginning of the Calendar
 and not upon page 15
 rhe CHAIRMAN The Chair will
 submit the question to the
 decision of tl le House
 Mr WINSLOW 1 hope we
 will begin with the beginning
 of the Calendar for we
 will then be enabled to
 go through the entire Calendar
 and not through only a
 parit of it The CHAIRMAN
 The Committee has heard the
 proposition is there objection to
 it Mr PERRY 1 object
 ri he CHAIRMAN The question
 will be sub mitted to
 the House I hope we
 will Mr CLARK of Missouri
 take up the entire Calendar
 and not confine the call
 to Senatc bills Mr WINSLOW
 The order of the House
 confines us to Senate bills
 Mr McCLERNAND 1 think that
 the gen tleman from North
 Carolina is mistaken as to
 the order of the liouse
 limiting the call to the
 Senate bills upon the Calendar
 The CHAIRMAN The Clerk informs
 the Chair that the order
 of the House was for
 a gen eral call of
 the Caley dar including House
 bills as well as Senate
 bills The question now is
 shall the call begin with
 the beginning of the Cal
 endar instead of where it
 was left off on the
 last objection to day The
 CHAIRMAN The order of the
 House was general Mr FLORENCE
 My understandingisthat when the Smith
 case was up the House
 agreed to take up the
 Senate bills The Smith bill
 was a Senate bill and
 it wras understood that the
 order included it but if
 we go on as the
 Chairman has decided that case
 will not be reached It
 is a meritorious case and
 I will tell the gentleman
 who objected to it that
 if he will look into
 it he will be satisfied
 that it ought to be
 passed Mr TOMPKINS to the
 pending bill I understand the
 House has over and over
 again refused to pay such
 claims JOHN MONTZ A bill

 part of the Senate Mr
 WASHBURNE 0f111inois I louse does
 not understand what has been
 done by the statement only
 of the numbers of the
 amendrnents I hope the gentleman
 from New York will explain
 the action of the committee
 of confcrcncc Mr SICKLIiS Mr
 Speaker the result of the
 report is that the Senate
 recedes from so much of
 its amendment in reference to
 the postal ser vice appropriation
 as was disagreed to by
 the House It does not
 affect the substance of thc
 proposition at all because thc
 additional clause of the Senate
 was deemed redundant In reference
 to the land offce appropriation
 in Kansas we have modified
 the ainendment of the Senate
 so as to take away
 that which was appro priated
 for omce rent fuel c
 and restricting the sum to
 what was found to be
 due for clerk hire and
 we have added to that
 a clause repealino the act
 of 1855 56 under which
 such allowance was made so
 as to prevent the allowance
 of this sum operating as
 a precedent for future claims
 of similar character In reference
 to the amendment of the
 Senate appropriating 300 000 to
 carry out the contract made
 by lie Secretary of the
 Navy with which the House
 is familiar the Senate recedes
 from its amendment It is
 in that shape Mr Speaker
 the bill comes before the
 House without the Chiriqui appro
 priation with the Kansas land
 office appropria tion modified in
 the sense have stated and
 with appropriation for mail service
 to California in tact as
 it was adopted by the
 House I demand the previous
 question on the adoption of
 the report The previous question
 was seconded and the main
 question ordered and under the
 operation hereof the report was
 adopted Mr SICKLES moved to
 reconsider the vote by which
 the report was adopted and
 also moved that the motion
 to reconsider be laid upon
 the able The latter motion
 was agreed to Mr SHERMAN

 there is too muéh doubt
 about that case and therefore

 back twenty years WILLIAhL HUMPHREY
 A bill H R No
 590 for the relief of
 the children of William Humphrey
 a soldier of the Revolution
 Mr HOLMAN There is pending
 before Con gress a generat
 bill which embraces au cases
 of this kind and therefore
 I object At a sn
 bsequent period Mr MARTIN of
 Virginia appealed to the gentleman
 from Indiana to withdraw his
 objec lions HOLMAN 1 will
 withdraw my objec tion The
 CHAIRMAN By unanimous consent that
 can l e done Mr
 HOLMAN My objection was based
 upon the fact Lhat a
 general bill is pending covering
 all such cases but I
 withdraw it The bill requires
 the Secretary of the Treas
 ury to pay to the
 surviving legitimate children of Wiliinm
 Humphrey deceased a revolutionary soldier
 late of Virginia out of
 any money in tbc Treasury
 not otherwise appropriated the sum
 of four dollars per month
 to commence from the 4th
 of March 1831 to the
 22d of March 1850 the
 day of his death It
 appears from the report which
 was read that the evidence
 sufficiently establishes the fact that
 Humphrey wvas a soldier of
 the Revolution and served asa
 private in the American Army
 at the sieo e ot
 Yorktown and continued in such
 service til after hc surrender
 of the Bri tish arrnv
 that the length of time
 he served in the said
 Army does not appear except
 from his own affidavit which
 states it at seventeen It
 also ap pears that said
 Elumphrey in his lifetime to
 Wit August 23 1833 made
 application in due form for
 a pension under the act
 of the 7th of April
 1832 the granting of which
 through no fault or neglect
 on his part was delayed
 till his decease which was
 in March 1850 that he
 left surviving chit dren the
 petitioners hut no widow that
 said chil dren have been
 diligent in presenting their claim
 for the arrears of pension
 due their deceased father at
 the time of his death

 vas read it appears that
 the petitioner enlisted as a
 private in May 1813 under
 Captain Amberson a recruiting offi
 in Stoystown Somerset county Pennsylva
 nia He marched to Pittsburg
 and from t bence under
 Colonel Hugh Brady marched to
 Fort George in Canada thence

 for the relief of Henry
 Sanford The bill directs the

 put the name of Henry
 Så nford of Freeddnh Maine
 on the invalid pension list
 at the rate of eight
 dollars per month to commence
 on the 1st of December
 1855 and continue during his
 nat ural life The report
 which was read states that
 the evi dence in this
 case shows that the said
 Henry San ford enlisted in
 Dece mber 1812 in a
 company of volunteers commanded by
 Captain John Com mins and
 marched to the eastern frontier
 of the then district of
 Maine that he was frequently
 on duty during the night
 time and through the win
 ter watching fin smugglers Near
 the close of the winter
 he was taken sick while
 in the service was very
 sick for about tsvo months
 after which he partially recovered
 so as to occasionally be
 on duty and attend roll
 call and was discharged at
 Eastport in December 1813 It
 further appears tl atsoon after
 his return home he was
 taken down sick again by
 a disorder in the back
 and kidneys and after about
 six tnonths he measurably recov
 cred so as to in
 part attend to his business
 as a fanner for a
 time but for the last
 twenty years has been entirely
 prostrated and for more than
 sixteen years has been unable
 to stand upon his feet
 These facts are substantiated by
 the affda vits of two
 of his fellow soldiers who
 were with hirn in the
 United States service in 1812
 and 1813 and have been
 well acquainted with him since
 now reside near him and
 have frequently visited him during
 his confinement and his family
 phy sician also testifies that
 he has frequently visited him
 professionally during thirty nine years
 last past and that said
 Sanford has been entirely pros
 trated has had n runnincy
 sore on his back for
 twenty years and that he
 has no doubt his pros
 tration is in consequence of
 his exposure as afore said

 Secretary of the Interior to
 place the name of James
 Van Pelt on the roll
 of invalid pensions and to
 pay him a pension at
 the rate of eight dollars
 per month commencing on the
 4th of March 1859 The
 report which was read shox
 vs that James Van Pelt
 was a corporal in the
 company of New York militia
 commanded bv Captain Abner Woodworth
 and it also show s
 that after he so entered
 the service he became sick
 from extraor dinary exposure to
 the weather and cold while
 on the march westward and
 in the line of his
 duty which resulted in partial
 paralysis that has incapacitated him
 from labor The bill was
 laid aside to be reported

 William W Diehl on the
 roll of invalid pensioners at
 the rate of eimht dollars
 per month in lieu of
 the pension that he now
 re ceives and that the
 same commence on the 4th
 of March 1860 The report
 which was read states that
 the peti tioner was a
 soldier in the war with
 Mexico and received a wound
 in the elbow by a
 musket ball He was honorably
 discharged as wounded and subsequently
 obtained a pension for partial
 inabil ity to perform his
 manual labor Since then he
 has totally lost the use
 of his arm as certified
 by the United States surgeon
 The petitioner asks an increase
 from 5 33 to eight
 dollars per month The bill
 was laid aside to be
 reported to the House with
 a recommendation that it do

 H R No 598 granting
 a pension to Daniel Lucas
 The bill directs the Secretary
 of the Interior to place
 the name of Daniel Lucas
 upon the roll of Invalid
 pensions at the rate of
 eight dollars per month and
 that he receive pay from
 the 4th of March 1859
 From the report which was
 read it appears I that
 I aniel Lucas enlisted in
 the United States Army and
 was attached to cornpany E
 third United States infantry then
 under ccnnma nd of I
 Captain Van Horne which was
 ordered to New Mexico It
 appears from the proof that
 while in garrison he with
 others was ordered by Captain
 Van Horne to haul water
 from the Rio Grande I
 river for the use of
 the troops that while in
 the execution of these orders
 and during the progress I
 of loading the wagons with
 hauls of water he I
 overstrained himself and was seen
 suddenly to fall and hiscomradesgoing
 to hisassistance found he had
 been severely ruptured and powerless
 The Army surgeons certity he
 has hernia and in consequence
 he was discharged from the
 ser i vice for disability
 as unfit for the service
 There I seems to be
 no doubt but this hernia
 is fixed and incurable The
 petitioner applied to the Pension
 OMce for a pension but
 the regulations requiring the proof
 of disability to be made
 by an offcer in command
 and Captain Van Horne being
 dead and the other offcers
 on distant posts on duty

 The bill which was read
 directs the Commis sioner of

 place the name of Henry
 F Bowers on the list
 Of invalid pensioners and pay
 him a pension at the
 rate of eight dollars per
 month from the 25th of
 January 1858 and continue during
 his natu ral life It
 appears from the report that
 Bowers was a private of
 marines and enlisted on the
 22d of January 1853 and
 was discharged by surgeon s
 certificate on the 20th April
 1855 that his disa bility
 was caused by inflammation of
 the eyes produced by standing
 guard while on board the
 receiving ship Union at the
 Philadelphia navy yard Since his
 discharge as aforesaid he has
 become blind Mr HOARD i
 do not see why the
 pension should date back in
 that case Mr FLORENCE The
 case has been here ever
 since the time to which
 it dates back I he
 bill is two yearsold but
 it has never been reached
 on the Calendar The man
 is totally blind and the
 bill only gives him eight
 dollars a month Mr HOARD
 The certificate accompanying the report
 does not state that the
 man is blind Mr FLORENCE
 The practice of the Pen
 Sion Offce is to make
 the pension commence from the
 date of proof and we
 had the proof here two
 years ago I lr lr
 HOARD I move to amend
 the bill so as to
 make the pension commence from
 the date of its passacye

 fifty dollars a month Mr
 HOARD understand that the gentle

 that the bill shall be
 amended so as to reduc

 KILN I move to reduce
 it to twenty five dollars

 is not just The amount
 ought to be thirty dollars
 Mr JUNKIN She will be
 dead before sixty days pass
 She is now upon her
 death bed Mr FLORENCE still
 justice ought to be done

 the second section of the

 entitled An act to continue
 half pay to certain widows
 and orphans in the following
 words That the widows of
 all officers non commissioned officers
 musicians and privates of the

 as shall be prescribed hy
 the Commissioner of Pensions provided
 that no pension shall be
 allowed to any widow for
 the same time during which
 her hus band was living
 and in the receipt ofa

 not a private mR It
 appears to be a joint
 resolution giving a ter construction
 to a certain public act
 If so it is here
 bv mistake Mr HUTCHINS I
 will explain the resolu lion
 to the gentleman Mr W
 i I do not know
 what it is Mr HUTCHINS
 The Comnuttee of Claims reported
 this joint resolution to meet
 a number of cases of
 bills that follow it upon
 the Caiendar T fie Gentleman
 will doubtless remember the cases
 It gives a construction to
 the law of 1853 dating
 The CHAIRMAN Is there any
 objection to the joint resolution
 Mr HOARD I am a
 member of the Com mittee
 of Claims and I have
 read this law If the
 gentleman from North Carolina will
 examine the statute and give
 it the same construction as
 the Court of Claims has
 given it I will not
 object otherwise I will Mr
 WINSLOW 1 think the joint
 resolution to have been considered
 in the Committee of the
 Whole Oil the state of
 the Union but if it
 can be passed by informally
 until we can have an
 opportunity of examining it I
 will not object the advertisement

 with the understanding wi li

 Mr BURNETT I ask gentlemen
 what they I m the
 Pacific and other circumstances have
 de propose to do when
 they object giving these parties
 the relief which the Court
 of Claims has decided then
 to be entitled to Will
 you repu diate the decision
 of your own court When
 thesc partics havc gone there
 and obtained judg ment in
 their favor after employing counsel
 and incurrincr considerable expense ought
 the House then to repudiate
 the decision of the court
 created by itself I say
 no The CHAIRMAN All this
 discussion is out of order
 Mr HOARD lobject to the
 joint resolution for the present
 but I will withdraw the
 objection t hereafter if the
 gentleman North Carolina after examining
 the statute decides that the
 con struction of the Court
 of Claims is correct Mr
 S YANTON 1 think myself
 that there may be some
 doubt about the accuracy of
 the con struction of the
 Court of Claims but I
 submit to the gentleman from
 New York whether he will
 on a question about which
 good lawyers undoubt edly differ
 when we have provided a
 tribunal for examination of these
 cases and when these par
 ties have incurred expense and
 delay of litigation refuse these
 parties relief 011 the assumption
 that he understands the question
 a great deal better than
 anybody else Is it right
 Mr PHELPS This discussion is
 out oforder I object The
 CHAIRMAN Discussion The gentleman from
 New York Mr HOARD has
 objected to the consideration of
 the joiot res olution Mr
 HOARD For the present Mr
 WINSLOW 1 suggest that as
 the bills next on the
 Calendar from Che Court of
 Claims depend on the decision
 of the joint resolution just
 passed over we pass these
 bills over informally for the
 prescnt We can examine them
 after wards The CHAIRMAN By
 unanimous consent all the cases

 1849 large number of cases
 from the Court of Claims
 The report T vas read
 from whicl l it appears
 which follow it on the

 say to the gentleman that
 in the year 1848 Captain
 Alexander V Fra ser theri

 Slates rcve from North Carolina
 that these cases were up
 during the last Congress They
 are a class of nuc
 briff Lawrence was ordered on
 duty to the cases arising
 under the pension laws about
 which Pacific coast of the
 United States Previous to layed
 the presentation of the claim
 to Congress until this time
 From the arrangement made between
 the col lector and Captain
 F raser it appears that
 the ernment saved about twenty
 thousand dollars Captain Fraser having
 recez ved for his rations
 3 360 whereas under the
 lowest bid the same number
 of rations would have cost
 23 072 Which he might
 have made had not a
 feeling of delicacy at taliinø
 advantage of the condition of
 things and a behef that
 upon a statement of the
 facts a just compensation would
 be allowed him in accordance
 with his understanding with the
 col It appears that as
 late as 1853 the prices
 lector paid by the Govefnment
 for rations San Fran cisco
 w as sixty five cents
 per ration The claimant asks
 to be allowed the difference
 between this price and that
 which was paid him under
 which allow ance if made
 the Government will still have
 saved the sum of 16
 100 If the proposals under
 the collector s advertisement had
 been below the sum agreed
 to be paid to the
 claimant his contract according to
 its terms being no longer
 obligatory the collector would have
 been obliged to accept them
 and the ciaimant would have
 suffered se rious loss This
 advantage was secured to the
 Government against the claimant under
 the terms of the contract

 their joint expense keep in
 repair the various streetson either
 side of which they own
 property This street was as
 the evi dence shows iri
 an almost impassable condition although
 it was one of the
 greatest thoroughfares of the city
 The United States court was
 held on one side of
 it and the custom house
 on the other The owner
 of the United States court
 house build ing entered into
 this contract with Mr Russ
 He endeavored to obtain the
 sanction of the United States
 authorities but there was no
 authority in any one there
 to give that consent The
 col lector district judge and
 other Government of ficers gave
 the matter their privat e
 approbation though they had no
 authority to enter mto a
 con tract that would be
 binding on the Federal Gov
 ernment The work was done
 and an applica tion was
 then made by the assignee
 to be paid an equal
 sum with that paid by
 the original contractor for his
 half The claim as it
 originally passed the Senate was
 for a pavement of he
 Russ kind but it has
 been reduced to the unere
 cost of a cob ble

 Météyé Mr JOHN COCHRANE If
 the committee will listen to
 me a moment I think
 I can explain this bill
 satisfactorily Mr CAREY 1 object
 Mr GROW It seems to
 me there is a suit
 pending in court of justice
 in this case Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE There is Mr GROW
 Then 1 must object to
 the bill Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 think 1 can ex
 plain it to the satisfaction
 of the House Mr GROW
 I do not object to
 the gentleman s explanation I
 Mr JOHN COCHRANE 1 would
 not weary the committee with
 any statement in this case
 were it not very important
 to the Treasury De I
 partment as well as to
 the claimants I will state
 briefly what the facts au
 e There was a firm
 in New Orleans under the
 style of De Visser Vil
 larubia subsisting from 1851 to
 1857 havincr a limited partner
 named Charles Météyé In the
 course of three years Métöyé
 fraudulently intro I duced through
 ihe custom house of New
 Orleans merchandise to the amount
 of 363 850 34 He
 was discovered in an attempt
 to enter two hun dred
 and three boxesofsugar valued at
 12 210 85 The discovery
 was effected through the instru
 mentality of special agent sent
 on from Wash ington During
 these three years the negligence
 of the employös of the
 custom house from the highest
 down to the lowest offcer
 was so great and cul
 pable that invoices were introduced
 by Météyé of so palpably
 fraudulent a character that the
 most cursory observer could detect
 them They I ties should
 be exempted from all penalty
 on con dition of their
 pay ing the duties But
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 asks that they be also
 obliged to pay in addition
 to the 24 517 78
 the stun of 10 112
 85 the value ofthe two
 hundred and three boxes of
 sugar Now I think with
 all due deference to the
 Sec retary of the Treasury
 that the Committee on Commerce
 were wise in the recommendation
 they made but I nevertheless
 submit the amendment prepared at
 the Treasury Department that this
 committee may determine for themselves
 whether they will adopt the
 recomrnendation of the Corn mitteeon
 Commerce or that recommended by
 the Treasury De artment The
 CHAIRMAN The Chair will state
 to the gentleman froru New
 York that when the bill
 was up beforc the amendment
 of the Committee on Commerce
 was adopted By unanimous con
 sent however a vote can
 be taken upon the amendinent
 the gentleman from New York
 now proposes Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 ask the unani mous
 consent to offer this amendment
 which has been prepared at
 the Treasury Department as a
 substitute for the bill as
 amended on motion of the
 Committee on Commerce I will
 repeat how ever that in
 my judgment it will be
 wise for this committee to
 adhere to its decision and
 pass the bill as it
 is now amended No objection
 being made the substitute was
 received and read Mr BOULIGNY
 It is due to the
 House that I should state
 that the firm of De
 Visser Vil larubia is one
 of the oldest and most
 respectable commercial houses in the
 city of New Orleans I
 happen to know all the
 circumstances of the case This
 Météyé was a young man
 employed as a clerk by
 the house After serving for
 several years the firm were
 satisfied with him and they
 gave him an interest in
 the business Ele was attending
 to the whole of their
 custom house busi ness and
 the whole fraud committed by
 him was failed to detect
 them or if detected they
 failed to II I unknown
 to the house as is
 shown by the books expose
 them It is not contradicted
 that about i of the
 firrn Those books show the
 whole amount forty four invoices
 for swyar and molasses were
 written on paper entirely different
 in appearance from the foreign
 paper on which genuine invoices
 were written A simple inspection
 of one of these invoices
 would instantly satisfy any person
 ac quainted with business that
 it was a forgery yet
 nearly forty passed unsuspected Nay
 more all these forgeries were
 in Météyé s own hand
 writing undisguised well known ill
 the custom house yet no
 one detected the forgery The
 case underwent a judicial criminal
 examination and the certificate of
 the United States Commis sioner
 is this NEW ORLEANS np
 rü 22 1857 I he
 under igned commissioner hereby certifies
 that after a careful examination
 of tbc above entitled case
 he was satisfied that there
 was no ground for prosecutilig
 the defkhldant s the evidence
 sl lowinø conclusively that the
 frauds 01 the cust0111S perpetrated
 by Charles Météyé were lars
 seems to me that the
 Federal Govern t acnt f
 I exclusively his own crime
 The det endants fully exoner
 o luties paid into the
 custom house and it is
 also shown clearly that Météyé
 received from t hem the
 full amount of duties charged
 upon the ori II gina
 invoices The courts determined that
 these gentlemen had nothing to
 do with the fraud and
 that Météyé was the only
 one in fault And let
 rne state another thin to
 the commit It was understood
 at the time that after
 tee I the officers of
 thc custom house had given
 noticc that they had discovered
 the fraud thev allowed Météyé
 three days to escape from
 Orleans before any attempt was
 made to arrest him and
 after that ohey knew exactly
 where he was bat did
 not pursue him or make
 any attempt to his arrest
 He has since run away
 and I be iieve is
 now perhaps in France I
 think it is due under
 all these circumstances that thése
 gen tlemen should be released
 from the penalties for which
 they are liable under the
 law Mr If I understand
 this question corrcctly the court
 acquitted these gentlemen from any
 complicity in the perpetration of
 the ought not to take
 this man s work and
 refuse to pay him The
 Government is under a moral
 ob ligation to pay him
 and I hope the Government
 will not repudiate an obligation
 of this descrip tion which
 no private individual would for
 a mo ment hesitate to
 pay The amendment was agreed
 to and the bill as
 amended was laid aside to
 be reported to the House
 with a recommendation that It
 do pass DE VISSER AND
 VILLARUBIA An act S 39
 for the relief of Simon
 de Visser and José Villarubia
 of New Orleans The bill
 releases SimoY1 de Visser and
 José Vil larubia jr merchants
 of New Orleans from the
 pavment of all claims penalties
 and forfeitures the United States
 arising out of frauds commit
 ted in the custom house
 of New Orleans by one
 Charles Météyé they having been
 judicially de clared to be
 entirely innocent of said frauds
 and ated themselves from any
 suspicion of complicity with the
 said Mét6yé and were accordingly
 discharged ROBERT M LUSHER United
 States Comvnissioncr A bill was
 passed in the Senate exonerating
 these parties entirely It came
 before the Corn mittee on
 Commerce That committee disagreed with
 the Senate in this respect
 declaring that if De Visser
 and Villarubia had received the
 benefit of these frauds they
 should take no advantage of
 the success of Météyes fraud
 but should pay the i
 I just and proper duties
 on these goods Thesc i
 duties amounted to 24 517
 78 But Mr Chairman I
 received recently from the Secretary
 of the Treasury an amendment
 which I will propose to
 the bill instead of the
 which may legally exist against
 them in favor of arnendment
 reported by the Committee on
 Com merce Mötéyé s fraud
 was discovered on Sat urday
 he was informed of the
 discovery he be Mr BOULIGNY
 Entirely Mr GROW Then I
 have no objection to the
 passage of the bill The
 question being upon the substitute
 offered by Mr J0HN COCHRANE
 it was taken and the
 substitute was disagreed to The
 bill as amended was then
 laid aside to be reported
 to the House with the
 recommendation that it do pass
 JOHN W NYE AGAIN The
 committee then resumed the consideration
 of bill H R ND

 can be amended so forfeitures

 frauds in two depart unmolested
 but the petitioners v yere

 discovery until Mondav after ted

 in A more gross instance
 of negligence on the part
 curred in said suits and
 that the rights of the
 of functionaries of the Government

 that one ohiection will be
 sumcient to prevent the consideration
 of the bill if it

 do LEGISLATIVE ETC APPROPRIATION BILL
 SHERMAN I desire to present
 a priv ileged report in
 the House from the committee
 of conference on the legislative
 executive and ju dicial appropriation
 bill and move that the
 com mittee rise for that
 purpose The motion was agreed
 to So the committee rose
 and Mr Bococx hav ing
 taken the chair as Speaker
 pro tenzpore Mr WASHBURNE Of
 Illinois reported that the Com
 mittee of the Whole House
 had according to order had
 the Private Calendar under considera
 tion and had come to
 no resolution thereon Mr SHERMAN
 1 am instructed by the
 com mittee of conference on
 the legislative executive and judicial
 appropriation bill to report their
 ac tion to the House
 I will state with the
 permis Non of the House
 that the committee recommend that
 the House vree to the
 sixth amendment of the Senate
 simply raising the amount of
 their con tingent fund from
 2 000 to 2 500
 The House I also aoree
 to thc Senate amendment in
 regard to the Mint Wich
 an arnendlllent As it now
 stands we authorize the Secretary
 of the Treasury when ever
 he deems it expedient to
 discontinue the refining at the
 mints but allows the same
 charge as under the existing
 la vv for refining when
 it is done at the
 Mint With these two exceptions
 the action of thc House
 upon the Senate amend ments
 is confirmed by the committee
 I move the previous question
 on the adoption of the
 report The previous question was
 seconded and the main question
 ordered to be put The
 report of the committee of
 conference was adopted Mr SHERMAN
 moved to reconsider the vote
 by which the report was
 adopted and also moved to
 lay the motion to reconsider
 on the table Mr THOMAS
 moved that the House adjourn
 The motion was disagreed to
 COMMITTEE OF THE WIIOTÆ Mr
 WINSLOW moved that the House
 resolve itself into a Committee
 of the Whole House on
 the Private Calendar The motion
 was agreed to The House
 accordingly resolved itself into a
 i Committee of the Whole
 House Mr WASH BURNE of
 Illinois in the chair and
 resumed the consideration of the
 Private Calendar JOHN W NYE
 AGAIN Mr BURNETT Before the
 reading of the Calendar is
 commenced I desire to make
 a ques tion of order
 upon House bill No 628
 in relation I think this
 bill had to the claim
 of J W Nye been
 called regularly and objected Co
 on a pre vious occasion
 and that under the rule
 it requires the objection of
 five members to prevent its
 con sidcration that this is
 the first time the bill
 has been regu larly called
 and objected to He will
 therefore be compelled to ovcrrule
 the point of order made
 by the gentleman from Kentucky
 HARRIS AND HODGE Mr CLARK
 of Missouri I ask the
 unani mous consent of the
 House for leave to take
 up and pass House bill
 No 723 for the reliefof
 Har ris Hodge of Missouri
 Mr McCLERNAND I am always
 willing to accommodate the gentleman
 from Missouri but there are
 other bills upon the Calendar
 in which gentlemen upon the
 floor feel a deep inter
 est and I think that
 we had better proceed with
 the call in order I
 object HALF PAY TO WIDOWS
 AND ORPHANS Mr BURNETT 1
 now call up House joint
 resolu tion No 33 giving
 construction to the second section
 of the act of February
 3 1853 to continue half
 pay to widows and orphans
 That resolu tion anda large
 number of Court of Chiims
 bills which depend upon it
 wore laid aside informally for
 the purpose of affording an
 opportunity to members to look
 into them These cases might
 as well be disposed of
 now as at any other
 time I hope therefore that
 we will take them up
 and pass or reject them
 Mr MéCLF RNANQ think there
 is some misunderstanding about this
 matter It is rny recollection
 that the gel tleman from
 New York Mr HOARD objected
 to the consideration of the
 resolution Mr WINSLOW The gentleman
 from New York withdrew his
 objection and agreed that it
 should be informally passed over
 for exanmunation The CHAIRMAN The
 Chair understands the matter as
 stated by the gentleman from
 North Carolina These bills from
 the Court of Claims were
 informally passed over to bc
 called up by any member
 Mr BURNETT 1 call them
 up and ask that they
 be disposed of The ioint
 resolution was read Mr WINSLOW
 This resolution is to put
 the widows of revolutionary officers
 and soldiers who married after
 the year 1800 upon the
 same footinff as those who
 married before that year I
 have looked into the decisions
 of the Court of Claims
 and the statutes and I
 have no doubt the joint
 resolution is framed accordinm to
 the con struction of the
 law Mr MILLSON 1 understand
 the object of that resolution
 is to give these widows
 pensions from the tirne antecedent
 to the passage of the
 law Mr HOARD Yes sir
 Mr MILLSON well the It
 curnstances attending the passage of
 the act was passed under
 the previous question and I
 then desired to have the
 opportunity of opposing I think
 that the decision of it

 find that the bill for
 the lief of Mrs Mary
 Ann Henry was not reported
 with the atnendment of the
 Committee of the Whole House
 and that it passed without
 that I asked the gentleman
 who had the amendment bill
 in charge what it granted
 and he replied some thirty
 dollars a month At my
 suggestion it was reduced to
 twenty dollars a month I
 ask that by unanimous consent
 the correction be made in
 the engrossed bill It was

 Committee of the Whole from
 the further consideration of Sen
 ate bill No 134 for

 and that it now be

 The bill directs the Secretary
 of the Interior to place

 the war with Mex ico
 and on the frontier of
 Texas on the invalid pension
 roll at the rate of
 eight dollars a n rontll
 to commence on the 4th
 of March 1858 and to

 From the report which was
 read it appears that the
 petitioner was several years in
 the Army of the United
 States serving throughout the Mexi
 can campaign and doing duty
 upon the frontieq s of
 Texas where he received the
 Injury while out with a
 scouting party which has resulted
 in a permanent disability The
 duty upon which he was
 engaged at the time of
 receiving the injury is regarded
 as one of a hazardous
 character and though the mannerin
 which he received the wound
 does not appear m evidence
 the petitioner ap tenant June
 21 1839 captain April l
 1850 and died February 22
 1851 The petitioner applies for
 a pension on the ground
 that her husband died of

 of the United States Army
 certifies that Captain Reeves was
 under his pro fessional treatment
 from June 1846 to June
 1848 for disease of the
 left testicle caused by an
 injury received while on drill
 at Fort Adams Rhode Island
 some time in 1845 which
 he be lieves was the
 cause of his death in

 ultimately caused his Captain Reeves

 At the time of his
 death no report was made
 by a medical officer as
 he did not die at
 a military post Acting Surgeon

 certificatb of Surgeon IM cDouryall
 is in his opinion entitled
 to all the credit that
 would be given to a
 similar statement from the records
 of thc surgeon gene eraPs
 office Captain T Jones United
 States It appears from the
 report that some time prior
 to the 20th of December
 1858 tho citizens of Huntsville
 Brunswick and vicinity in the
 State of Missouri petitioned Congress
 to establish a daily mail
 or post route between said
 points but that by reason
 of the failure of the
 last Congress to pass the
 post office appropriation and post
 route bill the route was
 not and is not now
 established by law The wants
 and demands of the people
 for further mail facilities in
 that section of the State
 of Missouri caused by the
 rapid increase of population induced
 the petitioners to open up
 a route from Huntsville to
 Brunswick a distance of about
 sixty miles and commenced running
 a daily line of coaches
 between said points with the
 understanding with the postmasters that
 they should have the mails
 and look to Congress for
 compensation In pursuance of this
 arranoement the petitioners therefore an
 the 20th day of De
 cembcr 1858 at the instance
 of the postmasters took charge
 of the mails and carried
 them daily each way until
 the 20th of August 1859

 his health was so much
 impaired that he was unable
 to go with his company
 to Mexico and was assigned
 duty at West Point that
 he was at the post
 with Captain Reeves when he
 received the injury went with
 him to Pensacola and was
 subsequently with him between three
 and five years during his

 one can possibly make out
 anything about the claim Mr

 during the year to about
 nine thousand dollars and the
 Post Offce Committee tell you
 that this is as just
 a bill as ever came

 SESSION The House reassembled at
 seven o clock m Mr
 ALDRICH occupying the Chair as
 Speaker pro tempore and immediately
 resumed the c on sideraüon
 of the special order being
 the reportof the committee of
 thirty three on the present
 eon dition of the country
 Mr SOMES Mr Speaker I
 do not propose in the
 brief space of time f
 shall occupy to fatigue the
 House With a recital of
 the present diMculLies which seem
 to threaten the peace and
 stability of the nation Thcy
 are already too familiar to
 every American citizen and are
 but the resulb Qf an
 attempt to override the laws
 of civilization by endeavoring to
 force slavery upon enlightened communities
 where the institution never before
 existed rl he advocates of
 slavery have tried to harmon
 ize the most intensified despotism
 on earth with free schools
 and Christianity They have in
 sulted the intelligence of the
 North by declaring that wron
 r is right and that
 allNho differ from them in
 this conclusion should be gagged
 They have undertaken to unite
 two repellant bodies and because
 they would not fuse now
 threaten to break the crucible
 Any political chemist could have
 foretold the result When the
 fathers framed the Government they
 weere compelled to tolerate slavery
 from the ne cessity of
 the case but at the
 same time they adopted the
 theory of equality among men
 and provided in the Constitution
 the means that were sure
 to lead to its ultimate
 triumph nämely free speech and
 a free press They did
 not fear error so long
 as truth was left free
 to combat it Our southern
 friends understand the power of
 truth when uttered without restraint
 as well as the first
 Napoleon did and they fear
 it more because the despotism
 of Napoleon s sway was
 a democracy compared with the
 tyranny of American slavery The
 nephew IS wiser than his
 uncle or the slave holder
 for he meal s hereafter
 that the golden and not
 the iron rule shall govern
 his people and he is
 therefore begiuning to loosen the
 muzzle He prefers intelligence and
 unfetter the press to ianorance
 intellectual strencrt li to brute
 force wealth to poverty national
 greatness to an imbe cite
 oligarchy a personal renown which
 shall keep up with or
 run before the progress of
 civilization rather than present ease
 and the execrations of future
 generations Time will verify this
 state ment The slave power
 might lea rn_ many a
 lesson of political wisdom by
 crossing the Atlantic but it
 chooses the Gulf In order
 to coerce the North into
 compromising its principles the South
 has inaugurated a system of
 terrorism that has no parallel
 in the history of the
 world and when it understood
 that there is no sincerity
 in the present movement at
 least with four fifths of
 the Inhabitants of the southern
 States but that it is
 a mere game of it
 certainly seems surpris ing that
 so many of our statesmen
 should be drawn into the
 snare But I may be
 told as a proof of
 their sincerity that already several
 of the States have held
 con ven tions and resolved
 themselves out ofthe Union ventions
 are cheap and resolutions still
 cheaper besides conventions and resolutions
 constitute no inconsiderable part of
 southern political capital The southern
 States occasionally hold conven tions
 and resolve to open direct
 trade with for eign nations
 by means of lines of
 magnificent steamships a nd fast
 clippers Phcy resolve great cities
 where small towns have hardly
 held their own for many
 years But i believe the
 world has wagged along about
 the same after as they
 did the resolutions passed and
 fast clippers and the stupendous
 steamships float only in the
 imaginations of the resolvers But
 you say they have gone
 beyond resolutions Mr HOARD I
 object and the gentleman Mr
 B NGHAM That is understood
 all round in this case
 they have seized the forts

 968 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 1 6 ment into a
 war I know they have
 and that is the verv
 card that was required to
 bring Congress I like the
 bold on its knees and
 they knew it ncss with
 which they play their game
 thev stake their all on
 a small pair and then
 with out moving a muscle
 of the face they look
 their opponent in the eye
 until he quails and lays
 down his hand was in
 Washington most of the time
 for six weeks prior to
 the assembling of Congress and
 had good reasons for believing
 that a deep and broad
 scheme was laid which has
 since been par tially carried
 out to dissolve the Republican
 party and obtain new concessions
 and ptedges from the free
 States by threatening to dissolve
 the Union Without the slightest
 desire or intention to do
 so I had a peep
 behind the sceneé and can
 assure the timid ones that
 it is nothing but sheet
 iron thunder thät so startles
 and alarms them The managers
 did not fully comprehend the
 firmness of tbe northern people
 and have therefore been obliged
 to play their game more
 desperately than was at first
 intended If that which was
 intended as a farce should
 end as a real tragedy
 among the actors the get
 ters up of the play
 will be responsible for the
 re sults If the true
 Union men will stand aloof
 from taking any part in
 this performance the seces sionists
 will in the course of
 ninety days cry for quarter
 instead of concessions But suppose
 we grant that the Union
 is now really in danger
 what will save it Or
 if it can not be
 saved what is the next
 best thing to be done
 The seceding States repudiate all
 offers of adjustment it is
 therefore folly to svaste time
 or words on them it
 is worse than folly it
 is weak ness and cowardice
 In a speech before the
 late State convention in Alabama
 Mr Yancey said S Mr
 President avow myself as utterly
 unalterably opposed to any and
 all plans of reconstructing a
 Union with the Black Republican
 States of the North No
 new guar antees no amendinents
 of the Constitution no peaceful
 resolutions no repeal of ofi
 nsive laws can offer to
 Ine any the ieaqt induemnent
 to reconstruct onr relations with
 I his op0 lion is
 not töunded the non slavehol
 ling States on any objection
 to a con federation with
 the States north ot Mason
 and line on principles rnucually
 agreeable to then but it
 is i ouuded on the
 conviction that the dis ease
 which preys on the vitals
 of the Federal Union docs
 not enmnate from any defect
 in the Federal Constitutioni but
 from a deeper source rhe
 hearts heads and con sciences
 of the northern people But
 we are told that the
 border States must be saved
 and that this can only
 be done by giving them
 some compromise upon which they
 may stand and around which
 they can rally to resist
 the Gde of secession It
 ispt oposed by gentlemen to
 build a platform out of
 empty compromises and meaningless prom
 ises for Union men of
 the border States to stand
 upon and with this to
 cheat the people back to
 their constitutional allegiance We may
 cheat ourselves thus but not
 the people Any com promise
 now offered can only have
 the effect of demoralizii ff
 and disorganizing the only power
 upon which the tranquillity of
 the country de pends namely
 the Republican party for these
 same disturbing elements wilk reappear
 whenever the slave power has
 any real or fancied grievance
 unless all attempts at compromise
 are sternly re sisted by
 the Republican party for all
 other par ties are broken
 up and have no political
 strel gth The Republican party
 must save the Government by
 standing firm upon its platform
 of principles or Iosc itself
 in the general chaos There
 are va rious propositions of
 compromise offered by dif money
 permanently invested and have retired
 to their easy chairs to
 doze out the balance of
 tbeir days and are unwilling
 to be disturbed They were
 once like other men active
 and brisk and bold in
 their operations but now those
 days are but dreams of
 the past they have now
 a taste for everything that
 is old moldy and stationary
 The world whirls too fast
 for them it makes them
 dizzy and so they are
 anxious to stop it If
 you could be permitted to
 look into their safes you
 would find large packages of
 Government and State stocks as
 well as railroad and manufactur
 ing You would also find
 bonds and mortgages and bank
 stock in abundance They are
 in the habit of overhauling
 and contemplating these as a
 poct does Shakspearc or Longfellow
 In a word these men
 arc chronic fogies run to
 seed and should be treated
 with consideration and re spect
 for we have one of
 them at the head of
 the Government But there is
 a class of men who
 do not propose to give
 any further license to sla
 very who act from higher
 motives whose con trolling influence
 is humanity whose åmbition is
 its growth and universal development
 This class has secured the
 control of the Government iri
 the triumph of the Republican
 party after a struggle of
 many years There are certain
 strata in political history that
 mark the progress of the
 race with as much cer
 tainty as do those of
 geology the formation of the
 earth These are war money
 and humanity The first had
 its day and controlled nations
 with an iron will Then
 war yielded to money and
 capital has been for many
 years the barometer of public
 opinion and the controlling influence
 of political parties and nations
 But this is about to
 give up its scepter to
 hu manity giving a higher
 tone to public sentiment a
 better political practice as well
 as theory to the country
 War and money are to
 be used only as auxiEiary
 agents in the development of
 this new power This young
 giant is already inawurated In
 the North and you might
 as well attempt to rcsist
 the laws that govern the
 seasons as to check his
 onward course The position of
 the free States is uncompromising
 hostility to the expan Sion
 of slaverv In view of
 these facts let us see
 what is the real condition
 and interest of the slave
 States and the policy which
 they should pursue The cot
 ton states South Carolina Georgia
 Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Florida Arkansas
 and a part of l
 exas are slave consuming States
 Vir ginia Maryland Delaware Kentucky
 Tennes see North Carolina and
 Missouri are slave i brecdinc
 States The former seek extension
 of breeding territory to secure
 cheap neo roes the latter
 if they would extend slavery
 at all should strive to
 annex more consuming territory for
 the purpose ot enhancing the
 market Value of slaves What
 then is the policy of
 the two sections of the
 South I cheerfully admit that
 the bofdcr States are but
 slightly responsible for the dis
 tu rbed state of affairs
 and that the crime rests
 mainly upon seceding or slave
 consuming States Suppose then the
 consuming States really mean secession
 and an independent southern confeder
 acy will the border slave
 States go with them and
 assist opening the African slave
 trade when it is evident
 that sooner or later the
 value of slaves would be
 so reduced by fresh importations
 that it would become unprofitable
 to raise them In addition
 to this sacrifice of the
 interests of the breeding States
 they will from their geo
 graphical position be compelled to
 fight the bat ferent classes
 of men The first class
 of compro tles of the
 consuming States as well as
 their own mises are called
 conservative They are the and
 to assist in suppressing servile
 insurrection representatives of property either
 in slaves at the as
 soon ds the restraints of
 the Federal Govcrn South or
 merchandise at the North they
 have ment are removed from
 those in the North who
 everything to lose and little
 to gain in any political
 would excite it New and
 increased facilities will orsocialdistürbance and
 are therefore ever ready I
 be offered for the escape
 of this property for to
 counsel the sacrifice of principle
 wheneverthcre property with brains and
 legs would then be less
 is an appearance of witation
 The second class reliable than
 stocks or even Indian bonds
 and I are men of
 passive or negative qualities with
 no wish to tell southern
 gentlelQen now that if they
 particular purpose and are the
 subjects and tools succeed in
 breaking up this Union and
 place of the positive men
 Then there is a third
 class themsclvcs upon unfriendly relations
 with the free of men
 who having an eye to
 an office or a con
 States they can never recover
 from northern soil tract suddenly
 become oVerwhelmed with patri a
 single slave who steals himself
 for then even otic emotions
 and are ready to save
 the Union at nw rshal
 q and cmnmissioners being shorn
 of their ail hazards fees
 will join the hosts of
 freedom The policy There is
 still another class of men
 that should of the consurning
 States will be free trade
 and di not be overlooked
 fi r they have indirectly
 a rect taxation which must
 necessarily prevent the good deal
 of influence I hey are
 what are called development of
 the natural resources of the
 border retired gentlemen or millionaires
 they have their States and
 re luce them to slave
 breeding alone Such is the
 condition and position of the
 seced ing slave consuming States
 with whom it is pro
 Dosed the border States shall
 ally themselves unless we of
 the free States concede some
 com promise upon which they
 can stand Why should they
 then demand of the North
 concessions that will only result
 uftimately to their disadvantage and
 our disgrace Suppose that we
 give you New Mexico with
 astringent slave code what then
 I have already shown you
 that it would only create
 competition with your own slave
 breeding States and that while
 you expand slave territory you
 contract your own income Suppose
 vge offer you as a
 compromise the strongest guarantee that
 we will not interfere with
 slavery in the States you
 have it already in the
 Constitution And one year ago
 yon rung the changes on
 the Constitution and the Union
 until the phrase became a
 byword Has the Consti tution
 changed or why have you
 lost faith in it The
 Republican party is satisfied with
 it as it is Shall
 we repeal the personal liberty
 bills You now say vou
 carc nothing about them Do
 you want more guarantees for
 the rendition of fuTi tives
 from labor Can you get
 any better guar antecs by
 going out of the Union
 than you now have in
 it fl he fugitive slave
 law was framed to satisfy
 the slave power and was
 made so heavy that it
 crushed its northern champion the
 greatest man of the age
 and carried down a President
 and the Whig party Are
 you not satisfied with such
 a feat or have you
 got your eyes on another
 crop of great men and
 a successful party whose necks
 you wish to place under
 this modern guillotine called compromise
 Several arc already on their
 backs looking up at thc
 glistening blade but they are
 unwilling to die alone so
 they beckon us on to
 share then inglorious fate It
 is urged by some that
 we should yield all the
 Territory south of 36030 to
 slavery on the ground that
 slavery cannot exist there and
 be profitable that the laws
 of nature forbid it Why
 should not slave breeding be
 as profitable in New Mexico
 as in Virginia or Maryland
 It is for breeding alone
 that they want this Territory
 as I have endeavored to
 show but if it is
 worthless why are you so
 tenacious to secure iL for
 slavery Y on say it
 is a mere abstraction for
 which we arc contending because
 slavery cannot possibly go tberö
 And yet you regard this
 abstraction of so much importance
 to you that you say
 you are willing to dissolve
 the Union and plunge the
 coun try into civil war
 to secure it If ilis
 an abstrac tion with us
 of course it must be
 an abstraction with you But
 you say you have gone
 so far in tlk seces
 Sion scheme that it would
 be humiliating to be compelled
 to retract and therefore we
 must do something if it
 is only a semblance of
 conces sion I admire thie
 coolness of lhis proposition more
 than the justice of it
 You who are for dis
 union have turned traitors to
 the Govcrnmcnt stolen the forts
 and arsenals and now you
 come to us and insist
 that we must get np
 a sham and a cheat
 in order that you may
 escape the gallows with out
 tarnishing your honor or humiliating
 your pride It is true
 the North has been condescending
 and generous towards the South
 and _l have no doubt
 will continue to be so
 longas the Union shall last
 It is natural for intelligent
 and honest communi ties to
 be more generous than just
 especially to ward the weak
 and erring Gut when criminals
 come to such a pcoplc
 and demand that their crimes
 shall be indorsed instead of
 being pardoned think it is
 rather more than they will
 consent to And although a
 few members of Congress rep
 resenting a generous people may
 be induced to stand god
 fathers to traitors and becomc
 accesso ries to treason after
 the fact I feel confident
 that their constituents will hang
 them higher on the tree
 of public scorn than Haman
 or Judas hung Let ine
 say to gentlemen of the
 border slave States if you
 would be protected by the
 Federal Government against insurrections if
 you would have slavery still
 tolerated and your firesides re
 spected if you would escape
 the torch and the assassin
 s knife I beseech you
 in all candor and frankness
 accept the aid and coöperation
 of your best friends ally
 yourselves with the North and
 let the cotton States fight
 their own battles Ac knowledge
 the rightfulness of the doctrine
 of free I dom education
 and elevation which now obtains
 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 969
 in all the free States
 disenchant yourselves of the influence
 of that which in your
 hearts you would gladly be
 rid of and the North
 wili assist you Gentlemen may
 scout the idea of emancipation
 but it is soon to
 come God and humanity have
 decreed it Empty compromises cannot
 prevent it If the slaveholders
 are honest in declaring that
 they are afraid that the
 people of the North will
 interfere with slavery and dest
 roy it altogether and that
 these fears are founded upon
 the increas ing anti s
 avery sentiment and political strength
 of the North would it
 not be well for them
 to treat chis northern power
 with consideration and would it
 not be wise to conciliate
 it I know that gentlemen
 have reason to laugh at
 this when they look upon
 the past history of northern
 political parties but can assure
 you that a new order
 of things has taken possession
 of the northern mind and
 desire to state to gen
 tlemen on both sides of
 the House that the North
 has awakened to the practical
 consideration of these issues and
 if the southern States persist
 in keeping up the present
 warfare against ihe rights of
 citizens who are compelled from
 busj ness rela tions to
 iravel South on peaceful missions
 if they insist that the
 North shall regard the Constitution
 in letter and spirit asa
 sacrcd instrumcnt and yet they
 thernselves treat it as though
 it were but so much
 blank parchment if they mob
 and hang men and women
 who are guilty of nothing
 but havin been born in
 free States if they continue
 to rob the Government to
 aid them in carrying out
 their treasonable designs they will
 soon find the whole people
 of the North becc ning
 aboli tionized and consolidated in
 one great and power ful
 party I say this not
 in a spirit of menace
 bui I desire to state
 the truth lthey have borne
 and forborne until forbearance ceases
 to bc a virtue rl
 hey have been constantly yielding
 to the demands of the
 slave power for tho sake
 of peace until neither peace
 nor justice are to be
 found And I now warn
 the South that unless it
 retracts at once from its
 treasonable operations and commences a
 system of conciliation toward the
 North it rnay make up
 its mind that slavery in
 the States will date its
 downfall from the day the
 first act of treason was
 committed and in a few
 years it wili go out
 in blood warn you not
 to take the flimsy compromises
 which some fex v gentlemen
 on this side of the
 House would offer you They
 do not represent the sentiment
 of the North the North
 will repudiate any compromise such
 as has been proposed and
 the party that makes it
 Let us look this question
 squarely in the face and
 grapple With it as it
 is Let us not In
 attempt to deceivc ourselves or
 cheat others a crisis like
 this we should be men
 do ourduty and lake the
 consequencee VvTould you cornprotnise with
 a burglar who had entered
 your house by giving him
 thc key of your safe
 w you had the means
 to put him out What
 would vou think of an
 officer who you now have
 or its full value and
 gain that which while slavery
 exists as the controlling in
 fluence of your social and
 political system you can never
 receive I need not recount
 in detail the happy effects
 of the inauguration of such
 a sys tem in the
 border St at es they
 are witnessed every day in
 the growth we dth enterprise
 peace pros perity and happiness
 of every free State in
 the country You have the
 alternative before you to adopt
 this plan or do worse
 Compromising may stave it off
 for a brief period and
 it may not If it
 does it will be like
 building a dam across a
 river raising the water to
 the top only to fall
 with all the more noise
 and force devastating the coun
 try when your compromisc dam
 shall break away Secession compromise
 and reconstruction is now the
 platform of the odds and
 ends of the latc Democratic
 party Secession to force compro
 mise compromise to disrupt and
 destroy the Re publican party
 and the reconstruction of the
 old Democratic party on its
 ruins This is a nev
 platform but is fully in
 keeping with all its plat
 forms in the past The
 Democratic party was always bold
 po sitive and radical its
 opponents have been conservative and
 timid The Demo cratic party
 has been tho engineer fearlessly
 lot on the steam while
 its opponents have been at
 the brake ready to stop
 the train at the slight
 estjostle In a new country
 like ours where almost every
 thing is yet undeveloped and
 where the masses are more
 or less impulsive and speculative
 t bold and courageous are
 bound to succeed while the
 timid will complainingly follow after
 thcm It is an instinct
 in the human race to
 admire bold ness and daring
 Mcn will sooner follow a
 hero into the ditch than
 a coward into the camp
 Hence the people have always
 rallied around the standard Of
 the Democratic party and have
 borne it on to victory
 time and again although that
 party has been too often
 in the wrong It was
 only when the more selfish
 and unscrupulous attempted to perpetuate
 and extend a wrong by
 unlawful and unconstitutional means that
 a division of the and
 consequently a loss of party
 was caused It has had
 the shrewdness to keep its
 op power ponents always on
 the defensive While I would
 commend the political sagacity and
 pluck of that party I
 would save this young champion
 of free dom and true
 Democracy the Republican party from
 internal dissensions and dissolution I
 would save the honor of
 the free States from a
 disgrace so humiliating as would
 be involved in the cowardly
 surrender of the great principles
 for which they have so
 valiantly contended and hon orably
 won A nd before this
 scheme of barteri1V away a
 nation s hope to appease
 the wrath of a them
 on the auction block to
 bedriVbn tothe rice and cotton
 fields there to be worn
 out in a few years
 like things You vote to
 compromise with a power that
 regards neither nor the Constitution
 You vote for the perpetuity
 of ignorance and you vote
 for the overthrow Of the
 freedöm of speech and of
 the press You lose the
 respect of the friends of
 freedom Y tl gain the
 contempt of the slave påwer
 and the applause of hell
 You say to all traitors
 go on with your robbery
 and treason hereafter they shall
 be rea spectable and at
 a premium Whenever you are
 beaten at the ballot box
 you have only to steal
 the public property and declare
 war against the Gov ernment
 and we will makc concessions
 oven to the sacrifice of
 our dearest principles and break
 the power that defeated you
 if you will be quiet
 and remain in the Union
 Mr Speaker this is probably
 my last appeal on this
 floor I should be willing
 to do anything that might
 lead to the restoratiåh of
 national tran quillity and social
 harmony which woü ld not
 com promise the honor and
 dignity of the nation but
 1 fail to discover in
 any proposition now before the
 House anything that will lead
 to those re suits And
 before I would leave a
 word fr a vote on
 record that miffht be construed
 into favor ing thecxtension or
 perpetuity ofslavery I would perish
 on the steps of my
 country s Capitol or be
 lost in the general wreck
 that would follow revo If
 I thought the preservation of
 the Union lution would be
 the means of furnishing fetters
 for those who are yet
 to be born on soil
 now free l would be
 the first to break the
 chain that has so long
 bound us together and let
 the slave States swing out
 from the protection of tho
 national Govern ment to contend
 alone awainst servile insurrec tion
 famine and civil war But
 sir I trust and believe
 that no such calamity will
 befall the hope ful and
 prosperous millions ofthe American States
 and when this crisis shall
 have passed away and the
 dark horizon shall be lighted
 up with the rain bow
 of hope peace new g16ries
 and a happy fu ture
 the people will decide who
 were right those who would
 strike hands with wrong or
 those who would subdue it
 and Ict universal liberty have
 free course and be glorified
 Let us have lib erty
 and Union if we can
 but liberty without Union rather
 than Union without liberty The
 country will occasionally receive the
 assaults Of traitors and the
 shocks of political earthquakes Popular
 outbreaks will disturb the harmony
 of society and whirl vinds
 will plow through party organizations
 as they do through the
 forests of our vast domain
 breaking down the old decayed
 trees and testing the strength
 of the young and vigorous

 have cleared away we shall

 Arined rebellion rears its head

 Revolted States defy the Federal

 Sir isit not strancre indeed
 that there can be found
 not simply individual Instances of
 non submission to law which
 may always be looked for
 but large portions of the
 intelligent people of this country
 extending indeed to whole States
 and sections who are willing
 to overthrow the Government rather
 than yield to the will
 of majorities a Government whose
 very founda tion is the
 sovreignty of the people created
 by their own voluntary associa90n
 the result of their own
 free choicc containin no powers
 but such as the people
 freely delegated and havilV no
 strength but such as their
 willing allegiance con fers which
 extends its protection over all
 alike and showers its benefits
 and its blessinos upon every
 class We have ever felt
 a just pride in thc
 harmonious working of our elective
 system and often after our
 most exciting contests have we
 bid the _ strong Governments
 of the Old World not
 thus in conflict and only
 such as are neces saty
 to protect the liberty of
 the humblest citizen I in
 111 y judgment they ought
 never to be repealed come
 what may But sir admitting
 that such laws exist that
 they are unconstitutional and that
 they were in tended to
 obstruct the operation of the
 fugitive slave law can their
 existence to any extent be
 regarded as justifying this rebellion
 It will not be denied
 that revolution is the ultimate
 right of every people when
 the oppression of their Gov
 ernment shall become too intolerable
 to be borne never to
 be resorted to however till
 every peace able remedy has
 been exhaåsted As to this
 ex tent it is better
 to bear the ills we
 have Than fly to others
 that we know not of
 What then has been the
 practical effect of these laws
 and what practical injury has
 resulted from them to our
 southern brethren The President tehs
 you in lus annual message
 that in every in Nance
 during his Administration the fugitive
 slave law has been fully
 executed and so we believe
 i has it always been
 when attempted Never then has
 it been obstructed by these
 enactments what ever may be
 their character whatever their de
 behold how peaceably and quietly
 all the people I sign
 No slaveowner has ever been
 deprived of i The first
 resolution in my judgment declares
 the true doctrine of the
 Constitution The idea of property
 in man is carefully excluded
 from that It nowhere recoonizes
 the righffül instrument ness of
 slavery It affords it no
 ouarantees found slavery existing in
 many of the States by
 It simply recog their local
 customs and laws nized its
 existence there and let it
 alone each State of course
 having the right to regulate
 it in its own way
 but having no right to
 eitend those customs and laws
 beyond their own State lirnits
 and impose them upon others
 And it is equally clear
 that no authority whatever exists
 outside of said States to
 interfere with it in the
 least And this obligation of
 non interference should be strictly
 observed by the Fcdefal Government
 and by all the citizens
 And although there is little
 or no evidence of any
 attempt ever having been made
 in any free State to
 set on foot any lawless
 invasion of any slaveholding State
 yet as there is apprehension
 felt on this subject in
 consequence of the recent unlawful
 proceeÜings of John Brown and
 his associates in the State
 of Virginia and as there
 is the hitThest evidence of
 lawless invasions having been set
 on foot in one of
 thc border States to violate
 the laws and to trample
 upon the rights of the
 people of an adjacent Territory
 I most cor dially unite
 in requesting the States to
 enact such laws as shall
 effectually prevent any such wrong
 in the future In every
 free Government it is necessary
 to its success that there
 should be voluntary and strict
 acquiesced in the dectsion of
 the majority as cx pressed
 through the ballot box But
 our pride humbled For the
 first time since the organi
 zation of our Government the
 will of the major ity
 constitutionally expressed is resisted and
 we awake at last as
 from a dream to find
 it may be that our
 experimeut is a failure I
 will consider the main causes
 assigned in jus tification of
 this rebellion and the remedies
 pro posed Many are the
 grievances allerrcd by those who
 justify and by those who
 will only apologize for it
 Some of them are so
 indefinite and others so frivolous
 that I cannot stop now
 to notice then r but
 will consider only those which
 in the esti mation of
 tho committee of thirty three
 are of suf ficient importance
 to require spe cific remedies
 And first certain legislative enactments
 of the free States commonly
 spoken of in these allegations
 it is undoubtedly as personai
 liberty bills truc sir that
 in many perhaps most of
 the free Slates there are
 laws upon the statute books
 of the class named some
 of many years standing and
 enacted without reference to more
 recent events for the prcvcntion
 of kidnapping Others of more
 recent date to protect the
 libertics of such residents as
 were more especially exposed by
 the I have not operation
 of the fugitive slave law
 examined all these laws Some
 of them of which complaint
 is made know are not
 unconstitu tional If any of
 them are they ought undoubt
 edly to be repealed or
 modified as ought all laws
 in all States that are
 in conflict either in letter
 or spirit directly or indirectly
 with the Constitution of the
 United States or any law
 of Congress made in pursuance
 thereof And this not on
 the ground and for the
 reason that Congress has modified
 or will modify the more
 obnoxious provisions of an obnoxious
 law on accountof which some
 of them may have been
 enacted but simply bec ause
 the legislation of a State
 should never bc in conflict
 with the Constitution and laws
 of Congress And I have
 rio doubt sir that the
 Lcgislature of thosc States which
 may haye this class of
 laws upon their statute books
 will for the purpose of
 satisfying their brethren of the
 South of their dise position
 to deal justly with them
 and for the pur pose
 of being clearly in the
 right before they enter upon
 this great conflict which may
 be approach incr revise their
 legislation in this respect and
 if they find it thus
 conflicting with the Constitution or
 laws will modify or repeal
 it And though I do
 not recognize it as strictly
 within the province of Congress
 to make requests of the
 Sta te Legis latures in
 regard to what shall be
 their legislation in a matter
 of this kind and though
 I do not like his
 property by means of them
 But again they be unconstitutional
 or if they conflict with
 any law of Congress passed
 in pursuance of the the
 Constitution they are void and
 would be de clared so
 by all proper judicial tribunals
 when i properly brought before
 them inasmuch as the obedience
 to law And the people
 of every State II should
 see to it that all
 laws made in pursuance Constit
 ution and the laws made
 in pursuance thereof are the
 supreme law of the land
 i of the Constitution be
 fully cxecuted and should the
 existence of any such iaws
 is a If then punish
 with promptitude every attempt to
 pre grievance has this easy
 peaceable and constitu vent it
 And it should be remembered
 that it is tiona remedy
 been resorted to And can
 a resort to the ultimate
 right of revolution be just
 ified Can there even be
 an apology for il till
 this has been done Again
 sir though there may be
 such laws upon the statute
 book Chougln they may be
 unconsti tutional though they may
 be in conflict with the
 said law of Congress though
 they do impede and obstruct
 its operation still they do
 not practically injure the Gulf
 States who have instigated and
 led off in this rebellion
 The border States are those
 who have most reason and
 who only have reason to
 complain of them if they
 are really what they are
 alleced to be But they
 have not complained and would
 not on this account have
 piunged into I this wicked
 rebellion or at least until
 they had ex i haust
 ed all peaceable remedies and
 will not now unless whirled
 on by the tide that
 follows the mad precipitancy of
 South Carolina Bat sir I
 repeat whether a just cause
 or not let the legislation
 be revised and if wrong
 let it be made right
 Next follow in the committee
 s report a series of
 declaratory resolutions embracing many mat
 I ters of complaint and
 many matters of dispute between
 the two sections to every
 one of which I give
 my hearty assent They are
 as follow I Resolved I
 hat we recognize slavery as
 now existing not for one
 section only to regard its
 constitu t ional obligations while
 another may entirely dis regard
 them And if it be
 claime d on one part
 that the Constitution and all
 laws made in pur suance
 thereof shall be strictly observed
 touching the rendition of their
 human chattels how much more
 ought they freely to yield
 a strict observ ance of
 their own constitutional obligations to
 af ford the same protection
 to citizens of free States
 temporarily within their limits as
 they afford 10 citizens of
 their own State Sir I
 do not wish to enter
 upon a course of crimination
 but it ought to be
 said that while our southern
 brethren com plain of us
 so persistently because as they
 say we fail to observe
 in good faith our constitutional
 oblieations in this onc respect
 they seem entirely to forget
 that wye have any cause
 of complaint against them They
 know full well that any
 of their people can travel
 or sojourn with entire safety
 in our midst no matter
 what may be their opin
 ions and that they will
 meet with no indignities anywhere
 They know that our courts
 are freely opened to them
 for a redress of all
 grievances and that they are
 as sure of justice therein
 as are our own citizens
 They know that their most
 extreme men can enter with
 freedom our forums and in
 entire security command respectful atten
 in fifteen of the United
 States by the usages and
 laws tion to their advocacy
 of the most extreme opin
 those States and we recotynize
 no authority legally or otit

 know sir that our peaceable
 and with slaves or slavery

 of the unoffending citizens while

 Is not the right of

 high aright as protection to

 be destroyed be cause citizens
 of slave States are sometimes
 wronff fully deprived of their
 property by citizens of free
 States and shall no complaint
 be heard when to us
 the freedom of the courts
 the freedom of the elective

 and the freedom of conscience
 are all stricken down and
 when our own unof fending
 citizens of both sexes and
 of all ages are insulted
 tarred and feathered imprisoned robbed
 scourged and in many instances

 irresponsiblc moVs But sir I
 will not pursue this further
 I say sir with the
 committee let there be a
 faithful observance on the part
 of all the States and
 of ail the citi zens
 thereof of all their constitutional
 obligations to each other and
 to the Federal Goverrrment and
 let such necessary laws be
 enacted as will carry out
 that provision of tbe Constit
 ution which de chares that
 the citizens of each State
 shall be en titled to
 all the privileges and immunities
 of citi zens in the
 several States and much will
 have been done towards restoring
 peace and harmony to our
 distracted country Resolved That it
 is the duty of the
 Federat Govern ment to enforce
 thc Federal laws protect the
 Federal prop erty and preserve
 the Union of these States
 Sir does this resolution of
 the committee con tain any
 startling proposition Yet the support
 of any measure that looks
 to the enforcement of your
 laws against those who have
 violated and who defy them
 or to the protection of
 our Fed eral property against
 those rebel bands that would
 seize it is denounced as
 a wanton act of war
 as high handed oppression A
 Statc revolts and de fies
 your power seizes your arsenals
 navy yards and forts pulls
 down your flag and turns
 your own Yuns upon your
 own vessel conveying your own
 soldiers to reinforce your own
 fortress and over whose deck
 wave the stars and stripes
 her colors are lowered and
 the vessel retires ay sir
 that flag which has proudly
 waved over so many victorious
 battle fields that flag under
 which your brave seamen fought
 on Erie and Champlain and
 which wherever it has floated
 at mast head as your
 commerce has pushed itself into
 every sea and into the
 remote corners of the ocean
 has commanded respect that flag
 which in the presence of
 the hauaht y power of
 Austria could in the name
 of the American Government demand
 and secure protection to a
 humble Amer ican citizen dare
 not throw its fblds to
 thc breeze in the presence
 of the palmetto and the
 rattle snake Secret bands are
 arming all around this national
 city threatening to seize the
 very Capi tol in which
 we deliberate and we may
 take no steps to defend
 it Sir I am for
 the resolution I will now
 consider the resolution of the
 com mittee which proposes an
 amendment oftbe Con stitution providing
 that no amendment shall here
 after be made ant horizing
 äny interference with slavery in
 the States unless it shall
 originate in a slave State
 and have the assent of
 every State I regret very
 much that the com in
 the Union mittee felt it
 to be their duty to
 recommend this resolution because from
 the very fact of its
 being rejected if such shall
 be its fate I fear
 it will be inferred that
 we design at some time
 in the future t6 effect
 the very amendment which this
 would provide against whereas no
 such expectation or wish exists
 in any quarter No one
 claims that the Constitution as
 it now is gives any
 right to Congress or to
 anybody outside to interfere with
 slavery in the States and
 no one it seems appre
 hends that anv such attempt
 will be made by Congress
 But it is said to
 be apprehended that in the
 future when the preponderance of
 free States by the vote
 of two thirds of both
 Houses of Con gress or
 Congress upon request of the
 Legis latures of two thirds
 of the States may call
 a con vention to propose
 amendments So that even to
 propose amendments supposing the fiftecn
 slave States to be against
 any proposition of this kind
 and the free States all
 for it would require thirty
 free States We have now
 nineteen it re quiring eleven
 more even to propose an
 amend ment But before any
 amendment can be valid as
 a part of the Constitution
 it must be approved by
 three fourths of the States
 either through their Legislatures or
 conventions therefore upon the same
 supposition it would require forty
 five free States twenty six
 more than we now have
 Where are we to get
 them Certainly not from any
 territory we now have and
 as certainly not Is not
 then from any we are
 likely to acquire this apprehended
 danger altogether too remote and
 altogether too improbable to be
 reasonable cause foralarm to ourslaveholding
 brethren And is not this
 alleged apprehension altogether too frivolous
 to be regarded at all
 and much more to require
 an amendment of the Constitution
 in the manner proposed But
 you say you have no
 fears of this your selves
 that you have no idea
 the Republican party proposes or
 will attempt now or in
 the fu lure to interfere
 with slavery in the States
 but Chat you cannot make
 your people understand it Why
 not Cannot your people understand
 so simple a calculation as
 that ust stated Have you
 not yourselyes created tl is
 fear and appre hcnsion in
 their minds as to the
 designs of your political opponents
 And if you are now
 satisfied i that you have
 rnisrepresented us can you not
 tell them so and Ihat
 they are in no such
 danger from us And will
 they not believe you as
 readily as 11 I think
 you had better try the
 experi before ment at least
 before you demand of us
 to alter this old Constitution
 in order to relieve you
 cannot consent sir to meddle
 with this sacred instrument in
 a case where there is
 confessedly no practical necessity for
 it but only to quiet
 a o roundless apprehension existii
 g with a portion of
 the people Let the danger
 if it shall ever arise
 approach nearer before you ask
 it And Ict those whose
 duty it shall then be
 to dccide it act in
 the nearer view and in
 that day s accumulated light
 I approach now sir that
 subject embraced in thc report
 which I regard as more
 important than any other nerhaps
 more than all others and
 more diffcuft of adjustment the
 disposition ot the I erritorics
 as to this question of
 slavery And I will leave
 for a moment the propositions
 of the committee and consider
 in this connection another proposition
 on which we will be
 called I mean the Crittenden

 republican be adm itted into
 Union on an equal footin
 v with the original States
 with or ivithout slavery as
 the constitution of such new
 State may provide I have
 read sir only the proposition
 relating mained as such to
 this dayhad it been left
 undie turbed It was approved
 by the wiseæmenof that day
 wiser and greater men than
 we have sn_DV All the
 territory north of the line
 was given to freedom to
 be hers forever Those who
 Were anxious to promote the
 extension of free instaw tions
 stood by that compromise ingood
 faith But when slavery had
 gathered to itself all south
 of the line it reached
 forth to grasp that which
 was north The idea of
 a geographical line between freedom
 and slavery was ridiculed and
 th e pro hibition was
 denounced as unconstitutional and unjust
 to the South And in
 the midst of intense excitement
 they procured its repeal But
 this was not enough To
 guard against any future restora
 tion ofthe line they procured
 a decision ofthe high est
 judicial tribunal in the land
 in direct conflict with the
 whole tenor of decisions in
 all the courts and with
 the opinions of the wisest
 statesmen from the foundation of
 the Government confirm ing their
 action and declaring such prohibition
 to be unconstitutional and void
 And now having lost the
 prize at which they grasped
 havinglOSt rather t han gained
 by their bad faith seeing
 that the new polfcy did
 not work to their advantage
 and wishing now to gain
 some new concessions and guarantees
 as to territory south of
 this line by seeming to
 grant something to freedom north
 in prohibiting slavery in territory
 which is now free and
 which will always remain free
 as well without the prohibition
 as with and finding now
 this Supreme Court decision an
 obstacle In the way of
 this nice arrangement they propose
 to relieve themselves from the
 diffculty in which this decision
 has brought them by an
 amendment of the Constitution Sir
 I will none of it
 not touch that instrument for
 any such purpose If they
 wish to have this legislation
 which so short a time
 since they did not want
 let them go and procure
 a reversal of that decision
 as I have no doubt
 they can if they wish
 it Expunge that bad page
 in our judicial records and
 let the Con stitution stand
 as our fathers made it
 with the interpretation that our
 fathers put upon it Butagain
 to secure all you really
 wish to secure by this
 legislation you do not need
 this amend ment What you
 really wish is to secure
 slavery south of that line
 you need no constitutional amendment
 for that for you say
 the Constitution already recognizes slavery
 as existing in the Ter
 ritories and you say the
 Supreme Court has so decided
 and that it bas also
 said Congress cannot interfere With
 it And the only remaining
 thing you want is a
 congressional code protecting sla very
 in the Territories You need
 no constitu tionul amendment therefore
 to accomplish this Ilbe court
 has not decided that Congress
 has no power to give
 you a slave code Ail
 you vvant of the tunendment
 is to get around your
 Dred Scott decision so you
 may extend to us the
 great priv ilege of having
 slavery prohibited in the Térri
 tories north of 360 30
 We know and you know
 that all the territory north
 of said line is free
 now and that it will
 always remain so You know
 that by the admission of
 Kansas as a free State
 and with the tide of
 emigration pouring into Pike s
 Peak and with frcc California
 on the west your last
 hope of fastening slavery upon
 any of that territory is
 gone And if you did
 not know this you would
 not propose this amendment How
 idle then to amend the
 Constitution for this pur pose
 We do not ask it
 We know that free in
 If then you are slitutions
 gain nothing bv it to
 have this guarantee ana protection
 to slavery south let it
 be without any amendment of
 the to this particular subject
 There are others of Constitution
 granting to usa seeming equivalent
 which amounts to nothing I
 would sooner vote which I
 may speak if time permits
 seen that it proposes to
 amend the Constitution so you
 a con yrcssional slave code
 than vote for this as
 to prohibit slavery north of
 the line 360 30 amendment
 What you propose in this
 amend ment as to territory
 south of 360 30 is
 in sub known as the
 Missouri compromise line And stance
 identical with the Breckinridge platform
 in this pact it is
 in the same terms as
 the Missouri It recognizes slavery
 as existing prohibits Con prohibition
 And as to all the
 territory we now hold or
 may hereafter acquire south of
 that line gress from interfering
 with it and commands the
 over the slave States shall
 be great enough the Constitution
 will be so atnended as
 to give Con which wi

 hereafter acquire territorial government to

 I from Mexico Central America

 argument of the dis America

 then can unfounded t hat

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February 16 have
 been struggling to restore the
 early policy of code and
 is a slaveholding Territory Whether
 the Government prohibiting the introduction
 of if she were tq
 adopt a constitution preparatory to
 slavery into the Territories and
 after many de admission into
 the Union durinrr the present
 year feats they have at
 last triumphed at the polls
 she would make it free
 or slave there to be
 And now in the very
 hour of th eir victory
 it is demanded that their
 colors shall be hauled down
 their flag surrendered and they
 are not only re quired
 to give up their policy
 of prohibition but to grant
 a constitutional recognition and protec
 tion to slavery in all
 our present El erritories and
 in all we may acquire
 hereafter The terms of peace
 are an unconditiönal surrender that
 we shall pass directly from
 the position we have so
 long occupied on to the
 platform of the secession ists
 We may not even halt
 at the quarters of the
 popular sovereigns they being expected
 to join us as we
 pass in the grand procession
 And what is to be
 conceded to us for this
 great humiliation A prohibition of
 slavery where it is already
 shut out forever And this
 is called compromise The ad
 vocates ofpopular sovereign fy trium
 phed over the secessionists at
 Charleston in April and I
 at Baltimore in June and
 both they and we by
 a more decisive victory at
 the polls in November And
 now we are all required
 to surrender at dis cretion
 in Washington If the secessionists
 had succeeded at Charleston their
 poficy would have been triumphant
 in the Democratic party If
 they had succeeded in November
 at the polls their pol
 icy would still have been
 triumphant with the people but
 failing in both they yet
 triumph all the same by
 the surrender of both opposing
 forces If this can be
 so elections amount to little
 They determine no policy of
 Government they only change offcials
 The one million eight hundred
 thousand voters for Lincoln the
 one million three hundred thousand
 voters for Douglas to say
 noth ing of the six
 hundred thousand voters for Bell
 all are demanded to lay
 down their arms to the
 eight hundred and fifty thousand
 voters for Breck inridge This
 Crittenden proposition also contains amendments
 to the Constitution prohibiting Con
 gress from abolishing slavery in
 the District of Columbia and
 the places under its exclusi
 vejuris diction within the slave
 States and prohibiting also all
 interference with transportation of slaves
 from one slave State to
 another On this subject the
 committee well say that as
 there are no prop ositions
 from any quarter to interfere
 in any of these respects
 they do not deem it
 necessary to take any action
 on the subject Sir can
 consent to no amendment of
 the Con stitution affording new
 and addit ional guarantees to
 slavery I would observe faithfully
 ail our ob ligations under
 the Constitution as it IS
 and carry out all its
 guarantees to the full extent
 but no more Let this
 old Constitution remain as our
 athers made it It is
 suffcient It has brought us
 from infancy to our present
 mature strength Under it we
 have prospered as no nation
 ever prospered before Under it
 we have lived in unity
 and peace We can continue
 to live on and to
 doubt But is New Mexico
 in proper condition to be
 admitted into the Union as
 an independent State It seems
 to me not The information
 we have as to her
 population is quite limited and
 nn satisfactory Exclusive of roving
 Indians I sup pose her
 population falls much short of
 the num ber requisite to
 entitle her to admission and
 that is made up of
 a few thousand Americans a
 few thousand Mexicans and the
 balance of mixed bloods and
 peons The standard of general
 intel ligence and education is
 extremely low and the people
 ofa character to be easily
 influenced by de signing men
 Sho would scarcely be able
 to sup port a State
 to conduct its affairs Is
 it expedient to admit such
 elements into our Confederacy of
 independent States She does not
 ask to be admitted and
 would undoubtedly be better in
 a territorial condition where she
 will be I striction the
 question as to all the
 Territories north of New Mexico
 being practically settl l and
 that being only in dispute
 ve may well leave it
 where the compromise measures of
 1850 loft it I have
 thus briefly dwelt n all
 the propositions reported by the
 committee of which I care
 to speak as well as
 those by the distinguished Senator
 from Kentucky There are various
 other propositions somewhat different in
 form but substantially the I
 cannot perceive any real necessity
 for same them nor any
 occasion for this great excitement
 on the part of our
 southern breth ten These nu
 merous schemes of compromise only
 increase the diffculty and complicate
 the entanglement Our Government will
 go on smoothly enough if
 we will onlyeperrnit it and
 if we will stand by
 it as patriots ought to
 do The will of the
 people has just been expressed
 through the ballot box and
 all good will acquiesce in
 their decision It IS not
 the time now to compromise
 it would weaken arid demoralize
 the Government The incoming Administration
 should enter upon its duties
 without being subjected to any
 other con ditions or terms
 than Vhat the Constitution im
 poses upon all It a
 portion of the people in
 armed rebellion can impose any
 other tfq ms your Government
 isa delusion and your elective
 franchise a sham In maiutaining
 the supremacy of majorities within
 constitutional limits equally interested It
 is for no political party
 but for the security of
 all To day thc majority
 entitled to the support and
 fostering care of the General
 Government And is it not
 best for us that she
 should thus remain for a
 time longer If New Mexico
 remains in territorial condition she
 will remain a part of
 our dominion If we admit
 her as an independent Statc
 according to modern theories she
 may assert het own sover
 eignty and join a southern
 confederacy or rean nex herself
 to Mexico for it seems
 to be conceded that the
 Federal Government may control even
 coerce a Territory but if
 we dignify one into the
 position of a State it
 may then go where it
 pleases and when it pleases
 To day asa Territory we
 may control her to morrow
 as a State we may
 lose her I suppose that
 if the proposition to ad
 mit New Mexico had been
 made at the last ses
 Sion of Congress not one
 voice would have been given
 in its favor Why then
 now Simply be cause we
 do not know how or
 cannot agree how to manage
 her out I am not
 willing to crowd her into
 the Union in this way
 and for such rea sons
 I am not willing to
 use these Territories as mere
 shuttlecocks to be thrown about
 as instru ments of compromise
 Let us not confess our
 weakness by hurrying Territories in
 as States be fore they
 are fit to come in
 simply because we cannot agree
 how to dispose of them
 while out But sir notwithstanding
 ail these objections this proposition
 is to mc the least
 objectionable of all I confess
 the inducement wouldVbc very strong
 to admit New Mexico as
 a State if it would
 be ac cepted as a
 settlement of this territorial question
 But as this proposition is
 rejected by all whom it
 is necessary to conciliate it
 might perhaps as well be
 laid aside After au what
 does all this clamor about
 inequality in the Territories mean
 Have you not equal rights
 in them now If not
 where IS the inequality Do
 you wish to go into
 Ne braska with your slaves
 Do you wish to go
 into Washington Territory into Utah
 into Colorado or Pike s
 Peak Go on then by
 all means W I lat
 prosper in the future as
 we have in the past
 if we i hinders You
 do not claim that thc
 Constitution will but be faithful
 to our duties and dcvotcd
 to II hinders you You
 do not need it to
 be amended our Government No
 sir Ict us not in
 this hour then for that
 There is no law of
 Congress pre of excitement attempt
 to tamper with it In
 this venting you and no
 one proposes any such The
 at least let us have
 something of permanency Supreme Court
 says you may go What
 more something of security Though
 our political plat then do
 you want But you will
 confess that you forms may
 change as often as may
 suit the pur do not
 desire that you do not
 expect to go there poses
 of aspiring dcmaøo ues though
 your con i Then you
 will not quarrel about anv
 of them gressional legislation be
 vacillating contradictory Do you wish
 then to go into New
 Mexico and absurd as the
 supposed necessities of com say
 again go on YVhat hinders
 There is no promise may
 require let the Constitution remain
 l law of Congress to
 prevent you from going there
 Let its grand proportions rise
 above the troubled and if
 there ever should be which
 is not proba waters unmoved
 and unharmed by the angry
 ble you know the court
 would declare it void I
 waves that dash against it
 Sir if this people be
 and you have there a
 slave code to protect your
 not struck with judicial blindness
 they will now i slave
 property This Territory has been
 open in this day of
 peril cling to this Constitution
 as I to you without
 any obstruction for eleven years
 the wrecked mariner clings to
 the last plank when and
 you have 0t one dozen
 slaves there these night and
 the tempest gather around him
 being mostly servants of Government
 officers I return to the
 report of the committee Asa
 ask once Inore what are
 your quarrelings about i solution
 of this territorial question they
 propose Is it about your
 rights in Territories we do
 not to admit New Mexico
 as a State into the
 Union yet own and may
 never own And are you
 about as soon as she
 shyll form a constitution prepara
 to destroy this Government for
 such a cause Sir I
 tory thereto thus as they
 say removing all cause wc
 need no compromise We have
 nothing really of diffcultyas to
 the disposition of the Territories
 ii to settle If wo
 will bo but reasonable and
 practi as this includes all
 territory south of 360 30
 and cal we can comp
 to peace at once all
 in regard to which there
 is any doubt as to
 But what shall be done
 with the Territories as slavery
 it being well understood that
 as to all to this
 question of slaverv Ia_nswer leave
 them north of this the
 question is practically settled where
 the legislation of i850 left
 them Kansas no one having
 any doubts or anxiety in
 regard being now admitted a
 free State into the Union
 and free institutions having regained
 thereby all New Mexico has
 nowa few slaves anda slave
 that they lost by the
 repeal of the Missouri re
 is with us four years
 hence it may be against
 us YVith whomsoever it is
 it must be sustained or
 anarchy prevails Let those then
 M ho love our Government
 and our Union and would
 preserve them both stand by
 and support them without condition
 or qualification Mr Speaker I
 would not shat my eyes
 to the dangers that surround
 us We are in the
 midst of great peril Our
 system of Government is in
 severe trial It is passing
 a decisive crisis only a
 firm hand and steady nerve
 can carry it through in
 safety No compromising policy can
 save it Its moral power
 must be maintained The will
 of the people nuust be
 obeyed Can it be sir
 t between the two sections
 of this Confederacy be cause
 of our differences as to
 the rights of sltwery in
 thc Territories One seeking to
 extend it into free territory
 and demanding congressional pro tection
 thereto and the other resisting
 this de mand how would
 the parties stand before the
 world in such a contest
 Let the great statesman Senate
 in 1850 on the compromise
 resolutions introduced by him he
 said But if unhappily we
 shoa d be involved in
 war in civil war between
 the two parts of this
 Confederacy in introduction ot slavery
 into the new rrerrit ories
 and upon the other side
 to fin ce its introduction
 there what a spec tacle
 should we present to the
 astonishinellt of mankind in an
 effort not to propagate rights
 but I must say it
 though I trust it will
 be understood to be said
 xvith no design to excite
 feeling a war to propagate
 wrongs in lhe Territo ries
 thus acquired f rcjm Mexico
 It would be a war
 in which we should have
 no syanpathies no good wishes
 in which ail Inankind would
 bc against us in which
 ow_n tot itself svould be
 against us for t orn
 the cornxnence ment of the
 Revolution down to the present
 tizno we have constantly reproached
 our British ancestors tbr the
 intro duction ot slavery into
 this country N lr Speaker
 what a spectacle do we
 present to the world How
 humiliating and discouracrinm our presentcondition
 Everywhere else the march is
 onward and while the whole
 firmament is illu mined with
 the gathering rays ofa h
 igher and an civilization sprinøincr
 up from all ua tions
 here where they should center
 in their intensest brilliancy the
 light fades the clouds gather
 A y at the commencement
 of this very year through
 the benign decree of the
 Russian Emperor millions of his
 people cast off their cen
 tury worn garments of servitude
 and clothed themselves in the
 habiliments of freemen And too
 the haughty Government of Austria
 in its age and decrepitude
 yields something of its pre
 rocratives to the spirit of
 thc age whi e in
 Italy that land of glorious
 memories the people emcrcr ing
 from their long night ot
 despotism roll from their bowed
 shoulders the burden of centuries
 and assume their true position
 among the peoples of the
 earth While in other lands
 wise rylen states men and
 heroes are lendirjg theirenergies devot
 ing their lives and freely
 baring their bosoms to the
 storm of battle to secure
 to the people insti tutions
 somewhat more fully recognizing their
 inalienable rights here traitorous arms
 are fast locked around the
 pillars of this fairest temple
 madly bent on its overthrow
 Sir I know not what
 the teemirw womb of the
 future may have in store
 for us I know not
 what dire calamities may be
 about to be revealed to
 us from the thick cloud
 beyond the vail that is
 lifting Bat if it be
 so that this great work
 of our fathers is to
 be destroyed and the destruction
 thereof is to be so
 great that _there shall not
 be left one stone upon
 another that shall not be
 thrown down let it be
 recorded so that it may
 be read by all the
 generations of tbc comino centuries
 that this great calamity has
 been brought upon us because
 our free people would not
 consent to grant now constitutional
 guarantees to a system of
 hu man bondage Mr WALDRON
 Mr Speaker the topics of
 this discussionare novel and strange
 to an American Congress They
 are such as were neverdreamedof
 by the patriots and statesmen
 who framed ourGov ernment They
 are such as their children
 in the confidence which long
 years of peaceful security have
 imparted believed to be impossible
 But the delusions of the
 past I might almost add
 the hopes of the future
 varlish into thin air A
 Union established by sacrifices and
 hailowed by imper ishable memories
 trembles in the agonies of
 dis solution llhe spectacle of
 to day isoneofdisloyal States of
 revolted people of a divided
 nation ality You may call
 this secession call it conspiracy
 ripened into revolution But it
 is not my purpose to
 quarrel about terms nor will
 I stop to refer to
 the causes which have brought
 I have not risen to
 indulge these evils upon us
 in the lancruage of crimination
 or cmnplaint It is entirely
 foreign to my present purpose
 to inquire which political party
 is responsible for the perils
 a THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBL 1861
 advance of any efforts to
 reconcile and compro have closed
 the door of reconciliation they
 de 979 less by the
 concessions you make in the
 effort to preserve it You
 incorporate into its system a
 poison which not only mars
 its beauty but de stroyg
 its vitality for good The
 very principle on which this
 policy of compromise rests is
 that the will of a
 maiorit_y constitutionally expressed I shall
 be nullified at the pleasure
 of a dissatisfied minority and
 to that principle I never
 will con I sent The
 freemen of the Unitöd States
 have under the forms of
 law for the nineteenth time
 elected a President and it
 is useless to disguise the
 fact that his authority is
 denied in advance unless the
 defeated party is allowed to
 dictate the policy of his
 administration The verdict that was
 involved in his election is
 to be ignored as the
 price of acquiescence on the
 part of the van quished
 In the last canvass a
 portion of our fellow citizens
 demanded at the hand of
 the Fed eral Government protection
 for slavery in the Territories
 of the Republic and the
 demand was resisted even to
 the disruption of the Democratic
 party a party which never
 bet ore hesitated when demands
 were made upon it in
 behalf of the slave power
 That deinand was so objectionable
 that the larger fraction of
 the party threw away its
 votes on a candidate x
 vho had no chance for
 success rather than indorse the
 doctrines of the supporters of
 Mr Breckinridge The issue was
 fåirly can vassed before the
 people Three million freemen by
 voting for Mr Lincoln or
 Mr Douglas repu dialed and
 discarded the doctrine of congressional
 protection for slave property eight
 hundred thou sand who voted
 for Mr Breckinridge indorsed and
 now the thrcc million are
 asked by com it promise
 to surrender their convictions and
 judg ment to the eight
 hundred thousand Sir if this
 Union can only be preserved
 by concessions of principle from
 majorites to minorities then it
 is If we are to
 recoo a Union not worth
 presecvioo nize the doctrine that
 a minority may demand amendments
 or congressional legislation A And
 where loyalty is in the
 market I like ihe gentle
 man from New York Mr
 CONRLING do not want the
 Government to be a bidder
 oreovep we after all treat
 with the Gulf States through
 the mediation of the border
 States The Legis latures of
 North Carolina Virginia and CKen
 tuck y declare that they
 must have new guaran tees
 for slavery for the purpose
 of insuringtheir own allegiance and
 in the hope that anovement
 will be inaugurated which wiH
 bring back the seceded States
 Moreover these border States announce
 to us in advance that
 no force must be used
 by the General Government to
 collect Ixits revenue or maintain
 its authority in tho revolted
 States When the hour comes
 in which the strength of
 this Government is to be
 tried then we are told
 that the common interests of
 the slave States lead to
 a bommon cause and a
 common destiny I am asked
 to join in a declaration
 that the Re publican party
 meditates no invasion of the
 rights of sovereign States and
 that it especially con templates
 no interference with the relation
 of mas ter and slave
 where the relation oxists under
 the sanction of State laws
 I am told that a
 declara tion of that nature
 will do much to disabuse
 the public mind in the
 southern States and that it
 will be an effective agency
 in the work of concilia
 tion Sir if an impression
 of that nature prevails in
 any part of the Republic
 it is because men are
 unable or unwilling to examine
 the creed which the Republican
 party has avowed to the
 world If any man to
 day labors under the delusion
 that the Republican party meditates
 interference with slavery in the
 States it is because that
 man has believed the slanders
 of its enemies in preference
 to the statements of its
 friends and it best be
 comes the men who have
 circulated falsehoods for partisan ends
 now to retract them if
 the wel which surround us
 T be people have already
 terms and obtain them as
 the condition of their fare
 of a common country is
 hazarded by their visit bd
 the sins of out political
 opponents upon their heads and
 with their verdict I am
 conterlt Other matters press upon
 our attention The fair fame
 of our Government is tarnished
 its flag de fied its
 property desöoiied its reputation among
 foreign nations dislh01 ored and
 the enemies of republican progress
 exult in the declaration that
 free institutions are a failure
 I turn there fore from
 the responsibilities of the past
 to the question of the
 present and the responsibilities of
 the future The question of
 the day is I lavc
 we a Government at au
 Minor issues of compromise and
 adjustment must give way to
 and be swallowed up by
 this most momentous of all
 questions When am appealed 10
 in behalf of compromises and
 conces sions I must first
 inquire what shall save What
 Is the do I get
 as an equivalent for concession
 Union which I am called
 upon to preserve by com
 promise ablc to outlive the
 demoralizing humilia tion of the
 sacrifices which are made in
 its behalf And here I
 take occa si0i1 to say
 that I will go as
 far as any man in
 line of toleration and con
 ciliation where no surrender of
 a vital principle If pride
 of opinion is in the
 way I is involved If
 the prejudices of the past
 or the sacrifice it passions
 of the present are obstacles
 I forget It shall never
 be said of me that
 in this them hour my
 action was controlled by dictatcs
 of pas Sion or considerations
 of partisan advantage but there
 is one thino to be
 settled here and now in
 If this Government is a
 mere partner nuse ship wit
 h no power for its
 own preservation and subject to
 dissolution at the caprice of
 any of its members then
 it is utterly useless to
 patch it up loyalty then
 the sooner this Union is
 dissolved If freemen are to
 make humiliating the better concessions
 in return for the privilege
 of enjoying what at the
 ballot box they have fairly
 won then we have a
 Government better suited for some
 other meridian a Government too
 imbecile to cornmand respect and
 certainly worthy of no sacrifices
 to preserve It may be
 answered that we are not
 asked to concede to that
 exwult that we are not
 required to surrender any principle
 as the price for peace
 but I I find that
 one idea pervades all propositions
 for compromise and that is
 the surrender to slavery of
 the territory south of the
 line of 360 30 It
 is done either directly and
 openly in express terms by
 constitutional amendmcn t or it
 is accmnplished influence The appeal
 should be made to our
 political opponents because if any
 misapprehen Sion on this subject
 exists it is the result
 of their reckless and groundless
 assertions in the effort to
 manufacture political capital and they
 will best evince their anxiety
 for fraternal peace by humil
 iating themselves to the work
 of retraction and confession I
 commend that work to them
 Let them for once be
 patriotic rather than partisan But
 in view of the perils
 which surround us I shall
 not stand on any point
 of punctilio eti If it
 will bc any satisfaction to
 any sec quette tion that
 the Republicans of this Congress
 place on record the declaration
 that slavery in the Statcs
 is under the exclusivc control
 of State sovereicrn ties I
 for one am willing to
 join in it and it
 was covertly and indirectly bv
 the admission of New in
 that spirit Mr Speaker that
 I voted on Mon t
 iniplies a recognition and ii
 day last for the resolutions
 offered by the gentle Mexico
 as a State extension of
 the institution of slavery it
 gives it man from New
 York Mr PALMER But as
 the moments are passing away
 allow l ew Ytnarantees and
 additional strength If it does
 not do it then it
 is useless as a measure
 of com I me to
 say tc my constituents and
 associates what I will not
 do No vote of mine
 shall give any promise and
 just so far as it
 does it it is a
 sur render of a popular
 judgment carefully matured additional guarantees
 to slavery If guarantees are
 to be given I claim
 them for freedom The in

 are other objections in my
 rnind to a stitution of
 slavery has had control of
 this Gov It has made
 every If one is desirable
 this at any ernment for

 to think of it Six
 States have department first sectional

 and demoralized political parties and
 compelled even northern men to
 abjure and deny the faith
 of their fathers It denies
 to day to northern men
 the protection of law It
 makes a compromise in its
 favor only the occasion for
 renewed aggression and additional demands
 uses its powcr to ruin
 a Government when it can
 no longer rule it To
 that slave powrer I yield
 no additional guarantees that it
 now has under the sanction
 of the Consti I tution
 but I add not to
 the number For the Union
 of these States I would
 yield much and suffer much
 Baptized as it was by

 already raised the standard of

 the brotherhood SD far as
 any acts of their own
 could effect a separation They
 moreover declare the scparation to
 be final they Clare alike
 by word and deed that
 they desire none To them
 the offer of compromise is
 on our part an unnecessary
 humiliation Even if it were
 not so the offer to
 treat with men who have
 in salted our flag aud
 taken possession of our prop

 so helpless that the first
 touch of the traitor destroys
 it then it is good

 entail disgrace and shame A
 nothing after it is saved

 of utter weakness but it
 would be a premium offered
 to in behalf ofa Union

 BEALE Mr Speaker the great
 question which has for the
 last twelve years agitated the
 country is that of human
 freedom and slavery Increasing year
 by year and election after
 election in magnitude and importance
 it has at last assumed
 dimensions which cast their shadow
 far and darkly overeveryother public
 issue And sir in the
 same ratio with its increase
 has progressed the intelli gcnt
 understanding by the people of
 at least one section of
 the country relative to it
 This ques tion so great
 I shall not undertake to
 discuss on this occasion Not
 only have such discüssions here
 in the Senate through the
 press and before the people
 been too full to render
 such a course necessary but
 sir now is no time
 for essays upon any question
 no time fbr theories or
 for policies Che lögic of
 circumstances is hurryinm us irresist
 ibiy along to far different
 conclusions The pro jects of
 the hour demand at our
 hands immediate and far different
 consideration The time for de
 liberation gives place in every
 earnest and patriot soul to
 a desire a resolve to
 act 1 shall endeavor sir
 briefly and earnestly to express
 my opinion as to the
 causes which have produced the
 existing state of things to
 consider our condition and the
 duty of every representative man
 in the premises have said
 that this question has been
 before the country for thirteen
 years Every grand princi ple
 involved was fully discussed thus
 long since proclaimed the nationality
 of freedom and the sectionalism
 of slavery reaffirmed thc policy
 of the ordinance of 1787
 denied the power in the
 Federal Government to deprive any
 person of life liberty or
 property without due legal pro
 cess dcnicd the power of
 Congress to make a slave
 or establish slavery asserted the
 power of Congress to exclude
 slavery from free territory demanded
 freedom for our brethren in
 New Mex ico as well
 asin Oregon and California demanded
 economy in all public expenditures
 and the sub slitution of
 election by the people of
 all civil off cers as
 faras practicable in lieu of
 appointments and to correct the
 abuses of executive patronao e
 recommended free grants of public
 lands to actual settlers and
 in order to pay the
 national debt its interest and
 the current expenses of the
 Gov ernment they recommended a
 tariff of duties These recommendations
 denials assertions and demands constituted
 the platform of principle upon
 which the friends of liberty
 waged the polit ical contest
 of 1848 In what sir
 does it differ from the
 platform of the Republican party
 in 1860 Certainly in no
 essential And one is impressed
 not only with the patriotism
 of those men who framed
 it but with their sagacity
 and almost prop I letic
 forecast To the great iiiind
 which conceived the fervid heart
 which impelled the true courage
 which pro claimed and the
 iron will which has maintained
 the assertion of these principles
 prophetic vision is vouchsafed and
 the future opens to him
 with all itsincidents as the
 broad path from cause to
 effect Honored among men will
 this patriot be and the
 more honored that standing firm
 amid defection of friends and
 mutation of events he still
 keeps the whiteness of his
 soul Would that all who
 stood with him then were
 with him to day that
 the uncornpromisincr earnestness of that
 hour per vaded this and
 that freedom should not have
 had occasion to mourn the
 departure of his com panions
 and her votaries from the
 altar and the temple retie
 principles of freedom thus asserted
 twelve years ago the great
 central idea of that struggle
 demand them and therefore it
 is that to dav we
 resistance to the aggressions of
 slavery having are asked to
 compromise and if northern Rep
 fallen upon the popålau heart
 of the free States resentatives
 dare to refuse the Republic
 is con produced an impression
 which could not be effaced
 l vulscd States secede the
 Union is to be dissolved
 Those soldiers of freedom twelve
 years ago last that same
 New Mexico for which they
 had demanded freedom and the
 establishment of November polled one
 hundred and twenty thou sand
 votes in the State of
 New York and about free
 institutions But sir under the
 pledge of three hundred thousand
 in the Union and thus
 I peace quiet and finality
 to agitation and more gave
 an earnest of their sincerity
 and proof of than all
 through their love for the
 Union of the their vigor
 i States they yielded a
 tacit assent their Repre The
 Free soil organization and canvass
 of 1848 t sentatives signed
 a solemn league and covenabt

 of the Republican never to

 apostles proclaimed the tion in
 Congress or to support any
 one who should evangel of
 liberty through that canvass the

 thås discharged what they con
 seed was sown broadcast Everywhere
 throughout ceived to be their

 their constituents now does proclaimed
 unwavering hostility to the will

 for the com extension of
 human servitude non interference promisers

 the States where it exists
 by virtue of In 1852
 the Whig and Democratic national
 conventions passed resolutions indorsing these
 compromises and pledeing themselves acrainst

 agitation or discussion Each nominated
 a presidential candidate and en

 the Whig party par alyzed

 died of their indorsementin 1852
 rehe majestic mourner hav ing
 poured from her party u

 gates and stretched herself by
 the side of Webster both
 self slain by a compromise
 The result of the election
 of 1852 and the fate
 of Representatives who surrendered the
 free sen timent of the
 country to the slave power
 proved conclusively how deep was
 the resolve of the people
 of the North to resist
 further aggression of slavery While
 acquiescing reluctantly in those compro
 mises and permitting one after
 another of fugi tives to
 be arrested and remanded to
 slavery they through their immediate
 Representatives claimed and exercised the
 right to pass such State
 laws as should protect every
 freeman frorn unlawful seiz ure
 and secure to him his
 inalienable right of personal liberty
 Such laws were passed with
 due reference to the Federal
 Constitution and in the full
 exercise of their respective State
 sovereignty Massachusetts in all this
 doing only what Vir ginia
 had done and for the
 same reason While thus legislating
 to protect freemen from slavery
 several of the southern States
 of the Con federacy had
 legislated to reduce free colored
 men to servitude and still
 more of them flagrantly dis
 regarded the constitutional right that
 citizens of each State shati
 be entitled to all the
 privileges and immunities of citizens
 in the several States Mr
 Speaker the compromise of 1850
 is one of the causes
 of the present concfition of
 things The antagonistic systems of
 freedom and slavery hav ing
 come in contact and the
 former having yielded its principles
 and rights having as in
 1820 al lowed that to

 There must be no more

 vowed unqual moderate not to

 accord ance with both when
 they shall have done all
 this and failed to secure
 cheerful obedience to the constitutional

 win I admit that they
 may claim at my handsoonSid
 eration for terms of compromise
 and conciliation But Mr Speaker
 not only was the slavery
 question agitated in the last
 Congress but the same question
 went into the Democratic nationa
 convention Sir it was the
 power in those con It
 dissevered the party and disrupted
 ventions all ties which had
 bound it together The Demo
 cratic party was broken up
 by its southern mem bers
 by design They proposed terms
 which they knew could not
 be accepted by nortliern meri
 and live Sir the leaders
 of the southern Democracy are
 sagacious men They know well
 the senti Inent of the
 North educated as it has
 been on questions There are
 no more sagaciou g men
 unless it may be the
 leaders of the northern and
 particålarly of the New York
 Democraéy These too know full
 well thc strength of north
 ern sentiment on the question
 of opposition to slavery extension
 and aggression They have been
 Inade to feel the edge
 as well as wat ch
 the gleam of the steel
 The result was as desired
 by the South secession from
 convention separate nominations distracted canvass
 and an iffno minious defeat
 Sir long ere the convention
 met in Charleston secession had
 become a foregone conclusion with
 the extreme South they labored
 to accomplish it by first
 disrupting the national convention and
 at that result felt and
 some expressed the same joy
 which Samuel Adams expressed to
 Hancock when he beard the
 firstgun at Lexington This i
 henceforward to them the is
 a glorious day canvass was
 an affair of secondary importance
 their primary object was to
 operate not with the people
 but with the Administration for
 the ac complishment of their
 purpose The Secretary of War
 was to garrison southern posts
 with föw troops and under
 the command of officers who
 were supposed to sympathize entirely
 with seces sion Artillery arrns
 and munitions of war were
 to be transferred to southern
 arsenals and depots And the
 sinews of war were to
 be material yweak ened by
 operations upon the Treasury The
 Sec retary of the Navy
 was to officer and station
 ships of war so that
 resignations and surrenders of our
 armed marine would be easily
 accomplished The Secretary of the
 l reasury was to excue
 panic in NV all street
 depreciate public stocks impair the
 public credit which he was
 bound to protect and suffer
 depredations upon the Department under
 his charge while the President
 the wo rthy head of
 the conspiracy was to play
 the dignified part of dummy
 In this game Of political
 whist Sir these gentlemen acted
 with their usual sagacity and
 how wvell they have succeeded
 let the events of the
 last three months and the
 present distracted condition of the
 country bear witness in the
 mean time the Republican party
 ad mirably organized and harmonions
 having pro were expressly repudiated
 One of the most dis
 the Thirty Sixth Congress the
 Sir I do not impeach
 the motives of these hon
 tineuished of their fenders proclaimed
 that and the uni orable
 gentlernen They doubtless supposed they
 day of compromises had passed
 were obeying the will of
 their constituents versa heart resF
 ouded arnen Professing these I
 do say that by such
 discussion and by such a
 princip e s the Republican
 party M ent into the
 con of action they contributed
 not a little to test
 in 1856 and by its
 youthful vigor and by the
 the present unfortunate condition of
 the country con nnallding purity
 of its purposes almost won
 And I say further that
 it comes with but ill
 grace the people were not
 yet Ple But sir the
 victory pared or the victory
 four years more were neces
 from these gentlemen now to
 reproach Repub I licansfor failing
 to exercise a compromising spirit
 savy to the fall developmentofitsstrength
 Those fot u years were
 years of further education to
 the för deClining at their
 request to sacrifice their i
 convictions and disregard the known
 wilt of their northern mind
 rl he campaltrn of 1856
 was one of enthusiasm constituents
 And still further I would
 say to thcse conserva Like
 the strifi upon the red
 crest of Breed s hill
 it was a conflict of
 gallant mililia acrainst trained tive
 gentlemen that when they have
 done all which veterans The
 result was that the Republican
 they can do both here
 and at home fo correct
 mis representa tians of Republican
 principles and de i claimed
 to the country the same
 principles upon which it was
 founded and by fidelity to
 which it had grown from
 infancy to the stature and
 strength of manhood abating no
 whit of its uncompro mising
 hostility to the extension and
 aggressions of slavery and none
 of its equally uncompronlis ing
 opposition to interference with the
 institu tions of any of
 the States loyal to the
 Consti tution obedient to the
 laws and resolved at everv
 hazard to preserve the Union
 of the States nom inated
 a candidate who was and
 Stili is believed to be
 the true exponent of those
 principles and whose firmness and
 personal probity had passed into
 a proverb and with such
 a platform and candidate entered
 the canvass Sir there never

 the patriotic examples of conducted
 with more reference to the
 reason so and Lho present
 Adrninistration clevated to poxver the

 D ci THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS

 spirit of those Representatives if

 cveh con sented to negotiate
 for a compromise had they
 elected their candidate and we
 threatened to ser cede from

 our friends of the border
 States to day stand in
 the position of negotiators for
 concessions from us and point
 to the living arguments of
 six seceding States as the
 powerful iiRiucement for our sacrifice
 and at the same time
 not one of them nor

 any attempt to vindicate the
 honor of our flag or
 rescue or punish the lawless
 seizure and impris onment of
 a civil offcer whose offense
 conststed in obedience to the
 laws of the nation and
 the discharge of his duty
 But on the contrary these
 honorable Representatives deprecate and denounce
 all enforcements of lavv or
 all defense of Federal property
 as coercion and as war
 And not a few of
 these Representatives conducted the lust
 canvass upon the avowed party
 platform of the Constitution the
 Union and the enforcement of
 the taws And further I
 say that every in terest
 of the order States points
 to the propriety of an
 adherence to the Union Let
 tho line of separate Government
 be brought down to the
 northern boundaries of Mai yland
 Virginia Ken tucky and Missouri
 and all security for their
 pe culiar property would cease
 Such sir are my objections
 to any compro mise and
 particularly at this juncture The
 plans which have been submitted
 do not tend to diminish
 bu t rather to increase
 the strength of my objections
 In my judgme_nt each of
 them involves the surrender of
 the cardinal principles of the
 Republican party which are those
 of the Con stitution and
 but one of them would
 tend in any degree to
 placate the slaveholding States and
 that is the proposition of
 the honorable Senator from Kentucky
 Indeed several of the border
 Slates have declared that proposition
 to be their ultima tum
 I shall endeavor to review
 briefly these propositions and state
 frankly my objections to each
 The select cornrnättee of thirty
 three propose first an amendment
 of the Constitution of the
 United States as follows ART
 12 No amendment of thig
 Constitution having for its object
 any interference within the States
 with the relation between their
 citizens and those described in
 sec tion second of thc
 first article of the Constitution
 as other persons shall originate
 with any State that does
 not recognize that relation within
 its own limits or shall
 be valid without the assent
 of every one of the
 States com posing the Union
 Sir m y objections to
 the proposed amendment are I
 It deprives the people of
 the United States who ordained
 and established the Constitution of
 the rights of amendment thereto
 in the man ner and
 form therein prescribeq and substitutes
 the action of a State
 therefor and ratification of all
 the States instead of the
 people of three fourths thereof
 2 It discriminates unjustly between
 the peo ple of one
 class of States or between
 those States themselves and the
 States which recognize the relation
 specified in the Constitu tion
 and which relation is interpreted
 to mean chattel sla very
 3 It would interfere with
 those powers of the Government
 so ably discussed by m
 friend the distinguished gentleman from
 Ohio Mr BING HAM first
 to impose a capitation tax
 appor tioned upon the basis
 of representative popula tion second
 to emancipate slaves in time
 of war TUESDAY FEBRUARY 19
 1861 erty in a slave
 and other property except that
 the former sustains no portion
 of the burdens of Government
 that each is entitled to
 the same pro tcction and
 stands upon the same footing
 under our Constitution and laws
 19 How Rep pp 451
 452 and it would furnish
 occasion for re newed decisions
 of similar character and still
 further carrying out the doctrine
 5 By the so called
 decision of the same court
 in the same case it
 was held substantially that free
 colored persons whose ances_tors were
 im ported into this country
 and sold as slaves had
 no rights which the white
 man was bound to re
 spect and were not citizens
 of the United States although
 such persons were born and
 reside therein and that the
 Constitution having taken from the
 States all power by any
 subsequent legislation to introduce as
 a citizen into the po
 litical community of the United
 States such or any other
 person no matter where born
 or what his character or
 condition and such decision having
 been predicated in part upon
 the terms citizens relations all
 other persons as used in
 the Constitution and repeated in
 the pro posed amendment I
 am unwilling to furnish any
 additional evidences sanction or assurance
 to so atrocious a doctrine
 And inasmuch as many of
 these persons so described disqualified
 and out lawed have been
 emancipated and reside in slave
 States and as many residing
 in and citi zens of
 free States heretofore have gone
 and may go into slave
 States in business capacities and
 as many so going and
 temporarily sojourning have been arrested
 and imprisoned and others may
 not only be so imprisoned
 but sold into sla very
 and as State legislation has
 for some time been contemplated
 to reduce all colored persons
 in slaveholding States into actual
 or conditional slavery or to
 impair their rights and interest
 and banish them from such
 States therefore I am unwilling
 to support any such proposition
 as will forbid an amendment
 of the Constitution more clearly
 defining recognizing or protecting the
 rights of such persons or
 interfering with the relations between
 citizens under such de cision
 and these persons or as
 would more ef fectua ly
 protect the rights of citizens
 of each I say I
 am unwill State in the
 several States ing to support
 a proposition that no such
 amend ment shall be made
 unless originating in a slave
 State and approved by each
 and every one of the
 slave States Including of course
 the one where those rights
 were violated 6 My further
 objection to this nendment is
 that the southern people through
 their represent atives in either
 branch of Congress have never
 demanded it but by every
 fail implication have They have
 demanded noth protested against it
 mg but what they called
 loyalty to the Constitu tion
 Such for years here and
 elsewhere has been the purport
 of their speeches and journals
 To that cnd they have
 wielded the legislation of the
 country and wrested the judicial
 authorities Let us to day
 agree with them and in
 the loftiest sense be unfalteringly
 loyal to the Constitution of
 our country as it is
 7 Another obiection to this
 amendment I have ever been
 taught to regard the Constitution
 of the Republic the fundamental
 lavvy of the land as
 something sacred from the touch
 of the pro fane as
 permeated with the liberal spirit
 and jeweled with the starry
 brightness of the intellects which
 framed it as glorious all
 over with the patriotism of
 the Revolution as coming down
 to us of inferior clay
 and of baser spirit an
 emana tion of better days
 and from better men as
 bring ing down to us
 and through us bearing on
 to furthest posterity the treasures
 of a perfect assured Union
 of established justice of c
 tranquillity prosperity and the blessings
 of liberty I believé it
 has all these perfections this
 i day and therefore sir
 I am reluctant here in
 under the war power vested
 in the Government 4 It
 would furnish additional evidence to
 sus tain the propositions enunciated
 in the case of Dred
 Scott os Sandford that the
 Constitution of the United States
 recoo nized the right of
 property in man that there
 is no difference between prop
 62 this hour of madness
 and folly to change add
 or diminish onc line or
 word one scntimcnt or thought
 And sir I am resolved
 that in so far as
 I am concerned no change
 shall therein be made which
 shall in thc slightest degree
 or by NEW SERIES Q
 any interpretation recognize the M
 p Madison depnegated of admitting
 iw the Constitutiötfthe idea of
 proÉe CSi iR which shål
 fasten süch f try throug
 the proposition The next Proposition
 is an Sion of New
 Mexico My objections to this
 compqomise are I As nearly
 as can be ascertained the
 inhåbit ants of New Mexico
 do not desire that the
 TéR itpry shall become a
 State but on the ContraL
 i wish to retain their
 present condi tio 2 New
 Mexico is not fit to
 be aHmiffed as snch State
 The insuffcient number of hefiBhabitantS
 and their mixed and motley
 chdi åcter speak strongly against
 the impolicy hf such admistsiofi
 3 i am illclined to
 agree with my friend from
 Ohio in his constitutional objection
 to her ådfniS sion and
 would with him apply to
 her the Jbf fersonian rule
 applied to the State of
 Ohio 4 1 never would
 vote for the admission of
 New Mexico until she expunges
 from her t xritorial statute
 book her atrocious slave code
 the won der and the
 shame of the age and
 nation a code sir which
 we repealed by a decided
 majority at the last session
 of Congress but which still
 lies upon the table of
 u Democratic Senate 5 This
 proposition to admit New Mexico
 is brouaht forward as a
 compromise on the part of
 the North to the South
 while abthe same time honorable
 gen tlemen of the Republican
 party pi e dict that
 it will come in as
 a free State If so
 the object for which it
 is proposed will fail and
 the South will then have
 just cause of offense If
 gentlemen offer it as a
 concession to slavery while they
 believe it will not be
 so in reality there is
 bad faith in the transaction
 I will be a party
 to no such contrivance I
 will not assist to cheat
 as I do not desire
 to be cheateÜ I cannot
 consent that tho ethics of
 Tatersall s shall be thus
 in grafted upon the honor
 of Parliament 6 But I
 am opposed to the adoption
 of this proposition because I
 believe it will result in
 her admission as a slave
 State and I believe that
 she will secede from the
 Union within thirty days thereafter
 This act is an enabling
 act under it a consti
 tution may be framed and
 the State admitted by proclamation
 without further congressional seru tiny
 or action Sir I am
 opposed to such man ner
 of admission without checks and
 limitations upon the exercise of
 the power granted to the
 people of the Territory No
 such checks are con tained
 in this act and the
 people of New Mexico may
 frame a constitution as odious
 and despotic as they please
 so only that it shall
 be republican in form that
 is representative and with thatcon
 stitution she will come into
 the Union withöut further action
 of Congress There can be
 no reasonable doubt but one
 of the odious and des
 potic features of that constitution
 will be the in stitu
 tion of human slavery The
 compromise of 1850 was the
 organic act of New Mexico
 Under its provisions a slave
 Territory has been organ ized
 atrocious slave codes passed and
 a pro sla very Delegate
 sits upon the floor of
 this Chamber All this was
 accomplished by the exercise of
 the powers recognized and confirmed
 by the provis Ions of
 this bill and by excluding
 Congress from any jurisdiction over
 the subject matter By con
 tinumg such exclusion the result
 will be that New Mexico
 will come into the Union
 as a slave State Looking
 back over the success of
 this policy and forward to
 such consummation the honorable Senator
 from Illinois in his great
 justification by faith speech in
 the Senate on the 16th
 of May last said reproachfully
 yet triumphantly to the South
 Now what has been the
 result My views were in
 corporated into the cornpromise measures
 of 1850 and his I
 lag the South been eicluded
 from all the were rejected
 territory acquired from Mexico What
 says the bill from the
 House of Repfcsentatives now on
 your table repeal ing the
 slave code in New Mexico
 established by the peo ple
 themselves It is part of
 the history of tho country
 that under the doctrine of
 non interveution this doctrine that
 you delight to call squatter
 sovereignty the people of New
 Mexico have introduced and protécted
 slavery in the THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE February 16 whole of
 that Territory Under this doctrine
 they have eonvöi te d
 tract of free territory into
 slave territory xnore than five
 times the size of the
 State of New York Under
 this doctrine slavery has been
 extended from the Rio Grande
 to the Gulf of California
 and from the line of
 the Republic of Mexico not
 only up to 360 30
 but up to 380 giving
 you a degree and half
 more slave territory than you
 ever claimed In 1848 and
 1849 and 1850 you only
 asked to have the line
 of 360 30 The Nashville
 conven tion fixed that as
 its ultimatum I offered it
 in the Senate in and
 it was adopted here but
 rejected in the House of
 Representatives You asked only up
 to 360 301 and non
 intervention has given you slave
 territory up degree and a
 half more than you asked
 and yet you say this
 is of southern rights Sir
 if the people of New
 Mexico have thus de liberåtely
 adopted a territorial constitution pro
 slavery m its character and
 have through their Territorial Legislature
 passed sustained and themselves submitted
 to such disgraceful slave legislation
 and have with great unanimity
 elected a pro slavery Detegate
 in Congress I submit to
 Republican Representatives whether the inference
 is not irresistible that the
 same people will adopt a
 slave constitution and under it
 come into the Union as
 a slave State and I
 submit further to them whether
 such legislation will redeem the
 pledges which they made to
 the people and by which
 they were elected Sir for
 these reasons I shall vote
 against the measure The third
 compromise is an amendment to
 the fugitive slave act of
 1850 I am opposed to
 this amendment 1 Because it
 retains in the act amended
 those unconstitutional features existing in
 that act vest ing in
 commissioners the judicial power to
 dis pose of the questions
 of personal liberty the sus
 pension of the writ of
 habeas corpus and the refusal
 of jury trial in the
 State where the fugitive resides
 at the time of seizure
 2 Because it compels the
 citizen to aid in the
 capture or detention of the
 fugitive whenever the owner or
 marshal shall amprehend resistance to
 such capture thus placing the
 honor and self respect of
 every citizen ofa free State
 in the cus tody and
 subject to the apprehension of
 the kidnapper and compelling such
 citizen under severe penalties to
 perform a revolting task to
 which no southern gentiemen even
 would submit t nd the
 performance of which among themselves
 is left to a mercenary
 and degraded class not recognized
 as the social equal of
 the slave owner 3 Because
 it may remove from the
 place of his birth and
 continued residence to a remote
 and unfriendly vicinage a free
 citizen subjecting him to all
 the perils delays and inconveniences
 of a trial in to
 him a foreign land and
 before a tri bunal which
 recognizes in him no right
 which a white man is
 bound to respect subjects him
 to a temporary imprisonmcntwithout bail
 or lim its subjects him
 to the unjust presumption that
 he is a slave compels
 his witnesses from a great
 dis tance and into an
 unfriendly neighborhood and should they
 bc of colored skin exposes
 them to the inconvenienccs and
 imprisomnents awarded to all colored
 freemen from the North in
 slave holding States In short
 it renews the grievances of
 our revolutionary ancestors that of
 transport inff men beyond proper
 jurisdictions to be tried for
 pretended offenses 4 It substitutes
 et parte proofs before the
 com missioner and his decision
 thereupon in place of the
 practice of the civilized world
 in all ot l her
 cases where the accused is
 to be confronted with the
 accuser and allowed opportunity to
 defend 5 By supporting this
 proposi_tion I and my people
 indorse the odious act of
 1850 in all these unconstitutional
 errors all these great wrongs
 and in its conspiracy against
 the freedom of tl uou
 sands and the honor of
 millions Sip I will never
 vote for any such measure
 But I will here and
 I now vote to repeal
 the act of 1850 uncondition
 ally and thus revive the
 act of 1793 under which
 for fifty seven years the
 Republic was peace And more
 sir I am of the
 same opinion as Mr Webster
 that under the Constitution the
 whole business of delivering up
 such as owed service or
 labor belonged to the State
 whither the fugitive flee or
 shall have fled frorn justice
 arid be Found in another
 State shall on the demand
 of the executive authority of
 t he State from which
 he fled upon the district
 judge of the United States
 of the district in which
 he may be föund be
 arrested and brought before such
 judge vho on being sat
 isfied that he is the
 person charged and that he
 was within the jurisdiction of
 such State at the time
 such crime was committed of
 which such charge shall be
 Timafucie evi dence shall dclivcr
 him up to be removed
 to the State hav mg
 jurisdiction of the crime and
 if any question of law
 shall arise during such examination
 it may be taken on
 exceptions by writ of error
 to the circuit court I
 am opposed to this amendment
 of the act of 1793
 1 Because it takes from
 the Govern oru f the
 several States who are the
 representatives of the sovereignty of
 such State the powers heretofore
 vested in and exercised by
 them to protect the life
 and liberty of the citizen
 2 Because it transfers those
 powers to the Fed eral
 judiciary and to officers appointed
 by the Federal Executive and
 holding their offices by a
 life long tenure 3 Because
 by such deprivation and transfer
 it G abridges the rights
 of the States and tends
 to the centralization of power
 in the Federal Gov ernment
 of which the people and
 the States are so iustly
 jealous against which our constitutional
 fathers so earnestly protested which
 they so much feared and
 which they endeavored in every
 way to prevent With such
 a clause in the original
 Constitution I do not hesitate
 to aficm that it would
 never have been adopted by
 the States never 4 Because
 upon such judicial officer an
 in dictment found in his
 own court or one of
 equal jurisdiction would be regarded
 as conclusive vvhereas State executives
 entirely independent in their action
 have refused so to regard
 indictments or certified affidavits but
 have passed behind and examined
 into the merits of the
 application 5 The term other
 satisfactory evidence is too vague
 and undefined to meet with
 approval Under the act of
 1793 such evidence was clearly
 defined It must be indictment
 or affdavits duly certified by
 the executive of the State
 where the offense xxvas alleged
 to have been committed I
 cannot consent to invest a
 Federal offcer himself not immediately
 responsible to the people and
 receiving his Inandates from irresponsible
 supe riors with any such
 dangerous discrction 6 My sixth
 objection to this amendment is
 my In want of confidence
 in the Federal judiciary former
 and latter days it has
 stepped tob far beyond the
 limits of well defined duties
 and has ignoretd many of
 the personal rights of the
 cit izen and has endeavored
 to grasp too many powers
 as a correlativc department of
 the Gov ernrnent and it
 has too often and too
 effectually dictated to the legislation
 of the country to in
 sure such respect as would
 induce my vote to invest
 them with other powers at
 the expense of State rights
 7 I object 40 this
 amendment upon the further gvound
 that if not intended it
 will be used to suppress
 freedom of speech and of
 the press not only in
 slaveholding but in free States
 An indictment in South Carolina
 against the editor of a
 paper published in Albany Boston
 or New York and mailed
 to and received and read
 or circulated in that State
 would be presumptive evidence of
 the publicati0Y1 in that State
 a pre sumption to be
 disproved by the party charged
 and pcrhnps not permitted to
 be disproved at all Certainly
 this presumption could not be
 rebutted before the judicial offcer
 issuing process of ar rest
 and remanding for trial 8
 I do not believe that
 the Federal judiciary or any
 of its ofiicers should be
 placed at the dis posa
 of the executive of any
 State to arrest or cause
 to be arrested and returned
 any person alleged to have
 committed an offense against the
 laws of such State Their
 functions are judicial not police
 9 do not believe that
 the Federal judiciary or any
 of its offcers have any
 constitutional right to arraign examine
 and remand any person for
 an offense alleøed to have
 been committed against fled and
 not to the General Government
 the laws of any one
 of the States Their juris
 The last proposition of the
 committee of thirty diction and
 duties are clearly defined by
 the Con three is as
 follows stitution All are denied
 them and reserved Jmendment Of
 the act for the rendition
 of fugiti z cs from
 to the State tribunals justice
 Be it enacted by the
 Senate and I louse of
 Representatives Mr Speaker with these
 objections I shall vote Besides
 these certain resolutions have been
 sub mitted by said committee
 many of which are open
 to similar objections and which
 I cannot support My time
 forbids their consideration Another proposition
 is before the Housc in
 the form of an amendment
 known as the Crittenden It
 is enough at this time
 for me to compromise say
 that it seeks to incorporate
 into the Corrstitu tion of
 the Republic the föllowinff propositions
 1 That Congress shall have
 no power to preR vent
 the extension of slavery into
 free territory 2 That south
 of a certain geographical parallel
 of latitude Congress or a
 Territorial Legislature shall have no
 power to abolism modify or
 in any way interfere with
 slavery in the Territories 3
 That slavery shall be prote
 ed in all terri tory
 south of such parallel and
 slaves shall be regarded and
 protected as property in the
 same manner as all other
 kinds of property 4 That
 Congress shall have no power
 to abol ish slavery in
 the District of Columbia 5
 Orin the forts arsenals dock
 yards or where ever else
 the Federal Government has exclusive
 jurisdiction 6 That in case
 of the failurc to arrest
 any al the community leeed
 fu itive from service t
 where such failure took place
 shall be compelled to pay
 the value of such alleged
 fugitive to the owner thereof
 and may be prosecuted for
 that In short it seeks
 to purpose and to that
 effect Incorporate into the Constitution
 and by joint resolution too
 the principles set forth in
 the Piat form of the
 Breckinridge wing of the Democratic
 i party during the last
 canvass Propositions which were introduced
 and urged by secession gentlemen
 to break up the Demo
 i cratic convention and party
 and w hie h were
 repu diatcd by an overwhelming
 popular majority in November I
 shall vote against that compromise
 Mr Speaker having stated thus
 frankly what I will not
 support it may be asked
 me what affrm ative action
 do you propose shall be
 taken This is a most
 important inquiry But sir aware
 of all the responsibilities which
 devolve upon me as a
 Representative of all the perils
 which environ my country asking
 for that wisdom of duty
 which cometh down freely from
 and hoping for that fortitude
 which renders man equal to
 either fortune I have no
 diffculty in answering the inquiry
 I propose that the Con
 stitution of the Republic shall
 remain forever intact the same
 invulnerable immortal ægis of human
 rights forged upon the stithys
 of our rev I propose
 that the Union olutionary demi
 gods of the States ordained
 by our fathers and upon
 which their and our common
 Father has smiled glory and
 prosperity shall at all hazard
 and by every power of
 the Government be maintained I
 propose that the just laws
 of my country shall be
 enforced everywhere throughout her borders
 and by every constitutional means
 and that such additional legislation
 shalt be immediately had as
 will enable such object to
 be accomplished propose that the
 property of the Republic Which
 has been unlawfully seized shall
 be repossessed that the civil
 and military offcers of the
 Govern i ment who for
 the discharge of their duties
 have been imprisoned or be
 eaguered shall immedi ately be
 succored and that the honor
 of our flag which has
 been tarnished shall be vindicated
 be fore the world I
 proposc that the wil ofthepeopie
 of the Union mighty majestic
 and constitution ally expressed at
 the national election shall be
 respected and obeyed And above
 all sir do propose that
 liberty shall not again be
 beaten down upon the threshold
 and beside the altars of
 this her temple That the
 free principles which undeflie the
 whole structure of the Republic
 for which constitutions were ordained
 laws enacted and the will
 of the people expressed shall
 not again be compelled to
 pass under the yoke of
 slavery These propositions constitute a
 platform saff ciently broad and
 strong to upbear the patriotic
 men of every section of
 the Union They in volve
 no sacrifice but the maintenance
 of our mu tual principles
 They will restore peace tranquil
 lity and self respect They
 wili bring back to us
 the almost alienated confidence and
 respect not only of the
 lovers of liberty but of
 the despots of of the
 United States of america in
 Congress assembled I hat aoainst
 this amendment the Old World

 book of destiny every person

 Mr Speaker the secession of
 six States from the Federal
 Union brings us face to
 face with grave issues fraught
 with results of the most
 momentous importance The unavoid able
 duty now devolves upon every
 true patriot and friend of
 the American Union of examining
 with care the great questions
 presented and in forming himself
 as to the proper course
 to be pur sued in
 this trying emergency At a
 period in our history when
 thig great American Confederac y
 has advanced to a position
 which commands the respectful attention
 of the civilized world at
 a moment when the whole
 country is full of st
 rc_ngth and when a gracious
 Providence has vouchsafed to us
 a season of un exampled
 abundance with no new element
 of strife in our system
 which has not been present
 every nuo ment since the
 organization of the Gocernment at
 such a moment our oreat
 political fabric issought to be
 overthrown in one section of
 the Union by an armed
 resistance to the Federal Government
 and a conspiracy against the
 Constitution the Union and the
 laws W ith the exception
 of that protracted arid bloody
 conflict which gave birth to
 this nation none has arisen
 and in my judgment none
 will arise in our subsequent
 history involving in terests so
 vast consequences so momentous as
 the one now CONGRESSIONAL GLOBØ
 the seventy two years which
 will have elapsed on the
 4th of March 1861 when
 Mr Buchanan s presidential term
 expires the South will have
 had the President and the
 entire control of the Government
 forty eight years and the
 North twenty four Now sir
 I care nothing about the
 question of which section has
 had the n nost hon
 ors The North should not
 complain because she might have
 had it otherwise But When
 southern gentlemen talk of aggressions
 upon their rights by the
 people of the North and
 ask for guarantees in the
 future I desire to know
 what kind of aggressions they
 can bé when thé North
 has for forty eight years
 out of seventy two sur
 rendered up to the South
 the whole control and management
 of the Government in all
 its branches Not only have
 they had the Presidents but
 through them the Cabinets thecourts
 and all the omcers of
 every grade throughout the country
 The shaping the forming and
 modeling of the system has
 been theirs The government of
 the Territories tho powerful influence
 of the execu I tive
 over the legislative branch has
 all this timc been with
 thc South sometimes having the
 Pres ident and Vice President
 both and alt this too
 when the North could have
 prevented it as her electoral
 vote has always been the
 largest but she did not
 The South has had all
 the proper legislation she asked
 No legislation of Congress has
 evgr been directed to the
 disturbance of s avcry where
 it actually existed Tithe foreign
 slavb trade was permitted to
 continue till 1808 and its
 prohibition after that period was
 an ad vantage to the
 South By the purchase of
 Louisiana and Florida and the
 annexation of Texas a large

 a vast extent ofslave territory

 the character and policy of

 of Congress mcnt but its
 very cxistcnce 1 hc ultimate

 the South is strorvcr cision
 of the present controversy will
 settle the I i there
 now tl lan it was
 at the time of thc
 formation great question whether this
 Government shaki be I of

 The free States administered in
 the spirit that gave it
 birth whether peaceful constitutional self
 government shall be supplanted by
 a system of Mexican vio
 lence and anarchy where life
 liberty and prop erty are
 never safe This is the
 point vv e have reached
 tions and have boasted that
 however excited our elections may
 have been all parties joined
 in sus taining the victors
 About three months since a
 vitrorous election terminated and a
 Chief Magis trate was elected
 by the people in strict
 conform ity to the Constitution
 From that day to the
 present a portion of the
 southern people have per although
 in a majority in both
 branches of Con gress and
 havitog the power to pass
 any law they please havc
 not abolished slavery in the
 District I of Columbia or
 in the forts mao azines

 is it that guarantces are

 sought to destroy that Government
 of which they had just
 endeavored to take renewed possession
 Théy say they have a
 legal and con stitutional right
 so to do and V
 re are thus to inquire
 whether any justification exists for
 this i I extraordinary procedure
 For the past three months
 the cry o usurpa tion
 tyranny and oppression has been
 daily rincrino in our ears
 Thesc complaints come but from
 one section of the Union
 the South and relate to
 but one subject slavery The
 charge is that the North
 has committed a2gressions on the
 South Sir when and where
 did the North ever at
 The passage of personal liberty
 bills by some of the
 northern States has furnished theoccasion
 though not a justification for
 much censure and the excuse
 ftn much of the feeling
 exhibited by the South Sir
 it is the highest duty
 of a State to protect
 the liberties of its citizens
 with all possible secu ties
 consistcnl with superior constitutional obli
 gations Laws calculated to accomplish
 that pur pose ought not
 to be repealed unless they
 clearly transøress the limits of
 constitutional power has been well
 said that the Constitution of
 the United States was not
 intended and must not be
 construed to intend to divest
 the States of their power
 to protect their citizeus in

 of the Federal Government of
 the North are forbidden ing

 protection as well as humanity
 alike demand that every free
 State should have a law

 its provisions to prevent the
 kidnapping of our colored citizens
 Ailaw Of that character ought
 not to be regarded as
 aggressive or as designed to
 interfere with the constitutional rights
 of the South Sir we
 all know that there is
 a most unfortu nate misapprehension
 in the southern mind in
 regard to the feelings and
 mötives of northern men Deception
 and misrepresentation have been freely
 and criminally employed by designing
 politicians north and south to
 exasperate the southerrr peo ple
 and to goad them to
 a c ts of folly
 andmadness All through the South
 men in high positions have
 lent themselves to the propagation
 of the basest slanders to
 foment discord between the two
 sec tions of our country
 and every appliance of art
 and dissimulation has been resofted
 to widen I the breach
 and to dedeivé the people
 of the South into the
 support of a vile and
 treasonable conspir acy Vou of
 the South arc told that
 Lincoln Seward and the entire
 victorious party of the North
 are fiends and devils incarnate
 that thei e is no
 virtue no love of country
 no humanity no purity no
 honesty in the ranks of
 the Republican party Truth might
 well stand back aghCFi at
 the rage of passion and
 falsific ation Sir miléss the
 southern mind is disabused Of
 these erroneous conceptions an eternal
 gulf of impassable hatred will
 soon roll between us Then
 will come a War of
 extermination and desolation Whose angry
 front shall surge across the
 land and drench the kindly
 bosom of our mother earth
 with the gore of our
 brethren a war that will
 bring no glory to the
 victor that will send its
 slain before the pres enco
 of their God with consciences
 wreaking with guilty murder of
 men of our own race
 and lineage of the same
 Fcligion sinful like us faulty
 like us yet none the
 less our kindred our brothers
 before high heaven The people
 of the South should turn
 a deaf ear to tl
 iose unscrupulous politicians who expect
 agitation and turbulence to raise
 them to the surface from
 the depths of oblivion to
 which a peaceful state precipitates
 them Mr Speaker thc present
 attitude of the North is
 that of dignified consistency and
 certainly of praiseworthy forbearance towards
 the South Gentlemen the border

 do not justify the violence
 of South Oar olina Georgia

 the former in firing il

 You say that they have
 acted with precipitation and that

 980 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE February
 16 abase surrender of the
 veyy principles on which this
 Government was founded Sir I
 have examined with some care
 the vari ous propositions submitted
 to the House for the
 purpose of quieting the present
 troubles The compromises proposed by
 the chairman of the committee
 of thirty three Mr CORWINI
 are as follows 1 An
 to the Constitution whereby any
 power to interfere with slavery
 in the States is fp
 rever denied to Congress until
 every State in the Union
 by its indiy ldual State
 action shall consent to its
 exercise 2 An act for
 the admission of Now Mexico
 as a slave Stpt e
 withoutfurther action of Congress 3
 An amendment of the fugitive
 slave law so that it
 shall be more efficient fbr
 the arrest of fu gitive
 slaves 4 An amendment of
 the act for the rendition
 of fugitives from justice so
 as to give the Federal
 courts exclusive jurisdiction and make
 the in dictment primefccie evidence
 against the accused So får
 as the first proposition is
 concerned there is no necessity
 whatever for its passnge The
 Con stitution protects slavery in
 the States and forbids any
 interference by Congress The platform
 of the Republican party adopted
 at Chicago ex pr eåsly
 recognizes this doctrine in the
 following resolve Fourth That the
 maintenance inviolate of the rights
 of the States and especially
 the right of each State
 to order and control its
 own domestic institutions according to
 its power o n whieh
 the perfection and enduranceof our
 polit ieai fubrie depends and
 wedenounce the lawless invasion by
 apned force of the soil
 of any State or Territory
 no mat ter under what
 pretext as among the gravest
 of crimes The remaining propositions
 are objectionable to use the
 language of the gentleman from
 Ohio Mr BINGHAM on the
 ground of constitution ality on
 the ground of humanity and
 on the ground of policy
 From the debate thus far
 I am led to conclude
 that these propositions if adopted
 would not satisfy those gentlemen
 of the Sou lh who
 complain of northern acyryressionsupon their
 constitutional righ Is The gentleman
 from Massachusetts Mr ADAMs a
 member of the committee is
 of the same opinion for
 he states inhis minority report
 That no form of adiustment
 will be satisfactory to the
 recusant States which does not
 incorpora te into the Constitu
 tion of the Unil cd
 States a recognition of the
 obligation to protect and extend
 slavery this condition and on
 this glone will they consel
 t to withdraw their opposition
 to the reccyrnition of a
 constitutional clection of the Chief
 Magistrate Viewing the Inatter in
 this light it seelus un
 advisable to attempt to proceed
 a step t urther in
 the way of offering unacceptable
 propositions This of itself is
 a suffcient reason why north
 ern Representatives should withhold their
 votes frorn these propositions A
 compromise of this character would
 not make peace Its utmost
 effect would be to make
 a short deceptive fruitless truce
 the prelude to a contest
 twofold morc in tense and
 destructive l he plan of
 Mr CRITTENDEN proposinty eer tain
 amendments to the Constitution has
 attracted the most general attention
 and wo are exhorted I
 to support it by considerations
 no less sacred than those
 of union and peace W
 c are told that if
 we pass it we shall
 heal the bleeding wounds of
 the country bring back the
 seccding States and restore peace
 and harmony to a divided
 peo pie It is I
 fear like s mne other
 compromises which we have made
 a surrender of principle i
 on thc part of the
 North and will lead probably
 to the same or a
 worse conclusion The amend ments
 proposed by Mr CRITTENDEN are
 as fol 10 ws ART
 1 In all the territory
 of the United States now
 held or hereafter acquired situate
 north of latitude 360 30
 slavery or involuntary servitude except
 as a punishment for crime
 is prohibited while such territory
 shall remain under territorial government
 In all the territory south
 of said line 01 latitude
 slavery of the African race
 is hereby recognized as existing
 and shall not be interfi
 rcd wkth by Congress but
 shall be protected as property
 by all the de the
 adjoining States Virginia and Maryland
 or either nor without the
 consent of the inhabitants nor
 without just cornpexsation first made
 to such os mers of
 slaves as do not consent
 to such abolishment Nor shall
 Congress at any time prohibit
 officers of the Federal Government
 or meni bers of Copgress
 whose duties require them to
 he in said District from
 bringing with them their slaves
 and holding them as such
 during tne time their duties
 Inay require them to remain
 there and afterwards taking them
 from the DiS trict ART
 4 Congress shall have no
 power to prohibit or hin
 der the transportation of slaves
 from one State to another
 or to a Territory in
 which slaves ate by law
 permitted to be held whether
 that transportation be by land
 navigable rivers or by the
 sea ART 5 That in
 addition to the provisions of
 the paragraph of tlie second
 section of the fourth article
 of the Constitution of the
 United States Congréss shall have
 power to provide by law
 and it shall be its
 duty so to pro vide
 that the United States shall
 pay to the owner who
 shall apply fbr it the
 full value of his fugitive
 slave in all cases when
 the marshal or other officer
 whose duty it was to
 arrest said fugitive was prevented
 from so doing by vio
 lence 01 intimidation or when
 after arrest said fugitive was
 rescued by törce and the
 owner thereby prevented and obstructed
 in the pursuit ot his
 remedy for the recovery of
 his fugitive slave under the
 said clause of the Constitution
 and the laws made in
 pursuance thereof And in all
 such cases when the United
 States shall pay for such
 fugitive they shall have the
 right in their own name
 to sue the county in
 which said violence intimidation or
 rescue was committed and to
 recover from it with interest
 and dam ages the amount
 paid by them for said
 fugitive slave And t he
 said county after it has
 paid said alnount to the
 United States may its indemnity
 suc and recover from the
 wrongdoers or rescuers by whom
 the owner was prevented from
 the recovery of his fugitive
 slave in like manner as
 the owner himself Might have
 sucd and recovered ART 6
 No future amendment of the
 Constitution shall affect the five
 preceding articles nor the third
 paragraph oftbe second section of
 the first article of the
 Constitution nor the third paragraph
 of the second section of
 the fourth article of said
 Constitution and no amendinent shall
 be made to the Constitution
 which shall authorize or give
 to Congress any power to
 abolish or interfere with slavery
 in any of the States
 by whose laws it is
 or may be allowed or
 permitted Mr Speaker these amendments
 make slavery a national institution
 by a constitutional recog nition
 of the right of property
 in man and pledges the
 Federal Government to its support
 It is sub stantially the
 Breckinridge platform which was condemned
 at the late election by
 a vote of more than
 four to one When it
 tvas introduced into the national
 Democratic convention last spring that
 body chose to see itself
 split into pieces rather than
 to adopt it in any
 form The returns o the
 late presidential election show that
 more than a million Democrats
 north and south voted for
 Stephen A Douglas in order
 to express their dis sent
 from it Every free State
 voted for a directly opposite
 principle including my own State
 where out of over five
 hundred thousand votes not over
 twenty thousand were cast for
 Mr Brady the candidate of
 the Breckinridge Democracy for the
 offce of Governor And yet
 in the face of the
 fact that this heresy put
 forth by Yancey and the
 disunionists was repudiated by the
 people we their Representatives are
 asked to accept it as
 concession to the small disaffected
 minority who threaten civil war
 and the overthrow of the
 Government in case of refusal
 Sir I object to these
 amendments for the further reason
 that they propose to make
 a constitution which shall be
 one thing in the South
 and another thing in the
 North which shall recognize prop
 erty in men and protect
 it south of 360 30
 and which Shull prohibit slavery
 north of that line until
 State rovernments are formed Do
 we want a sectional Constitution
 drawincr a geographical line between
 difbrent sections of the Union
 and o iving tl ie
 two sections different laws in
 any other way than by
 harmonizing its policy with the
 thought that gave it birth
 I object to the Crittenden
 compromise for an other reason
 If the seceding States come
 back under any such offer
 as is proposed in th
 isscheme they bring back with
 them the doctrines of State
 sovereignty and the righ t
 of secession unimpaired I had
 almost said acknowledged and certainly
 successful The loyal States may
 not ingraft this upon the
 written compact but they will
 have recognized the practical effciency
 of these doc trines We
 may still call it revolution
 but the record will sho
 w that this revolution has
 been the means of gaining
 for the revolutionists all that
 they desired and will give
 them a most instruct ive
 precedent for their guidance in
 making any future demands Now
 sir if the validity of
 this method of de manding
 that which is supposed to
 be right or convenient is
 once admitted the occasion for
 its practice will not long
 be wanting W c are
 told that the adoption of
 this compromise will remove the
 slavery question from Congress and
 that we therefore need not
 fear any of those fixture
 diff culties which we apprehend
 But how is this question
 to be removed from Congress
 As the proposition now stands
 it covers all future acqui
 sitions of territory No sane
 man can fail to see
 that the whole controversy is
 reopened thc mo ment any
 such acquisition is proposed For
 these among other reasons I
 am in favor of the
 resolution reported by Messrs WASHBURN
 and TAPPAN from the committee
 of thirty three which is
 in the following words Resolved
 That the provisions of the
 Constitution are ample for the
 preservation of the Union and
 the protection an the material
 interests of the country that
 it needs to be obeyed
 rather than amended and our
 extrication from present difficulties is
 to be looked for in
 efforts to pre serve and
 protect the public property and
 enforce the laws rather than
 in new guarantees for particular
 interests or compromises or concessions
 to unreasonable demands Sir I
 believe that we can stand
 with safety upon this proposition
 It reduces the issue to
 a simple question of fidelity
 to the Union and acqui
 escence in the Constitution as
 it is Any south ern
 State desiring to remain and
 satisfied with its old rights
 can here find ground on
 which to rcgt secure Any
 State not wishing to retnain
 or dissatisfied With the Constitution
 will find little occasion in
 adopting this resolution to felic
 itate itself upon the success
 of its movement Among such
 States as adhere to the
 Constitution upon this basis we
 shall have firm and solid
 Uniou not weakened by tuworthy
 concessions to threats or actual
 violence nor by any implied
 admission of the right of
 secession among the remedies for
 the supposed grievances of States
 Of those which have seceded
 few in my judg ment
 will fail to return finallv
 with minds so bered and
 enlightened but they will not
 bri og back those overstrained
 notions of State sovereignty on
 the strength of which they
 have gone into thcir present
 undertaking and which if once
 acceded to even by implication
 must inevitably under mine the
 foundations of the Government In
 my judgment the present is
 no time för com promise
 Until the strength of the
 Government bc tested it is
 not right 01 legal or
 politic to con sider concessions
 is only when traitors have
 been reduced to obedience 01
 the Government has proved impotent
 that we should be constructino
 articles of agreement A compromise
 at this time would be
 the humiliation of one section
 loyal to I ouject to
 these propositions because theyare the
 Union and obedient to the
 laws made under a departure
 from the fundamental principles on
 II the Constitution to another
 section in array which this
 Government was founded Our fathers
 I against the Government of
 the Union and defy prohibited
 slavery in all of the
 territory belongincr ing law order
 justice and My remedy to
 the Government at its formation
 instead of looking forward to
 its diffusion over new reoions
 they confidently expected it to
 be swept from the country
 at no very distant period
 and finally the compromises on
 the su b ject of
 slavery to which the northern
 States assented were formed in
 ref partments of the territorial
 government during its contin crence
 to these facts and must
 be interpreted in uancc And
 when any I crritory north

 our path from line within

 so long as it exists

 is folly to strive for

 found in executing the Constitution
 as it is and enforcing
 the laws of the General
 Gov ernment I have no
 sympathy with any man who
 repudiates the Constitution of our
 common coun try whether he
 resides north or south By
 that Constitution I abide both
 in its letter and in
 its spirit Standing firmly upon
 tbc principles of free dom
 and the Constitution we shali
 have no cause for self
 reproach even if civil war
 should follow Mr Speaker let
 the same spirit animate us
 which was so nobly expressed
 by Henry Clay in the
 Senate of the United States
 in 1850 when as now
 agitators threatened tho peace of
 the Union Now Mr President
 I stand here in my
 place rneaning to be unawed
 by any threats whether they
 eotne from livi uals or
 fro n States 1 should
 deplore as Inuch as any
 authority of thc Union either
 by individuals ar by States
 1861 But after all that
 has occurred if any one
 State or a por tion
 of the people of any
 State choose to placethemselves in
 military array aoainst of the
 Union I am for trying
 the strength of the Government
 I am tor ascertaining whether
 we have got a Government
 or not practical efficient capable
 of maintaining its authority and
 of upholding the powers and
 interests which belong to a
 Government Nor sir am to
 be alarmed or dissuaded from
 any such course by intimations
 of the spilling of blood
 If blood is to be
 spilt by whose fault is
 it to be Spilt Upon
 the supposition maintain it will
 be by the fault of
 those who choose to raise
 the standard of disunion and
 endeavor to prostrate this Government
 and Sir when that is
 doene so long as it
 pleases God to give me
 a Voice to express uiy
 sentiments or an arm weak
 and enfeebled as it may
 be by age that voice
 and that arm will be
 on the side of my
 Coun try for the support
 of the general authority and
 för the maintenance of the
 powers of this Union The
 State which I have the
 honor in part to represent
 has made known her sentiments
 on this subject too clearly
 and too distinctly to be
 misunderstood The Legislature of that
 State on the 25th day
 of January last by a
 vote of 117 to 2
 in the Assembly and with
 but one dissent ing vote
 in the Senate adopted the
 following pre amble and resolutions
 W hereas the insurgent State
 of South Carolina after seizing

 Speaker the events ofthe last
 ninety days show that the
 Federal government is still an
 experiment and perhaps as doubtful
 now as it was when
 Washington declared in his first
 inaugural address that the preservation
 of the sacred fire of
 liberty and the destiny of
 the repub lican model of
 government are justly considered as
 deeply perhaps as finally staked
 on the ex pcriment intrusted
 to the hands of the
 American It has successfully resisted

 by them the t eaty
 mäking power and powers of
 avowals of the sccessionists and
 as early as Oc peace
 and war To be sure
 it has been argued tober
 last he was specially warned
 by the highest again and
 again that we have no
 power to make offcer of
 the Government in military rank
 and war upon a seceding
 State but nobody will deny
 the peer of the highest
 in the world in military
 our power to make war
 upon a foreign State and
 reputation of the dangers to
 which the country it behooves
 all concerned to remember that
 there was exposed and of
 the remedy within his reach
 is not a kingdom in
 the world agailist which we
 Warnings were neglected treason lurked
 in the ever had or
 ever can have strorwer or
 more Cabinet under the very
 eye of the President and
 grievous causes of war than
 with this extempore reveled through
 the Executive Departments The kingdom
 of cotton The seizures of

 dispersed in distant Territories and

 of the United the Navy
 in distant seas the loyal
 North was States by armed
 men under the authority of
 the seceding States were overt
 acts of iVar The sur
 veillance by arms over the
 navigation of the Mis sissippi
 and the robbery of the
 national Treasury by Louisiana are
 outrages upori our national rights
 for which instant atonement would
 be manded from any other
 nation backed if need be
 by thousand cannon and a
 million bayonets But sir I
 vv ill not contemplate the
 picture or the prospect of
 actual war nor even the
 prospect of two lincs of
 standing armies and threatening forts
 in two confederacies stretching one
 thousand or three thousand miles
 from the Atlantic to the
 Mississippi or from thc Atlantic
 to the Pacific I will
 only add that if the
 seceding States are really out
 of the Union we have
 new dl ld urgent duties
 upon our hands in the
 settlement of new diflicult and
 all important questions The pub
 lic debt the public lands
 the public buildings the national
 ships the national obligations growing
 out of public treaties such
 for instance as those touching
 the slave trade the claims
 of States and citizens of
 the United States upon the
 Govern ment all these topics
 present questions of the gravest
 import The navigation of the
 Missis sippi and the control
 of the Gulf of Mexico
 is another matter that will
 permit no delay And then
 hov will you settle wit
 h the seceding Staies including
 an item of spent for
 the purchase and defense of
 territory nöw occupied by them
 Sir if these States are
 out of the Union let
 us turn our attention to
 these questions There are none
 o raver none more urgent
 If these States are not
 out of the Union then
 the old ob I thc
 House All that is changed
 In this House i ligations
 and powers remain upon us
 all of them in full

 Those ob ligations we are
 to discharge and those powers
 after State has seceded our
 forts arsenals macr azines hospitals
 post offces custom houses mints

 laws of the United States
 have been violated and the
 power of tho nation defied
 The President has notified us
 of the events in Inessaffe
 after message I think he
 tells us all this is
 very wrongin the southern people
 and the north ern people
 are very much to be
 blamed for it regret it
 I cannot help it I
 am impotent The Greeks are
 strong and skillful to their
 strength Fierce to their skill
 and to their fierceness vaiiant
 But I am weaker than

 failed to use the means
 that were in his power
 to defend the Government Per
 haps it oucrht to be
 said that he has been
 deceived and paralyzed by the
 infidelit y of his advisers
 but in anv event he
 has cast himself upon Con

 of thirty million peo ple
 are turned and here the
 hopes of all the loyal
 and the patriotic are centered
 True it is that here
 until a very recent date
 they looked and hoped in

 powerless as the Executive Here
 töo was disloyalty to the
 Fed and no set of

 at least the Representatives of
 the Reptiblican il party cornmalld
 a majority in numbers and
 they 982 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 16 we are to
 exercise just so far as
 of the case will admit
 I ask then are the
 se ceding States out of
 the Uniön I do not
 intend to discuss the rightof
 secession which has been so
 largely argued in this debate
 in my judgment the matter
 is completely settled by tfie
 Constitution itself There no power
 express or implied conferred by
 the Constitution upon any department
 of this Government to perform
 the last the all essential
 and the crowniog agt of
 successful secession or revolution that
 is the recognition of the
 inde pendence Of a seceding
 or revolutionized State States may
 secede in fact they may
 form inde pendent governments and
 receive the recognition of the
 world they may resist and
 successfully resist this Government and
 yet this Government has notthé
 constitutional power to their independence
 nor a constitutional right to
 treat them as Independent States
 The Constitution was designed not
 only as a perfect Union
 it was designed also for
 postcrity and therefore as a
 perpetual Union Section ten of
 article one is throughout a
 prohibition of secession because it
 is a prohibition to every
 State of powers essen tial
 to an independent nation The
 abrogation of the Constitution and
 laws of the United States
 is rebellion and resistance to
 them by force is trea
 son A persistence however long
 is but con tinued rebellion
 and treason So far then
 as this Government is concerned
 until the new power of
 recognizing the independence of a
 rebellious State shall have been
 constitutionally conferred we are to
 refuse such a recognition to
 refuse to recognize the agents
 of seceding or rebellious States
 to re fåse to enter
 into a settlement of any
 of those grave questions to
 which I have already alluded
 and to the best of
 our judgment and ability we
 are to maintain the sovereignty
 of the United States to
 execute the laws and bring
 back the rebellious States to
 their allegiance to the Consti
 tution and to their late
 and madly lost estate of
 liberty security prosperity and peace
 I confess that I have
 thought it will bé a
 hard necessity for the want
 of constitutional power to acknowledge
 the independence ofa seceding State
 to endure a protracted period
 of anarchy or the horrors
 of civil war Perhaps it
 will be a neces sity
 too hard to be borne
 imperative enough to warrant an
 assumption of undelegated power as
 in the instance of the
 acquirement of that very Territory
 which is now the theater
 of this griev ous discontent
 But we are not yet
 warranted to make an assumption
 like that The necessity may
 come it has not yct
 come In spite of the
 confident declaration of the ex
 Secretary of the Treasury I
 must deny that the seceding
 States arc yet out of
 the Union and stillindulge the
 hope that equaliy confident estimates
 from the same quarter is
 altogether too illusive to varrant
 any assump tion of undelegated
 power In instance yet has
 the ordinance of secession become
 the act of stitutions of
 their own States and of
 the Uuiled States they are
 not out of the Union
 yet By the patriotism and
 prudence of their people on
 a calm review of these
 revolutionary proceedings and the sad
 resülts already suffered by their
 regular constitutional action let us
 hope that these States will
 yet be declared to be
 within the Union redeemed from
 the usurped power of aspiring
 demagogues and purified from their
 polluting touch Surely we may
 refuse to acknowledge the independence
 of States which have not
 yet seceded At least until
 of the seced ing States
 have ratified or acquiesced in
 the rev olution that has
 been attempted we cannot rec
 ognize their independence Conciliation compromise
 concessions for more than sixty
 days these have been pressed
 upon us powerfully and persistently
 pressed upon us from without
 by timid and mistaken friends
 and bold and avowed enemies
 pressed upon us by the
 first not more to preserve
 the Union than by the
 last to annul the late
 verdict of the country and
 destroy the Republican party but
 x vorse than these pressed
 upon us for tem porary
 peace or a temporary policy
 at the ex pense of
 principles which never can be
 surren dered pressed upon us
 to keep the cotton States
 within the Union at the
 risk of driving the north
 ern States out of it
 pressed for the conciliation of
 rebels who will not be
 conciliated at the risk of
 disaffecting the loyal who will
 not be degraded I know
 there are men among them
 who are actu ated by
 nobler motives than some of
 these and who do not
 contemplate consequences such as these
 know there are good men
 here generous pure and patriotic
 men of almost every section
 and of every party who
 are actuated by the best
 of motives and have appealed
 to us with ali the
 charms of eloquence enforced by
 the claims of fraternal affection
 and the fears of fatal
 results Alas that these have
 been so few alas that
 among the Representatives of fifteen
 States the instances have been
 so rare that each deserves
 a monument more lasting than
 marble And each will have
 it in the mernories of
 all good men They say
 he is a very man
 per se And stands alone
 Conciliation forbearance kindness Yes Mr
 Speaker I will accord all
 these even to rebels in
 arms Christianity demands it humanity
 de mands it the ties
 of blood and the bonds
 of a common nationality demand
 it and I would prove
 to a wondering world that
 my country above all I
 stances we apply to members
 of the domestic family The
 rebellious State are but maniacs
 of a larger size Jt
 is ours to put tbcsc
 noaniacs in a straiaht jacket
 kindly gently b as we
 would a revered mother or
 a darling child to protect
 them from harming th lmselves
 as well as from harm
 ino us to administer unpleasant
 medicines per haps b ut
 nevertheless very necessary and very
 salutary to nurse them into
 health and sanity gently faithfully
 unremittingly and God willino through
 patience and long suffer ing
 welcome them back restored and
 in their right mind with
 renewed affections and mutual joy
 How madly are the seceding
 States crushing iheir own people
 how madly crushing the rnerchantg
 of the North who havc
 confided in them how madly
 would they crush the entire
 country i they could The
 disease is indeed madness and
 it indicates its own remedy
 Concessions compromises a few words
 on this topic It has
 had a prominence beyond all
 others here and perhaps throughout
 the country There are compromises
 that cannot be made under
 any circumstances on any conditions
 at any price You cannot
 compromise the consciences of the
 people or of any considerable
 portion of the peo ple
 you cannot compromise their earnest
 and honest convictions you cannot
 compromisc their will The people
 are greater than Congress than
 conventions than States than ail
 the States com bined in
 our Federal system We may
 propose they will dispose We
 may attempt to traffc in
 their names they will take
 care of our bargains and
 if need be take carc
 of us We cannot compromise
 liberty it is above price
 We can not compromise rights
 justice honor these are not
 merchantable Cotton and calico shoes
 and sugar wheat and woolens
 can be sold or ex
 changed we can make bargains
 about them but we can
 never bargain away the rights
 of the indi viduals who
 produce them Those rights are
 to be respected and protected
 and the only bargain to
 be made a bout them
 must be complete and mutual
 the act of all the
 parties and binding upon all
 a mutual encrwement of each
 to re spect and protect
 the rights of the other
 There are various conditions absolutely
 essen tial to such a
 compromise The parties must be
 present in person or by
 representatives they must stand on
 an equal footing and with
 equal powers they must act
 voluntarily and freely upon their
 own judgrnents unswerved by passion
 and unawed by threats and
 their act there must be
 equivalents to sanctify it by
 justice to ail others responds
 to such demands as these
 Our the parties Such a
 compromise volnntary Inu Governinent is
 based more directly than any
 I tual complete and just
 will be ratified and re
 other upon the affections and
 the will of the peo
 spected or enforced It will
 stand against a ple and
 it must bc more lenient
 than any other assaults of
 sectional interests political insanity to
 the mistakes and the offenses
 of the people and armed
 rebellion I Will n ot
 say that the peo We
 must appeal from the people
 mad to the people plc
 I represent will reject a
 cono promise like that sane
 we must bear and forbear
 As our Gov They will
 voluntarily do anything that in
 their ern tnent originated so
 must it be maintained by
 judgment is right and necessary
 to be done they the
 voluntary and unrestrained will of
 the people will never be
 forced to do anything that
 is wron a State or
 bccn reco rnized by the
 sovereign power If it cannot
 be so maintained then is
 our system I will not
 sav that such a compromise
 is impos of a State

 broad enough to settle the

 believe they will they will
 fail because the very States
 you would con ciliate have
 willfully and contemptuously closed the

 parties to a compromise cannot
 stand here with equal powers
 because the seceding States are
 not represented here at all

 the remaining Statcs cannot freely
 act because they are forced
 to act under a more
 than half executed threat of
 disunion and war if they
 do not surrender without a

 I hcy do not threaten
 but plead they have no
 malice but overflow with fraternal
 affection they have no passion
 but a passionate love for
 the Union and yet their
 affectionate and passionate plea is
 compromise or secession Not that
 they will secede if they
 can help it but that

 other purposes and over burdened
 with other duties and by

 DEFICIENCY BILL Mr PEARCE I
 ask the Senate now to
 take up f6r consideration the
 report from the committee of
 conference in relation to the
 deficiency bill which was up
 on Saturday No no I
 will remark that It has
 not been usual to object
 to taking up these things
 in the Senate whenever If
 the Senate now determine to
 treat proposed reports from such
 committees in a different man
 ner froin heretofore should like
 to knov r it The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Senator from
 Maryland moves to take up

 mittee of conference on the
 votes of the two Houses

 No 866 to sup ply
 deficiencies in the appropriations for
 the fiscal year endingJu ne
 30 1861 The motion was
 agreed to The VICE PRESIDENT
 The question is on agreeinff
 to the report of the
 committee of con ference Mr
 GREEN The other day when
 the report was made I
 indicated an intention to oppose
 it The Senator from Maryland
 then made some statements which
 originated from a misapprehen Sion
 of the subject I can
 explain them all at the
 proper time but I do
 not Wish to interpose ob
 staCles to the passage of
 this bill and I will
 post pone it because there
 will be a fåvorablc oppor
 tunity to offer the same
 amendment on another bill and
 therefore i decline opposing the
 report of the committee The
 report was concurred in JF
 ÅN A B DAIJTDRIVß Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 move take up
 House bill No 583 foi
 the relief of the heirs
 and legal representatives of Jean
 A B Dauterivc That bill
 has aséed the House of
 Representatives Mr RING I now
 rise to my question of
 order I desire to know
 whether by the rules the
 first business in order in
 the mornino is not to
 call for petitions and reports
 from committees The VICE PRESIDENT
 The Chair will again decide
 that point of order as
 hc has done heretofore All
 Senators will recollect the rule
 It is that after thc
 reading the Journal the Chair
 shall call for petitions and
 reports from com mittees The
 Chair has decided repeatedly in
 ac cordance with what ho
 believes to be spirit of
 the rule and with the
 precedents of those who pre
 ceded him that it is
 directory merely as to the
 order of business but that
 it is in the power
 of the Senate to change
 it by their own act
 and that therefore any Senator
 who takes the floor may
 rnove any other order of
 business than reports and petitions
 Mr Ki NG Without postponing
 them The vlCE PRESIDENT on
 a simple mo ion This
 was not a special order
 The usaffe has been so
 ever since I have been
 on tho floor Mr KING
 The usage has been both
 ways The VICE PRESIDENT For
 the last four years it
 has been as the Chair
 states Mr KING I wrant
 it settled Mr PEARCE I
 desire the Senator from Ken
 tuc ky to yield to
 me to submit a report
 from a committee of conference
 on the leffislative execu tive
 and judicial appropriation bill Mr
 CIUTTENDEN can r do it
 without i losing the floor
 The VICE PRESIDENT strictly the
 Sena tor would lose the
 floor unless by unanimous Mr
 HALE 1 do not give
 it Mr PEARCE 1 shall
 not press it if there
 is the slightest objection I
 will wait until the Sen
 ator is through and then
 submit the report Mr WILSON
 1 hope the Senator from
 Ken tuck y will iot
 press the consideration of that
 bill this morning It involves
 the title to a large
 amount of land and must
 necessarily lead to de bate
 and the consumption of important
 time Therefore I hope it
 will not be taken up
 Mr HALE I have in
 my hand a petition The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair will
 state to the Senator from
 New Hampsh e that the
 question is on the motion
 pf the Senator from Kentucky
 to take up a particulai
 bill Mr HALE I thought
 he had waived that to
 allow petitions to be presented
 have a petition which relates
 to action now pending before
 the Committee on Naval Affairs
 I want to present it
 The VICE PRESIDENT There is
 a motion now pending before
 the Senate Mr CRITTENDEN would
 waive it if 1 could
 do so without yielding my
 right to the floor The
 VICE PRESIDENT The question is
 on the motion of the
 Senator from Kentucky Mr FESSENDEN
 1 can only say to
 the Senate that if they
 choose to take up that
 bill of cqurse I shall
 not object but it comes
 from a com mittee of
 which I am a member
 and I shall deem it
 my duty to speak to
 the Senate in reference to
 it and l think it
 must necessarily lead to a
 debate The Senate can do
 as it pleases with it
 I shall not opiose the
 motion because 1 see it
 is of no use The
 Senate seem determined even at
 this late pexiod of the
 session to keep out reports
 from commRtees of conference on
 our general appropri ation bills
 in order to receive petitions
 and all that sort of
 small matter which certainly can
 wait a little while Mr
 CRITTENDEN 1 will gladly say
 to all gentlemen that if
 they will permib me to
 consider my bill as succeeding
 the business of the present
 ation of petitions I shall
 not object to thor being
 received but the Chair thinks
 f cannot do it with
 out losing the floor I
 ask for the question The
 motion to take up the
 bill l vas not agreed
 to ORDER OF BUSINESS Mr
 KING I desire to offer
 an amendment to the rules
 or rather to give notice
 of an amend ment to
 the rules which propose to
 offer to morrow morning or
 if the Senate will consider
 it unanimously I 10W I
 Shall prefer it The Secretary
 read the arnendment which is
 in line three of the
 24th rule after the word
 committees to insert the words
 which shall have priority over
 other business in the order
 they are named unless otherwise
 ordered by the Senate 24
 After the Journal is read
 the President shall first call
 for petitions and then for
 report from standing commit tees
 which shall have priority over
 other business in the order
 they are named unless otherwise
 nrdered by the Sen ate
 and every petition or memorial

 Mr LATHAM I think it

 wish only to ask for

 Mr GREEN He does not
 desire it he only asks
 a concurrence with the House
 of Represent atives The VICE
 PRESIDENT The Chair will re
 state his sugøestion to the
 Senate that it is per
 fectly manifest that we cannot
 get along with the business

 Senators on the floor who

 minutes ali the petitions which

 POST ROUTE BILL On motion
 of Mr G WIN the
 Senate proceeded to consider its
 amendments to the bill H
 R No 714 establishing certain
 post routes disagreed to bythe
 Housc of Representatives and the
 amend merits of the House
 to other amendments of the
 Senate to that bill Mr
 G WIN I now move
 that the Senate ln sist
 on its amendmeiits disagree to
 the amend ments of the
 House of Repreéentatives and ask
 for a committee of conference
 I will state my reasons
 for making the motion In
 the first place I am
 instructed by the Committee on
 the Post unsealed circular or
 other article of printed matter
 not exceeding three ounces in
 weight shall be one cent
 and i for every additional
 ounce or fraction or an
 ounce one cent additional SEC
 20 and be it further
 enacted That the cost of
 the service on the routes
 named in this act shaii
 be paid atter annual appropriation
 by the Secretary of the
 I reasury I upon the
 certificate of the Postmaster General
 and that the rate of
 retter postage between any State
 or Territory east of the
 Rocky Mountains and any State
 ror Territory on the Pacific
 coast shall be ten cents
 per half ounce Mr LATHAM
 I move as an amendment
 to the motion of my
 colleague that the Senate con
 cur in the amendments of
 the House of Repre sentatives
 to the Senate amendments to
 this bill I think that
 motion will have priority and
 I be lieve it will
 settle the whole question If
 the Senate disagree to it
 of course a cornmittee of
 conference can be appointed I
 make that motion Offce and
 Post Roads to make it
 The main i for this
 reason the Senate will recollect
 very point which we wish
 to settle in this committee
 of conference if be granted
 by the Senate is the
 fact whether the limitation of
 the compensa t ion to
 for a daily mail over
 the central route will enable
 the Department to get a
 contract to carry the entire
 mail on that route for
 that sum of money The
 Senate imposed no limit The
 Senate passed through the last
 session an amend ment to
 this bill requiring the Postmaster
 General to establish a daily
 mail on that route and
 to give the contract to
 the lowest responsible bidder The
 House of Representatives has amended
 it by lim iting the
 expense to 800 000 a
 year The Com mittee on
 the Post Offce and Post
 Roads of the Senate are
 not satisfied that the service
 can be obtained for that
 surn of rnoney In the
 event that be obtained the
 mails have to be carried
 as they are now carried
 by the Isthmus ra ute
 and we shall have no
 mail on the central overland
 route Therefore I ask that
 the Senate insist on its
 amendment which makes a daily
 mail on the central route
 certain because there is no
 limitation on the amount and
 ask fora com mittcc of
 conference Mr LATHAM Let the
 Secretary read the well the
 termination of this struggle over
 the over land system at
 the close of the last
 session a quarrel ensued between
 the two branches of Con
 ffress as to the proper
 policy to be pursued rela
 tive to the overland mails
 and the consequence was that
 no system whatever was adopted
 The Govérnment was left entirely
 at the Inet cy of
 the steamship companies as to
 the great bulk of mail
 matter Now sir repreænting a
 constituency that have such a
 direct and vital interest in
 this question I am unwilling
 to see the same state
 of things occur again if
 I can possibly prevent it
 and therefore I move that
 the Senate concur in the
 amendments of the House of
 Representatives I know that the
 Committee on the Post Offce
 and Post Roads of thc
 House of Representatives have maturely
 deliberated on these amendments they
 consid all the information they
 could and when finally they
 got them before the House
 of Representa tives it took
 two or three ureeks before
 the chair man of that
 committee could get the floor
 with the press of business
 there existing to put them
 on their passage They were
 finally adopted amendment Now within
 twelve working days of the
 close of Mr G MTIN
 Read the original proposition and
 this session a motion is
 made that recommences the amendment
 proposed by the House of
 Rep resontatives The Secretary read
 the amendment of the Sen
 ate to insert the following
 section SEC 18 vand be
 itfurt her enacted I hat
 the Postmaster General be and
 he is hereby authorized and
 directed to ad vertise for

 further enacted That the Postmaster
 General ts hereby authorized and

 On motion of Mr WILSON
 the Senate pro tract on
 ronte 6076 in the State
 o J_ exas so that
 it will this struggle between
 the two branches of Con
 I gress and I believe
 that the result of it
 will be a fäilure to
 reconcile conflicting ideas and diffeul
 ties and no law wilE
 be passed whatever I do
 shall have to assume or
 share any such responsi bility
 If the Senate agree to
 these amendments as ingrafted on
 this bill by the House
 of Repre sentatives then we
 shall have got a perfect
 over land mail system a
 system as complete m my
 judgment us human wisdom can
 devise If there are other
 amendménts to be offered if
 Senators have other sucrgestions to
 carry out properly the policy
 of the Government in curtailing
 the ex penses as you
 then have an existing law
 you can move amendments to
 your Post Offce appro priation
 bill to curtail expenses or
 modify the service as your
 judgments may dictate But sir
 I first want a law
 perfecting this overland mail syst
 em Now what is the
 argument against the amend ments
 of the House of Representatives
 My col league says that
 he does not believe this
 service cah be carried under
 tbe flouse s amend men
 L over the central route
 and the Committee on the
 Post Office and Post Roads
 of the Senate are of
 his opinion that they are
 not satisfied of this and
 therefore they want a committee
 of conference of the two
 branches to be satisfied of
 this fact Sir I ask
 how on earth is Congress
 ever to be satis fied
 that it cannot be done
 until the effort is made
 as provided in the House
 amendments to this bill Who
 are you going to consult
 Not a parcel of speculating
 contractors who around your galleries
 they are not the men
 who are alone to bc
 consulted in this matter know
 that respons ible gentlemen have
 stated to IY1e that the
 service can be performed and
 that they will bid for

 I give notice that I

 Mr POWELL Has the Senator
 amendments to proposc from the
 committee Mr SIMMONS Yes sir
 Mr POWELL 1 yield Mr
 SIMMONS move an amendment to
 the eighteenth section in line
 four on page 28 after
 the word books to strike
 out the words printed in
 the English language or of
 which the English forms the
 text bound or unbound 15
 cents per pound and on
 all books printed in foreign
 la n guages 8 cents
 pet poundi and in lieu
 thereof to insert Periodicals pamphlets
 and all printed mattef and
 illus trated books and papers
 and on watches and parts
 ot watches and watch materials
 and unfihi he_d parts of
 watches 15 per centum ad
 nalorem Mr SEWARD I move
 to amend the amend mcnt
 by striking out 15 per
 centum and in serting IO
 per centum in the first
 portion of it which relates
 to books and printed literature
 I wish to state to
 the Senate that if the
 table which I laid before
 them this morning is correct
 the present bill as it
 has been arranged will enhance
 the duty upon books 200
 per cent That is to
 say on the same quantity
 of books which now pay
 a duty of 394 there
 would be a hit y
 of 787 I understand the
 effect of the under the
 bill amendment proposed by the
 honorable Senator from Rhode Island
 to ptace the duty at
 15 per cent will be
 to enhance the duties c
 olloc ted from that source
 100 pcr cent The effect
 of my own amendment to
 his amendmcnt would be to
 pro duce an increased revenue
 from that source of about
 30 per cent above tbc
 present tariff Sup posipg that
 30 per cent is quite
 enough to levy on knowledge
 and literature I move to
 amend the amendment in that
 way Mr SIMMONS I am
 very sorry that any of
 these extravagant papers have cot
 on our side of In
 that paper the duty is
 made 300 the Senate per
 cent on a duty of
 15 These books are in
 the bill at 15 cents
 a pound and I suppose
 some body has been making
 a calculation as to how
 much that would amount to
 on some particular kind of
 paper and books The committee
 now propose to put a
 duty of 15 per cent
 on all kind of books
 no matter in what language
 they are printed T lie
 reason I dislikéd this section
 was because it put a
 different rate of duties on
 books printed in other languages
 than our own not want
 to make any difference in
 our commer Cial relations between
 t_hose who speak our own
 If and those who speak
 some other languaoe they want
 to send books here Ict
 them send them This duty
 of 15 per cent cannot
 be tortured into It is
 15 per 100 pe r
 cent in any way you
 fix it that is the
 whole of it It is
 not a revenue cent duty
 That is as plain as
 A B C We have
 got to have as much
 a s 20 000 000
 over the present tariff and
 I have consented to put
 the duty on books as
 low as it was proper
 in the present con II
 dition of the Treasury and
 I hope it will remain
 II so Mr CAMERON 1
 have only to say I
 hope they will to the
 friends of this measure stand
 by the chairman of the
 committee in these matters He
 understands this whole subject He
 has investigated it very fully
 If we are to make

 gentleman conoegtedwith thé literature attention

 on bookk will add very
 little tothe Yevenae ofth e
 coån try while it will
 Ill upon a class of
 persons we I think we
 shou ld by every possible
 mea nS favor It will
 fall upon the poor scholar
 the clergymdn and the lawyer
 My impression is we had
 bet ter throw our dütieson
 something else rather than u
 pon a class so important
 as these whö ifthey feel
 the pressure of this duty
 will be apt to bo
 against I therefOré agree With
 our whole tariff system the
 Senator from New York in
 fixing ihe duty at the
 lowest point and if I
 could have my own way
 I would have books entirclv
 free N ir SIMN IONS
 One of the inducements I
 had to change the duty
 upon books from what I
 was going to put it
 in the bill was in
 order to satisfy the Senator
 from Massachusetts he toldk me
 that he was satisfied but
 suppose every body has a
 right to change his opinibn
 Mr SUMNER 1 thought Icould
 get a little more off
 Mr SIMMONS You were satisfied
 if you could not get
 any more Mr SUMNER That
 is it Mr SIMMONS Well
 sir when am trymg to
 satisfy the friends of a
 measure by making modifications I
 expect that they will hold
 on to I think a
 man ought to have them
 at least an hour I
 took a reasonable time to
 change his opinion the pains
 this morning to sec those
 members of the committee that
 I thought the I nirdest
 and they consented to this
 modification on books putting them
 at 15 per cent While
 I was read Ing the
 section the Senator from Massachusetts
 came and said if I
 would pug it there hc
 would be content Now when
 somebody proposes to put it
 sornewhere else and make a
 change in the he is
 in favor of changinæ it
 We shali not I an
 I willing get along very
 fast in that way take
 the vole ana should be
 perfectly Satisfied if the Senate
 voted all the duties off
 I merely wish to do
 my duty and present such
 provisions its I think are
 right Mr BARER Will the
 Senator me to ask him
 a question Does the increase
 or de crease of the
 duty upon books affect the
 pricc of the writing or
 simply of the printing Is
 it Inore likely to encourage
 the republication of foreign books
 here or otherwi by or
 de creasing the duty altcrations
 for every person interested that
 comes I Mr SIMMONS A
 duty is put on books
 for here we shall never
 get the bill through We
 the purpose of encouraging their
 republication shali find that everybody
 interested in the im here
 and the use of the
 material and labor in this
 country in the production of
 books They are portation of
 a particular article will come
 here and complain that he
 is wrofiged Let us stand
 by sold very much cheaper
 here than they are in
 the countries where they are
 first published because this bill
 as it is The PRESIDING
 OFFICER Mr FOSTER they are
 copyrighted books and they have
 a T hc question is
 on the amendment of the
 Senator monopoly there You get
 one of their magazines after
 it is reprinted in the
 United States for two from
 New York to thc amendment
 of the Senator thirds of

 I Mr BINGHAM 1 to
 ask the Senator Mr POWELL
 called for the yeas and
 nays In the letter which
 I frolil Rhode Island a
 question and they were ordered
 the honorable Senator from Massachusetts
 read Mr SIIMMONS I want
 to call the at tention
 the referred to a high
 duty on books I suhjcct
 up early morning and I
 hope of those who intend
 to devise sornc revenue for
 I the Government to the
 fact that the proposed tariff
 want to kilow if the
 15 per cent that he
 proposes the Senate will stand
 by it on these books
 is only 15 per cent
 and the prop is that
 high duty THE TARIFF BILL
 The Senate as in Committee
 of the Whole re osition
 is to take off a
 third of that When we
 II Mr SIMMONS The Senator
 must know as sumed the
 consideration of the bill H
 R No want money we
 cannot find any interest that
 is well as I do
 that it is not near
 up to what we call
 338 to provide for the
 payment of outstanding I willing
 to pay it W e
 want to get 20 000

 BING HANI That letter then
 has no application to this

 to amend the Mr SIMMONS
 If thc Senator will aiiow

 made from coir If you
 will road the whole sentence
 you will see that the
 other yarns are yarns made
 from manilla hemp There is
 a duty of 4 cents

 these coir yarns are cheap

 President of the United States
 is hereby authorized to make
 proclamation that the afore said
 articles of tea and coffee
 Inay be imported into the
 Uni ted States exempt and
 free from the specific duties
 herein imposed Mr HUNTER 1
 should like to hear from
 the Senator from Rhode island
 what rates ad ta lorem
 he supposes these duties will
 amount to on sugar tea
 and coffee Mr SIMMONS From
 15 to 17 per cent
 The present duty on suøar
 is reduced somewhat and I
 thought though a majority of
 thc commit tee did not
 that it was necessary now
 to resort to a duty
 on tea and coffee to
 supply suffcient rev enue to
 meet the wants of the
 Government As I stated the
 oti er day the interest
 on the increase of the
 public debt that has taken
 place for the last four
 years amounts to 4 000
 000 I think that it
 is necessary to resort to
 these articles of tea and
 coffee to get money enough
 to pay the inter est
 of that debt and when
 the debt is paid off
 I propose that the President
 of the United States may
 then admit thcm free of
 duty without any action of
 Congress I think that the
 additional revenue provided in this
 amendment over and above what
 we now collect wiil be
 about 4 000 000 annually
 T hc duties arc not
 heavy but my view is
 that when articles have been
 accustomed to be imported free
 there should be a very
 light duty put on at
 first that the public may
 not be very much disturbed
 by the alteration Other Senators
 have the same means of
 knowl edTe that I have
 as to the necessity of
 increasing the revenue We have
 failed togetrevenue enough to pay
 the expenscs of the Government
 for the last four years
 by about 21 000 000
 a year and i know
 of no way but to
 resort to taxation to arin
 it up I know it
 is a disagreeable thing to
 impose taxes but it is
 not as bad in my
 judg ment as it is
 to keep borrowing money at
 extraor dinary rates of interest
 I therefore hope the amendment
 will prevail Mr HUNTER 1
 should vote very cheerfully for
 a reduction of the duty
 on sugar for as far
 as I can ascertain by
 conference with those in whom
 lion of the duties in
 the fifth section It is
 to I trust it is
 too high as it stands
 I sliould Ije strike out
 in line nine in section
 five all after the word
 first to the end of
 the section in the followino
 words On raw sugar commonly
 called Muscovado or brown sugar
 not advanced beyond its raw
 state by claying hoil ing
 clarifying or other process I
 cent per pound on syrup
 concentrated melado I cent per
 pound on white and c
 ayed sugars when advanced beyond
 the raw state not above
 willing to reduce it to
 20 per cent and I
 think that would be above
 the rovcnue duty on sugar
 and if this were a
 revenue tariff I should not
 ob ject to introducing tea
 and coffee but regardincr it
 If Senators would introduce a
 rev amendment enue tariff and
 propose to add tea and
 coffee to the dutiable articles
 it would be a proper
 ques tion and they might
 be as fair subjects of
 taxation as any others but
 when you arc prohibiting to
 so large an extent other
 articles and fabrics and such
 necessaries as iron in order
 to protect domestic manufactures and
 enable tliem to derive profit
 at other people s expense
 Iam not Willing m order
 to make up the deficiency
 thus created to tax tea
 and coffee Mr BIGLER It
 is not my intention to
 vote for the amendment of
 the Senator from Rhode Island
 but I do not mean
 to discuss it for the
 purpose Of presenting the imports
 of 1859 under the present
 tariff with the revenue derived
 thei efröm which will show
 Senators at once the relative
 rate of duty which is
 proposed to be charged rl
 he imports of sugar in
 1859 amounted to 654 226
 000 pounds on which a
 revenue of 7 313 000
 was collected It will be
 scen there fbre that the
 rate exceeded 1 cent per
 pound Instead of under the
 present bill these imports would
 yield 6 542 000 so
 that the prop osition as
 originally presented in the House
 bill would be a reduction
 of the duty upon suffar
 It is now proposed to
 reduce it to cent per
 pound which would still be
 an additional reduction The Senator
 from Virginia therefore is mistaken
 in supposing that the bill
 as it stands will increase
 the duty on sugar If
 you go back to 1857
 you will see that the
 ad valorem duty amounted to
 2 cents per pound in
 consequence of the high price
 of sugar then Mr SIMMONS
 It seems to be considered
 by Senators on the opposite
 side of the Chamber that
 you cannot put on a
 specific duty without putting on
 a protective duty Now I
 suppose a specific duty can
 be putön that would not
 be 10 per cent just
 as wcll as one could
 be put on that Would
 amount to 30 per cent
 Specific duties are in no
 other way protective than as
 they protect the Treas ury
 from frauds Mr HUNTER Does
 the Senator say that 1
 said that you could 110t
 put on specific duties with
 out them protective Mr slNIM0Ns
 No sir The Senator said
 that this was a general
 system of protection in stead
 of revenue Mr HUNTER Yes
 sir 1 said that Mr
 SIMMONS I can sec no
 reason for saying that unless
 it is bécause some of
 the dutics are specific They
 are not higher than they
 would be if they were
 td nalorent duties By this
 svs tem we only protect
 the revenue against frauas r
 have concluded to put a
 moderate duty on all these
 articles that go very much
 together I have hitherto contended
 that it made no difference
 to the consumers of and
 sugar whether you put all
 the duty on the sugar
 or put half on the
 sugar and halt on the
 coffee but I never could
 satisfy Senators on the other
 side that that was correct
 reasoning Now in order to
 make things more comfortable to
 them I propose to put
 some of the duty on
 each of these articles and
 a rate of duty on
 sugar that cannot be complained
 of by anybody who is
 willing to raise the revenue
 by customs and certainly they
 cannot complain of the 15
 per cent on coffee and
 tea That is not more
 than a revenue duty on
 sucrar It inay inci dentally
 help the sugar interest to
 put on a duty cent
 per pound x vhen svar
 is very low and help
 the Treasury now That is
 the advantage of having a
 specific duty One year when
 the sivrar crop failed in
 Louisiana we raised from the
 éugar duties and next year
 the revenue was down to
 6 000 000 It depends
 alt02ether on the price of
 sugar in Havana where we
 princi pally get it I
 should like to have the
 same duties all the time
 and as we consume about
 the same quantity we shall
 get the same revenue from
 the sugar whether it be
 high or low in the
 foreign I market So with
 the duty on offee and
 so with that on tea
 think ita very much better
 method I have heard a
 great deal said about thesc
 rates of duty being prohibitory
 I do not consider that
 there is rate of duty
 in this bill that will
 materi ally lessen the amount
 of importations Lt may check
 some particular articles a little
 but there will be always
 imports that will absorb the
 as I do as a
 highly prohibitory tariff T am
 not money we can spare
 to pay for foreign merchan
 willing to vote for a
 scheme of finance which ex
 dise If you stop a
 little on one you will
 increase clades other products and
 gets revenue arom tea a
 little on others That has
 been my experience and coffee
 I shall therefore vote against
 the I under all the
 tariffs 1861 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Mr
 HUNTER The Senator seems to
 sup pose that I imagine
 that every specific duty is
 necessarily prohibitory In that he
 mistakes me from the men
 most competent to give it
 the ap praisers in New
 York the experts who under
 stand this matter of price
 much better than it is
 possible for the Senator from
 Rhode Island or myself to
 do and they have shown
 that when they convert the
 specifics into ad vålorems many
 of these duties are most
 enormous and the Sen ator
 cannot get around it except
 by denying the their peculiar
 qualifications to pronounce upon questions
 of price and value But
 that is not all The
 Senator has shown by his
 own admission that this is
 an enormous rate of duty
 which he is imposing generally
 He said the rule of
 the com mittee was to
 lay 25 per cent on
 the market price What market
 price in this country or
 abroad Mr HUNTER If he
 laid 2 5 per cent
 on the market price in
 this country let us see
 how it would operate on
 an article which is in
 the 24 per cent schedule
 of the present tariff The
 market price is made up
 first of the foreign cost
 then of the duty say
 24 per cent then of
 all the va article in
 getting here estimated as I
 said before and as I
 have it from a large
 importer in New York at
 about 15 per cent making
 thus far 39 It is
 made up of the merchant
 s profit say 12 é
 per cent more Now in
 order Oo lay 25 per
 cent on cent on the
 foreign cost but you lav
 the 25 per cent on
 the other 52 per cent
 making thus 13 per cent
 additional raising the duty to
 about 38 percent which is
 the estimate that the appraisers
 b Can the Senator say
 that thul duty is not
 almost can he say that
 such a duty as that
 will not ex clude a
 large proportion of the imports
 I take that from his
 own statement in which he
 says that this rate is
 25 per cent upon the
 home value Twenty five per
 cent upon the home value
 as I have just shown
 you is one fourth upon
 all these sums that are
 added to the foreign cost
 in order to make out
 the market price here and
 on the 24 per cent
 schedule under which very large
 quantity I believe the largest
 quantity of our imports come
 in except under the free
 list by his own confession
 he is raising the duty
 to some thing like 33
 per cent And how does
 he ascertain the marketvalue at
 home That would be a
 work of infinite trouble and
 labor How does he know
 the market price of these
 various commodities He is liable
 to error there and the
 very principle on which he
 proceeds shows how enormous must
 be the taxation which is
 laid in this bill I
 acknowledge that a specific duty
 may often be lower than
 an ad oatorem one but
 I say that specific duties
 are laid most generally in
 order stands an ad vulore
 jn Present an ad oaloreøn
 tariff and any of us
 can see at once whether
 we are im posing a
 taxation of 30 25 20
 or 15 per cent but
 how many of us understand
 the taxation here ferior kind
 of that quality differ would
 not stand it Therefore you
 mustxesört ent thing when you
 lassess the rate zof to
 this method whereby wool for
 instance if it duties up_on
 coarse zeommon goods costs under
 24 cents pays a duty
 of 3 cents and poor
 good of their kind That
 is a ery differeiit if
 it costS over that it
 pays 9 cents What a
 pre thing That never intend
 to go That mium and
 what a temptation to fraud
 is there here have avoided
 in this bill as far
 as possible It If the
 wool costs 23 cents the
 importer pays only may be
 in some instances that duties
 areftoo high 3 cents but
 if it is over 25
 cents he pays 9 and
 on this kind of goods
 but in an thus within
 these narrow limits you afford
 every friend from Virginia _L
 differ totally aud opportunity to
 fraud to the importer to
 represent tirely with his whöle
 theory on this 3 subieet
 wool as being just a
 little under the priee atsvhich
 have heard him repeat this
 doctrine befÖre and he is
 compelled to pay the high
 duty on it This håd
 intended to reply to it
 ati lengtb but piobably bill
 proposes not only specifics and
 specifics I shall not have
 an opportunity I do not
 inténd founded upon such ad
 oalorems as have to seek
 the opportunxty_ of saying more
 Ethan I tioned but it
 adds ad ocdorems to them
 It does have said at
 this time but certainlys sol
 far as the not abandon
 the cd valorem principle There
 are comprehension of the eßbct
 of the two modes is
 more ad valorems than specifics
 in the bill as it
 is concerned in the part
 of the consumer there is
 drawn and it will be
 found that in most case_s
 only one side to the
 ease these specifics are introduced
 and put in the bill
 The Senator told us here
 the last session that to
 hide enormous duties all that
 the consumer had to do
 was to turn to fhe
 Mr BIGLER Mr President I
 have repeat laws of Congress
 aud he could gee whethew
 he edly heard this same
 argument of the Senator paid
 one half one thirds one
 fourth or one fifth from
 Virginia Hc seems to prefer
 the ad tato My answer
 to Chat is what proportion
 of the rem system because
 as I understand him the
 honorable Senator s constituents or
 of consumer indeed anybody and
 everybody can have access to
 the laws of Congress But
 sup understand exactly what it
 means Now sir I pose
 they had the laws of
 Congress so faros the object
 to the Ld tal orean
 system for the very reason
 amount of duty which they
 pay upon a given that
 you cannot understand what it
 means On article is concerned
 they might as well have
 a the other hand thc
 specific mode is comprehended Greek
 dictionary i venture to assert
 that under by the most
 ordinary mind Why sir the
 Sen ator from Virginia has
 never been able to tell
 yet forit and I agree
 it is the most convenientsys
 tem what the exact amount
 of duty was that we
 paid the most convenient mode
 of making charges the on
 any given article under the
 ad odorcm system consumer never
 can tell what he is
 paying The Chairman of the
 Committee on Finance as he
 has Senator from Virginia finds
 it necessary to have been
 there never has been a
 time when he could a
 certain quantity of the vast
 variety of goods tell what
 the amount of duty was
 that we paid which he
 consumes in hispursuitsathome Nows The
 great error in ali this
 theory is taking sir purchasing
 them under the present tariff
 I value instead of quantity
 The country needs a ask
 him whelher he can determine
 with any dee certain quantity
 of goods the Senator from
 Vir gree ofsatisfaction to himself
 what amount necesp Yinia needs
 a certain quantity for his
 domestie sarily went into the
 Treasury If he can I
 con purposes Under the specific
 mode he can tell fess
 that I cannot Ido not
 know what the profits exactly
 what he is paying the
 Government Unr of the wholesale
 merchants are der the ad
 valorem system he never can
 tell Can what the profits
 of the country fiferchant may
 be the country purchaser learn
 from the country merchant what
 the amount of ad calorem
 is upon and to go
 back further I do not
 know whether a given quantity
 of goods No sir never
 The I the invoice was
 an honest one or not
 I do riot Senator from
 Virginia may start now on
 a shop know whether the
 appraisement was made by ping
 expedition down Pennsylvania avenue and
 buy one article of each
 of the vast variety that
 is offered for sale and
 I venture to say tha_t
 when he is through hc
 cannot tell what that duty
 is on any one of
 the articles But sir if
 it is aspecific i he
 pays 12 a ton on
 railroad iron he under stands
 that If sugar be tariffed
 at I centa pound and
 he buys ten pounds he
 knows precisely What If he
 buys two he is paying
 to the Government yards of
 cloth and the duty is
 75 cents a yard he
 knows that it amounts to
 1 50 But he says
 anybody understands that it is
 a relative rate a nercentage
 A percentage upon what Not
 a percentage upon the rate
 that the consumer pays to
 the count ry merchant not
 a percentage upon the rate
 which the country mer chant
 pays to the wholesale merchant
 in the city not a
 percentage upon the rate which
 the whole eentage upon the
 foreign invoice the dutiable value
 which the country consumer can
 never know anything about In
 all my experience in this
 way I never could have
 told what the pre cise
 duty was upon any given
 amount of goods ator from
 Rhode Island himself could not
 explain of uny kind and
 yet every man will see
 when a if you were
 to call upon him to
 reduce it into ad charge
 is specific upon the quantity
 exactly what If there is
 to calorems And yet we
 are called upon to vote
 in he is paying to
 the Government this manner blindly
 when he himself confesses be
 a contest between the two
 systems as to which is
 the most candid and open
 and easily compre that there
 is a principle of taxation
 here which hended then the
 argument is undoubtedly against must
 be enormous because he admits
 that he is laying 25
 per cent upon the home
 value Twenty the Senator But
 sir another point As for
 the effect of a competent
 men or not but if
 the charge is made upon
 a specific quantity then I
 cannot fail to be able
 to tell satisfactorily to myself
 exactly how much I am
 taxed for the Government Mr
 HUNTER 1 say to the
 Senator from Pennsylvania that I
 and my constituents know proportion
 I know whatever may be
 the profit that I have
 to pay to the retail
 dealer and to the domestic
 merchant that I have to
 pay to the Gov we
 know but when the duties
 are covered up by specifics
 we cannot how what rate
 we pay Mr BIGLER A
 third half or a fifth
 on what Mr HUNTER on
 the foreign price the for
 eign cost Mr BIGLER How
 what the foreign rice is
 Mr ÅUNTER How do you
 learn what the foreign price
 is under the specifics on
 wool when you have to
 pay 3 cents on wool
 costing under 23 cents and
 9 cents over that You
 have got two prices there
 and a very small mistake
 mav lead to larger fraud
 than can be committed undér
 this tariff Mr BIGLER That
 is begging the question I
 am examining the question between
 specifies and a d oalo
 rems purely Mr HUNTER But
 I have just shown that
 these specifics have to be
 accompanied by mini mums order
 to prevent sueb unequal taxation
 rate of taxation Aman who
 imports one specific charge upon
 the quantity in interfering that
 no would bear it Look
 system of specifics and you
 will find it accom hundred
 bales of goods would have
 to leave one with the
 importation of an inferior article
 for one fourth in custom
 house in order to pay
 the duty I assume all
 the responsibility that belongs to
 that I panied with minimums
 Look at the duty on
 operation I say that it
 is the true policy I
 say wool on wool under
 so many cents a pound
 the duty is so much
 and over that there is
 an6ther But when you come
 to add to that 25
 per cent not on the
 foreign cost but on the
 duty which as a universal
 principle fthe importation and con
 sumption of an inferior art
 icle of a given kind
 is duty A variation of
 1 or2centsin the pound makes
 tures attending the Importation which
 go to make I the
 worst possible policy Inferior of
 any an immense difference in
 the dutiesimposed Is kind are
 always the dearest to the
 consumer and not that a
 much greater temptation to fraud
 Is it is because the
 specific mode upon the quantity
 it not n mch easier
 to perpetrate fraud under up
 the price here you see
 to what an extent it
 Now sir in regard to
 these specifics Senators interferes with
 the importation of the inferior
 ar I such a duty
 as that than a general
 ad duty raises it ta
 k about preventing the frauds
 of the ad valorem ticle
 ofa given kind of goods
 that I prefer it svstem
 Why sir these specifics depend
 upon II is to some
 extent a protection awaiust imposition
 tcm you have both you
 have all the opportuni ad
 vatorenn You cannot aliow one
 specific over upon the consumers
 Why sir the Government did
 the disparity would inspects drugs
 in order the consumers may
 in addition to these specifics
 be so enormous between the
 duty upon the articles II
 not be imposed upon This
 specific mode upon II Mr
 SIMMONS I do not intend
 to go into price and
 large price that the community
 the quantity rests heaviest 1
 agree upon the in il
 thisargument about the propriety of
 already 990 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 February 18 fifed intthe bill
 afid agreed upon by the
 Senate do not exactly understand
 these tactics When Senators are
 opposed to a particular proposition
 before the Senate and they
 can find nothing to show
 against that they go off
 to some other part of
 the bill and find fault
 with what we have done
 not with what I propose
 The Senator from Vir ginia
 has made no argument whatever
 to show that this is
 not right but he says
 he will not vote for
 it becausehe does not like
 something elsein another part of
 the bill That is no
 reason as l understand it
 for not voting for thisj
 if he thinks it ax
 necessai y meaSure f0i revenue
 But that is the whole
 substance of his argument he
 willznot vote for these duties
 of about 12 to 15
 per cent because we have
 got somewhere else what he
 con siders a very obnoxious
 feature I do not think
 there is any part of
 the bill subject to the
 criti cism which he makes
 upon it He says that
 25 per cent is an
 enormous duty that a man
 when he imports one hundred
 bales of cotton has got
 to give twenty five to
 the Gov ernment Suppose he
 should and that is the
 law to day if there
 is any doubt about the
 valua tion the custom house
 offcers can take the duty
 in kind according to the
 percentage levied on the article
 Suppose a man should import
 one hun dred barrels of
 flour and there was a
 duty of 20 per cent
 ad on it and it
 was undervalued In his invoice
 and the Government should resort
 to taking the duties in
 kind and sold 25 per
 cent of it twenty barrels
 of flour in the market
 what I would the Government
 get Would it not get
 the price in this market
 and not the foreign market
 Most assuredly it would If
 it was 5 a barrel
 it wöuld get 100 on
 the twenty barrels and if
 it were valaed at 5
 abroad on a fair valuabion
 equal to 20 per cent
 with the additional charges the
 Govern_ment would get that sum
 Senators are trying to make
 it out that this 25
 per cent is a high
 duty You can say anything
 is hicrh You can cipher
 it up here that it
 costs 40 or 50 per
 cent to import goods beside
 the duty That is the
 way you cipher when you
 want to make out a
 large sum But the Senator
 if he knows any thi
 ngabout merchand ising knows that
 very man y of these
 articles are sold for less
 than the cost The cost
 by that calculation has nothing
 to do with the market
 here It is dependent upon
 other considerations If the market
 is overstocked goods are invariably
 sold at a loss and
 if they are very scarce
 no matter what they cost
 they will fetch a high
 price The Senator wants to
 know how I could find
 out these duties and he
 says if the question were
 presented to me I could
 not tell him anything about
 what this percentage would be
 on the for eifn cost
 have neverfound myself ata Joss
 to find out whenever I
 have examined a question You
 might bring a question upon
 me that had not been
 brought up here and I
 might not know what the
 cost abroad was but as
 to any duty I have
 put in this bill I
 can tell him for I
 have reasons for putting them
 in i go to the
 merchants who are selling goods
 and ask the prices abroad
 and here too That is
 the way these steel duties
 were fixed in this bill
 had invoices of thirteen dif
 ferent kinds of steel with
 an affdavit that they were
 the prices as they were
 rendered at the Bos ton
 custom house and I fixed
 the rates upon that evidence
 Instead of the duty being
 260 per cent it is
 bat 20 per cent or
 within a very few per
 cent I think myself it
 is highly important that we
 should be looking for revenue
 and that we should resort
 to such articles as will
 bc pretty sure to briog
 it in articles of general
 consumption and put a moderate
 rate of duty on them
 do not hear anybody complain
 that this is too high
 or too low of the
 country and seek s to
 raise the revenue chiefly and
 mainly from others that do
 not come into competition with
 the domestic manufac tares That
 was the argument I used
 and in order to show
 how much fairer the ad
 valorem was how much more
 intelligently we could act upon
 it I said any of
 us could understand that by
 a duty of 20 per
 cent we were payincr one
 fifth the foreign cost He
 says how are we to
 ascertain the foreign cost We
 are to ascertain it by
 our system of appraisements As
 much as has been Said
 against it it has not
 yet been proved that in
 genefral l knowthere are exceptions
 the system has not worked
 well ln the first place
 if the appraisers think the
 invoice is a falsé one
 they may raise it according
 to the consul s cer
 tificate as to the price
 in the principal markets of
 the country from which it
 comes They com pare this
 part icalar invoice with those
 prices and in the next
 place if they suspect fraud
 they may take the revenue
 in kind so that we
 have almost every check which
 it is possible to impose
 upon it I say at
 any rate they would be
 fully as able to tell
 the value of the whole
 carff0 upon which you would
 put this ad oaLoretn tariff
 as to tell whether wool
 costs 24 or 23 cents
 upon which in the one
 case the importer would pay
 3 cents and the other
 9 Mr CLINGMAN I am
 rather inclined to vote for
 this provision I agree with
 the Senator from Virginia that
 there are very objectionable provisions
 in the bill which will
 cause me to vote against
 it but it strikes me
 that this is one of
 the few that is not
 liable to being vicious Now
 coffee tea and sugar since
 Louisiana has gone out Of
 the Union are ail productions
 that are not made in
 the present Union and all
 the taxes that the country
 pays on them therefore will
 go into the Treasury but
 the tax which is paid
 upon clothing iron c will
 go perhaps one halt in
 many instances three fourths to
 the manufactur ers I prefer
 therefore taxing those things as
 our object is to get
 a revenue throwing it as
 much as possible on those
 articles thate verybod yconsumes and
 manufacturers and all other persons
 in that way will be
 brought to support the Government
 by a tax When your
 object is to impose a
 tax you ought to make
 it bear upon everybody and
 think therefore that the Senator
 from Rhode Island is movin
 in the right direction Ido
 not admit that while sucar
 and coffee may be neces
 saries they are anv more
 neccssaries than cloth ing working
 tools made of iron and
 iron itself They all may
 stand on the same footino
 b I prefer therefore the
 tax in this shape and
 if he will cut down
 the other protective features in
 this bill and put them
 at 15 or per cent
 I will vote with him
 butat any rate this present
 provision I think is a
 good one and I am
 inclined to vote to adopt
 it Mr FOOT Mr President
 1 am inctined to vote
 for the amendment of the
 honorable Senator from Rhode Island
 so far forth at least
 as it im poses a
 duty upon tea and coffee
 and at the first when
 your national Treasury is literally
 empty when your Government is
 involved in a debt bf
 I seventy or eighty million
 dollars and when your current
 expenditures are largely outrunning your
 current income This is not
 the time nor the occasion
 to speak of the causes
 which have produced this condition
 of our national finances I
 speak only of the fact
 I speak only of the
 stern reality as it exists
 as it stands before us
 a reality which we have
 to meet and to meet
 it as best we may
 I doubt not the spirit
 of patriotism in the great
 masses of the American people
 is warm enough and strong
 enough to bear without complaint
 and without murmur a small
 import duty upon the article
 of sugar and that in
 addition to this they would
 bear without complaint and without
 murmur a small duty upon
 the articles of tea and
 coffee in order to enable
 the Government to discharge its
 pecuniary obligations to enable it
 to meet its cur rent
 expenditures and to enable it
 within a rea i sonable
 length of time to extinguish
 the public indebtedness Our hope
 and our confident hope is
 that we are about to
 inaugurate a more eco nomical
 administration of the affairs of
 this Gov ernment that the
 public credit and the public
 confidence are to be restored
 and strengthened and that the
 public debt will be paid
 so that after a brief
 period these dutiesavon these arti
 cles may be removed But
 just now sir we are
 called upon to provide the
 ways and means of meeting
 a present existing and pressing
 emer gency That emergency being
 passed this bur den if
 it may be regarded as
 a burden may be taken
 off I am aware sir
 that heretofore this duty upon
 sugar has been imposed for
 the twofold purpose of revenue
 and protection of protection to
 the great staple productions of
 smne two or three of
 the extreme southern States and
 of Louisiana in particular Itm
 aware that the recent action
 of that State may furnish
 a motive to some gentle
 men for abolishing this p
 rotectivc duty altogether But sir
 however strongly I may deprecate
 how ever strongly I may
 condemn the recent action of
 that State in the consideration
 of a question of public
 policy of this character in
 the considera tion of a
 question of mere political economy
 I would avoid even the
 appearance of being actu ated
 by any spirit of revenge
 of retaliation or of unkindness
 even towards an offending State
 The question of protection is
 not at all invoived in
 the imposition of this duty
 It is only writh us
 a mere question of revenue
 This we need and this
 we must have if we
 would maintain the credit the
 honor and the good faith
 of this Gov ernment At
 the present time you cannot
 dis pense with the whole
 or any considerable portion of
 this import duty which yields
 to your Treas ury 7
 000 000 annually You say
 you can make it up
 by a duty on tea
 and coffee and so indeed
 I you may but that
 does not at all lessen
 the bur I den upon
 the one hand nor increase
 your reve suggestion 1 was
 inclined to favor a reduction
 if nues upon the other
 It is a mere transfer
 of the not an entire
 removal of the duty on
 sugar raw duty or burden
 from one article of necessity
 and or brown sugar commonly
 so called This is an
 placing it upon another in
 neither of which is the
 article that enters very largely
 into the general question of
 protection involved consumption by all
 classes of people in the
 coun But do you propose
 to divide and equalize this
 try so that it has
 come to be counted among
 the duty between the three
 articles of sugar tea and
 prime necessaries of lift and
 for this rcason I coffee
 You do not in that
 case enlarge your should be
 glad to see it brought
 within the reach revenue upon
 the one hand nor lessen
 the burden of all especially
 of the poorer classes of
 the com il to the
 consumer upon the other Sir
 our present munity at the
 lowest rate But sir a
 more ma and want is
 more revenue in addition to
 ture reflection a more careful
 consideration of the that which
 arises from the sugar duty
 and other subject has induced
 me at least to question
 the articles As I befbre
 intimated it may be found
 policy the expediency of removinry
 or even ma to be
 necessary it may at all
 events be found terial y
 reducing the duty on sumar
 at the present to be
 expedient in order to carry
 on your Gov time The
 duty as p oposed by
 the original bill ernment in
 order to save the public
 credit and the TÅ he
 only question is whether we
 is a slight one and
 hardly perceptible by the con
 need the money If wearegmngtogetthe
 money i sumer it being
 but I cent upon the
 pound gi throezh these articles
 I should suppose the Sen
 ator from Virginia will not
 dispute that the duties are
 Rtir I hope the amendment
 will be adopted Mr HUNTER
 The Senator from Rhode Island
 says that I object to
 his amendment not upon its
 merits but on account of
 something else in the bill
 I object to it on
 account of the gen eral
 character of the bill I
 say if it laid a
 fair revenue tax on articles
 that entered generally into consumption
 I would not object to
 a tax on tea and
 coffee but I am unwilling
 to tc a Behemc of
 finance which puts almost prohibitory
 duties at any rate high
 protective duties on most of
 the articieg that enter into
 the necessary consumption upon the
 hundred pounds and about equivalent
 cies of tea and coffee
 also MI hencvcr such a
 Ine to the present ad
 valoron duty of 24 per
 cent as cessity exists and
 everybody knows that it nov
 I believe it is upon
 the originat cost exists the
 popular sentiment and the popular

 cheerfully respond to the demands
 of that a fraction of

 sum of 12 500 000
 The cc nsideration as I
 have before within a very
 small fraction and the aggregate
 of what nlay have been

 amount of hit y from
 this source alonc during be

 purposely avoided 6 000 000

 ten years Sir we t
 longs not legitimately to this
 subject can hardly afford to
 dispense with the whole o

 upon t bis theater rrhe
 A Il h rican any
 portion of this revenue at
 the present time people will
 take cognizance of thc fact
 and rnake 1861 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBFR the proper inquisition and
 pass the deserved and appropriate
 judgment upon it Entertaining the
 opinions which I have thus
 very briefly expressed in reference
 to the amend ment now
 pending before the Senate i
 shall give I my vote
 so as to rctain thc
 duty upon sugar as provided
 in the original bili of
 the House of Rep resentatives
 which provides a specific duty
 of 1 cent upon the
 pound and is just about
 equivalent to thæ existing ad
 valorem duty of 24 per
 cent upon the cost Mr
 1 did not desire to
 say a word upon this
 subject because I believe it
 is always unwise to make
 speeches on measures which you
 wish to hurry through but
 this sub ject of the
 duty on tea and coffee
 has not bcen very often
 discussed and I wish to
 say a word in I
 have always been opposed to
 relation to it taxing the
 prime necessaries of life My
 own feeling and I very
 often act more on my
 feelings than my judgment is
 against interfering with the duty
 on sugar My motives at
 this time are that in
 raisino a system of revenue
 it is wise and right
 that all the varied interests
 and various sections I one
 of the country should be
 taken care of who has
 no difficulty in saying that
 I am in favor of
 protection to American man ut
 ac turcs and Amer ican
 products of every kind Some
 gentlemen on I have both
 sides have a delicacy on
 that subject I believe too
 that in raisino revenue for
 none this country this great
 and extensive country as it
 was the other day and
 as I hope it will
 al ways be the duties
 required to meet the wants
 of the Government when properly
 distributed will protect every great
 interest of the country I
 do not look upon Louisiana
 as having left us I
 look upot that rather as
 the prodigal son who has
 run away at present but
 who will come back after
 awhile throwing himself upon our
 kindness and our protectiorv and
 thorefore if were ieft to
 myself would leave this protection
 to their great industrial interest
 sugar Other gentlemen think differently
 and in accordance with all
 rny motions in legislation 1
 go with a rnajority of
 those who act with me
 havinø no faith in my
 own judgment especially I trust
 to the aggregate judgment of
 those with whom I act
 They think it is wise
 to reduce thc duty upon
 sugar one fourth and put
 the remainder on tea and
 coffee which are in relative
 _positions with scvar and I
 yield to that I do
 not believe that this revenue
 upon tca and coffee is
 going increase the price at
 all The uniform practice of
 the world and of the
 tea and coffee producing countries
 especially has been to put
 on an export tax which
 is vaned from time to
 time to accommodate itself LO
 the unportation I remember that
 tax levied in other countries
 was the case with Cuba
 some years ago When we
 reduced thc duty on sugar
 they put on a slight
 to hear the honorable Senator
 from Vermont de clare that
 the party about to cömeinto
 power ex pected to conduct
 the Government upon more economical
 principles than has heretofore been
 I had supposed from the
 votes of Sena done tors
 on that side of the
 Chamber that they in tended
 to take a different course
 They have not only voted
 at this session to borrow
 35 000 000 but there
 is a provision in this
 very bill to bor row
 21 000 000 more making
 an addition of 56 000
 000 to the public debt
 and besides that they have
 carried through this body bill
 appro priating 121 000 000
 to the three Pacific railroads
 That is an addition to
 the indebtedness of the country
 of at one session Just
 t hink of it Oat
 preSent debt is about 69
 000 000 and here is
 to be an addition of
 177 000 000 to it
 am gratified however to find
 that the purpose is not
 to carry out that system
 Again the Senator from Pennsylvania
 says that he is very
 averse to lam very much
 pleased with that declaration but
 it does seem to me
 that his line of action
 is very in consistent Surely
 iron is a necessary put
 the question to a farrner
 whether he would rather give
 up his plows and axes
 or up his tea and
 coffee I think he would
 say he must have his
 working tools Ask a man
 whether his shoes and coat
 and blanket are more important
 to him than his tea
 or coffee and I think
 he Would be apt to
 say that the former stood
 in the first rank If
 thc honorable Senator will go
 of neces sariés with us
 in making a bill which
 relieves the com munity which
 chables those who are obliged
 to have these necessaries of
 life to get them on
 the cheapest terms he shall
 have my codpention But if
 it is merely limited to
 smne particular things which may
 be regarded as necessaries and
 the great burden nf t
 er all is to fall
 on what everybody is obliged
 to use so as to
 fall heaviest on the poor
 of the country I cannot
 go with him IVIt CAMERON
 A single word to the
 Sen ator from North Carolina
 He talks about the I
 want to know how a
 farmer will get farmers his
 tea and coffee they come
 from abroad Mr CLINGMAN Then
 why the plow dear by
 taxing thc material of which
 it is made I desire
 Pennsylvania to That is the
 question make plows but I
 wish her to make them
 and sell them at as
 cheap rates as tl lcy
 can be had else where
 I am willing to impose
 some tax on it I
 am willing to tax everything
 that is consumed but unfortunately
 the discrimination is ævrainst thc
 poor mainly it is against
 the necessaries of life and
 if you will look over
 the list you will find
 that those which are cheapest
 generally arc lux I should
 say tea and coffee were
 nearer to unes luxuries than
 other articles that we are
 speaking of WILSON The Senator
 from Vermont exportation tax to
 correspond l hat has been
 I expressed the hope that
 we are to have an
 Admin istration that is to
 be more ccononoical than the
 the case with the Brazilian
 coffee and I have concur
 with him in that hope
 and I trust looked with
 astonishment and wor der at
 the wis that that l
 ope is not to be
 disappointed V hat has been
 dom with which that Empire
 of Brazik ever however rnay
 bc the failings of the
 incom They always manage their
 affairs for the benefit of
 their and their people and
 ing Administration I do not
 think it becomes any I
 wish our people would pay
 a little attention to of
 the gentlemen who have sustained
 the past Administration to make
 any reflections in advance I
 do not believe this duty
 will in that subject should
 like to reduce the duty
 uon sugar Every body feels
 that that duty has been
 high thatyii never ought to
 have been so high as
 it has Euled 4for the
 past few yearsi have myself
 beenGn favor of its reduction
 and I am so still
 buts as tha Senator from
 Vermont has Saidi we cannot
 now sparo the money which
 We receive ffo m thdt
 sou rcc and besides 1
 do not wantito giVe aavobe
 liere that can be unders_tood
 by anybody inLthe country as
 having bcen Oaused by an

 action of Louisian r I
 regaid Louisiana a part of
 my country and whatever may
 be the action of that
 Statenowiil have undoubting to nfidence
 that timé will come and
 that not far istant when
 those wan dering States that
 have rushed out of the
 Union without the shade or
 the shadow a cnåses will
 see their errors at d
 will return to this Govern
 ment and in the future
 uphold the Constitution and the
 flag of our common country
 172herefoée do not wish to
 give a vote thabmay be
 supposed to strike at any
 of the peculiar interests of
 that State and besides we
 want the revenue to be
 de rived from sugar If
 the present rate of duty
 was not there by taw
 I might not consent to
 put it there would place
 it at n lower rate
 Now a single word in
 regard to the proposition to
 tax tea and coffee That
 we need an increase of
 révonue we all admit but
 tea and coffee for years
 have come into this country
 duty free They enter every
 family they are used in
 every cabin of the country
 if we here in the
 Senate amend this bili by
 putting a tax on tea
 and have the irnpression that
 it will fail in the
 House of It it be
 put in the bill although
 Represc n tatives it will
 gi ve us 4 000
 000 or 5 increased revenue
 it will be the theme
 of demagoguism all over the
 country The charge will be
 made thåt we h avc
 made a tariff for the
 protection of certain interests of
 iron in of textile I
 fabrics and that becausewc have
 madea protect ive tariff we
 have been forced to tax
 teaand coffee In 111 y
 judgment the friends of this
 measure had better not incur
 the opposition that may be
 made ill the I louse
 of Representatives had better not
 incur the hostilitv that may
 be excited in the coun
 try by imposing a lax
 on tea and coffee and
 so I fee constrained to
 vote against the believing proposition
 of lhc Senator from Rhode
 Island I know we have
 debts impending upon us forced
 upon us by extravaoance some
 perhaps by thc grossest dishonesty
 I hope that these things
 are to be corrected in
 the future but to day
 here and now I feel
 that my duty requires me
 to vote against the amendment
 moved by the Senator from
 Rhode Island Mr HALE I
 want to ask the Senator
 from Rhode Island a question
 I understand that he submitted
 an estimate of what would
 be the amount of duty
 on tea and coffee together
 sire to know if he
 is prepared to state to
 the Sen ate what it
 would be severally how much
 of it would come from
 tea and how much from
 coffee Mr SIMMONS i have
 not the paper here on
 which the estimate was made
 but I should think there
 was about two thirds of
 it from cof fee It
 is com Mr HALE lam
 glad to hear it mob
 in this discussion to speak
 of tea and coffee as
 if they occupied precisely the
 same relation to the consumption
 of the country and it
 is said that they are
 used in every cottage in
 every home however humble I
 apprehend that it is not
 true of them equally ahat
 what is true of tea
 is nat true of coffee
 Tea comes nearer to being
 con crease the price of
 tea and coflöe at all
 I never make appeals to
 the Senate or the coun
 1 you Mr President try
 about thc poor that the
 poor people are the least
 exacting of all the people
 of t his country Thev
 always take care of themselves
 As I said the other
 day give them protection to
 their labor and J mean
 by that give thern fair
 wages for what they do
 and they I have seen
 very few ask no other
 protection poor people in this
 country because I believe no
 man is poor who lives
 within his means The man
 who gets a dollar a
 day and lives within that
 dollar a day is as
 rich as the millionaire s
 vho lives up to his
 income That sort of people
 only want to get a
 fair price for their labor
 and to be protected against
 t be labor of other
 countries who have not the
 same virtue or the same
 intelligence and the same industry
 which they have All our
 revenue laws for the last
 ten or fifteen years havo
 tended to protect the pauperlabor
 of Europe which sends your
 false invoices in here and
 which drives I say I
 the Arnerican laborer frotn his
 supper shall for this alteration
 the stvat duty not frotn

 my own heart but because
 sviser nu n think it
 right IVIr CLINGMAN I was
 very muchgratified in regard to
 what the next Administration rnay

 the finances of the Government
 The present Administration came into
 power four years acro with

 with the creditofthe country hich

 sir the sidered a necessity

 that by Mr GRIMES I
 t is right t he

 that I am going on
 my joritv of the House

 pendituresofthis Government have been cut
 down i Nesv England habits
 and that while what I
 have said is true of
 New England it is not
 true of the by millions
 from what the Executive Departinents
 asked and their recommendations were
 generally West i know that
 among the people whom i
 represent it is eminently true
 that tea is an arti
 supported by their friends in
 Congress tare here to day
 to say that the record
 will show I cle of
 universal consumption among the very
 that those who are now
