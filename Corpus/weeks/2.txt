 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 181 that
 privilege We are not only
 compelled to recheck our baggage
 there but we are compelled
 to purchase tickets there and
 in many instances passencrers have
 missed their connections by this
 very detention Orjly thc other
 day when I came over
 the road there was a
 lady goincr into Vir ginia
 traveling alone who lost her
 Lyaco tve in consequencc of
 comino over the Pennsyivania Central
 railroad because she did not
 understand that it was necessary
 to recheck it at Baltimore
 She did not discover her
 mistake until she got It
 is a monopolv that is
 t vainst the nearly here
 interests of the traveling community
 and though we cannot interfere
 with that I will not
 give my vote to add
 to its privileges unless tbc
 evil com piained of be
 corrected Mr KENNEDY 1 have
 but one word to say
 aru i it is this
 if this amendment prevails believe
 it w iii nullify all
 the privileges asked for and
 not think this cmnpany can
 accept the bill If they
 do with such restrictions on
 it as these not check
 this baogaffe upon such terms
 as other companies may prescribe
 the whole act is nulli
 fied I becr that such
 a provision may not be
 inserted The question being taken

 Wasil inotnn ibiiU nad Cornpany
 road hereby granted and the
 property of said company con
 nected therewith shall be subject
 to taxation as real estate
 in the city of Washington
 to the same extent as
 the real estate Of individuals
 Mr KENNEDY 1 would rather
 not have that in for
 the same reasons which I
 stated when the Senator offered
 his amendment before not disposed
 to debate it Mr FESSENDEN
 This is new property which
 they propose to bring into
 the city The question is
 simply whether you mean to
 extcnd their exemption from taxation
 not only to what is
 now exempted but to what
 they may hereafter brivn Certainly
 nobody wouid conter d for
 that exclusive privilege Mr GREEN
 I desire to understand the
 amend If it simply embraces
 thc local property men t
 Mr FESSENDEN Idid not intcnd
 itshould embrace anything else The
 Senator can hear it It
 is very plain in its
 terms I think read agmn
 Mr GREEN If it cmbraces
 only that it is PRESIDING
 OFFICER Is the readin 0
 of the amendment asked for
 Mr HUNTER Yes sir The
 Secretary again read the amendment
 Mr GREEN broad The property
 connected therewith is thc language
 It Inay include passcmyer cars
 and freWht cars There ought
 to be something to guar
 acainst that The phraseolo ry
 ought to be 6 the
 local property Mr FESSENDEN 1
 am should alter it in
 that way I hat is
 my idea entirely Mr DOUGLAS
 1 am not willing to
 the a mcndment even with
 this modification It seems to
 me that the object of
 the amendment is to subject
 to taxation the right of
 way with the cost ol
 hc tunnel and the Inoney
 cxpended in It is an
 improve making it under the
 ground I ment that is
 to bc rri do at
 o reat expense under hill
 and really I do not
 think we ought t tax
 the underground work of this
 company taking the whole cost
 of the work as the
 basis of taxation t can
 be of no harm to
 the city of Washington to
 have the work done It
 is underground It does not
 release the land above from
 taxation There can be no
 loss of any kind to
 the city This IS a
 burden on thc cotnpany that
 I fear will defeat the
 I for one shall not
 performance of the work vote
 for it Mr FESSENDEN It
 is a new idea to
 me that taxation is based
 upon the cost of the
 thing II It was not
 111 y in I did
 not know that before a
 very heavy rate Of taxation
 On an objedt ought not
 to Inc sub ected tdtaxntf6n
 in that iVai i Mr
 FESSENDBN that it should bo
 so unless the corporåterautlior ities
 of Washington are all knaves
 They would never do anything
 ofthat sept Mr GREEN n
 tsened before property Mr FESSENDEN
 i that it shall bc
 taxable as i eat cstate
 M GREEN But you make
 everything con nected with the
 road taxable as real estate
 Mr FESSENDEN well 1 have
 no objec tion to making
 the modification Mr KENNEDY 1
 should like understand the amendment
 as it is now The
 Secretary read the amendment as
 modified as follows sand provided
 further That the extension of
 the said road hereby granted
 and the real property of
 said company cori nected therewith
 shall be Subject to taxation
 as real estate in the
 city of Washington to the
 same extent as the real
 estate of individuals Mr GREEN
 The word property should bc
 stricken out and estate inserted
 Mr KENNEDY Would it not
 be cific to say all
 buildings and lots Mr FESSENDEN
 They are real of course
 Mr KENNEDY That would leave
 the out The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Is the Senate ready or
 tho question on the amendment
 as mod The amendment was
 agreed to Mr FESSENDEN 1
 have I will state to
 thc Senator from mcnt to
 proposc Maryland and others that
 deem it very import ant
 exceedingly so that the corporate
 autliorities of the city should
 have for the protection of
 life and the protection of
 property some power to makc
 regulations with regard to thc
 running of these locomotivcs through
 streets Bv the bill as
 it now stands confined it
 to that they inay run
 their cn rit les through
 the Streets of this city
 within thc limits assigned by
 day or by night There
 is not a provision in
 the bill With reference to
 thc creclion of gates where
 they cross main streets going
 lhe whole length of the
 city or for lighting the
 crossinzs for the ring ine
 of bells 01 for anything
 They have power ri tention
 certainly if this work under
 the hill should cost hundred
 thousand dot I b lays
 and be no property in
 itself that it should be
 l taxed but where a
 certain amount of iron is
 laid down to rnakc the
 road bed that might very
 well be subjected to estimation
 and taxation Nobody can pretend
 Cor a moment that municipal
 COP poration would have u
 right in tho asscssment of
 II wiil be se en
 that the object of the
 amendment taxes to predicate its
 assessments upon what a thing
 happened to cost That is
 never done to is pu
 rely to accomrnodate local travel
 the Senator froin Maryland has
 no objection to my know
 edxe at all The idea
 of the amend I hope
 it will be agreed to
 I ment is simply this
 that where they have prop
 it Mr KENNEDY 1 will
 erty consisting ofa road iron
 and a depot con prefer
 that it were not put
 in the bill but as
 it is nected therewith or
 other arrangements turn deemed a
 matter of itnportance to persons
 on the li II tables
 if you like and ancfio
 ine house at the other
 side of the river and
 to persons travelin y I
 end of the city if
 they have one or anything
 of bctwecn here at ld
 Alexandria with such rest ric
 that sort it is propei
 ly taxable That is all
 I mean tio ns as
 are in the tunendment though
 would to convey by the
 amendment If the Senator from
 prefer the bill writhoul it
 I shall not Ol ject
 Missouri desires any modification in
 order to ex Mr CAMERON
 I think the amendment of
 I press that idea rnore
 definitely I have no objec
 the Senator from North Carolina
 is right an act of
 justicc to the company owning
 the road Mr GREEN Suppose
 you say real prop across
 the river and it ought
 to pass amendment was agreed
 to Mr FESSENDEN 1 have
 said estate I Mr DOUGLAS
 In making this tunnel The
 bill was t epotted to
 the Senate as amended The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr FOSTER in
 have to excavate a large
 amount of earth have then
 to erect an arch of
 brick I suppose the chair
 T be question is will
 the Senate con cur ill
 the amendments made as in
 Comnuttce of to prevent the
 earth from filling in I
 suppose the MT hole f
 no objection be made the
 question that those bricks that
 support the arch will be
 properly just as Inuch as
 the iron over which wilt
 be taken on Iliesc amcndments
 collectively In order to find
 ratio of taxa The arnendments
 were concurred in the cars
 run I suppose Mr FESSENDEN
 I wish to make another
 I t on under thc
 Senator s efibrt to protect
 the rights of the people
 here to it will be
 necessary to find out what
 the new toad is worth
 Onc of thc means of
 ascertaining it sotue extent and
 have modified my first prop
 and a verv satisfactory one
 n encrally is its cost
 osition and no iV move
 this amendEnent to con le
 what they VI hat they
 paid Ilie right of NV
 a y in at the
 ond of section one to
 which I presutne paid for
 excavating the Cunncl what they
 paid there will be no
 objection I think it ispått
 ing i nnd pyovidca further
 That the extension of the
 said fois the arch that
 supporte it to do the
 whole thing and there is
 no provision whatever and we
 cannot put in the necessary
 pro visions here havcdraughted this
 amendment so as to cover
 that and I think it
 very important for I move
 the protection of life and
 property both to insert at
 the end of the second
 section wluch o ivcs authority
 to use steatn posver Upon
 such tenns and conditions as
 the corporate authoro ities of
 the city of IVashington may
 impose thc safety o persons
 and property an t the
 said corporate authoritie arc authorized
 to prevent such use of
 steam power Within the corporate
 limits unless such terms and
 eonditions are ccnnplied with Mr
 BENJAMIN I would suggestan amend
 ment to the Senator from
 Maine There might be something
 ambiguous in the expression upon
 I propose to sub such
 terms and conditions subject to
 such rules and stitute for
 these words regulations Mr FESSENDEN
 1 will accept that The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The question is
 on the amendment as modified
 Mr FESSENDEN Rules and regulations
 should be put in both
 places where terms and I
 think that is an improve
 conditions occur ment and am
 much obli ed to the
 Senator for it The amendment
 W as agreed to Phe
 bill was ordered to be
 engrossed and read the third
 time It was read the
 third time The PRESIDING OFFICER
 The question is Shall the
