action on the resolutions, I would inquire of the chairman of the Corn Illit- tee on Printing why there is no recommendation for printing extra numbers of the report of the Post Offce Department
It is usual to allow them
Mr

I believe the resolutions are transcript of those heretofore reported from the committee
Last year, I think, the Post Office Department printea its own report, and•perbaps the resolution of last
year was modified on that account; and we may have been led into error this year from the absence of that clause; but I belicvc it proper to allow the head of that Depart- ment number of copies of his report, and on the motion of the Sellator so to amend the resolulions, I think it witl be acceded to by the Senzue at once
Mr
YULEE
lhope the amendment will be made
It was not included last year in the gcn- eral resolution, because it was ordered by a spe- Cial and separate resolution presented by myself

1 should like very much to have a vote on it to-day, if possible; but if it is deemed impossible to do that now, I should bc very glad to have the Senate appoint a day when If gentlemen's minds the vote shall be taken
are not made up upon it, I have no desire in the world to force this bill on the consideration of the body now
It is a bill of very great importance to the traveling community generally in the Uni- It was sornewhat discussed last ses- ted States

CLAIMS AGAINST MEXICO
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr
F00T in If there be no further busincss for the chair.) the morning hour, the bill (S
No
112) to fur- ther carry out lhc provisions of the fifteenth sec- tion of the treaty between the United States and Mexico, concluded on the 2d day of February, 1848, which was under consideéation at the last is now befin•e the Senate as in morning hour, Committee of the Whole, the pending question being on the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr
HALE] to insert, as an addi- tional section, the following: vend be it further enacted
'I'hat this act shall not take effect until the public debt of the United States shall have been paid
Mr
IVERSON
i propose to make a very brief statement of this bill, and then let the Senate decide upon it
MT hen it was up for considera- tion before, the Senator from Louisiana, not now in his place, [Mr
SLIDELL,] made some remarks in relation to the bill itself, and the claims that he supposes are covered it; and the Senator took occasion to say that by the treaty between the United States and Mexico, the United States agreed to pay to Mexico $15,000,000 for certain territory ded Mexico to the United States, and that that had all been paid
I do not suppose the Senator intended to niisrepresent the facts of the case, and hc made this statement through mere inadvertcnce
However, his remark would lead a person not conversant with the facts to believe that the United St.ates had paid to the Republic of Mexico in cash, and that this #3,250,000 was a different, an outside matter, which the Government of the United States was not called upon to respond to
That, however, 'i'he United States did agree is a oreat mistake
to pay to the Government of Mexico $15,006,000 as a consideration for the cession of the territory
Of that sum, $3,250,000 were seb apart by the treaty, with the consent of Mexico, to pay claims of Ahnerican citizens atyainst the Governrncnt of Mexico
The whole therefore, have not been paid
All was paid to the Republic of Mexico with the exception of the $3,250,000; and that sum, as I have said, vvras set apart by the Republic of Mexico in this treaty to pay the claims of the citizens of the United States against that Government, the Government of the United t States undertaking to pay those claims out of the $3,250,000, and to release the Government of Mexico from all obligation to pay those private claims
Under the provisions of the treaty a commis- Sion was established for the purpose of ascertain- ing those claims, and paying them out of these $3,250,000
'That commission sat in this place, and a large amount of claims svere adjudicated But• there remains of the fund of ai')d paid
$3,250,000 thus set apart by Mexico to pay the claims of individual citizens of the United States, #211,000, now in the '1' reasury
I therefore stated the case correctly when I said, the other day, that this was the money of Mexico, deposited in the United States Treasury to pay certain claims of citizens of the United States
The $3,250,000 was a part of the $15,000,000 which this Government NEw SERIES.....NO
7
•agreed to pay to Mexico for -the
cession of ter- ritory; and Mexico appropriated the $3 250,000 to pay the claims of United States citizens
Of course, therefore, the $3,250,000 was a fund be- longing to the Republic of Mexico, Which she placed as a trust fund in the hands of this Gov- ernment to pay the debts due to our citizens; and the whole $3,250,000 is justly due to such citi- zens of the United States as may have just and honest claims against the Government of Mexico
Now
sir, as I understand—and that is the foundation of this bill—there were some persons who had claims against Mexico, who did not pre- sent them to the original commission
One of these is a claim now held by the heirs of General Robinson, which has been before the Committee on Claims, and has been investigated and decided upon unanimously by that committee, on more than one occasion, to be a just claim against thé Government of Mexico, which ought to be paid
That amounts to fourteen, or fifteen, or sixteen thousand dollars; but-it v.,ras not presented to the original commission for the reason that the heirs- at-law in the case were minors, probably, and there was no person to represent them
it was not presented, and therefore has never been ad- judicated by the original board of commissioners, or any other commissioners
There is another claim, as the committee understand, of the heirs of Conunodore Porter—a pretty large claim ; how much it amounts to, I do not know
Whether it is a just claim or not, I do not know
All can say 'is, that it is a claim presented by the repre- sentatives of the estate of Commodore Porter; and that clailü, we understand, was never presented to thé original board of commissioners
There is also the Clair}), to which the Senator from Lou- isiana alludcd the other day, of Atocha
That is a claim existing and pressed
Whether it is a meritorious claim or not, I do not undertake to say, because I know nothing about it
The Sen- ator is opposed to the raising of this commission, because that claim may by possibility be adjudi- catcd by this board; and he says that it was be- fore the old- board originally, and was rejected on a question of law
Well, sir, if it was rejected on a question of law, it is precluded by this bill, and cannot be brought forward as a clann aoainst this fund
This bill 
provides that only such claims shall be adjudicated by this board as were not presented to ibe board formerly established; or if presented, were not decided on their merits
Now, sir, there may be merits of law as well as merits of fact; and if this claim of Atocha was overruled by the former board on the ground that -that it had it was illegal; that it was improper; no foundation in law; that it was not embraced within the terms of the treaty—then, as a matter of course, that is an adjudication which-will be in bar of any consideration by this board, so that it will do no harm whatever so far as that [f, on the other hand, that claim is concerned
or any other claim has never been properly adju- dicated, either for the want of sufficient
proof or on any other ground not affecting the merits of the claim and the right of tl'le claimant to recover froin the Government of Mexico, it seems to me nothing more than just and fair that this fund should be thrown open to the payment of it
was the intention of the parties, both the Amer- ican and the Mexican Governments, that all the just claims of American citizens against the 'Republic of Mexico should be paid out of the $3,250,000, if it was suffcient to pay them
Now, sir, if there be any just claims, any other meritorious claims that have not been paid, cer- tainly every principle of fairness and justice would require that this fund w)lich is in the Treasury of the United States, put there by Mexico for the express purpose of paving the just claims of our citizens, should be appropriated to the payment of thorn
I make this brief statement; it is all I have to I trust the amendment will say about the bill
not prevail, and that the original bill will pass
At any rate, I must insist on the Senate making an adjudication of the question, and deciding it  98 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

Mr
President— Mr
HALE, 'With the consent of the Senator from Maine, as the whole subject is befijre the Senate, I will withdraw the amendment I offered, and let the vote be on the
bill
The PRESIDING OFFICER
ing been had on the amendment, it is competent for the Senator to withdraw it
Mr
HAMLIN
It seems to me there are two points which såggest themselves to the consider- ation- of the Senate in this matter
The first one is, and goes -to the entire merits of the case, is it wise, or just, or proper, to open this commission at fill 
Mr
COLLAMER
To a new one
Mr
HAMLIN
To revive the old one or create new one
I think the Senate understood what I meant, if I did not use the most happy lan- guage in presenting the idea
T hc first point is this: whether we will create anew commission
There arc in the Treasury a little morc than two hundred thousand dollars ofthe fund wh ich our Govern rnen t originally .greed to pay, under our treaty with Mexico, to American claimants
Now, if there are claimants who never submitted their claims to the oricinal commission, it presents a case where I might very freely and very cheerfully institute a new commission for that purpose
I think there is eminent merit in doing that
If they were pre- vented from presenting their clairns by any cause which did not arise from their own neglect, it would be but just that those claimants should have a right to come in upon any amount of that fund which has not already been expended; and I think I would be disposed to institute anew commission for that purpose, and ti'hat purpose only
But the bill as it has been rerjorted to the Sen- ate, and as it now stands before the Senate, will amount to a revision of all the decisions that were ll)ade by the previous commission which were not favorable to the claimants; and I not believe that cither just or wise
More than that, ic seems to me that the language of the bitl itsclt• justify a new commission in (letcrminincr would upon claims which 111 ight have merit that hud no law to support them
I take it the treaty, and law passed in pursuance of the treaty, did prescribe precisely w•hat claims were to be paid from the fund
Now, there might have been a very great number of claims that had " merit' I think that is the word—there
might have been clainas that had eminent merit in them, but that were vet not ineludpd either within the treaty or the terms of the law; and what could the com- mission:do but exclude them on principles of law 
They had nothing to do with the terms either of of tho law, and the commission titeaty or could atljudic.ate upon them
language of' this bill covers claims which were cither not presented to the board" form- erly oppointcd, " or werc notadjudicated on their and authorizes this new merits by the sarnc,' board " to decide acc.ording to thc pro- visions of the s:aid treaty," and to pay tlkC amount derided favorably
Is it not a fair construction of' the language of this bill, to say that, if a clailn has Inerit in it, although it does -not come within the toyms of the original law, or the treaty on which the law was based, this new commission must consider it
It seems so to me
It is the fair deduclion to be drawn from it; and the com- missioner who may be appointedän pursuance of this bill, should it become a law, would, I say, be fairly called to adjudicate upon cases that 'i"Gcfi it would be setting had merit in them
everyt!.ling afloat, and you might (TO back to the *lion of this Government, and any man who ht flave a claim that had some original merit, and which, )erhaps, ought rightfuljy to have been include( in sonle treat.y, would present it, and demand that the commission adjudicate upon such a clain), and pay it to him
It is a perver- Sion of snit•it of both the treaty and the law to divert this fund to such a purpose
I-lavii-rr indicated that I am disposed to rein- state a cepnunission for the purpose of adjudicating upon claikns that never have been pre- sented, I will propose—the Senator from New Hampshire havino' withdrawn his amendment— to strike out of this bill the words which I have enclosed in brackets in the printed copy which I to make one other slight amendment
That will confine the commission to the adjudication of claims that have never been presented; and if there are such, I am disposed to aid them; but not to open this matter aoaii'l to all the claims that have once been decided upon, whether-they have what is technicåily called " merit" or not
I move to strike out in section one, lines sixteen, seven- teen, and eighteen, the words, " or were not ad- judicatcd on their merits by the same, and to decide thereon according to the provisions of the said treaty;" and also to strike out the word " either," in the fourtecn'th line

Certainly, do that triqdcr the rulcs of the Senate without in y consent; but if it wore otherwise, I would give my consent most cheerfully

thirteenth and fourteenth arti- cles recite the fact of existing claims against IViex- ico on tl')e part of American citizens, some of which had been adjudicated, and some of which had not; and the fifteenth article exonerates Mex- ico entirely from all those claims by American citizens, and agrees (which is a common form of treaty stipulation on the part of the United States) to be answerable all claims ofBAmerican citi- zens upon that Government arising from that exoneration, to an amount not exceeding the sum of $3,250,000
Tl'he article then goes on to provide that a board of cmnmissioners shall be established for thc purpose of deciding upon the validity of all ciaims presented to that board which were claims of citizens of the United States against Mexico
Under the law passed to carry the treaty into efli•ct, commissioners were appointed; thcy adjudicated upon all the claims prescntod to them —very unfort.unately on some; and by their final adjudication, it appeared that, all the claims, even with the allowance of the fraudulent claim of Gardiner, did not equal the amount which the United States'limited as the ultimate sum which they would pay in satisfaction of the claims
At a subsequent session ofCongress complaints were made of the fraud connected with the Gar- diner claim, and there were also more than sixty petitions presented to Congress, complaining of irregularities in the decisions of the commission- crs, and presenting other claims outside of the decisions
A special committee was raised in the Senate at the first session at which became a member of the body
Of that committee I was In the investigation which was had by the one
committee, we examined every petition; we gave public notice to the people of the United States for all claimants to come in and present any claims that they had, because one of [he questions sub- mitted to us was: whether, as there was a resi- duary fund, we would advise the creation of a new commission, in order to decide upon existino• outstanding claims
After reviewing all those send to the desk; and I think it will be necessary i claims, and investigating the Gardiner claim, with great labor, the committee arrived at the conclu- Sion of reporting in favor of but two claims that were then presented to us, and none whatever other than those that were presented to us; and although fulLnotice was given to the worl(l, none of the claims now adverted to came before that committee
Now, what is the proposition
The United States made a treaty twelve years ago
Under that treaty, and by the law which was passed in pursuance of it, they exonerated Mexico from the claims of their own citizens, and they agreed pay all those claims, provided they did not ex- ceed a certain amount
All the claimants had notice
They did not choose to come in to the first commission; they did not choose to come in before a special committee of the Senate, who had power to recommenda second commission, if the circumstances justified it
They slept over their rights, if any they had; and now, at the lapse of twclvc years, they come in and ask you to raise a new commission—on what ground
On the ground that this is a specific surn of money re- mainino• in the Treasury, which would be the property of Mexico if the United States did not i have to pay it to the claimants
I deny that, as any just conclusion from the treaty with Mexico
There is no stipulation to pay a cent to Mexico except the $15,000,000
It has been paid
We stipulated to pay ail our own citizens' claims pre- cisely as we did in the Florida treaty of 1819
We there agreed, in consideration of the convey- ance by Spain of the Floridas, that x.ve would assume all claims of the citizens of the United States upon the Government of Spain, and that we would appoint a board for the purpose of their adjudication, and would pay them an amount not exceeding #5,000,000
rl*hat board sat, and be- fore that board the claims were presented
They allowed many, and disallowed many; and the amount that they did allow was not paid beyohd ninety-two per cent

IV'Ir
Meade's, among other claims, was ruled out
has been in your halls of Congress, in order to get at an adjudication of it by special act of Con- gross, ever since
Have you done it
No
What is the danger of the principle here 
Where you have with a forei«yn nation stipulated for and obtained, by means of a benefit derived to yourself, the right of the payment of claims of your own citizens, and have assumed them, and when you give them all fair notice to come in before a commission regularly appointed, and present those claims, and they refuse to do it, on •what principle is it that you can afterwards ap- point a new commission
If you can do it on I thc ground of the gross neglect of the parties in not having presented their claims, il would be a much stronger ground if there happened to be a difference of opinion on the part of the Senate ag to any particular claim, and they thought the commission had erred in its decision
case, there would be a stronger ground for allow- ing that claim to come in, because the party there had dono all he could do—he had shown dili- gence, at least; the others have not; and if there had been an error in the judgment, you would be much Inore bound to correct it than you would, in the casc of a negligent party, to give him an opportunity to c.on')e before a newe commission
In In y judgment, the decision is final
Where a Government, acting for its citizens, obtains for them what they could not otherwise obtain, and gives fair notice to all parties to present, for the purpose of authentication and judicial decision, their claims, and they refuse to present them, they arc entirely barred
If this monev, this balance, belonged to Mexico, I should agree cn- tirely with the houorable Senator frot1) Georgia, that it is not our moncy, and that we might raise a second commission if the claimants would come in, or we
should be bound to pay it to Mexico
Rut, sir, read the stipulations of the treaty
There is no semblance of such a claim on the part of Mexico there
The United States were to pay these claims out of their own money, out I of the general funds in the Treasury
They we•re t to appoint a commission to ascertain them, and they did so
Before that commission, every claim presented was heard
Some \vere rejected, sorne were admitted; and the annount admitted did not exhaust, not a separate fund, but the limit which the United States agreed that they would pay
Does that give any right to the neg-  1860

ligent afterwards to come in
Besides, they had public notice further from the action of the spe- Cial committee of the Senate in 1852—53, that they would be heard if they came in then; and onc of the very questions before that committee was whether there had been, in the conduct of the commission, such negligence or such dis- regard of the frights of American citizens as to justify the recommendation of anew commission, and the committee decided unanimously against that; but they reported in favor of special action in two claims
I can say, for myself, that I ex- amined evcry petition personally, read them all at tho cost of weeks and months of labor, and I am sure I am not wrong as to the facts, and that the decision of thecommittee was, as I mentioned, that there was no ground prcsentcd to them from any source whicÅ would either justify or require the United States to establish a new commission
That was in 1853
sir, is not this a suffcient answer to the argument of the honorable Senator from Georgia 
He assumes the fact that the $3,250,000 was ap- propriatcd by Mexico out of the $15,000,000 we had agreed to pay her
He is mistaken, I think; clearly mistaken
Article thirteen stipulates ex- pressly for the payment to the Government of Mexico of in cash and It has been all the rest in annual installments

The matt.cr of claims is totally distinct
The is a mere limitation
we had exonerated Mexico from all the claims of our cit- izens, which the Government had the power to do; and in consideration of that we aqrreed that if those claims were presented to a board created under our laws, and adjudicated in favor of the claimants, we would pay them to the cxtent of $3,250,000; and yet the claims prescntcd and al- How docs lowed did not amount to that sum

in this case, why should you refuse to do it ill) the case of the treaty with Spain of 1819
Why refuse to do it in the case of the trcaty with France of 1833
There is scarcely a treaty we have necrotiated in reference to the payment by the United States of claims of their citizens against a foreign country in which there is not a •limita- tion of the amount that we agree to pay; and in all those cases, if this precedent be established, you will be bound to pay, for there is no special fund here any more than there is ill any other In one

I think that the amount did not roach the limit

We have every vayiety of treaties of that kind; and under many of them the amount did not reachi the limit
MT het,her it did or not would be perfectly immaterial, if you establish the prin- ciple that you will readjudicatc or rehear them in this M..ray

'If at the lapse of twelve years, why not at the lapse of twenty, when all the facts have been,oblitcrated and there is no power on the part of the Government to get at them
I bmit, Mr
President, that there is no ground for the passagc of this bill to provide for these claims which have had a privilege that, I believe, in no other case have claims of this character had accorded to them, of an investigation, by a special committee, of the entire proceedings of the board of commissioners under the treaty with

If the claims did not come I do not know that there has been any mind
to that amount, it was only bound to pay the encroachment upon the rights of any section of amount of the adjudication; and if they exceeded the country since that time; I came here, therefore, that amount, it was only to pay to that extent

December 17, pressible by the law of the country
I suppose that IS the case now; because if these outrages against northern citizens were really authorized by the State authorities there, were they a foreign Gov- ernment, everybody knows, if it were the strong- est GoVernmént on earth, we should declare war upon her in one day
But what has caused this great excitement 
Sir, I will tell you what i suppose it is
not (and I say it frankly) so much blame the people of the South; because they believe, and they are 'led to believe by all the information that ever comes before them, that we, the dominant party to-day; who have just seized upon the reins of •this Government, are their mortal enemies, and stand ready to trample their institutions un- der foot
'They have been told so by our ene- mies at the North
Their misfortune, or their fault, is that they have lent a too easy ear to the insinuations of those are our mortal ene- mies, while they would not hear us
Now I wish to inquire, in the first place, hon- cstly, candidly, and fairly, whether the southern gcntlemen on the other side of the Chamber, that complain so much, have any reason&ble grounds for that complaint—I mean when they are really informed as to our position
Northern Democrats have solnctimes said that we had personal liberty bills in some fcw of the States of the North, which somehow trenched upon the rights ofthe Sou th under the fugitive bill to rocapture their runaway slaves; position that in not more than two or three cases, BO far as I can see, has the slightest foundation in fact; and even of those where it is mostcomplained of, if the provis- ions of their law are really repugnant to that of the United States, they are utterly void , and the courts would declare them so the moment you brought them up
Thus it is thal I glad to hear the candor of those gentlemen on the othcr side, that they do not complain of these laws
The Senator froin Georgia [Mr
IVERSON] himself told us that they had never suffered any injury, to his knowl- edge and belief, from those bills, and they cared noihing about them
The Senator fron•i Virginia (Mr
MASON] said the same thing; and I be'licve the Senator from Mississippi, [Mr
Bnowx.] You all, then, have given up this bone of contention, this matter of complaint which northern melli have set forth us u gricvuncc more than any- bod else
Islr

Will the Senator indulge me onc moment
Mr
WADE
Certainly
Mr
MASON
I know he does not intend to misrepresent me or other gentlcmcn here
What I said was, that the repeal of those laws would furnish no cause of satisfaction to the southern States
Ouropinionsofthose laws sve crave freely
MT e said the repeal of those laws would give no satisfaction
Mr
WADE
Mr
President, 1 do not intend to misrepresentanything
landerstood those gen- tlemen to suppose that they had not been injured by then)
I understood the Senator from Virginia to believe that they were enacted in a spirit of hos- tility to the institutions of the South, and to ob- ject to them not because the acts themselves had done them any hurt, but because they were really a stamp of degradation upon southern men, or something like that—I do not quote his words
The other Senators that referred to it probably in- tended to bcunderstood in the same way; but they did acquit these laws of having done them injury to their knowledge or belief
I do not believe that these laws were, as the Senator supposed, enacted with a view to exas- perate the South, or to put them in a position of degradation
Why, sir, these laws aoainst kid- napping are as old as the common law itself, as that Senator well knows
To take a freeman and forcibly carry him out of the jurisdiction of the State, has ever been , by all civifized countries, ad- judged to be a great crime; and in most of them, wherever I have understood anything about it, they have penal laws to punish such an offense
I believe the State of Virginia has one to-day as stringent in all its provisions as almost any other not so much to point out any specific acts that northern people had done injurious to your prop- erty, as what he took to be dishonor and a deg- radation
I think I feel as sensitive upon that If I know myself, I subject as any other man
am •the last man that would be the advocate of any lav.r or any act that would humiliate or dishonor any section of this country, or any individual in it; and, on the other hand, let me tell these gen- tlemen I am exceedingly sensitive upon that same point, whatever they may think about it
I would rather sustain an injury• than an insult or dis- honor; and I would be as unwilling to inflict it upon others as I would be to submit to it myself
I never will do either the one or the other if I know it
I have already said that these gentlernen who make these complaints have for a long series of years had this Government in their own keeping
They belong to the dominant majority
I may say that these samc gentlemen who rise up on this floor and draw their bill of indictment against us, have been the leaders of that dominant party for many ycars past
Therefore, if there is anything in the legislation of the Federal Govermnent that is not right, you, and not we, arc responsible for it; for we never have been invested with the power to modify or control the legislation of the country an hour
I know that charges have been madc and run& in our ears, and reiterated over and over ao•ain, that we have been unfaithfel in the execution of your fugitive bill
Sir, that law is exceedingly odious to any free people
It deprives us of all the old guarantees of liberty that the Ancrlo-Saxon race everywhere have con- sidered sacred—more, sacred than anything else
Mr
GREEN
Will the Senator from Ohio allow me t.o say a word
Mr
WADE
Certainly
M.r.GREEN
is simply this: It has becn said Y; at the practical operation of thc so-called liberty bills of the North has not affected any- body; but they do act as evidonce ofa public son- tin')ent adverse to the execution of the Federal law to reclaim our slaves under the Constitution; arid a repeal of those laws would not be worth onc single straw while the sentiment remains
I know fro Ell) practical observation that in nine cases out of ten you cannot catch a fugitive slave; and I know more than that; you forfeit your life when- cvbt• you make the attempt
One word rnore: when it is said that thig fugi- tive slave law is obnoxious to the North, and runs counter to these old guarantees concerning per- sonal liberty, say that the recovery of fugitives from justice is, under the Constitution and under the la•w, just as summary without trial by jury, and must or necessity be so
Why is not the same cotfplaint made about forgers, and murder- ers, and scoundrels tbat steal

the gentleman of which you complain
I have not looked over says, if I understood him, that thcse fugitives the statute-books of the South; but do not doubt be turned over to the authorities of the that there will be found this species of legislation State from whence they came
That would be a very poor remedy for a free man in humble circum- upon all your statute-books
Here let me say, because the subject occurs to stances who was ttiken under the pfovisions of Where he came from
There is no law that re- quires that he shoutd be Carried there
Sir, if he is a free man he may be carried into the market place anywhere in a slave State; and what chance has he, a popr, ionorant individual, and a stranger, of asserting any rights there, even if tllere were no prejudices or partialities acrainst him
That would be the mere mockery of justice and nothing else, and the Senator ••.vell knows it
Sir, I know that from the stringent, surnmary provisions of this bill, free men have been kidnapped and carried into captivity and sold into everlasting slavery
Will any man who has a regard to the sovereign rights of the State rise here and complain that a State shall not make a law to protect her own people against kidnappino• and violent seizures from abroad
Of all men, I believe those who have made most of these complaints should be the last to rise and deny the power Ofa sovereign State to protect her own citizens against any Federal legislation whatever
These liberty bills, in my i judgment, have been passed, not with a view of degrading the South, but with an honest purpose of guarding the rights of their own citizens from I was exceed- unlawful seizures and abductions
ingly glad to hear that tl')e Senators on the other side had arisen in their places and had said that the repeal of those laws would not relieve the case from the diffculties under which thcy now labor
How is it with the execution of your fugitive biEE
Sir, I have heard it here, I have read it in the papers, I have met it everywhere, that the people of the frec States, and especially the great Rebublican party, were unfaithful on this subject, and did not properly execute this law
It has been said, with such a tone and under such circum- stances here, that, althoucyl) Iwas sure that in the State from which I coine these insinuations had no foundation in truth, I could not rise here and repel them in the face of those that say, •we will not believe a single you say
never did, and I never would, until our enemies, those who havo ever opposed us and who have censured us upon this subject, had arisen here in their places, and at lenffth, with a mao•nanimity that I com- mend, have said that this was not so
col- league, with a mao•nanimity for which give him Iny thanks, has stood forth here to testify that in the Slate which I in part represent, the Republi- can courts and the Republican juries have fulfilled this repulsive duty with perfect faithfulness
So said the Senator from Illinois, [Mr
DOUGLAS',] and if I understood him, so also said the Senator I from Indiana, [Mr
FvrcH.] Therefore, sir, this calumny upon us is removed so far as the state- ment of our political enemies can make the aver- ment good
I know that our courts, when a case is brouo•ht before t.hcm—l do not care wl')at their politics may be—feel bound to administer the law just as they find it; and let rnc say to gentlemen from thc South upon the other side, whcrc you have lost one slave from the unfaithfulness of our legislative or judicial tribunals, we have had ten men murdered by your mobs, frequently under circumstances of the most savage character
Why, sir, 1 can hardly take up a paper—and I rely, too, upon southern papers—which does not guve an account of the cruel treatment of some man who is traveling for pleasure or for business in your quarter; and the lightest thing vau do is to visit him with a vigilance committee, and coin- pel him to return: you so loncrto make your way out of our coast
What is the accu- sati on." -VVhy, sir, you are from Ohio." They do not even inquire what party he belongs to, or what standard he has followed
I say this is the case, if I may rely on the statements of your own papers; and rnany of these outrages occur under circumstances of cruelty that would disgrace a savage; and we have no security now in travel- in(r ill nt•arly one half of the Union, and espe- cia}ty the gulf States of this Confederacy

il constituents are guilty of all these things, can  1860

101 stand forth and accuse us of being unfaithful to the Constitution of the United States! Gentlemen had better look at home
Gentlemen, it will be very well for us all to take a view of all the phases of this controversy before we come to •such conclusions as seem to I make have been arrived at in some quarters
the assertion here that do not believe, in the history of the world, there ever was a nation or a people where a
law repugnant, to thc general feel- mng was ever executed with tho same faithfulness as has been your most savagc and atrocious fugi t.i ve bill in the You yourselves can scarcely point out any case that has come before any north- ern tribunal in which the In-w has not been en- forced to the very letter
You ought to kilOW these facts, and you do know them
You all know that when a law is passcd anywhere to bind any people, x.vho feel, in conscience, or for any other reason, opposed to its execution, it is not in human nature to enforce it with the same cer- tainty as a law that meets with thc approbation of the great mass of thc citizens
Every rational man understands this, and cvery candid naan will admit it
Therefore it is that .1 do not violently impeach you for your unfaithfulness in the exe- cution of many of your laws
You have in South Carolina a law by which you talce free cilizcn.s of Massachusetts or any other maritime State, W' ho visit t.he city of Charleston, and lock them up in jail under the penalty, if they cannot pay the jail- fees, of eternal slavery staring thern in the face— a monstrous law, revolting to tho best Ilie.ling.s of hum-unity and violently in conflict with the Con- I do not say this stitution of the United States
by way of recrimination; for the excitcmpnt per- vading the country is so great that I do not wish to add a single coal to [hc flanoe•, but never- theless I wish the •whole truth to appear
Then , sir, '.vhat is it of which complaint is made
You have bad the legislati ve power of the try and you have had the Id.xocuti ve of the country, as I have said already
You own the Cabinet, you own the Senate, and, I n•nay add, you own the President of the Uj)itcd States as mtich as you own the servant upon your own plantation
[Laughter.] I cannot see, then, very clearly, why it is that southern men can rise here and complain of the action of this Governrnent
I have already shown that it is perfectly impossible for you now to point out any act of which the Republican party can possibly be guilty, of which you complain; because at no period yet have they had the power of making any rule or regulation or law that could , by possibility, affect you ; and, therefore, I under- stand that when Senators rise up herc to justify thc overthrow of this Government, to break it
up, to resolve it into its original elelnents, they do so upon the ruere suspicion that the Republican party rights or violate tho may somehow affect their Constitution
Sir, what doctrines do we hold detrimental to you
is the next inquiry that I wish to rnake
Arc we the setters fin'tll of uny new doctrines under tbc Constitution of thc United States
I tell you nay
r I'here is no princip]c held to-day by this great Republican party that has not had the sanction of your Government in every depart- ment for more than seventy years
You have changed your opinions
We stand where we used Tl'hat is the only diffcrenco
Upon the to stand
slavery question,' the only doctrine you can find touching it in our platform or our action, the only I position we occupy in regard to it, is that forn'lcl'iy occupied by the most revered statesmen of this nation
Sir, we stand where Washington stood, where Madison stood, where Jefferson stood, where Monroc stood
We stand where Adams and Jackson, and even Polk, stood
That revered statesman , Hen ry Clay, of blessed memory, with his dying breath asserted the doctrine that we hold to-day
Why, then, are we held up before the community as violators of your rights
You have coine in latc in the day to accuse us of l')ar- boring these opinions
I ask, then, what doctrines do we hold of which you can rightfully complain
You have pointed out none
You do not complain of the execution of the fugitive slave bill; you do not complain of the liberty bills; you do •-not complain that Mr
Lincoln is a violent rnan, who vv•il! probably do you any injury
The Senator from Georgia told us that he 'had no apprehenslons that M Y
Lin- coln, m his administration, would do any act in violation of your rights, or in violation of the I subject
I do not know how that is; I have not resorted to all these old records; but I believe; Constitution of the United States

IVERSON
•Will the Senator allow me cedent sct by your own Governors; but whether to ask him when I said Chat

words, but I believe I have them here

IVERSON
The Senator is mistaken

WADE
Then 1 would thank the Sena- moral, many of the States have refused to sur- tor to repeat what his remark was on that point; render fugitives under such circumstances; and' I for I understood him as I have stated
am far from saying that they are not right'
How- Mr
IVERSON
I 
refer the Senator to the ever, it is a question of law about which I leave record of my speech 
legal gentlemen to their own opinion
Certainly, MI'
'WADE
I think it is there
I understood you can draw no inference acyaingt lhc Governou• the Senator expressly to say what I have stated— of Ohio for following precedents that had been will look up the Sentence—that he had not any set, if am rightly informed, by your own Gov- apprehension that Mr
Lincoln would do any- ernor, and especially wihen one of the most con- thing in violation of the Constitution of thc Uni- servative men that I know, now a resident of ted States; but the Senator's grievance, as I un- your own State, and one of the best lawyers, I derstood it, was, that a hostile chief magistrate presume, either in that State or Ohio, _laid down might, within the power of the Constitution, so the rule as a precedent on which Governor Den- administer the Government as to do away with I nison went
All this is entirely aside from the slavery in ten years
That is what I understood issue; it is a question affecting the return of fuci- him to say

IVERSON

proves tbc act of his Governor in this case
Mr
WADE
It is of no great consequence I Mr
WADE
I do not care to be catechised what the Senator said on that subject
I will only on a question of law arising incidentally here; say that from Mr
Lincoln's character and con- and the reason is, because should want to go duct, frorn his youth up, you have no right to more deeply into the precedents and history of draw any inference that he will trespass upon the that kind of adjudication than Iam now prepared rights of any man; and if you harbor any such I certainly cannot condemn the Governor suspicion, it is in consequence of an unwarranted for
of Ohio for acting in accordance with that which prejudice, and nothing else
everybody may well sce might exist everywhere
Now, sir, I should like to have the Senators on I would like to answer us a judge would on the the other side tell me when ever a Republican has bench, when inquired of as to what is the law

The Senator does Mr
POWELL
The Senator from Ohio will not meet the question
He speaks in eulogy of allow me
He seems to assert that wo have made the Republicans, as having executed the fugitive no specific charges affainst any Republican
-Why, slave law
I would ask that honorable Senator in the very few remarks which I made in the SIP, if he himself is in favor of the rigid execution of running debate a few days ago, I called the Sen- the fugitive slave law
It is unnecessary to be atop's attention to the act of the present Governor I wish to dealing in this kind of generalities
Dennison, of Ohio, who refused to deliver up a know from the honorable Senator himself, as one fugitive from justice from the State of Kentucky, of the leaders of his party, if he stands here to charged with the offensc of negro stealing
I wish proclaim to thc Senate, and to the country that he to know from the Senator, whether or not he IS in favor of executing the fugitive slave law; .jl_tstifies or approves of the action of Governor and I wish further to ask the Senator if the Re- Dennison in that case
That is a specific and publican Legislature of the State of Ohio has not direct charge upon the rocord
I have the record passed a statute backing up Governor Dennison I have the opinion of the attorney before me
in the decision to which I have referred, and general and Governor of Ohio setting forth dis- whether or not he approves of that legislation
tinctly that they refused to deliver that fugitive Mr
WADE
Mr
President, 1 do not know from justice, because he was not charged with an that I am a witness in this case; and certainly not offense that was a crime under the laws of Ohio, to answer all tile law quest-ions in the world
or the con)mon law
I wish to know distinctly l, I have told the Senator all that I [Laughter.] from the Senator whether he justifies his Governor think I ought to tell him
I am for the execution in that act
of any law that isa law; but am not here argu- Mr
WADE
The Senator has asked me a endo, on the spur of the occasion, to attempt to question that is a little difficult: it is a subject on decide what that law is on a disputed question
It isa which lawyers and judges may differ
I will never do that
[Mr
POWELL rose.] I question that I have investigated a little since it would rather not be interrupted, because nothing was up incidentally before
I know' that the prae- I tice of the different States has been variant upon I I do not 'ask the can corne of these questions
it; but B,'ir
Stanberry, now a citizen of the Sen- Senator any questions, and I do not like to bc ator's own State, and, I bclicve, one of the first questioned in this way, because it leads me Off lawyers in it, gave an opinion precisely like that from the train of rny argument
Mr.,P01MELL
of Mr
Dennison, upon which the present attor- noy general of Ohio founded his; and he says hc'li that are mala in se

 102 and I shall talk to you, my southern friends, pre- tention on the part of the to THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, December 17, Mr
WADE
Mr
President, 1 do choose to be catechised on these subjects Mr
POWELL
1 not
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Me
FOSTER in the chair.) The Senator from Ohio has the floor, unless he chooses to yield it
Mr
WADE
think 1 have made the answer to the Senator that I ought tomalce under the circumstances
Mr
POW ELL
if the Senator will allow me, I will say
that I have a resolution The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from Ohio give way 
Mr
POWELL
A resolution passed by the Republican State convention of his State in June last— The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from Ohio give way to the Senator from Ken- tucky 
Mé
WADE
I would rather continuc my ar•umcnt
Mr
POWELL
Will the Senator allow me to catechise him on that resolution 
Mr
WADE
No, sir; I will not be catechised any further
Mr
POWELL
1 suppose not
I would then say to the honorable Senator that he should not ask for special cases unless he is willing to be cat- echised and face the music on them
Mr
WADE I will not bc catechised upon the Levitical lay, or any other law, under these circu«mstances
It is very easy to ask a creat many questions that a man is not prepared to an- swer, especially a lawyer or a judge
I do not think there is any great difhcult•y involved in the questions that the gentleman puts; but they nre out of place; they are entirely disconnected with thc course of argument that I am put•suinff
Mr
POWELL
me, I will remind him that hc called upon Senators on this side o
thc Chamber to specify
Mr
WADE
I called upon tbcm to specify what they complained of in regard to the fugitive slavc bill, and the gentleman has got up a case where hc says the Governor of Ohio refused to issue his •,varrant to deliver up a fugitive from justice; and then hc catechises me us to whether I am in favor of tho decision or against it, or the legislation founded upon it
I do not
know any- thing about either, more than I havc statcd
Now, Mr
President, I have shown, I think, that the dominant nuijority here have nothing to complain of in the legislation of Congress, or in the •legislation of any of the States, or in the prac- tice of the people of the North, under the fugitive slave bill, except so far as they say certain State legislation fi.n•nishcs some evidence of hostility to their institutions
And here, sir, I beo• to make an observation
I tell the Senator, and I tell all the Senators, that tho Republican party of the north- ern States, so far as I know, and of my own State in particular, hold the sarnc opinions with to this peculiar institution of yours that are Tield by 8.11 the civilized nations of the world
We do not differ f'rom the public sentiment of England, of France, of Germany, of Italy, and overv other civilized nation on God 's earth; and I tell you frankly that you never {bund, and you never will find, a free community that are in love with your peculiar institution
The Senator from Texas [Mr
WIGFALL] told us the other day that eotton was king, and that by its influence it would gov- ern a'll creation
He did not say so in words, but that was thc substance of his remark: that cotton was king, and that it had its subjects in Europc who dared not rebel against it
Here let me say to that Senator, in passing, that it turns out that they are very rebellious subjects, and they are talking very disrespectfully at present of that king that he spoke of
They defy you to exer- cise your power over them
They tell you that they sympathize in this cont.roversy with what you call the black Republicans
Therefore I hope that, so far as Europe is concerned at least, we shall hear no more of this boast that cotton is king; and that he is croing to rule all the civilized nations of the world, and bring them to his foot- stool
Sir, it will never bc done
But, sir, I wish to inquire whether the southern people are injured by, or have any just right to com- plain of, thåt plattörm of principles that we put out, and on which we have elected a President and Viceæresidcnt
I have no concealments to make, cisely as J would talk upon the stump on the sub- I tell you that in that platform we did lay it down that we would, if we had the power, pro- hibit slavery from another inch of free territory I stand on that position under this Government
to-day
I have argued it probably to halfa mil- lion people
They stand there, and have commis- sioncd and cnjoincd me to stand there forevcr; and, so help me God, I will
I say to you frankly, genticmcn, that while we hold this doctrine, there is no Republican, there is no convention of Re- publicans, there is no paper that speaks for them, there is no 0K1tor that sets forth their doctrines, who ever pretends that they havc any right in your States to interfero with your peculiar insti- tution; but, on the other hand, our authoritative platform repudiates the idea that we have any right or any intQtion ever to invade your pecu- liar institution in your own States
Now, what do you complain of
You are going to break up this Government; you tire going to involve us in war and blood, from a more suspi- cion that we shall justify that uphich we stand everywhere pledged' not to do
-Would you be justificd in the c yes of the civilized world in taking so monstrous a Ijosition, and predicatincy it on a l)are, groundless suspicion
xvVe do not love slavery
Did you not know that before to- day
before this session commenced
Have you not a perfect confidence that the civilized world are a(rainst you on this subject of loving slavery or believing that it is thc best institution in the world
Why, sir, everything remains precisely as it was a year no-o
No great catastrophe has There is no recent occasion to accuse occurred
us of anything
But all at once, when we meet herc, a kind of gloom pervades the whole corn- luunity and the Senate Chamber
Gentlemen risc and tell us that they are on the eve of breaking up this Government, that seven or cight States arc going to break off their connection with the Government, retire from the Union, and set up a hostile Government of their own, arid they look imploringly over to us, and say to us you can prevent it; we can do nothina• to prevent; but it all lies with you." Well, sir, what can we do to préVcnt it
You hayc not even condescended to tell us what you want; but I think I see through the speeches that I have heard from gentlenncn the other side
If we would give up the ver- dict of the people, and take your platform, I do not know but you would be satisfied with it
think the Senator from Texas rather intimated, and think the Senator from Georgia inorc than intitnatcd, that if we would take what is exactly the Charleston platform on which Mr
Breckin- ridge was placcd, and givc up that on which we won our victory, you would grumblinely and hesitatingly bc satisfied
Mr
IVERSON
1 would that the sen- ator would look over remarks before them so confidently
I made no such statement I did not say that I would be satisfied as that
with any such thing
I would not be satisfied with it
Mr
WADE
I did not say that the Senator said so; but-by construction I gathered that from his speech
I do not lfX)ow that I was right in it
Mr
IVERSON
The Senator is altogether wrono• in his construction
Mr
WADE
well, sir, I have now found what the Senator said on ghe other point to which he called my attention a little while ago
Here Nor do we suppose that there will be any overt acts upon tlrc part of Mr
Lincoln
I"or one, I do not (Irrad these overt acts
I do not propose to •wait ihr them
VVbv, sir, the powcr of this Federal Governincnt could bc so exercised against thc institution of slavery in the southern States, as that, without an overt aet, the institution would not last ten years
We kno•.v that, sir; and seeing the stonn which is approaching, although it may be seern•ingly in the dis- tane.e
we are determined to seek our own saléty and secu- pity be(örc it shall burst upon us and o•erwbeitn us with its fury, when we are not in a situation to defend our- selves." That is q,'hat the Senator said
Mr
IVERSON
Yes; that is what said
Mr
WADE
Well, then, you did not expect that Mr
Lincoln would commit any overt act against the Constitution—that was not it—you were not going to wait for that, but were to proceed on your supposition that probably hc might: and that is the sense of what I said beiöre
• Wei], Mr
President, I have disavowed all in- harm a hair of your heads anywhdre
•we hotd to no doctrine that can possibly work you an inconvenience
We have been faithful to the execution of all the laws in which you have any interest, as stands confessed on this floor by your own party, and as is known to me without their It is not, then, that Mr
Lincoln is confessions
expected to do any overt act by which you rnay be injured; you will not m,vait for any; but antic- ipating that the Government may work an in- jury, say you will put an end to it, which means simply, that you intend either to rule or ruin this Government
.That is what your com- plaint comes to; nothing else
We do not like your institution, you say
Well, we never liked It any better than we do now
You might as well have dissolved the Union at any other period as now, on that account, for we stand in relation to it precisely as we have ever stood: that is, rc- it among ourselves as a matter of policy and morals, but ncvertheless admitting that where it is out of our jurisdiction, we have no hold upon it, and no designs upon it
Then, sir, as there is nothing in the platform on which Mr
Lincoln was elected of which you complain, I ask, is there anything in the charac- ter of tho President clcct of which you ought to complain
Has he not lived a blameless life
Did he ever trarnsgress any law
Has he ever com- mitted any violation of duty of which the most scrupulous can complain
Why, then, your sus- picions that he will
Ihave shown that you have I had the Government all the time until, by some misfortune or maladministration, you brought it to the very verge of destruction, and the wisdom of the people 'had discovered that it was hWh time that the scepter should depart from you, and be placed in more competent hands; I say that this being so, you have no constitutional right to complain ; especially when we disavow any inten- tion so to make use of the victory we have won I as to injure you at all
This 'brings me, sir, to the question of com- promises
On the first dayof this session, a Sen- ator rose in his place and offered a resolution for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the evils that exist betwccn thc different sections, and to ascertain what can be done to settle this great diffculty! That is t.he proposition, sub
stantially
I tell the Senator that I know of no I difficulty; and as to compromises, I had supposed that we werc all agreed that the day of compro- mises was at an end
The most solemn com- promises we have ever made have been violated without a whei•eas
Since I have had a seat in this body, one of considerable antiquity, that had stood for morc than thirty years, was swept away from your statute-books
When I stood herc in the minority arguing against it; when I asked you to withhold your lland; when I told you it was a sacred compromise between the sections, and that when it was removed we should be brought face to facc with all that sectional bitterness that has intervened; when I told you that it was a sacred compromise which no man should touch with his finger, what was your reply
That it was a mere act of Congress—nothing more, nothing less—and that it could be swept away by the samc majority that passed it
'1" hat was true in point of fact, and true in point of law; but it showed tho weak- ness of compromises
Now, sir, 1 0111 v speak for myself; and I say that, in vicw of the manner in which other compromises have been heretofore treated, I should hardly think any two of the Democratic party would look each other in the face and say "compromise' without a sn)ile
[Laughter.] A compromise to be brought about by act of Congress, after the experience we have had, is absolutely ridiculous
But what have we to compromise
Sir, I am one of those who went forth with zeal to main- I tain the principles of the great Rcpublican party
i In a constitutional way we met, as you met
We nominated our candidates för President and Vice 
President, and you did the same for yourselves
The issue was madc up; and we went to tha peo- ple upon it
Although vve have been usually in the minority; although we have been oeneratly beaten, yet, this time, the justice of our princi- ples, and the Inalachninistration of the Govern- ment in your hands, convinced the peoplc that a change ou&ht to be wrought; and after you had tried your utmost, and we had tried our ut.n)ost, we beat you; and we beat you upon the plainest  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
103 and most palpable issuc that ever was presented to the American people, and one that they under- stood the best
There is no mistaking it; and now, when we come to the Capitol, I tell you that our President and our Vicc President must be inaugurated, and administer the Government as all •tiieir predecessors have done
Sir, it would be humiliating and dishonorable to us if wo were to listen to a compromise by which he ho has the verdict of the people in his pocket, should make his way to the presidential chair
When it comes to that, you have no Government; an- archy intervenes; civil war may follow it; all the evils that may come to the human imagination may be consequent upon such a course as that
The moment the American peopie cut loose from the sheet anchor of free government and liberty— that is, wherlever it is denied in this Government that a majority fairly given shall rule—the people •are unvwot•thy of free governülent
Sir, know not what others may do; but I tell you that, with the verdict of t.ho people given in favor of the plat- form upon which ourcandidates have been elected, so far as I am concerned, I would suffer anything to come before would compromise that away
regard it as a case where I havc no right to ex- tend comity or generosity
A riffht, absolute right, thc most sacred that a free people can ever bestow on any man, is their undisguised, fair verdict, that gives him a title to the oflice that he is chosen to fill; and hc is recreant to the princi- ple of free government who will ask a question beyond the fact whether a man has thc verdict of the people, or if he will entertain for a motnenta It is all I want
proposition in addition to that
If we cannot stand there, we cannot stand any- whcre
Any other principle than that would be as fatal to you, my friends, as to us
On any other principle, anarchy Illust inuncdiately crnsue
You say that hc comes frorn a particular section If he is an hon- of the country
What of that
est man, bound by his constitutional duties, has he not as good a right to come from one side as the other
Here, gentlemen, we ought to under- stand cach other's duties a little
I appeal to every candid man upon thc other side, and I put this question: if you had ciected your candidate, Mr
Breckinridge, although we should have bccn a good deal disheartened, as everybody is that loses his choice in such a matter as this; although it would have been an overthrow that we should havc deplored very Inuch, as we have had occa- Sion almost always to deplore tbe result of national elections, still do you believe that we would have raised a hand against the Constitution of our coun- try because we werc fairly beaten in an election
Sir, I do not believe there is a man on the other side who will not do us more credit than to sup- pose that if the case were revcrscd, there would 'I' bere never has be any complaint on our side
been any frorn us under similar circumstances, and there would not bc now
Sir, I think we have patriotism enough to overcorne the pride and the have no right to yield to any such thing; and therefore i would not entertazn a proposition for anv compromise; for, in my judgment, this long, chi•onic controversy that has existed between us must
be met, and met upon the principles of the Constitution and laws, and met now
I hope it may be adjusted to the satisfaction of all; and I know no other way to adjust it, except that way which is laid down by t'hc Constitution of the United States
Whenever we go astray from that, we are sure to plunge ourselves into (liffcul- 'l"he old Constitution of the United States, E ties
although commonly and frequently in direct oppo- sition to what I could wish, nevertheless, in my judgment, is the wisest and best Constitution that ever yetorganizcd a free Government; and by its provisions 1 willing, and intend, to stand or fall
Like the Senator from Mississippi, I ask nothing more
I ask no ingrafting upon it
I ask nothing to bc taken away from it
Under its pro- visions a nation has grown faster than any other in the history of the world ever did beforo in pros- perity, in power, and in all that makes a nation It has ministered to the ad- great and glorious
vantages of this people; and now I am unwilling to add or take away apything till can see much clearer than I can now that it wants cithct any addition or lopping off
There is one othcr subicct about which I ought to say something
On t'hat side of the Chamber, you claim the constitutionai right, if I understand you, to secede from thc Govcrnment at pleasure, and sot up an adverse Government of your own; that one State, or any number of Staies, have a I perfect constitutional right to do it
Sir, I can find no warrant in the Constitution for any doc- trine like that
In rny judgment, it would be sub- If this is versive ot ali constitutional obligation
so, we really have not now, and never have had, a Government; for that certainly is no Govern- ment of which a State can do just as it pleases, any more Lhan it would be of an individual
How can a rnan be said to be governed by law, if he will obey the law or not just as hc sees fit
puts you out of the pale of Government, and re- daces this Union of ours, of which we have all boasted so much, to a mere conglomeration of States, to be held at the will of any capricious member of it
As to South Carolina, will say that she is a small State; aild probably, if she were sank by an earthquake to-day, we would hardly ever find it, (Hit, except by the unwonted harrnony that might l')rcvail in this Chamber
[Laughter.] But I think she
is unwise
i would bc willing that she should go her own gait, pro- vided we could do it without an cxtunple fatal to all government; but standing here in the highest council of the nation, my own wishes, if had any, ruust bc under the control of my constitu- tional duty
I do not
sce how any *nan can contend that a State can out of this Union at pleasure, though I do not propose now to argue that question, be- prejudice of the
canvass, and submit gracefully cause that has been done by men infinitely morc to the unmistakable verdict of the pcoplc; and as I able to argue it than I am
When it was raised some thirfy years ago, and challenged the investi- I have shov,xn that you have nothing else to com- gation of the best minds of this nation of all par- plain of, I take it that this is your complaint
Some of you have said that the election of Mr II ties, it received a verdict that J
supposed had put Lincoln showed hostility to you and your insti- tution
Sir, it is the common fate of parties to I eminent men that surrounded him in his Cabinet, differ, and one does not intend to follow exactly and in thc councils of thc nation, with hardly any the course of policy of the other; but when you exception, except Mr
Calhoun, held that
the talk of constitutional rightsand duties, lionest men doctrine was a delusion, not to be found in the will observe them alike, no matter to what party Constitution of the United States; and not only so, but utterly destructive of all Governments
they belong
I say, then, that so far as I am concerned, I Mr
Calhoun 'held the contrary
Mr
Webster, Ido not come here in his great contt•ovcrsy with Mr
Hayne upon will yield to no compromise
that subject, was supposed to have overthrown begging, either
It would be an indignity to the him, even upon nullification, so utterly, that it people that I represent if I were to stand here i was believed at tho time that the doctrine could parleying as to the rights of the party to which f belong
We have won our right to the Chief never arise or sprout up again
But here it is to- Magistracy of this nation in the way that you day in full bloom and glory: a State has a right have always won your predominance; and if you to secede
Mr
Calhoun did not hold so
He held that a State had a right to nullify a law of are us willing to do justice to others as to exact it from them, you would never raise an inquiry Congress that they believed to be unconstitutional
as to a committee forcompromises
Here I beg, I He took that distinction between the power of barely for myself, to say one thing more
Many I a State to nullify a law of Congress and seces- i precisely in the same
way and to the same extent of you stand in an attitude hostile to this Govern- sion
Grounding herself upon the resolutions of ment; that is to say, you occupy an attitude W 1798—99, he held that a State, in her, sovereign where you threaten that, unless we do •se and so, capacity', judging in the last resort as to whether you will go out of this Union and destroy the a lax,v was warranted by the Constitution or not, I say to you, for myself, that, in must be the sole judge of the infraction oc the Government
my private capacity, I never yielded to anything Constitution by the enactrnent of a law, and also by way of threat, and in my public capacity I of the mode of remedy
In that, he hardly had a second at t.hat period
But when you come-to the doctrine of secession, he himself says that that is not a constitutional remedy.' He did not treat it as such
Nay, sir, he goes much further than the President of the United States has gone in his Inessage, in which he deciares that the United States has no power to make war upon a seceding State
Mr
Calhoun says we undoubt- I edly have that power
One remedy he calls peace- able and constitutional, and the other not
I have not the book with me; I intended to have brought it, but forgot it; but you will find this doctrine laid dourn in his famous letter to Governor Ham- ilton, taking and working out the distinction be- tween peaceable nullification and secession, that puts an end to all the relationship between the General Govcrnment and thc State, and enables the General Government, if they see fit, to declare war upon such a State
Therefore I take
it that a Stato has no constitutional right to go out of this Government
I acknowledge, to the fullest extent, the right of revolution, if you may call it a right, and the destvuction of the Government under which we live, if wc are discontented with it, and on its ruins to ercct another morc in accordance with our wishes
I believe nobody at this day denies the right; but they that undertake it, undertake it with this hazard: if they are successful, then all is right, and they are heroes; if they are defeated, they are rebels
That is the character of all rev- if successful, of course it is well; olution: successful, then the Government from which they have rebelled treats them as traitors
1 do not say this because I apprehend that any party intends to make war upon a seceding State
I only assert their right from the nature of the act, if they see fit to do so; but I *.vould not ad- I should be very tender of visc nor counsel it
the rights of a people, if I had full power over them, who are about to destroy a Government which they deliberately come to the conclusion they cannot live under; but I am persuaded that the necessities of our position compel us to take a more austere ground, and hold that if a State secedes, although we will not make war upon her, we cannot recocynize her right to be out of the Union, and she is not out until she gains the consent of the Union itself; and that the Chief Magistrate of the nation, be who he may, will find under the Constitution of the United States that it is his sworn duty to execute the law in every part and parcel of this Government; that he cannot be released from that obligation; for there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States that would warrant him in saying that a single star has fallen frorn this galaxy of stars in the Confederacy
He is sworn not to know that a State has seceded, or pay the least respect to their resolutions that claim they have
What follow's
Not that we would make war upon her, but we should have to exercisc every Federal right over her if we had the power; and the moét important of these
would be the collection of the revenues
There are many rights that the Fed- eral Government exercises over the States for the peculiar benefit of the people -there, which,
if they did not want, they could dispense with
If thcy did not want the mails carried there, the President might abolish the offices, and cease to r I'hey might forego any such carry their mails
duty peculiarly 
for the benefit of the people
Fl"hey might not clect thcir offcers and send them here
It is a privilege they have; but we cannot force them to doit
'I'hey have the right under the Constitution to be represented upon equal terms with any other State; but if they see fit to forego that ricrht, and do not claim it, it is not incum- -bent upon the President to endeavor to force them to do an act of that kind
But when you come to those duties which im- pose obligations upon them, in commoh with the ot.her members of the Confederacy, he cannot be released from his duty
Therefore, it will be in- cumbent on the Chief Magistrate to proceed to collect the revenue of ships entering their ports, that he does now in every other State of the Union
We cannot release him from that obligation
The Constitution, in thunder tones, demands that he shall do it alike in the ports of every State
I What follows
Why, sir, if he shuts • up the ports of entry so that a ship cannot discharge her cargo there or get papers foie another voyage, then  104 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 17, ships will cease to -trade; or, •if he undertakes to blockade her, and thus collect it, she has not gained her independence by secession
W hut must she do
If she is contented to -live in this equivocal stqte all would be well, perhaps; L.ut she coald not live there
No people in the world could live in that condition
-What will they do
They must take the initiative and declare war upon the United: States; and the moment that they !evy war force must be met by force; and they must, therefore, hew out their independence by violence and war
There is no other way under the Constitution, that I know of, whereby a Chief Magistrate of any politics could be released from this duty
If this State, though seceding, should declare var acainst the United States, I do not suppose there is a lawyer in this body but what '.vould say that the act of levying war is treason against the United States
That is where it re- suits
We might just as well look the matter right in the face
The Senator from Texas says—it is not exactly his languace—we will förce you to an ionomin- ious treaty up in Faneuil Hail
Well, sir, you may
We know you are brave; we understand your prowess; we want no fight with you; nevertheless, if you drive us to that necessity, wc must use all the powers of this Government to maintain it intact its integrity
If we aro over- thrown, we but share thc fate of a thousand other Governments that have been subverted
If you are the weakest, then you must ko to the wall; and that is all there is about it
'I'hat is the con- dition in which we stand, provided a State sets herself up in opposition to the General Govern- men t
I say that is the way it seen-is to rne, as a law- 1 see no power in thc Constitution to re- Y er
lease a Senator from this position
Sir, if there was HI') y other, if there was an absolute right of secession in the Constitution of the United States when we stepped up there to take our oath of offce, why was there not an exception in that oath
Why did it not ran " that we would sup- port the Constitution of the United Statcs unlcss our State shall secede before our term was out
Sir, there is no such immunity
'I'here is no way by which this can be done that I can conccive of, except it is standing upon the Constitution of the United States, demanding equal justice for all, and vindicating the old flag of the Union
idVe must maintain it, unless we are cloven down by superior force, well, sir, it may happen that you can make your x.vay out of the Union, and that, by levying war upon the Government, you may vincllcate your
right to indepel')dence
If* you should do so, I have a policy in my mind
No man would regret more than myself that any portion of the people of these United States should think them- selves impelled, by grievances or anything else, to depart out of this Union, nnd raise a foreign flao• 17 and a hand against the General Government
there svas any just cause on God's carth that I could see that was within my reach, of honorable release from any such pretended grievance, they should have it; but they set fort,h none; can sce none
It is all a matter of prejudice, superin- duced unfortunately, I believe, as I intilnatcd before, mot•c because you have listened to the enemies of the Republican party and what they said of us, while, from-your intolerance, you havo shut out ali light as to what our real principles arc
We have been called and branded in thc North and in the South and everywhere else, as John Brown men, as men hostile to your institu- tions, as meditating an attack upon your institu- tions in your own States—a thing that no Repub- lican ever dreamed of or ever thought of, but has protested against as often as the question has been up; but your people believe it
No doubt they believe it because of the terrible excitcmcnt and reign of terror that prevails there
No doubt they think so, but it arises from fhlse information
or the want of information—that is all
Their pre- judices have been appealed to until they have be- come uncontrolled and uncontrollable
Well, sir, if it shall be so; if tfiat " glorious Union," as we, all call it, under which the Gov- ernment has so long lived and prospered, is now about to come to a final end„ as perhaps it may, I havc bccn looking around to see what policy ivo should adopt; and through tha_t gloom •which has been mentioned on the other side, if you will have it so, 1 still see a glorious future for those who stand' by the old flag of the nation
There lie the fair fields of Mexico all before us
The people there are prejudiced against you
They fear you intend to overrun and enslave them
You are a slavery propaganda, and you are fili- busters
That has raised a violent antagonism between you and thcm
But, sir, if we were once released from all obligation to this institu- tion, in six months they would invite us to take a protectorate over them
They owe England a large debt, and she has been coaxing and inviting us to take the protectorate of that nation
They will aid us in it; and I say to the commercial men of the North, if you go along with me, and adopt this policy, if we must Come to this, you will bc scvcn-fold indemnified by the trade and commerce of that country for what you lose by the secession
Talk about eatine ice and granite in the North! Why, sir, Great Britain now car- pies on a commerce with Mexico to tho amount of nearly a hundred million dollars
How much of it do we get
Only about eight million
Why so
Because, by our treatment of Mexico, we have led them to frar and to hatc us; and they have been compelled, by our illiberal policy, to place themselves under the shadow of a stronger nation for their own protection
The Senator from Illinois [Mr
DOUGLAS] and my colleague [Mr
PUGII] have said that we Black Republicans were advocates of negro equality , and that we wanted to build up a black government, Sir, it will be one of the most blessed ideas of the times, if it shall come to this, that we will make inducements for every free black among us to find his home in a morc concrcnial climate in Central America or in Lower Mexico, and we will bc divested of every onc of them; and then, endowed with tbc splendid domain that we shall get, we will aßopt a homestead policy, and we will invite the po-or, the destitute, industrious wl)ito man from every clime under heaven, to come in thero and make his fortune
So, sir, we will build up a nation , renovated by this process, of white labor- ing men
You may build yours up on compulsory servile labor, and the two will flourish side by side; and we shall very soon see whether your principles, or that state of society, or ours, is the i Inight say, Sir, Inost prosperous or vicrorous
that, divcstcd of this illstitution, who doubts that
the provinces of Canada would knock at our doors in n day
Therefore, my friends, we have all the elemenis for building up an empire—a Republic, founded on the great principles of the Declaration of Independence, that shall be more magnificent, morc powerful, and more iust than this world has ever seen at any othcrpefiod
I do not know that I should have a single second for this policy ; but it is a policy that occurs to me, and it reconciles ine in some measure to the threatened loss or secession of these Slates
But, sir, I am for maintaining tho Union of these States
i will sacrifice everything hut honor to maintain it
'That glorious old flag of ours, by any act of mine, shall never cease to wave over the intem•ity of this Union as it is
But if they will not -have it so, in this new, renovated Gov- ernment of which I have spoken, the 4th of July, with all its glorious nnemories, will never be re- I pealed
T hc old flag of 1776 will be in our hands, and shall float over this nation forever; and this Capitol, that some gentlemen said would be re- served for the southern republic, shall still be the Capitol
It was laid out by Washington; It was consecrated by l')im•, and the old flag that he vindicated in the Revolution shall still float from the Capitol
[Applause in the galleries.] The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Sergeant- at-Arms will take proper measures to preserve order in the gallery or clear it
Mr
WADE
i say, sir, 1 stand by the Union of these States
Washington and his compatriots fought for that good oldülacr
It shall never be hauled down, but shall be thé glory of the Gov- ernment to which I belong, as long as my life President, although it may be assailed by traitors on every side, by the grace of God, under its shadow I will die

TERRITORIAL BUSINESS
Mr
GROW
I ask the unanimous consent of the House to make thc usual order setting apart two days for the consideration of territorial busi- I prefer that those days should be before ness
the holidays, so that if the House adjourn over, tl'le Senate can takc up and act upon whatever we shall pass
I ask the House to set apart Thurs- day and Frida of this week
Mr
MAYdARD
Before that is done, 1 would suggest that it would be better to determine the question whether we will or will not adjourn over during I-hc holidays
Mr
GROW
Whether we adjourn over or not, this is a proper time to determine what days we will devote for territorial business
Mr
MAYNARD
forholidays, we '•.vill probably adjourn over from Thursday, which is one of the days indicated by the gentle- man; but as I dislike to make objection, if no other gentleman entertains the same views I do, I withdraw mv objection
Mr
HUGHES
What days are proposed to be set apart
The SPEAKER
Thursday ofthis week
Mr
HUGHES
1 certainly shall object if Friday is embraced in the motion, for thai is the day always devoted to the consideration of pri- vate business
If we transact any business on Friday, I insist that we shall devote that day to doing justice to private claimants
Mr
GROW
Friday has usually been onc of the days set apart for territorial business
Mr
HUGHES
If the gentleman will indicate any other day than Friday, shall not object
I would suggest Wednesday and Thursday
Mr
GROW
I have no objection to those days
Mr
STEVENS, of Washington
the Committee on Territories been called for bills in reference to the 'i'crritories
The SPEAKER
That will be the regular order of business this mornin€r
Mr
GROW
I ask the unanimous consent of the House—and to that I suppose there will be no objection—to allow the Cornmittee on Terri- tories to have thc bills they propose to bavc acted upon that day, numbered and printed in the same manner as if they had been reported
No objection being made, an order to that effect was entered
MAJOR LL'WIS TALIAFERO
Mr
McPHERSON
1 move that the Com- mittee on Private Land Claims be discharged shall continue
To maintain it, Washington and from the further consideration of the petition of his compatriots fought for liberty and the rights of man
And hcrc I will add that my own father, although but a humblc soldier, fought in the same great cause, and went through hardships and privations sevenfold worse than death, in order to bequeath it to his children
It is my inheritance
It was my protector in infancy, and the pride and glory of my riper years; and, Mr
Major Lewis Taliafero, of Pennsylvania, and that, the same be referred to the Committee of Claims
The motion was agreed to

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Mr
CARTER
I ask the unanimous consent of the House to set apart some day for the con- sideration of business relative to the District of Colum bia
The SPEAKER
Will the gentleman from New York indicate a day for the judgment of the House
Mr
CARTER
I will name to-morrow, (Tues- day,) as -Wednesday and Thursday have been set apart for other business
The SPEAKER
The gentleman from New York broposes that to-morrow be set apart for the consideration of business for the District of Columbia
Mr
BURNETT
to the chairman of the Committee for the bistr,ict of Columbia that it would be better to fix a day at a later period; say next Thursday week
Mr

Thursday week is now pro- posed by the gentleman from New York
Mr
BURNETT
That day will be within I would suggest next Monday— the holidays
this day week
IVIt•
CRAWFORD
we shall probably ad- journ on Saturday of this week until next Mon- 'day week; and if the District of Columbia really has any business that needs attention, it will be well to give them some day when they can be heard

CALL OF STATES FOR DILLS
The SPEAKER
The Chair, under the rule, will now call the States and Territories for bills and resolutions—first for bills; and as some mem- bers may not remember the rule on this subject, It is rule 130
the Clerk will read it
The Clerk read the rule, as follows: 130
All the States and 'I'erritories shali be called for bills on leave and resolutions on cach alternate Monday during each session of Congress; and, if necessary to secure the object
on said days, all resolutions which shall give rise to debate shall lie over för discussion, und6r the rules of the House already established : and the whole of said days shall he appropriated to bills on leave and resolutions, until all the States and Territories are called through
And the Speaker shall first call the States and 'I'erritoricg for bills 01k leavc ; and all bills so introduced during the first hour aft.cr the Journal is read shall be referred, without debatc, to their appropriate connnittecs: Provided, howeccr, 'Ithat a bill so introduccd and referred shall not be brought back into thc House upon a znotion to reconsider." The SPEAKER
In pursuancc of that rule, the Chair will now call the States and Territories for bills, beginning with the State of Maine
PROGRESS OF 'I'llE USEFUL ARTS
Mr
BURNHAM introduced a bill to promote Mr
BURNETT
1 have no objection to that
Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS
1 propose to have the report printed, and a day assigned for the consideration of the ease
Mr
MAYNARD
I object to assigning any day for its consideration until other orders are disposed of
Mr
JOHN 1-1
REYNOLDS
If there is any objection, I withdraw the report
Mr
HICKMAN
I hope there will bc no ob- jection to havino• a day assigned for the consid- It is very important that erntion of this case
this report should be made, so that the members of the House may have an opportunity of exam- ining it before they are called upon to act; and I think the gentleman from Tennessee should not raise this objection
Each member of the House must desire to have the printed report before him, and a day assigned for its consideration, so that if an impeachment of Judge
Watrous should be ordered by this House, it may go to the Senate at the earliest possible day
This case has occasioned a great deal of ex- pense, and a large consumption of time; and if it is delayed until the close of this session, it may be that time and expense will have been expended 1 trust, therefore, that the objection may vam
be withdrawn
Mr
MAYNARD
1 would ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee whether the exami- nation had before his committee at this Congress has been an parte one, or whether the examina- tion has been conducted in the presence of the
party acc.used
Mr
HICKMAN
The examination was not conducted in the presence of Judce Watrous, and it was ea,• pcrte
Mr
MAYNARD
It will be recollected that in the Thirty-Fourth Congress a similar investi- gation of this case was had-by the Judiciary Com- mittce, and they reported, I believe unanimously, a resolution of impeachment, that was not acted upon
In the Thirty-Fifth Congress the case
was again brought up and referred to the Judiciary Committee
Judge S•Vatrous appeared beföre the committee, as I understand, by himself and by counsel, and a very full and elaborate investiga- tion was had of the case
A report was then made, four of ti-le committee recommending the impeachment of Judge Watrous, four recom- mending his discharge, and one—judge Caskic, of Virginia—not acting
A day was ftssigned for a hearing of the case in the I-louse
It was very fully and elaborately argued on both sides, and I more fully considered, probably, than any other question that camc up before the last Congress, • unless it was the Lecompton bill; and after full the House, by a investio•ation and discussion, very decided majority, voted against the impeach- It seems that the matler has again been Inent
referred to the Judiciary Committee; all) ec parte , examination has been had, as the chairman of the committee informs us, and we are asked again to T suppose it was purely accidental consider it
that, ii') orcanizing the Committee on the Judi- ciary of this House, none of the gentlemen on that committee who reported in favor of Judge Wat- rous replaced upon it
I refér to the gentle- man from North Carolina, [Mr
CRAIGE,] the gen- the progress of the usefu•l arts; which was reada 11 eman from New York, [Mr
CLARK,] and the first arid second time, and referred to the Com- miltee on Patents
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS IN NEW YORK
Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS introduced a bill to establish an additional judicial district in the State of New York, and in relation to thc courts of the United States in said State; which was read a first and second time, and referred to the Com- mittee on the Judiciary
CASE OF JUDGE WATROUS
Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS
1 do not know whether it, is in order at this time or not; but I desire the unanimous consent of the House to make, a rcpot•t from the Committee on the Judi- ciary in the case of Judge Watrous
The SPEAKER
It is not in by unanimous consent
Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS
TYVell,1 ask the unanimous consent of the House
Mr
BURNETT
Let us hear what his report is
The SPEAKÉR
It is in the case of Judge Watrous
gentler-nan frotn New Hampshire, [MP
TAPPAN.] 'i'hc fourth member of the committee who reported in favor of Judge Watrous—Mr
Ready, of Ten- nessec—is no longer a member of the House
I am opposed to consuming this session, which is short, and which will necessarily be occupied vy'ith the gravest and most important questions, to the very existence and perpetuity of our Union, by setting apart any day for the special I examination of this case, which was so fully ex- amined arid disposed of in Congress
Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS
If 1 have no opportunity of havincy a day set apart for the consideration of the case, I withdraw the report
Mr
HOUSTON
What disposition has been made of the re ort
The SPEAICER
The gentleman from New York has withdrawn it
Mr
HOUSTON
was the committee called regularly 
The SPEAKER
No, sir; the gentleman asked unanimous consent to make the report, and it He novvr withdraws it
was cnven
Mr
HOUSTON
My that con- sent had better be given to allow the report to come in and be printed, because it: is, as I under- stand, voluminous, and that was one of the dif- ficulties that stood in the Way of the investigation of the case when it was reported by the commit* tee of the last Congress
The evidence is very voluminous, and it wras not examined, There were a great many members who nevei• read' it at all; and they were candid enough to say so, and will tell you so now
I think the ends of justice will be promoted by allowing the report to be made and printed, so that members can ex- amine it
If there be no objection to assigning a day for its consideration, of course the objection will hold good; but I do think the report ought, to be brought before the House at the earliest practicable mmnent
I'vlr
MAYNARD
will be recollected, Mr
Speaker, that at the close of the first session of the last Congress a rcport was madein this case; the report and evidence ordered to be printed; and a day set apart
for their consideration at.an early period of the second session
A MEMBER
I make the point of order that all this debate is out of order
The SPEAKER
The point of order being made, the Chair must ruie the discussion out of Mr
JOHN H
REYNOLDS

Only by unanimous consent
Mr
HICKMAN
My object have the bili referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

Mr
CRAWFORD
1 objected at the first moment I possibly could after the bill was read bv the Clerk, and as soon as I could understand what it was
The SPEAKER
The Chair thinks the tion comes in time
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 ask whether this bill is not in regard to the subject-matter of mileage 
Mr
MICKMAN
No, sir, 1 believe not
1 really do not myself understand what the bill is about
Mr
CRAWFORD
My understanding is that it is a bill touching the matter of mileage due to an ex-member

The bill seems to be in ref- erence to the discharge of certail') sureties
Mr
HICKMAN
The bill by both I-louses at the last session; but, as the President did not receivc it till the las't day of the declined to sign it for that reason
The bill was read for information
It directs the Secretary of the Treasury to satisfy a judg- ment rendered by the circuit court of the county of St
Louis, in the State of Missouri, at the Oc- tober term of 1857, in favor of Tåomas C, Rey- nolds and against the late William A

Mr
LOVEJOY
If that is not in order, 1 ,öb'ect, {dr
FLORENCE
I apprehend that) having had the consent of the House to (_)flör these propo- sitions, it is now too late• to object
They are to go to the committee of thiM,YEthrce
The SPEAKER
The Chairconsidcrs that the consent was (riven merely to have the propositions read
IF, therefore, the gentleman from Illinois ob'ccts, the ob•cction is in time
{dr
LOVE/OY
1 do object
Mr
FLORENCE
Perhaps the
gentleman from Illinois did not hear the resolution read
Mr
LOVEJOY
Yes, did
Mr
FLORENCE
TVcll, perhaps it is to have it read again, so that the gentleman may understand it
i ask that it be rcad again
Mr
LOVEJOY
1 object to it
Mr
FLORENCE
1 ask leave to prcsent cer- tain resolutions, adopted by the citizens of Phil- adelphia, in regard to the present condition of the country, with a view to their refbrence to the special committee thirty-three
Mr
SHERMAN
This is call of States for bills on leave
I object to anything else being brought forward
Mr
FLORENCE
very well; 1 will not
in- tcrpose at this stage of the business; but I will seek anothcr opportunity to ask for tbc reference of thcsc• resoluti0F1s
I understood, however, that my resolution was referred
The
SPEAKER
No; it was merely read for information
Mr
FLORENCE
1 did ask it to for information
I merely suggested most respect- Cully to the Chair that the objection of the gen- deman from Illinois ',vas not in tilue
I expressly stat.ed that I desired it to be read with a view to its reference to the committee of thirty-three; and it was so read
i now subnlit to the Chair that; having fulfillcd these functions, so far as the rcadw ing is concerncd, the resolution goes to the com- mlttce of thirty-three
I think •should be there
and I also think that it should receive lhe con- currence ofa majority of the committee
The SPEAICER
Objection being made, it cannot be received

UNION
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE offered the following preamble and resolutions; which were read, con- sidered, and refgrred
to the select committee of thirty-three: VVhercas a conflict of opinion, dangerous to the peace and pennanence of the Union, has arisen concerning the
true intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States in relation to African slavery within the Territories of the United States; and whereas the opinion of the ma- jority of the court pronounced in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Dred Scott ease, detcnnines that the citizens of the Unité.d States have an equal ri«r12tM) take with thein into the Territories of the United States any article of property which the Constitution of the United States recognizes as property, and that said Constitution recorrnizes slaves as property; and further, that the right neither of persons nor of property can be destroyed or im- paire(l by either congressional or territorial legislation ; and "'hereas such detenninati(jn, while it has been accepted by smne as a judicial exposition of the Constitution aiOresaid by the supreme judicial tribunal, has by others been re- jected as destitute of the törce of a judicial precedent ; yet, in view of the probability that
euch opinion will hereafter become the reason of decisions of a silniiat• character by thc sarne tribunal, and in the hope of averting tbc imtneas- urable calmnities which national dissolution threatens: 'I'herefore, Resolved, 'That the opinion of' the nyéot•ity of the Su- pr(.nne, Court of the United States, delivered by Ollie
J tice 'I'aucy, in the Dred Scott case, should be received as the settlement of the questions, under the, Constitution of the United States, therein discussed and decided
Resolced./'uj-ther, (two thirds of both nouses concurring.) '}'hat
the föliowing articles be proposed as an arnendment to the Constitution of tho United States, which, when rat- ified by conventions in three löurths of the several States, shall be vakid as part of such Constitution, namely: Con- gress may establish govcrnrnents fbr the 'I'erritories of the IJnitcd States ; but any Territory having a population equal to the constituency of one mnen)ber of Congress, and hav- ing adopted, by a vote of the citizens of the United States resident therein, a constitution republican in form, may be adnüt.ted by Congress into this Union as a State ; and nei- ther Congress nor the people of a Territory, during the territorial condition, shall, by legislation or otherwise, an- nul or impair thé rights of property recognized by the laws of any of the States

UNION—AGAIN
Mr
SICKLES offered the following preamble and resolutions; which were read, considered , and referred to the select committee of thirty-three: Whereas it is represented that one or morc of the States have declared, through their executive and legislative au- thorities, the desire of such States to reconsider and annul their ratification of the Constitution establishing the Gov
ernrnent of thc United Staws ; and whereas conflicting opinions prevail as to the right of any State to secede from the Union ; and whereas it is expedient to prescribe the rnode ill which a State may resume its sovereignty with the consent of the other States, thereby removing all occasion ' för the employnnent of forcible Ineans, of constraint, or re- sistance, and, at the sanic time, providing additional guar- aritees arrainst injustice by ordainintr au effectual, prcnnpt, and peaceful rmnedy {Or grievances : Be it therefore resolved, That the Congress propose to thc several States the followina amendment to the Constitu- tion : ART
8
Whenever a convention of delegates, chosen in any State by the people thereof, under the reconunendation of its Legislature, shall rescind and annul its ratification of this Constitution, the President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate shall appoint, commissioners, not exceeding three, to confer with the duly appointed agents of such State, and agree upon the disposition of the public property and territory belonging to the United States lying within such State, and upon the proportion of the public debt to be assumed and paid by such State ; and if the President shall approve the settle- field and Harper's Ferry armories during the pres- ment agreed upon by the commissioners, he shall there- upon transmit the saene to the Senate, and upon the ratifi- ent year; and he also asks to be informed of the character of those arms
Now, as to the author- ity by which the Secretary of War may have done this thing, the gentleman ought himself to be informed; and therefore I must object to the resolution being taken up for consideration at this time
want to havc an opportunity of looking • into it
Mr
DELANO
1 move that the rules be sus- pended in order that I may introduce the resolu- tion
If I am allowcd a word of explanation, I can obviate the gentleman 's objection
cation thereof by two thirds of the Senators vesent, he shall forthwith issue his proc;amation declaring the assent of the United States to the.withdrawal of such State from the Union
Mr
ADRAIN
I offer the following preamble and resolution, and rnove that they be adopted: iVhereas the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and its ready and faithful observ- ance the duty of all good and law-abiding citizens: There- fore, Resoh•ed, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to that Constitution whereyer manifested, and that we earnestly recommend the repeal of all statutes enacted by I State Legislatures conflicting with, and in violation of, that sacred instrument and the laws of Congress made in pursuance thereof
Mr
BURNETT
I demand the yeas and nays upon the adoption of that resolution
The yeas and nays were ordered
Mr

It has not•expired
Mr

I hope we shall vote upon the • resolution

JOHN COCHRANE
1 amend
ment to offer to that resolution
Mr
ETHERIDGE
1 move ques- tion upon the resolution
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 have the Mr
BURNETT
1 respectfully submit that the gentleman from New York was upon the floor long before the gentleman from tilennessee, [Mr
ETHERIDGE,] and addressed the Speaker, and that the Speaker, though he may have for- it, recoqrnized hirn
Mr
1 demanded thc previous question long ago
Mr
JOHN COCHRANLC
1 was upon the floor
The SPEAKER
The Chair did not hear the gentleman from Illinois, and will recognize him now if he says he demanded the previous ques- tion before the gentleman from New York took the floor to offer an amendment
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 think, upon flection , that it will bc admitted by every one that I proposed, as an amendment I had the floor
to the resolution, that the personal liberty bills and all such resolutions of States wherever passed shall be repealed by the-States
Mr
SHERMAN
The resolution as it stands covers that and everything else
Mr
A DRAIN
ihtroduced the resolution, and it covers personal liberty bills, and was in- tended to reach them
The resolution uses the language, " all statutes enacted by State Legis- laturcs." I havc no objection to accepting the modification suggested 'by tbe gentleman from New York; and r do accept his amendment
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
The the rcsolution accepts the amendment, and I call the previous question
The SPEAKER
Let us have no confusion, The demand for the previous question is upon the original resolution
Mr
I-IINDMAN
Was not the amendment accepted by the mover
The SPEAKER
Did the New 'Jersey accept the modification 
Mr
A DRAIN
• I hope gentlemen will retain their seats a moment until 1 say a word
Mr
STANTON
The question is not debat- able
Mr
ADRAiN
I call the previous question upon the resolution as modified
Mr
BURNETT
The gentleman from New Jersey has a right to modify his resolution, and he has done so
Mr
ADRAIN
1 have accepted the modifica- tion 
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I want the resolu- tion read as modified
Mr
SHERMAN
I rise to a question of order
I understand thatthe gentleman from Illinois [Mr
WASHBURNE] demanded the previous question before the resolution was modified; and after the previous question has been demanded the gentle- man from New Jersey cannot modify his resolu- tion
It, must be sunmitted to t.he House as it was originally offered
The SPEAKER
The gentleman from Illinois states to the Chair that he demanded the previous question
I ask the gentleman from Illinois if that f vvas before the gentleman from New York [Mr
COCHRANE] proposed to amend the resolution
I think it Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
was about the same time
The SPEAKER
Under that statement, t Chair decides that the resolution was modified in time; and tho pending question is the demand for the previous question
Mr
SHERMAN
1 wish to offer another If the gentleman will include, -not modification
only personal liberty bills, but all other nul_lify- ing laws, I shall have no objection; otherwise, I shall move to lay the resolution on: ghe table
 108 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
17, Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
Let the amend- ment stand as it is
Mr
A DRAIN
I hope therewillbeno objection to thc resolution as it is
If we are to preserve this Union, there must be a spirit of conciliation exhibited on all sides
What objection can there be now to that resolution as amended by the gentleman from- New York
The resolution de- clares that
all laws enacted by State Legislatures, pcrsonal liberty bills and all, should bc repealed If they conflict with the Constitution of the United States and the laws of Coogress made in pursu- ance -thereof
Does the Republican party ouject to such a resolution as that
If they •do, this •Union, in my humble judgment, is at an end
[Cries of " Read the resolution ! ' Mr
BURNETT
Before that is done, 1 desire to kno+.,r whether the previous question has been called
The SPEAKER
It has
Mr
LOVEJOY
I rise to a question of order
The previous question was called upon the ori- ginal resolution; it never has been demanded upon the resolution as amended
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
The gentleman is mistaken
Mr
A DRAIN
I demanded the previous ques- tion upon the resolution as modified
The SPEAKER
The Chair thinks the gen- tleman from Illinois is mistaken
The demand for the previous question, however, has not yet been seconded
The resolution, as modified, was then read, as follows: Whereas the Constitution of the United States is the suprenle law of the land, and its ready and Faithful observ- ance the duty of all good and law-.abiding citizens : There- Rcsolvcd., That we deprecatc the spirit of disobedience to that Constitution wherever manifOsted, and that we carn- estly recommend a repeal of all statutes, including personal liberty bills, so called, enacted by State Legislatures, con- flicting with, or in violation of, that sae red instrwnentand tbc laws of Congress Inade in pursuancc thereof
Mr
GROW
a Ide- sire to know if this resolution was introduced within the hour fixed for calling States 
The SPEAKER
It was
Mr
GROW
Then it must be referred with- out debate, under the rule
Mr
BURNETT
The resolution was received by unanimous consent
The SPEAKER
The rule will be read on that point
The 130th rule was read, as follows: All tbc States and Territories shall be called for bills 011 leave and resolutions on each alternate Monday (lurin'T each session o
Congress; and, if n&cessary to secure the object on sai(l days, all which shall give rise to debate
Shall lie over Cor discussion, under the rules of thc•llousc already established ; and the whole of said days shall be appropriated to bills on leave
and resolutions, until all States and 'Derritories are called through." Mr
GROW
I rise to a point of order
Un- der that rule, this resolution rnust be referred
If thc gentleman who offcred it will leave out the specification, will put in a spccification of all the laws conflicting with the Constitution, I will not object to thc resolution
Ido object to speci- fying a part of the laws referred to, and leavi11(F out a specification of the others
The
SPEAKER
The question is on second- in the demand for the previous question
SHERMAN
Icall for the yeas and nays on ordering the main question
I wish simply to add two 01' three words to the and then, I believe, it woul(l be voted for unanimously
Mr

'The previous question has not been secondod yet
The SPEAKER
There can be no demand for the yeas and nays on the second for the previous question, 'Ithey may be demanded on ordering the main question

The SPEAKER

Mr

That is right, Mr

During the roll-call, Mr

Speaker, the people of Mississippi have taken the questions referred to in this resolution into their own hands, and will make their own decision upon them
So far as I arn concerned, sir, I have no proposition for a compromise to make and nonc to receive; and hence I have no suggestions to offer to the North with reference I decline to vote
to their personal liberty bills•
Mr
SINGLETON (when his name was called) said: T"or tl-)0 reasons assigned by my colleague, and inasmuch as I do not feel inclined to volun- tcct• advice to the northern Statos as to what course they should take in regard to their so-called personal liberty bills, knowing that they will not take it, I decline to vote on this proposition
Mr
SHERMAN (when his name was called) said: I again ask the House to allow rnc to offer an amendrnent inserting the wrords and nullify- ing laws' 'after the wordk personal liberty bills," so that we may all be able to vote for this resolu- tion
Mr

1 call the gentle- man to order, Mr

Yes, we object to it
We are voting on the resolution

The resolution embraces two distinct propositions
Mr

The SPEAKER
They have been already ordered
Mr

I ask .that the resolution be divided after the word manifested
Mr

The resolution is not divisi- ble
Mr

That division would take away the sense of the resolution
The object ot the resolution is to declare against these obnoxious laws
We all know what an instrume'Ät the Con- stitution is, and we know that we ought to ob- serve it
The SPEAKER
The Chair thinks the res- olution is not divisible
WASHBURN, of Maine
Mr
Speaker, I understand the Chair to decide that the resolution is divisible, and I am glad that we are to have an opportunity to vote on the different propositions contained in it; for while I am in favor of the peal Of all laws in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, I have not sufficient knowl- edge of the personal liberty laws of the States to authorize me to sav that they are unconstitutional ; and thinking twat the latter clause may contam, by I implication, a staten')ent that they are, I cannot vote for it; and so if there had been no division, I should have been obliged to vote against the res- olution
[Cries of " Order ! ' ' The SPEAKER
The gentleman is mistaken
The Chair decided the question to be not divisible

Mr

1 have no objection

Mr
CRASVFORD
Is that motion in order
The SPEAKER
It is; the morning hour having expired, and this being Monday
The mot.ion to suspend the rules is therefore In order
Mr
CRAWFORD
The truth is, Mr
Speaker, that there- is no propriety, as I conceive, in un- dertaking to fool each other or the country by the resolution that may be introduced
Now, let us meet this question fairly
The gentleman from Illinois is not afraid to vote for anything which hc is in favor of; nor am I
Let a resolution be introduced by t.he member from Ohio, or thc member, member from Illinois, or any other stating exactly what each of us understands to bc our constitutional in regard to slavery, i have no objection to vote and let us vote on it
on any proposition thal may be presented
Mr
WASHBURNE, Then let us have a vote on this
Mr
LOVEJOY
I have no objection to what the gentleman from Gcorgia proposes, after this resolution shall be disposed of
I have moved to suspend the rules
It was gentlemen on that side of ther House who commenced " whipping the devil round the stump." We did not commenceit
Mr
CRAWFORD
1 did not
Mr
LOVEJOY
1 believe not; but your side of the House did
Mr
FLORENCE
1 rise to a pointof order
That is, that no business is in order until all the States shall have been called
I refer to the 130th rule of the House, which is as follows: All the States and Territories shall be called for bills on leave and resolutions on each alternate Monday during each session of Congress ; and, if necessary to secure the object on said days, ait resolutions which shall give rise to debate, shall lie over for discussion, under the rules of the Ilouse already established ; and the whole of *said days shall be appropriated to bills on leavc and resolutions, until all the States and Territories are called through." The SPEAKER
There is another rule which declares that on Monday of each week, at the expiration of one hour after the Journal has been read, the Speaker may entertain a motion to sus- pend the rules
Mr
FLORENCE
Yes, sir, except on this alternate Monday
Herc isan express rule, which provides that the States shall be called through for resolutions
The SPEAKER
It has been the practice, after one hour, to entertain motions under that Mr
FLORENCE
very well
Then 1 want to reform a bad practice; and I submit to the Speaker whether, with this rule staring him full in the face, reQuiring that each of the States shall have that equalily required by the Constitution, I am to bc prevented from pertbrming my duty to my constituents
Mr
GROW
The motion to suspend the rules includes, of course, suspension of the rule which m colleague has read
The SPEAKER
The
motion to suspend the ru!es is in order, and no debatc is in order
Mr
LOGAN
1 hope will be no objec- tion on this side of the House to the introduciion of the resolution
I can sce no difference, myself, between this resolution and tho one just passed, I can find but except in regard to the verbia«re
one objection to the resolution, and that is the usc of thc words declaring that all law-abiding" citizens should obey tho Constitution
I think that all men should so
Mr
FLORENCE
1 desire gentleman from Illinois to understand that i make no objection to the resolution
Mr
LOVEJOY
I accept the amendment sug- gested b v my colleague
Mr
LOGAN
It certainly should include mem- bers of Congress; but if it is allowed to remain all good and law-abiding" citizens, I do not think it will include them
[Laughter.] The resolution was modified by the omission of those words
The
rules were suspended; and the resolution was introduced
Mr
LOVEJOY called for tho yeas and nays on the adoption of his resolution
The yeas and nays werc ordered

Mr

Mr

I rise to a point Mr

suppose I can bc heard upon a point I know nothing of order if upon no other point
of the proposition which my colleague has to present, but I object to my Republican colleagues being allowed to occupy all the time of the House, I have a resolu- when I am entitled to the floor

I desire to Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
say that I have no objection to tbc proposition of my colleague, whenever he can obtain the floor to offer it
The SPEAKER
The gentleman from Illinois will state his point of order
Mr.- MORRIS, of Illinois
My point of order is this: that ut the cxpiration of the morning hour I had the right to call for the regular order of f took the floor for that purposc, and business
I did not aban- was recognized by the Speaker
don the floor
My colleague, [Mr
Lov'EJ0Y,] however, was permitted to prcsent his prol)osi- tien, which hus bccn voted upon by the House
Now, sir, as tho Speaker well knows, have, been trying from day to day to press the resolution which I havc in my hand for a vote of tbc House
I think I was entitled to the floor when the rcs- olution of my colleague was disposed of
My other collcaguc, [Mr

Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
I will say to my colleague that, if ho will allow' me to have the resolution which I propose read, if there be objection, I will not press the motion to suspend the rules until he shall have had an opportunity to Rct- his resolution before the House
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I rise to a question I ask thc Chair whether a call of the of order
States for resolutions is not the regular order of business; and whether Illinois has any right to bc hoard at this moment
'The State of Vi'rginia has not been called, as yet, for rosolutions; nor has any other southern State been called
SPEAKER
The Chair will say to the gcntlcman from Virginia that it is in order, under the rules, t.o move to suspend the rules on this day

[Laughter.] This House has to-day, by large majorities, rec- ommcnded the repeal of the acts of the State Le- gislatures, known as personal liberty laws, rec- ommending the repeal of the nullification laws, and all laws in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States

Does not this resolution, in one of its parts, in general lan- guage declare that in no conceivable state of cir- curnstances should the Union be dissolved
So understanding it, sir—and i
i am wrong, I hope, the gentleman will correct me—while i declare myself to be as ardently attached to the Union of these States as any man within their limits, and exceedingly anxious that our present diffculties should be adjusted, and that Union thereby pre- served, I am not willing to join in so broad a dec- laration, Consequently I vöte " no." [Applause and hisses in the galleries and upon the floor.] Mr
MORRIS, of Illinois
lhopc that 1 will be allowed to answer the question of the gentle- man from Maryland
[Cries of" No!" Too late!" ' 'l object P'] The
language of my reso- lution is that of Washington 's Farewell Address; are gentlemen afraid of it
[Cries of Order ! ' ' Mra HILL
I am willing, for one, that Wash- ington 's Farewell Address should be read every morning after prayers, if it would be productive of any beneficial effect
But I do not like the phraseology of tho resolution, and I therefore vote against it
am as much in favor of the Union as I ever have been
The vote was announced as above recorded
Mr
MORRIS, of I Ilinois, moved to reconsider the vote by which the resolution was adopted; and also moved that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table
The latter motion was agreed to

PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION
Mr
LANE
Mr
President, 1 ask leave to introduce some resolutions; and if it is not the pleasure of- the Senate to consider them now, I desire to give notice that I shall move them as a substitute for, or amendment to, the resolution introduced, by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mi
CLARK] yesterday
The Secretary read Mr
LANE 's resolutions, as follows: Whereas in the, years 1847—48 the northern States of this Union, by their Legislatures, and almost with unanimity, adopted resolutions in favor of what was called the Wilmot Proviso, prohibiting slavery in all the territory acquired passed counter resolutions, declaring that they would resist that ineasure at all hazards, and to the last extremity; and whereas in 1850 certain laws were enacted to settle the controversy between the two sections, caned the cmnpro- mise measures, agreeing that the people of the Territories, on entering the Union, should decide the question of sla- very tor themselvcs; and whereas at the last presidential election the peoplc of the northern States, by the election of a President on the Chicago platform, have reaffirmed their previous position, that slavery shall be excluded from ail the 'J'erritories of the Union, now and hereafter; and whereas a numÉer of tnc southern States, regarding eaid decision as destructive of the equality of the States and of their equal rights in the common territory of our e.ommon country, ultin•ately fatal to tbevystcm of society, and the agitation- resulting from such policy as imminently dangerous to their domestic peace and safety, have indi- cated a purpose to dissolve their political connection with thc northern States, and there is reason to believe that all the southexn States will-soon unite in said rnovement ; and whereas a dissolution of this Union woutd result in great disasters to both sections, and, if attended with Civit war
in horrors perhaps exceediug any that history has ro- corded; and whereas it is now apparent that the present syst.ein of governJnent is not adequate to the exigenéies of the times, to the changes of opinion and of circtunstance.s ; and, particularly, that the mode prescribed in the present Constitution for atnendtncnts thereto, is not, froun the sec- character of the controversy, and the urgency of events, ade.(luate to tbc occasion ; und whereas in a sin-ü- lar ditlieulty our (ijretht.bers, finding the of the
Articles of the Conti„uleration ilnpracticablc, called on the States to aet separately, t.o devise another plan govern- tnent, aud that course was adopted and crowned with sue
Resolved, 'I'hat the several States be requested to send co:mnlssioners ('r delegates to a convention, to consult on the ehanges which the present
times require
And whereas the southern States, being in a numerical minotity; complairi of aggressions, previous and prospect- ivc from the northern States : ic it resolved, That the delegates of said southern States be requested to convene firs) -by themse.lves to confer on the ('011ditlons ncccssary för their security arid peace, and submit their conclusions either to the delegates or tbc northern States separately convened, or to a convention of all the northern States
und hc it further resolucd, That it is contrary and abhor- rent to thc religion and civilization of our aoe, and to the si)irit of our Constitution
to interfere in any way by rorcc with such steps as any of the States feeling ao«rieved Inay *Rnd be it further resolved, That the Federal Govcrnrncnt will abstain from the ernployment all or any torcc to prövent or interfOrc with any State or States which Shall (let.ortnino by itself or themselves on any course tor their own prosperity and which shall not be aggressive ,owards the other States ; and iu any case where thcrc 'nay be danger of collision between any State and tile _FQderal forces stationed there, the it»rces bc pronnptly withdrawn
Mr
DOUGLAS
I would suggest that these resolutions lie over, and when the committee of thirteen is appointed on the motion of the Sena- tor from Kentucky, (Mr
POWELL,] that this and all similar, propositions go to that committee for consideration
Mr
DAVIS
And be printed
Mr
DOUGLAS
Yes; and be printed
The VICE PRESIDENT
Does the Senator move the printing of these resolutions 
Mr
LANE
What did the Senator from Illi- nois propose
I did not hear
Mr
DOUGLAS
'I'hat the resolutions lie on view and without the least ambitious feeling what- ever connected with it, prepared a series of con- stitutional amendments, which I desire to offer to the Senate, hoping that they may form, in part at least, some basis for measures that may settle the controverted questions which now so much agi- tate our country
Certainly, sir, i do not pro- pose now any elaborate discussion of the subject
Before presenting these resolutions, however, to the Senate, I desire to make a few remarks ex- planatory ofthcm, thatthe Senate may understand their general scope
The questions of an alarming character are those which have grown out of the controversy between thö northern and southern sections of our country in relation to the rights of the slave- holding States in the rrerritories of the United States, and in relation to the rights of the citizens I have endeavored of the latter in their slaves
by these resolutions to meet all these questions and causes of discontent, and by amendments to the Constitution of the United States, so that the settlement, if we can happily agree on any, may be permanent, and leave no cause for future con- troversy
These resolutions propose, then, in the first place, in substance, the restoration of the Missouri compromise, extending the line through- out the Territories of the United States to the east- ern border of Califörnia, recwnizing slavery in ali the territory south of that line, and prohibiting slavery in all the territory north of it; with a pro- vision, however, that when any of thosc Terri- arc formed into States, tories, north or south, they shall then be at liberty to exclude or admit slavery as they please; and that, in the one case or the other, it shall bc no objection to their ad- mission into the Union
In this way, sir, I pro- pose to settle the question, both as to territory and slavery, so far as it regards the Territories of the, United States
I propose, sir, also, that the Constitution shall be so amended as to declare that Congress shall have no power to abolish slavery in t.he District of Colurnbia so long as slavery exists in the States of Maryland and Virginia; and that they shall have no power to abolish slavery in any of the places under their special jurisdiction within the southern States
These arc the constitutional amendments which I proposc, and ennbrace the whole of them in re- gard to the questions of territory and slavery
There are other propositions in relation to griev- ances, and in relation to controversies, which I suppose are within tho jurisdiction of Congress, and may be removed by the
action of Congress
I propose, in regard to legislative action, that the fugitive slave law, as it is commonly called, shall be declared by the Senate to be a constitutional act, in strict pursuance of the Constitution
propose to declare, that it has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to be con- stilutional, and that thc southern States are enti- tled to a faithful and complete execution of that law, and that no amendment shall be made here- after to it which will impair its efiiciency
But, the table until the committee is appointed, and then send them all to the committee
Mr
LANE
I have no objection
The VICE PRESIDENT
The Chair will put the question now on the motion to print the reso- lutions
The motion was agreed to
COMPROMISE OF SLAVERY QUESTION
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 am gratified, Mr
President, to see in the various propositions which have been made, such a universo.l anxiety to save the country from the dangerous dissensions which now prevail; and I have, under a very serious thinking that it would not
impair its efficiency, I have proposed amendinents to it in two particu- I have understood from gentlemen of the North that there is objection to the provision giving a different fee where the commissioner de- cides to deliver the slave to the claimant, from that which is given where he decides to discharge the ulieged slave; the law declares that in the latter case he shall have but five dollars, while in the other he shall have ten dollars—twice the amount in one
case than in the other
The reason for this In case he delivers the servant is very obvious
to his claimant, he is required to draw outa lentrthy certificate, stating the principal and substantial ffrounds on which his decision rests, and to return him cither to thc Inarshal or to the claim- ant to remove him to the State from which he escaped
It was for that reason that a larger fee was given to the commissioner, where he Kad the largest service to perfortn
But, sir, the act being viewed unfavorably and with great prejudice, in a certain portion of our country, this was regarded as very obnoxuous, because it seemed to give an inducement to the commissioner to return the much as the fifth section of that law was worded somewhat vaguely, its general terms had ad- mitted of the construction in the northern States that all the citizens were required, upon the •sum- mons of the marshal, to eo with him to hunt up, as they express it, and arrest the slave; and this is regarded as obnoxious
They have said, the southern States you make no such requisition on the citizen;" nor do we, sir
The section, con- strued according to the intention of the framers of it, I suppose, only intended that the marshal should have the same right in the execution of process for the arrest ofa slave that he has in all other cases of process that he is required to exe- cute—to call on the posse comitatus for assistance where he is resisted in the execution of his duty, or where, havino• executed his duty by the arrest, an attempt is made to rescue the slave
I propose such an amendment as will obviate this difficulty and limit the right of the Inaster and the duty of the citizen to cases where, as in regard to all other process, persons may be called upon to assist m resisting opposition to the execution of the laws
1 have provided further, sir, that the amend- ments to the Constitution which I here propose, and certain other provisions of the Constitution itself, shall be unalterable, thereby forming a permanent and unchangeable basis for peace and tranquillity among the people
Among the pro- visions in the present Const.itution, which I have by amendment proposed to render unalterable, is that provision in the first article of the Constitu- lion which provides the rule for representation, including in the computation three fifths of the slaves
That is to be rendered unchangeable
Another is the provision for the delivery of fugi- tivc slaves
That is to be rendered unchangeable
And with these provisions, Mr
President, it seems to me wc have a solid foundation upon which we may rest our hopes for the restoration of peace and good-wilt among all the Ståtes of this Union, and all the people
I propose, sir, to I have ex- enter into no particular discussion
plained the general scope and object of my prop- I have provided further, which I ought osi tion
to mention, that, there having been some difficul- ties experienced in the courts of the United States in the South in currying into execution the prohibiting the African slave trade, all additions and amendments which may be necessary to those laws to render them effectual should be immedi- ately adopted by Congress, and especially the pro- visions of those laws which prohibit the import- 1 ation of African slaves into the United States
have further provided it as a recommendation to all the States of this Union, that whereas laws have been passed of an unconstitutional charac- ter, (and all laws are of that character which either conflict with the constitutional acts of Congress, or which in their operation hinder or delay the proper execution of the acts of Congress,) i.vhich laws are null and void, and yet, though null and void, they have been the source of mischief and discontent in the country, under the extraordi- nary circumstal')ces in which we are placed ; Ihave supposed that it would not be impropel' or unbe- comirw in Congress to recommend to the States, both North and South, the repeal of all such acts of theirs as were intended to control, or intended to obstruct the operabion of the acts of Congress, or which in their operation and in their applica- tion have been made use of for the puroose of such hindrance and opposition, and that they will re- peal these laws or make such explanations or cor- rections of them as to prevent their being used for any such mischievous purpose
I have endeavored to look with impartiality from one end of our country to the other; I have endeavored to search up what appeared to me to be the causes of discontent pervading the land; and, as far as I am capable of doing so, I have f am endeavored to propose a remedy for them
far from believmg that, in the shape in which I present these measures, they will meet with the It will be sufficiently acceptance of the Senate
gratifying if, with all the amendments that the superior knowledge of the Senate may make to I them, they shall, to any effectual extent, quiet the country
slave to the master, as he thereby obtained the} Mr
President, great dungers surround us
_ The larger fee of ten dollars instead of the smaller one Union of these States is dear to the people of the of five dollars
I havc said, let the fee be the same United States
The long experience of its bless- ings, the mighty hopes of the future, have made it in both cases
dear to the hearts of the American people
What- I have understood, furthermore, sir, that inas-  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN TII%RTY-SIXTH &NGRESS, -2D SESSION
ever politicians may say; whatever of dissension may, in the heat of party be created among our people, when you come down to the question of the existence of the Constitution, that is a question beyond all party- politics; that is a question of life and death
The Constitution and the Union are the life of this great people—yes, sir, the life of life
We all desire to preserve them, North and South; that is the universal de- sire
But some of the southern States, smarting under what they conceive to be aggressions of their northern brethren and of the northern States, are not contented to continue this Union, and are taking steps, formidable steps, towardsadissolu- tion of the Union, and towards the anarchy and the bloodshed, I fear, that are to follow
say, sir, we are in the presence of great events
We must elevate ourselves to the •level of the great occasion
No party warfare about mere party questions or part\ measures ought now to engage our attention
'1 hey are left behind; they are as dust in the balance
The life, the existence of our country, of our Union, is the mighty ques- tion; and we must elevate ourselves to all those considerations which belong to this high subject
I hope, thercfore, gentlemen will be disposed to bring the sincerest spirit of conciliation, the sincerest spirit and desire to adjust all these dif- ficulties, and to think nothing of any little
con- cessions of •opinions that they may make, if thereby the Constitution and the country can be preserved
The great dificulty here, sir—I know it; I rec- ognize it as the diffcult question, particularly with the gentlemen from the North—is the ad- mission of this line of division for the territory, and the recognition of slavery on the one side, and the prohibition of it on the other
The rec- ognition of slavery on the southern side of that line is the great diåculty, the great question with them
Now, I beseech them to think, and you, Mr
President, and all, to think whether, for such a comparative trifle as that, the Union of this country is to be sacrificed
Have we realized to ourselves the momentous consequences of such an event
When has the seen such an event
This is a mighty empire
Its existence spreads its influence throughout the civilized world
Its overthrow will be the greatest shock that civilization and free government have re- ceived; more extensive in its consequences; more fatal to mankind and to the great principles upon which the liberty of mankind depends, than the French revolution with all its blood, and with ail its war and violence
And ali for what
Upon questions concerning this line of division between slavery and freedom
Why, Mr
President, sup- pose this day all the southern States, being re- fused this right; being refused this partition; being denied this privilege, wero to separate from the Morthern States, and do it peacefully, and then were to come to you peacefully and say, let there be no war between us; let us divide fairly the Territories of the United States:" could the northern section of the country refuse so just a demand
What would you then give them 
What would be the täir proportion
If you al- lowed them theu• fair relative proportion, would you not give them as much as is now proposed to be assigned on the southern side of that line, and would thcy not be at liberty to carry their slaves there, if they pleased
You would give them the whole of that; and then what would be its fate 
Is it upon the general principle of humanity, then, that you [addressing Republican Senators] wish to put an end to slavery, or is it to be urged by you as a mere topic and point of party con- troversy to sustain party power
Surely I give you credit for looking at it upon broader and more generous principles
Then, in the worst event, after you have encountered disunion, that greatest of ail political calamities to the people of this country, and the disunionists come, the sep- arating States come, and demand or take their portion of the Territories, they can take, and will be entitled to take, all that will now lie on the 8 WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1860
southern side of the line which I have proposed
Then they will' have a right to permit slavery to exist in it; and what do you gain for the cause of anti-slavery
Nothing whåtever
Suppose you should refuse their demand, and claim the whole for yourselves: that would be a flagrant injustice which you would not be willing that I should sup- pose would occur
But if you did, what would be the consequence
A State north and a State south, and all the States, north and south, would be attempting to grasp at and seize this territory, and to get all of it that they could
That would be the
struggle, and you would have war; and not only disunion, but all these fatal consequences would follow from your refusal now to permit slavery to exist, to recognize it as existing, on the southern side of the proposed line, while you give to the people there the right to exclude it when they come to form, a State government, if such should be their will and pleasure
Now, gentlemen, in view of this subject, in view of the mighty consequences, in view of the great events which are present before you, and of the mighty consequences which are just now to take effect, is it not better to settle the question by a division upon the line of the Missouri com- promise
For thirty years we lived quietly and peacefully under it
Our people, North and South, were accustomed to look at it as a proper and just line
Can we not do so again
We did it then to preserve the peace of the country
Now you gee this Union in the most imminent danger
declare to you that it is my solemn conviction that unless something be done, and something equivalent to this proposition, we shall be a sep- orated and divided people in six months from this time
That is my firm conviction
There is no man here who deplores it more than I do; but it is my sad and melancholy conviction that that I wish you to realize will be the consequence
I wish you to realize fully the fully the danger
consequences which are to follow
You can give increased stability to this Union; you can give it an existence, a glorious existence, for great and glorious centuries to come, by now setting it upon a permanent basis, recognizing what the South considers as its rights; and this is the greatest of them all: it is that you should divide the territory by this line and allow the people south of it to have slavery when they are ad- mitted into the Union as States, and to have it during the existence of the territorial govern- Is it not the cheapest price ment
That is all
at which such a blessing as this Union was ever purchased
You think, perhaps, or some of you, that there is no danger, that It will but thunder and pass away
Do not entertain such a fatal delusion
I tell you it is not so
I tell you that as sure as we stand here disunion will progress
I fear it may swallow up even old Kentucky in its vortex—as true a State to the Union as yet exists in the whole Confederacy—unless some- thing be done; but that you will have disunion, that anarchy and war will follow it, that all this will take place in six months, I believe as confi- dently as I believe in your presence
I want to satisfy vou of the fact
Mr
President, l, rise to suggest another con- sideration
I have been surprised to find, upon a little examination, that when the peace of 1783 was made, which recognized the, independence of this country by Great Britain, the States north of Mason and Dixon 's line had but a territory of one hundred and sixty-four thousand square mile.s, while the States south of Mason and Dixon 's line had more than six hundred thousand square miles
[t was so divided
Virginia shortly afterwards ceded to the United States all that noble territory north west of the Ohio river, and excluded slavery from it
That changed thc relative proportion of territory
After that, the North had four hundred and twenty-five thousand square miles, and the South three hundred and eighty-five thousand
Thus, at once, by the concession of Vircyinia, the North, from one hundred and sixty-four t rose to four hundred and twenty-five thousand square miles, and the South fel\ from six hundred C

thousand to -three hundred and eightyeffW%th0R9 sand- square
miles
BYfrthat cession came smaller -ine<ent than the Nora-i
let us look beyond
intend to take upak.;litble• time as possible, and to avoid details; but take.all: -your subsequent acquisitionsof Florida, of Lou-x Isiana, of Oregon, of Texas, and the acquisitions made from Mexico
They have been BO divided; and so disposed of that the North has now, two
millions, two hundred thousand square miles of territory,_and the South has less than one million
Under these circumstaoceé_-, when you have 'been so greatly do not complain of it, I am stating facts—when- your section has 'been- made so mighty' by-these great acquisitions, and to a great' extent with•tbe- perfect consent of 'the South, ought you to hesitate
now upon adopting this line which will leave to you ton the, north: side of it nine hundred and odd thousand•square miles, and leave to the South only two •hundred, and eighty-five thousand
It will give you three times as much as it will give her
There is three: times as much land in youv portion as 
in; hers.
The South has already occupied some of it, and it is in States; but altogether the South gets by this division two hundred and eighty-five thou- sand square miles, and the North nine hundred thousand
The result of the whole of it is, that the North has two million two hundred thousand square miles and the South only one million
1 mention this as no reproach, as no upbraid- I do not ing, as no complaint—none at all
speak in that spirit; I do not address you in that temper
But these are the facts, and _they ought* it eems to me, to have some weight; and when we come to make .a peace-offering, are we to count it, are we to measure it nicely in golden scales
You get a price, and the dearest prace, for all -the, concession asked to be made—you have the firmer esta blishment of your Union ; you have the restor- ation of peace and tranquillity, and the hopes of a mighty future, all secured by this concession
How dearly must one individual, or,two individ- uals, or many individuals, value their private opinions if they think them more important to the world than this mighty interest of the Union and Government of the United States! It is a glorious sac- Sir, it is a cheap sacrifice
rifice
This Union cost a great deal to establish it cost the yielding of much of public opinion it; and much of policy, besides the direct or indirect cost of it in all the war to establish the independ- ence• of this country
When it was done, Gen- eral Washington himself said, Providence has helped us, or we could not have accomplished this thing, And this gift of our wiscst men; this great work of their hands; this work-in thefound- ation and the structure of which Providence him- self, with -his benignant hand, helpéd=are we Ito give it all up for such small eonsiderations
The present exasperation; the presentfeeiing of dis- union, is the result of a long-continued contro- versy on the subject of slavery and of territory
I shall not attempt to trace that controversy; it is unnecessary to the occasion, and might be harm- In relation to such controversies, I will say, ful
though, that all the wrong is never on one side, or all the right on the other
Right and wrong, in this world, and in all* such controversies,• are I forbear now any discussion mingled together
or any refrrence to the right or wrong of the con- troversy, the mere party controversy; •but in the progress of party, we now come to a point where party ceases to deserve and the preservation of the Union demands our highest and our grea test exert.ions
the Con- stitution of the country is the highest duty of the Senate, the highest duty of Congress—to preserve it and to perpetuate it, that we may hand down the glories which we have received to- our ehil-s dren and to our posterity, and to generations far beyond us, We are, Senators, in positions where history is to take notice of the course we pursue
History is to record us

Whereas serious and alarming dissensions have arisen between the northern and southern States, concerning the rights and security o! the rights of the slaveholding States, and especially their rights in the con-nnon territory of the Uhited States ; and whereas it is eminel'lt.!y desirable and proper that these dissensions, wbicil now threaten the very existence of this Union, should be permanently quieted and settled by constitutional provisions, which shall do equal justice to all sections, and thereby restore to the people that peace and good-will which ought to prevail between all the citizens of the United States: Theretöre, Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States of ,Rmwica in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Ilouses concurring,) That thc fbllowing arti- cles be, and are hereby, proposed and subrnitted as amend* jnents to the Constitution of the (Jnited States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of said Consti- tution, when ratified by convenUons of three iburths of the several States ARTICLE l.- In all the territory of the United States now held, or hereafter acquired, situate north of latitude 360 slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, is prohibited while such territory shan remain under territorial government

Nor shall Congress at any tllno prohibit oflicers of the Federal Govermnent, or mem- bers of Congress, whose duties require them to be in said District., from bringina with them t.heir slaves, and holding i them as such during the time their duticsmay require thern i to remain there, and -afterwards taking tbe:n froin tuc Dis- trict

'l'hat in addition to tho
provisions of the third paraorapil of the second section of Lho iburth article of the Constitution of the United States, C,ongrcss shall have power to provide by law, and it shall be its duty so to pro- vide
that the United States shali pay to t.he owner who shall' apply fbr it, the full value of his fugitive slave ili all cases when t.he ntarghal or other aflieer whose dnty it was to arrest said fugitive was prevented fronn so doing by vio- Icnec or intunidati011, or when, after arrest, said fugitive was rescued by turee

Resol•éed by the Senate and House of Representatit•es.of thc Uhited States of americä in Conk/ess asseiwbl.ett; 'Fhat the
laws now in forec for the recovery of fugitive, slave* are in strict pursuance of the plain and mandatory provis- ions ute the Constitution, and have been sanctioned as valid and constitutional by tlie judgment of the Suprwne (N,ouct of the Unitéd States ; that the siaVeßolding States are enti- tied to the faithful observance and execution of those laws, and that they ought
not to be i•epealed, or so modified or changed as to impair their-effciency; and that laws ought to be, made for the punishment of •those
who- attempt by rescue ot the slave, or other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution of said -laws
2
'Ithat•a'Il'State laws -which eonflict with the fugitive slave acts of any other constitutional acts of Congress, or-which, in their operation, impede, hinder, or delay the free course and due execut.ion of any of said acts, are nuil and void by the plain provisions of the Constituticni of the United States; yet those State laws, void as they are, have given color to practices; and led to consequences, which have obstructed the due administration and execu- tion of acts of Congress, and especially the acts ihr the de- livery of fügitive slaves, and have thereby•contributed rnucll to the discord a-nd comrnotion •now-prevailing
Congress, therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does 110t deam It improper, respectfülly and earnestly to recommend the repeal of those to the several States which nave en- acted them

And to avoid illiseonstruction, the last clause of the fifth section of said act, which authorizes the person holding a warrant for the arrest or detcnüon of a fugitive slave, to summon to his aid the posse comitatus, and which decla•res it to be thc duty of all good citizens to assist hizn in its execution,' ought to be so ainendcd as to expressly lirnit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall be resistance or danger of resi*tanee or rescue

HALE

DOUGLAS
1 rise to a question of order
My object is not to embarrass the Senator from New Hampshire, but I think it— The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator frorri Now Hampshire yield the floor
Mr
HALE
Only upon a question of order
Mr
DOUGLAS
1 rise to a question of order
I rose simply to *pieserve the order of business
If the Senate proposes to postpone it, very well; but I understand the motion to postpone is not a debatable question
As regards the priority of business, I suppose the unfinished business cornes up, and the Senator from Tennessee is entitled to the floor, unless he waives it
I am Willing to postpone it if it is the wish of the Senate, but [ want the
order of business preserved according to the rule
Mr
HALE
On the question of order, I would like to have the judgment of the Chair whether a motion to postpone is debatable
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair understands that the rule has been construed not to allow discussion upon the merits of the ques- tion; but it has been usual in the Senate to allow the Senator time to' state his reasons why he wants the order postponed; and in that view the Sena- tor can do so
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
To relieve the Senate from the difficult.y in which it seems to be involved, I think the business had better come up lam entitled to the floor when in regular order
that comes up; and if the Senator desires to con- sume but a few minutes, I will yield-him the floor for a short lime
Mr
HALE
I am much obliged to the Senator
The PRESIDING OFFICER
It is for the Senator from New Hampshire to state the reasons why he wants it postponed
Mr
HALE
•The reason why I wish it post- poned is this— Mr
JOHNSON, ofTennessee
1 wantto know how thc Scnator from •New Hampshire got the floor to make the motion, when I was upon the floor 
The PRESIDING OFFICER.
Thatquestion was not made by the Senator from Tennessee, and the Senator rose from his seat and was recog- nized by the Chair
According to strict parlia- mentary rule, the Senator from Tennessee, when the regular business is up, is entitled to the floor
Mr
HALE
well, sir, he may take it
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
The Senator from New Hampshire perhaps did not understand me
I wanted business to proceed in:its regular order; and then I said I would x,vaive a few mo- ments of my time if, he wished to say anything to the Senate
Mr
HALE
Oh, I do not know that I care about it
The PRES\DING OFFICER
The Senator from Tennessee is entitied to the floor
Mr
CRITTENDEN
1 beg leave to ask the Senator from Tennessee to allow me simply to have a motion made for printing the resolutions I have offered
IVII•
JOHNSON, of Tennessee

Mr
DOUGLAS
I believe that has already been done
'The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair understands that that motion has been agreed to, and the resolutions have been ordered to be printed 
Mr

No, sir, that question was not The PRESIDING OFFICER

The motion was not put

Certainly
'Mr
TRUMBULL
There is some confusion here, occasioned by the attempt to enforce strictly the rules of the Senate
Now, if the Senate will indulge rne for one moment, I will state how I think it may be obviated
The hour for calling up the special order passed w bile the Senator from Kentucky was on the flocn•, every one de- siring to hear him conclude his The Senator from New Hampshire has but a word to say, as understand, and the Senator from Ten- nessee is quite willing that he should say it
It seems to me that as we have passed the hour, the Senator from New Hampshire might be permitted to say his word or Iwo, and we go on regularly with the business
We have already lost more time
in this attempt to cnforce the strict
rule than it would havo taken to hear him twice over, as I understand hiln
I hope the Senate will allow him to say the few words he wishes to say, ['K cer- tainly,"] and then the Senator from Tennessee will proceed, as I understand he is willing that the Senator from New Hampshire should pursue that course
i stated dis- Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
tinctly that I woultl consent to that
Mr
DOUGLAS
There is nobody objecting to the Senator from New Hampshire now speak- ing but himself
The Senator from Tennessee has yielded the floor to him, no other Senator ob- jects, and he himself is the only man thatobjects [Laugh ter.l now to his speaking
Mr
HALE
well, Mr
President, 1 am ex- ccedingly obliged to the Senate, and to the hon- orable Senator from Tennessee, and to the hon- orable Senatoe from Illinois; butl am afraid that there has been so much fuss about my getting on the floor that expectations may havc been excited that I piqopose to make a speech, when I do not in- tend any such thing; but I simply rose in my place for the purpose of saying that whatever might be thought of the wisdom, or the practicability, or the expediency of the remedy suggested by the honorable Senator from Kentucky, [Mr
CRIT- TENDEN,] nobody would doubt the purity of his motive, the integrity, the disinterestedness, and poses, and I do pYöpöse's to,disebSsVit
erise for a simple purpost% which I Will State
, A few davs„sinée when the honoråble-' Senator from New York [Mr
KING] proposed an amend- ment to the resolution introduced, hon- orable Senator from Kentucky, [Mr., and the honorable Senator.from C,önbeeiictiGäiot now in his seat, [Mr•.' FOSTER',] marks expressive of
his sympathy Withithe i'.iows of the Senator from Nev,v York, an honorablé Senator from- Louisianas now in rn,y eye,- [Mr
BENJAMIN,] arose, and i thought: with -great pet- tinency and propriety suggested that, for the pai!- pose of informing himself as to' the state of public sentiment here, and among the people that We represent, he desired to know-zl- cannot state •his very words; but I think I state the substance of what if I do not, shoukd- be glad to be corrected—he desired -to know 'What was •in- tended by the .motion of the, honörable Seriator from New York; and further than that, in an like spirit of for information at that time, he would like also tohave the_views of the Senator from Connecticut upon: the, same subject
Now, sir, I stand here in .preeisOlY'that situation; seeking for -införmation
I listened last week, with a good deal •of pleas- ure, to the •long, able, erratic speech of the dis- tin uished Senator from Texas, right before -me, ] If it had no- Other merit—aid IGFALL
i do not mean to sav that it had not a great many others— it was explicit
I understood it; I un- derstood what he wants, what he expects, what he demands; and the way it was put to us was that we, northern men representing the success- ful party—he appealed to several of us here whom he designated as representative men, and even went so low as to name so individual as myself among them—he said we mustgo home and teach our people •certain things
1 do not remember all that he said; 1 have a-general im- pression of it, and I suppose -:his words can be found in the chronicles of the the Globe
I have also listened to the honorable Senator from Kentucky [Mr
CRITTENDEN] to-day; and from my recollection of the speech of the honor- able Senator from Texas, and comparing it with that of the -honorable Senator from -Kentucky to- day, I should judge, as the old theologians say, that they do not belong to the same see" of po}- itics
'The demands which are put forth to-day as being sufficient to produce quiet, restore har- mony, and preserve " this glorious Union,' are of an entirely different character from those pro- posed by the honorable Senator from Texas
The honorable Senator from Texas spoke for the Union wing of his party
My desire is to know vyrhich of these two distinguished Senators represents the demands that are to be made upon our people at home in order to secure this Union; because it has been said, and well said, that we cannot do it here; it must be done by our people
Well, sip, in .the communication which I have with the peo- ple that I represent, when ul talk
to them 'and'i•ep- resent to them that if they• accede to the proposi- tions and demands made by the honorable Senator from Kentucky to-day, the Union may be pre- served and harmony restored, and some one then gets up and flings in my face the eloquent-speeca of t.he Senator from Texas, altogether different in its demands, and covering a vastly broader field of concession, I want to know whether then -I may be permitted to say, " the hon'orable Senator from Kentucky represents the real, genuine, bona fide sentiments of the Union-loving people of tho South; and the honorable Senator from Texas, where he differs from him, does not;" or, shall I I be compelled to say that the patriotic effusion of the -honorable Senator from Kentucky is simply the effusion of his• ov.rn benevolent and .patriotic heart, but does not embody the-demands-and sen- timents of the southern
people, and that they are more correctly presented in the speech of the hon- orable Senator from Texas 
Now, sir, this is what I want to know—not that I wish to flatter gentlemen that either the
one or * the other will be acceptable to the people whom rcpresent
i do not knowe The honorable ator from Texas says he never gives.hjs opinion unless it is asked; and not then, unless be the fervor of his patriotism
Everybody accords I I or expects to be paid for it
- ['Laughter.] to him that, whatever may be thought of thc sir, my opinion has not been asked, -nor do II value or thc practicability of the remedy he pro- expect any pay

Welb I have- not looked at the Globe; but i heard it
Mr

J well; it is in there, if you heard it
Mr

I: think I cannot -be mistaken
But, sir, all: jesting
apart, for I am np,t- jesting, I do really.want to know
My judgment, if it be given; my advice, ifit be te-ndered, may be over- ruled; and it;rnay depend very much on the fact which -of these two gentlemen really is the
organ to the demands of the South as to the continu- ance and preservation of the•Union
When I say I desire that, of course 1_ do not desire an answer to this question from either of these two gentle- men, becauseW•ney have given their views; but the information that I desu•e would come (as that solicited•by the Senator from Louisiana, if I un- derstood him) from different gentlemen upon that side of the Senate
It gentlemen who, I think, can answer this question; and it seems to me that it.is due to candor, when such widely dif- ferent propositions- as these are made as to the price
and condition of the permanence of the Union, that before
we consult with our constitu- ents, and ask them, if-they will accede tothe terms, they ought to know-which is the..genuine demand of the southern -side-4 mean of the Union party of the South, because, that is the party that the 
Senator from Texas belongs to
- After we have got an answer from the Union Senators on that side of the Chamber, if there are any disunion- ists I should like to hear from them; and I should like to know whether those that favor disunion are willing to abide by the conditions which have been announced by one, of the Union members from that side—I refer to the honorable Senator from Texas

SAULSBURY
Mu•
President, will the Senator from New Hampshire allow me sto say a word
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator from New Hampshire yield the floor 
Mr
HALE
If the Senator is one of that class
Mr
SAULSBURY
i am
one of the Union Senators on this floor; and my State is in favor of-thspreservatiön of the Union
l, for one, amkwilling to accept the proposition presented by the Senator from- Kentucky
now ask the Sen- ator from New Hampshire whether he will rec- ommend the adoption of the propositions submit- ted by the Senator from •Kentucky to his people, provided he is assufed that that will preserve the Union ofnthe States 
Mr; HALE
Well, sir, I was trying to get thc ground.all before me before I answered: I do not want to answer by installments
I wanted to know; I was inquiring for information; and the honorable Senator from Delaw_are must have mis- understood my interrogatory, bccause I said that the honorable Senatorfrom Texas had represen ted himself (and, of course, I had no disposition to question him) as one of the strongest Union mcn on that sideof the Chamber, and I desired to hear from the disunionists,if there were any such ; and it was in answer to that appeal that the Senator from Delaware avoweüimself to be one of them, evidently misunderstånding the form in which put the question
Well now, sir, the honorable Senator from Delaware asks me a_question which I will answer, though I do not feel myself bound to do So
With my present conviction, I will not agree to theSe propositions in all their, extent
T here are some things there that I would
agree to; but to the extent that those resolutions go, would not recommend my people to accede to them
If they ask my advice, they can have it
But when i say 'thåt, I do not mean to say that there are not many things in the proposition of the Senator from Kentucky that' commend them- selves to my judgment
There are some things that do not
I have -listened to denunciations of a geographical line so long that 1 have not all at once become a eon vert to it
fl'here was a dis- tinguished lawyer once in my State who, when he began his arguments) sometimes produced an impression upon the mil'Jd of Lbe court that inr duced thetn to go off with an intimation of an opinion when thcy had not maturely considered CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 18, the subjeCt; and béföre the case Was throügh they had to reverse it
On a certain occasion, he was arguing a great- question before them, and the court Iritimated an opinion in his favor
He looked up in their faces with a good deal of saga- city sand said, Will your honorsstick." Taught by past experience, when another geographical line:is proposed as the great remedy, I should sa to you, gentlemen, ' 'Will your honors stick
Will you give an assurance that after the geo- craphlcal line has been established, and run to the Pacific ocean, or to the islands beyond, in the progress of time the interests of the country, or the demands of the party, or some new construc- tion of the Constitution, may not require that that shall be abandoned
I should want to have some assurance upon that point before I agree at once to recommencr another geographical line
I do not believe, sir, that the remedy is to be sought there, I do not believe that the •remedy is to be soughtin new constitutional provisions; but in an honest, faithful execution of the things that are already written in the compact and in the bond
am willing, and I hope the State I represent is willing, to look this matter all over fairly, calmly, and dispassionately, and if there be anything that can be demanded of that State consistent with the dignity that belongs to a free State, and the re
gard •that she owes to the Constitution, I have no doubt that she will render and perform it to the letter and to the spirit
But I say, with all defer- ence, that I think these new compacts and these amendments are the mere daubing of the wall with untempered mortar
They arenotwhatis required to sustain the fabric of our Government
But, sir, I do not wish to say anything that shall be construed into a pledge for my people
I haw no right to give it
They have given t leir own pledge in the history of their own lives, and I think that is a pledge of fidelity to the Consti- tution; and they will givc it still
But, sir, let me say to gentlemen on the other side of this Chamber, whatever may be your grievances, I think you are too prone, constantly and contin- ually and perseveringly, to throw thc blame over here; as if this Republican party, 'vvhich, as it were, sprang up like Jonah 's gourd in the night, is to be the pack-horse upon which are to be saddled all the evils that you bear or fear in the present or in the future
You fear that this Re- publican party is to be proscriptive and violative of the Constitution
Where do you find it
You fear that you are to be under the ban
Sir, where have we been, where have I been, where have the men that sympathize with me been, in all the long years that are past
Have we not been publicly proclaimed upon the floor of this Senate to be.unworthy ofa seat on one of your commit- tees
Yes, sir; we, and the States we repre- sented, have been disfranchised by the iron rule of a relentless political majority on this floor
I that it is not mhy years since remember, sir, the nomination of Edward Everett—who has been making speeches on Washington for do not know how long, and singing peons to the Union —to represent this Republic at the Court of St
James was hung up, and confirmation refused for weeks and weeks, because it was intimated that at some time in the course of his life—it must have been a good while ago—he had uttered some sentiments which were not deemed sound upon this subject of slavery
With all his learning, and all his great att.ainments—and his learninff and his attainments are such as do honor to the country—he was not deemed qualified to repre- sent this
Government at the Court of St
James, because it wras supposed that at some time, on some occasion, he had given utterance to senti- ments that were not deemed sound and orthodox by the political majority on II-nis floor
Sir, so •far as my experience •oes, in from which I come, and in the State that I rcpresent on this floor, there has not been, in the whole Re- publican party of that State, nor in the *Whig op- position when the Opposition were called Whigs, a man who was considered worthy to receive a letter and put it into the post offce, or to be a tide-waiter around any of your custom-houses, or to do any act that required the sanction of this Federal Government or any of its subordinates
And how is your Post Offce administered to-day 
L in some public paper, this very day, an by the Acting Postmaster General, Mr
King, Of onc of his subordinates; and the crime alleged against him was, not that he did not faithfully and honestly and to the letter per- form everything _that was required of him, but it was that he was an Opposition man, and had been heard to speak disrespectfully of the Presi- dent of the United States: and he was called upon to account for that
Now, sir, I do not say this in any disposition to stir up angry feeling on the other side; but, gentlemen, while you call on us to look at the truth, why not look at it yourselves
Why not yourselves look and see if there has been no occa- Sion for the formation of the party that has been formed
You say we are a sectional party
Well, sir, why are we a sectional party
We are no more a sectional party than the party -that has been op- posed to us, with this difference, that you have been able to bring over to your side men who live where we do, to favor your sectional views; but your views and your measures have been more sectional, infinitely more so, than any that are to be apprehended from this Republican party
Now, sir, I know thatevery speech of this sort will be represented by those opposed to me as calculated and intended to stir up angry feelings on the other side
The honorable Senator from Georgia may tell us that there is a feeling of ha- tred, deep as hell, between his people and mine; and that will not be deplored in the President's prayer-meeting that he has got up
[Laughter.] NO, sir; not a word will be said about that; but the angry effusions of such a " fanatic" as I am will be deplored as sadly tending to a dissolution 
of the Union ! Sir, I do not know that this Congress can do anything; but this controversy will not be settled It has been well said, it will be done by here
the States; but, sir, the enlightened tribunal of the public opinion of Christendom will utter its voice, and I tell you there is no power on God's I remember earth that can stand before that
when Kossuth was a wanderer and an exile in the Empire of Turkey, and the Emperor of Rus- sia, think it was, demanded his deliverance—or the Emperor of Austria, I do not know which; they were allies in the war—but when the deliv- erance of Kossuth was demanded from the Sul- tan of Turkey, Mr
Webster, in one of the sub- limest effusions that fell from his lips, said that not a hair of his head should be
injured; and that if the Emperor of Russia or Austria dared to vio- late the sanctity of the shelter which Turkey had given him, he should stand up like u crimnal and plead before the >arof public opinion of the world ; he should 'hear himself arraigned and should hear the sentence which that tribunal would pronounce
Well, sir, the Kentucky Senator has welk said we are making history
We are making it, and making - it rapidly
Events are crowding upon us in thick succession
It does not become any of us, with rash and presumptuous courage or temerity, to shut our eyes -to what is before us
But, sir, I will say here—and with that close the few remarks that I have to make—that 'let be be- fore us what may, let the teeming womb of the future pour out upon this land what it may, I have no doubt and no fear that a righteous judg- ment will be pronounced by the enlightened pub- lic sentimentof Christendom; and when it is pro- nounced, it will be more omnipotent than fleets and armies; and it will silence, with its withering scorn, the carpings of those who undertake to utter anAhing in this day and this crisis incon- sistent with the demands of truth and ofa sound and conservative patriotism

Mr
Presi- den t— PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator yield the floor to enable the Chair to put the question on the motion to print the resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky 
Mr
JOHNSON, ofTennessec
Yes, sir
The motion to print was agl:eed to
STATE OF THE UNION
The Senate resumed the consideration of the following resolution of Mr
POWELL, as modified by him on the 10th instant: Resolved, That so much of the President's message as relates to thé present agitated and distracted condition of the country, and the grievances betvveen the slaveholding and the non-slavehoiding States, be referred to a special com- mittee of thirteen members ; and that said committee be instructed to inquire into the present condition of the coun- try, and report by bill or otherwise
 1860
Mr.JOHNSON, ofTennessee
Mr
President, I must say that I did not expect the Senator from New Hampshire to make quite so extensive a draw upon my time
He only desired a few mo- ments, seemingly by way of explanation, as I understood; and he has consumed well nigh one It is now nearly two o'clock
hour
Mr
HALE
1 beg pardon
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
I have a sug- gestion to make to the Senate
I am exceedingly anxious that this committee should be appointed, and that the work should be commenced
We, at least, ought to make an effort to save the coun- try, if we can, and I am unwilling to occupy •an attitude that would seem to delay or postpone any action that could be had by that committee
If it wmtld meet the pleasure of the Senate, I would propose that the resolution appointing the cam- mittee be adopted, let the reference of the Presi- dent Ps message be made, and then let the joint resolution which I introduced, proposing amend- ments to the Constitution, come up and take the place of it; and those who want to make speeches on this subject, can make them on that joint res- olution as legitimately as on the pending resolu- tion
That will save time
It will show the country that we are willing to go to work
The other resolution can takc the same place and open the field of discussion as wide as any one can I hope there will be no objection to the desire
adoption of the resolution appointing the com- mittee
Mr
DOUGLAS
I hope that course will be pursued
I think it will expedite business
I, for one, intend to address the Senate on this subject, and should be glad to expedite business by the appointment of e committee; and I hope there will be unanimous consent to that course
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
If the resolu- tion be adopted with the understanding that the joint resolution shall then come before the Senate and take its place, the committee can have all the propositions before them , and make some progress In the work
Mr
COLLAMER
I merely suggest to the gentleman that these various sets of resolutions which gentlemen present as containing projets for the consideration of the committee are all ex ected, I suppose, to go to that committee
{ar
JOHNSON, ofTennessee
All, with the exception of one, which is a joint resolution
It was for the purpose of expediting business that made the suggestion
I desire that the joint resolution introduced by me should remain before It may go to the committee at some the Senate
future time, if it should be the pleasure of the Senate
Mr
COLLAMER
I misunderstood the gen- tlen-ran
I thought he reserved the discussion on all the resolutions at the same time, that the reso- lutions were to be before the committee
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the adoption of the resolution offered by the Senator from Kentucky
Mr
G WIN
If we are going to vote on that resolution, I should like to know whether the amendment of the Senator from New York [Mr
KING] is pending
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair un- derstands not
Mr
POWELL
It is withdrawn
Mr
GWIN
Then 1 am in favor ofthe lution
The resolution wys adopted
Mr
FITCH
There is no resolution for the I move that th appointment of the committee
Vice President be vested with the appointment f the committee
The motion was agreed to
AMENDMENT or CONSTITUTION
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
What is the proposition now before the Senate 
The
PRESIDING OFFICER
There is no question now pending
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
Then 1 move that the joint resolution that I introduced some davs since be now taken up
The motion was agreed to; and the joint reso- lution No
48) proposing amendments to the Constitutipnof lhe Umted States was read a sec- ond time, and considered as in Committee of the Whole
Mr
JOHNSON, Mr
President, CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, by •the joint resolution now before the Senate, three amendments to the Constitution of the Uni- ted States are proposed
One proposes to change the mode of election of President and Vice Presi- dent of-the United States from the electoral col- lege 
to a vote substantially and directly by the people
The second proposes that the Senators of the United States shall be elected by the people, once in six years, instead of by the Legislatures of the respective States
The third provides that the Supreme Court shall be divided into
three classes: the term of the first class is to e*pire in four years from the time that the classification is made; of the second' class in eight years; -and Of the third class in twelve years; and as these vacan- cies occur they are to be filled by persons chosen one half from the slave States, and the other half from the non-slaveholding States, thereby taking the judges of the Supreme Court, so far as their selection goes, from the .respective divisions of the country
This proposition, in substance, was offered many years ago; in the House of Repre- sentatives; It has been somewhat changed, and is now offered again for the consideration of the Senate
Mr
President, if these amendments had been made, or the Constitution had been in the shape now proposed, I think the diffculties that are now upon the country ••.vould have been obviated
It would have been required that either the President or the Vice President should be taken from the South
That would have destroyed, to some ex- tent, the sectional character of our recent election
The next provision of the amendment would re- quire the votes cast for President and Vice Presi- dent to be cast by districts; and if we are to take as an indication the returns to the House of Rep- resentat.ives ofa majority of twenty-seven against the incoming Administration, it is pretty conclu- Sive that a President differing in politics and sen- timents from thß one who has-been recently elected would have been chosen
Each district would have voted directly for the President and Vice President of thc United States
The individual having a majority of the votes in that district would be considered as receiving onc electoral vote, just as we count the votes for one member of Congress
Hence, if all the votes in the re.- speetive districts had been cast on the same prin- Ci,ple, we should now have a majority of twenty- seven in opposition to the incoming Administra- tion; they would have given us a majority in the electoral colleges
It seems to me, if these propo- sitions were adopted and made a part of the Con- stitution, that, to u very great extent, the diff- culty and complaint that is now manifested in different portions of the country would be obvi- ated, and especially so with some improvement or modification of the law which provides for the restoration of fugitives from labor
It is not my purpose, sir, to discuss these prop- ositions to amend the Constitution in detail to- day, and I shall say but little more in reference to them and to their practical operation; but, as we are now, as it were, involved in revolution (for there is a revolution, in fact, upon the counr try,) think it behooves every man, and espe- cially every onc occupying a public place, to indi- cate, in some manner, his opinions and sentiments in reference to the questions that agitate and dis- tract the public mind
I shall be frank on this occasion in giving my views and taking nay po- sitions,• as I have always been upon questions that involve the public interest
1 belicvc it is the imperative.duty of Congress to make some effort to savc the country from impending dissolution; and he that is unwilling to make an effort to pre- serve the Union, or, in other words, to preserve the Constitution, and the Union as an incident resulting from the preservation of the Constitu- tion, I think is unworthy of public confidence, and the respect and gratitude of the American say it devolves upon every one who people
can contribute in the slightest degree to thisresult to come forward and makesome effort, reasonable in its character, to preserve the Union of these States by a preservation of the Constitution
In most that I shall say on this occasion, I shall not differ very essentially from my southern friends
The difference will consist, as I think, from what I have heard and what I see published in the various periodicals of the day, in the mode and manner by which this great end is to be a'c„ complished, Some of our southern friends think that secession is the mode by-which these, ends can bé åccomplished; that if the-Union cånnöt be preserved in spirit,- by-sedesåion thßj&ill- get those rights secured and perpétuated that -they have fail}l to obtain within the Unions am opposed to secession
I believe it id
no
-remddy for the evils complained -of
Instead of' acting with that division of my southern friends u;ho.'take ground for secession, éhal-l' take while I try to accomplish:the same end
I think that this battle ought-to be fought not outside, but inside of the Union, and upon, the battlements of the Constitution itself
I am un- willing, of my (mn x•lition, to walk outside ofthe Union which has been the result (if made by the patriots of the Revolution
They formed the Constitution; and this Union that is so much spoken of, and which all ofus are so desirous to preserve, grows out of the Constitution; and, I repeat,' I am not willing _to walk out of the Union growing out of the Constitution, that was formed by the patriots and, may say, the soldiers of the Revolution
So tis I am concerned; and I be• lieve I may speak with soma degree of confidence for the people of my State, we•interid io fight that battle inside and not outside of the Uiiön; and if anybody must go o"ut of the Union , it mustbe those who violate,it
We do not intend to go out
It is our Constitution; it is our, Union, growing out of the Constitution; and we do not intend to be driven from it or out of the Union
Those who have violated the Constitution either in the pas- sage of what are denomiQated personal liberty bills, or by their refusal to execute the fugitive slave law—they having violated the instrument that binds us out and not we
I do not think we can go before the country with the same force of position demanding of the North a compliance with the Constitution and all its guarantees, if we violate the Constitution by going out ourselves, that we shall ifwe stand inside of the Constitution, and demand compliance with its provisions and its guarantees; or need be, as I think it is, to demand additional securities
We should make that demand inside of the Constitu- tion, and in the manner and mode pointed out by the instrument itself
Then we keep ourselves in tho right; we put our adversary in the wrong; and though it may take..a little longer to accom- plish the -end, we take right means to accom- plish an end that'is right in itself
I know that sometimes we tallwbout compro- I am nota compromiser, nor a conserva- mises
tive, in the usual acceptation of those terms
I have been generally considered radical, and I do not come forward to-day in anything that I shall
say or propose, asking anything to be done upon the principle of compromise
If we ask for any- thing, it should be for that which is riÉht and rea- sonable in itself
It being right, those of whom we ask it, upon the great prmciple of right, are bound to grant it
Compromise! I know, in the common acceptance of the term it is to agree upon certain propositions in Which some things ceded on one side and others conceded on the -other
I shall go for enactments by Congress or for amend- meats .to the Constitution, upon the principle that they are right and upon no other ground
I am not for compromisincr right with wrong
If we have no right, we ought not to demand It
If we are in thc wrong, they should not grant us what we ask
approach this momentous subject on the great principles of right, asking nothing and demanding nothing but what is ricrhtin itself and which every righ t-minded man an aright-minded community and a right minded-people, who wish the preservation of this Government, will be dis- posed to grant
In figh tingthis battle, Ishall do it upon the basis laid down by a portion of the people of my own State, in a large and very intelligent meeting
A committee of the most intelligent men in the coun- try reported, in the shape of resolutions, to this meeting the basis upon which I intend to fight this great battle for our rights.' They reported this resolution: Resotved, That we deeply eyrnpathize With ourlsister southern States; and free;y admit that there is good cause for disrxatisfhcLion and complaint
on their-part, on docount of the recent election of sectional candidates to the Presl- dency and Vice Presidency of the United States:; yet we, as a portion of tile people of a slaveholding community, are not for seceding or -breaking Of these States until every fair and honorable means-has been
exhausted in tryiug to obtain, on tbe..part of the non;slaveholding  118 with the spirit and letter of-the Cori- -apd its goaia-nt.ees; and when •.this Shail ; nave done, and thé States now in open rebellion against the Cnited States, in rCfusing•tO execute the' fugi- tiVu shill! persist in- t.heir -present *itieonstitu• tional• course, aid the -Federal Government shall' fail or ret.Use -t.o execute the daws, in good faith, it (the GQvern- npent) not have -t-h@.great design •of, its creåttoo,-and Will theretbte, in fact
bé a epråctical diSsoIti2- tiön-,--and the StateS,aS .released from thé compact wi-i-ich for-med tire:Upion." The people Of T-enriesSeb, irrespective of party, go on and •declåéesftii:ther: 'That; iti tti.e icipinion Of-this meeting no State has the c6nStitåtlonai hlight- -to geeedé from the Union 'Without the off-the -other; States -whieh ratified -the compact
The compaet,
when ratified, 'tormed the Union without makiig any provision whatever for its dissolution
It (the Compact.) was adopted by the States in toto and forecer., qbithoqitq•esenation-br conditioh hence a secession of one orrnore States fro:n the Union, without tbc consent of the others ratifying the compact, would be revolution, Icading in the cild to civil, and perhaps servile war
VVhile we deny the right of a State, constitutionally, to secede froin the Union,' we admit the great and inherent right of revo- lution, abiding and temaining with cvery people, but a rjuht not be exercised, except in extreme cases, aod ia the last resort, when grievances are without redress, and has become intolerable." 'Ilhcy declare further: That-in our opinion, we can more successfully resist "gressjon of Black Republicanism by reinainjng vvithin the Union, than We can by going out of it; and niore espe- claliy so: •While there is a majority of both branches in the Nati(inal' Legislature-oppostd to it, and the Supreme Court tutiOn, Fi'_bey- go on, and declare further: hat we are not willing•.toabandon our northern friends who stood by the Constitution of the United States, and- in standing by" it have vindieated our rights; arid in tlieir vindication have been struck down ; and now, in their extretnity,.wc cannot and will not desert them by seceding, or otherwise breaking up the Union." This is the basis upon which a portion of the people of Tennessee, irrespective of party, pro- pose to fight this battle
We believe that our true position is inside of the Union
We deny the doctrine of secession; we deny that a State has the power, of its own volition, to withdraw from the ConiZ•deracy
W c arc 110t willing to do an to comply •with the Constitution of the United States
We prefer complying •tvith the Constitu- tion and fl&hting our bal.tle, and making our de- mand inside of the Uhion
I know, Mr
Pi•esident, that;therc are some who believe-zand- sce_ some of the States are acting •oh State has the right to seéedc; that, of its own will, it has a right to withdraw from t)'le Confederacy
I am inclined 
and I know it is in fact, that in many portions of the -country this opinion has resulted from tho- resolutions of your own State, sir, [ M r
MA-sox in the of 1798 and 1799
I propose to-day to exa-mine thatsub.ject, for I know from the examination of it that tl'iere has been a false im- upon my own* tnind i'n reference to those resoiutions, and the power proposed to be exercised by a State in ing upon its own will
W heri we ccnne to cxan-)ine those resolutions, we find that the third reads as follows: That this Asselllbly doth (i.xplieit.l.y and pereinptorify declare that it views the powers of'the Federal Goverurnent, as the corn part, to M'bich the States are par- ties, as limited by the plain sense and intention of the in- strument constituting that compau, as no valid than th-éy are ;tnthorized by the grallt.anutuerot.ed in that pact and that: in ease deliberate, palpable, and dan- gerous ex'crci-xe of otbC! powers not
granted by the said cmnpaet> the States who are parties
thereto have the right, ond are
in duty böu:fid, interpose arrestif)C the progress of the evil, and -for maintainin« within their respective limits, the anil liberties appertaining to The.phrascelogy of the Kcrltucky resolutions is somewhat broader and more extensive than that a St.ote, of' its own will, has the right to secede or withdraw
from the Union
The Kentucky reso- luti01] ec.'cs to declare that a State has the right to judge of the infraction of the Constitution, as weål as the mode and measure of redress
This is what is declared by that resolution which is rc•poatod by so many in speeches and publications uiade Ihrotigh the country
Now, let Mr
Madison speak for himself* as to what he meant by that Mr
Madison, in his report upon resovat'ion
resolutions, goes .on and states e.xpressly that in the resolution the 'word States" IS used, nolwithstandir)g the word respective" is used
Mr
Madison says: '•-lt appears to your committee to be a plain princil*d, CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 18, founded- in common •sense; illustrated by common prac- tice, and essential to the nature of compacts, that, where resort can be had to no tribunal superior to the authority ot• parties, the parties themselVes must be the' rigbtt•ul judges, in•the last resört, whether the bargain made has been pur- sued Or violated
The Constitution of the IJnlted States was formed by .tbe sanction of the States, given by each in its sovereign capacity
It adds to the stability and dig- nity, as well as to the authority of the Constitution, that it rests on- this legitimate and solid foundation
The States, then, being the parties to the constitutional -compact, and in their sovereign capacity, it follows of neeessity, 'that there can be no tribunal above their authority, to decide, in the last resort, whether the compact made by them be violated ; and, consequently, that, as the parties to it, they must themselves [that is,the States] decide, in the last re- sort, such questions as may be of sufiicicnt magnitude to require their interposition." The States is the idea that is kept up through the report
He further remarks: But the resolution has done morc than guard against misconstruction, by expressly referring to cases of a defib- crate, palpable, and dangerous nature
It specifies the ob- ject ot the interposition, which it contemplates to be solely that of arresting the progress or the evü of usurpation, and of maintaining the authorities, rights, and liberties apper- taining to the States, as parties to the Constitution." Now we find, by thc examination of this sub- ject, that Mr
Madison, in his report, explains it, and repudiÄtcs the idea that a State, as a member of the compact, has a right to judge of an infrac- tion of the Constitution or any other grievance, and, upon its ox,vn volition, withdraw from the Confederacy
I will' here read a letter of Mr
Madison to Nicholas P
Trist, in explanation of this very proposition: MON+PELIER, December 23, 1832
DEAR SIR : I have received yours or the 19th, inclosing some South Carolina papers
There are in one of them sorne interesting views of the doctrine of secession, atnong which onc that had occurred to me, and which for the first time I have seen in print, namely: that if onc State can at will withdraw frcnn the others, the others can withdraw from her, and turn her, nodcntem Dolentem, out of tl)ä Union
Until late there is not a State that would have ab- horred such a doctrine inorc than South C•arolina, or dreaded an application of it to herself
!lthe saruc may be said of the doctrine ot' nullificatiou,which she now preaches as the only doctrine by which the Union can be saved
I partake of thc M,'onder that the you narne should view secession in the li"tlt ynent.ionod
'I'hc essential diflOr- ence between a free Government and a Government not free is, that the former is tbunded in compact, the parties to which are mutually and equally bound by it
Neither of them, thercforc, can have a greater right to break off frorn the bargain than thc other or others have to hold him to it; and certainly there is nothing in the Virginia reso- lutions of 1798 advene to this principle, whicli is that of common sense and cornmon justice
'I'he fallacy which draws a ditiOrent conclusion from them lies in confounding a single party with the parties to the constitutional compact of the United States
ter, having made the compact, may do what they will with it
'The former, as one of the parties, owes fidelity to it till released by consent or absolved by an intolerable abuse of the power created
In the Vil•ginia resolutions and re- port the plural number (States) is in every instance used whenever reference is Inade to the authority which pre- sided over the Governmeut." I-Ic says the plural is used; that G' States" is the word that is used; arid when we turn to the res- olution we find it just as Mr
Madison states, thereby cxcluding the idea that a State can sep- aratcly and alone detennine, thß question, and have the right to secede from the Union
As [ am now known to have dr.zwn those documents
may say, as do with a distinct recollection, that it was intentional
IL was in tact require(l by the course of rea- sonina on the occasit)l'i
The Kentucky resolu- tions, being less guarded, have been nnre easily perverted
The pret.ext {Or the liberty taken v.'ith those of Virginia is the word 'respective' prefixed to the rights, &c.' to be secured withiu the States
Could the abuse of the expres- Sion have been foreseen or suspected, the forin of•it would doubtless have been varied
But what can be morc con- sistont
Witb connnon sense than that all having the right* &c., should unite in contending for the security of them to It is rein ark able how closely the nullifiers, who make the name
at• Mr Jefferson the pedestal for their colossal heresy, shut their eyes and lips whenever his authority is ever so clearly and emphatically against them
You have noticed what hc says in his letters to Monroe and Carrinø- ton (pp
43 and 203, vol
'2) with rcspect to tile power of the 0111 Congress to coerce delinquent States ; and his reason for preferring the purpose a navai to a military force ; and, moreover, his retnarlc that it wag not necessary to find a ritrht to coerce in the Federal articles, that being inherent in tnc nature ofa compact* *'is high tirne that the claim to secede
at will shou\d be pu down by the public opinion, and I am glad to see tbc task cornrneneed by one who under- stands tbe subject
i know nothing of what is passina at Richmond morc than what*is scen in the newspapers
You were rigtlt in your foresight of the cfFect of passages in t.he late procla- mation
They have proven a leaven for much fermenta- tion there, and created an alarm awainst the danger of con- solidatinn balancin(' that of disunion
"VVit11 cordial salutations, " JAMES MADISON
NICHOLAS P
T Ris•r.-" I have another letter of Mr
Madison, written in 1833, sustainin«r and carrying out the, same interpretation of the resolutions of 1798 and 1799
I desire to -road son-le extracts fh•orn that letter
Mr
Madison says: Much -use has been inade of the terni 'regpcctive' in the third resolution of Virginia
which asserts thc right Of' the States, in case of sufficient to interpose rhaintaining within their respective limits the authorities, &c., appertaining ; the term.' respective' bell)" con- strued to lhean a constitutional right in each State, sepa- rately, to decide on and resist by force encroachrnents within its limits
A foresight or apprehension of the mis- construction *night cagily have guarded against it
But, to say nothing of the distinction between ordinary and extreme cases, it is observal)le that in this, as in other instances throughout tbe resolutions, the plural' nunber (States) is used in referring to them ; that a concürrenee and coöpeea- tion of all might well be contemplated in interposiUons fin• effecting 'be objects within reach ; and that the languarre of the closing resolution corresponds with this view Of the third
'I'he course of reasonincr in the report on the reso- lutions required the distinction between a State and the States
it surely does not follow, from thc fact of the States, or rather the people einbodied in them, having, as parties to thc constitutional cotnpact, no tribunal above them, that in controverted rneanings of the compact, a minority of the parties can rightfully decide against tile majority, still less that a single party can decide against the rest, and as litt}e that it can at will withdraw itself altogether from its com- pact witli tbc rest
The characteristic distinction between free govern- ments and governments not free, is that the
fortner are founded on compact, not between the govermnent and those for vvhom it acts, but among the parties creaf,ing the
gov- ernrnent
Each of these being equal, neither can have more right to say that the compact has bfen violated and dis- solved than every other has to deny the fact, and to insist on the execution of the bargain
An infbrenco the doctrine that, a single State has a right to secede at will from the rest
is that the rest would have an equal right to secede from it; in other words to turn it, against its will, out of its union with them
Such a doctrine would not, till of late, have been palatable anywhere, and nowhere less so Lbau where it is now most contended tör." When these letters are put together they are clear arid conclusive
'Cake the resolutions; take the report; take Mr
Madison's expositions of them in 1832 and 1833; his letter to Mr
Trist; his letter to Mr
Webster; his letter to Mr
Rives; and when all are summed up, this doctrine of a State, either assuming her highest political atti- tude or otherwise, havincr the righi of her own will to dissolve all connection with this Confed- eracy, is an absurdity, and contrary to the plain intent and meaning of the Constitution of the United States
I hold that the Constitution of the United States makes no provision, as said by the President of the United States, for its own de- struction
It makes no provision for breaking up the Governznent, and no State has the consti- tutional right to and withdraw from the Union
In July, 1788, when the Constitution of the United States x.vas before the convention of New York ratification, Mr
Madison was in the city of New York
Mr
Hamilton, who was in the convention, wrote a letter to Mr
MadisD1'1 to Know if New York could be admitted into the Union with certain reservations or conditions
One of those
reservations or conditions was, as Mr
Hamilton says in his leeter, that they should have the privilege of receding within five or seven years if certain alterations and amendments were not made to the Constitution of the United States
Mr
IVIadison, in reply to that letter, makes use of the following emphatic language, which still further corroborates and carries out the idea that the Constitution makes no provision for break- ing up the Government, and that no State has a right to secede
Mr
Madison says: NEW YORK, Sunday eveninry
MY DEAR SIR : Yours of yesterday is this instant come to*hand; and I have but a few minutes to answer it
mn sorry that your situation obliges yon to listen to proposi- tiouso the nature you describe
My opinion is, that a tion of a right to withdraw if arnendment.s be not decided on under the fornr of t.he Constitution within a certain tune, is a conditional ratification ; that it does not make New York a Inember of the new Union
an(l conse- qucntly that she could not be received on that •plan
Cotn- pacts must be reciprocal—this principle would not in such a case be preserved, 'Phe Constitution requires an adop- tion in toto and forever." This is the language of James Madison
It has been so adopted by the other States.
An adnp
lion for-a limited time would be as defective asan adoption of sorne of the articles only
In short, any condition "'hat- ever must vitiate the ratification
Whåt the new Conzt•ess, by virtue of the power to admit ncw States, may he able and disposed to do in such ease, do not igqutre, as r suppose that not the material point at present
havo not a Ino- ment to add more than my fervent wishes for your success and happiness
The idea of reserving a right to withdraw  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE: X,.vas started at Richmond, and considered as a conditional ratification, which was itself abandoned as worse than a rejection
Yours, JAMES MADISON, Jr." I know it is claimed, and I see it stated in some of the newspapers, that Virginia and some ofthe other States made a reservation, upon the ratification of the Constitution , that certain conditions were an- nexed; that they came in upon certain conditions, and therefore,they had a right, in consequence of those conditions, to do this or the other thing
When we examine the journal of the conven- tion,- we find that no mention is made Of any res- ervation on the ratification of the Constitution by the State of Virginia
We find that Mr
Madison says, in his letter to Mr
Hamilton, that this idea was first mooted at Richmond, and was aban- doned as worse than a rejection
His letter was written after the ratification of the Constitution of' the United States by the State of Virginia
Hence he spoke with a knowledge of the fact that existed, that no reservation was made; and even if it had been made by one of the parties, and not sanctioned by •the other parties to the compact, what would it have amounted to
T lien we see that Mr
Madison repudiates the doctrine that a State has the right to secede
We see that his resolutions adrmt of no such construction
We see that Mr
Madison, in his letter to Mr
Ham- ilton, puts the interpretation that this Constitution was adopted in toto and forever, without reserva- tion and without condition
I know that the inquiry may be made, höw is a State, then, to have redress
There is but one way, and that is expressed by the people of Ten- messee
You liave entered into this compact; it was mutual; it was reciprocal; and you of your own volition have no right to withdraw and break the compact, without thc consent of the other parties
What remedy, then, has the State
It has a remedy that remains and abides with every people upon the face of the earth—when griev- ances are without a remedy, or without redress, when oppression becomes intolerable, they have the great inherent right of revolution, and that is all there is of it
Sir, if the doctrine of secession is to be carried out upon the mere whim of a State, this Govern- ment is at an end
am as much opposed to a strong, or what may be called by some a consol- idated Government, as it is possible for a man to be; but while am greatly opposed to that, I want a Government strong enough to preserve its own existence; that will not fall to pieces by its own weiøht or whenever little dissatisfaction takes I
tl'iC States have place in one of its members
the right to secede at will and pleasure, for real or imtwinary evils or oppressions, I repeat again, this Government i_s nt an end; it is not stronger than a rope of sand; its own weight will tumble it to pieces, and it cannot exist
Notwithstandino this doctrine may suit some who are engaged in this perilous and impending crisis that is now 
upon us, duty to my country, dutv to my State, and duty to n'W kind, require Ille to avowa doctrine that I believe will result in the preservation of the Constitution of the United States it expressly I provided that you cannot even put one of the States of this Confederacy before one of the courts I of the country as a party
As a State, the Fed- eral Government has no power to coerce it; but it is a member of the compact to which it agreed in common
with the other States, and this Gov- ernment has the l*ht to pass laws, and to enforce those laws upon individuals within the limits of each State
While the one proposition is clear, the other is equally so
This Government can, by the Constitution of the country and by the laws enacted in conformity with the Constitution, operate upon individuals, and has the right and the power, not to coerce
a State, but to enforce and execute the law upon individuals within the limits of a State
I know that the term, " to coerce a State," is It is a sover- used in an ad captandum manner
eignty that is to be crushed! How is a State in the Union
What is her connection with it
All the connection she has with the other States is that which is agreed upon in the compact between the States
I do not know whether you may con- sider it in the Union or out of the Union, or whether you simply consider it a connection or a disconnection with the other States; but to the extent that a State nullifies or sets aside any law or any provision of the Constitution, to that ex- tent it has dissolved its connection, and no more
I think the States that have passed their personal liberty bills, in violation of the Constitution of the United StateS, coming in conflict with the fugitive slave law, to that extent have dissolved their con- nection, and to that extent it is revolution
But because some of the free States have passed laws violative of Che Constitution; because they have, to some extent, dissolved their connection with this Govern ment, does that justify us of the South in following that bad example
Because they have passed personal liberty bills, and have, to that ex- tent, violated the compact which is reciprocal, shall we turn around, on the other hand, and vio- late the Constitution by coercing them to a com- pliance wit b it
-Will we do so
Then I comc back to the starting point: let us stand in the Union and upon the Constitution; and if anybody is to leave !his Union, or violate its guarantees, it shall be those who have taken the initiative, and passed their personal liberty I am in the Union, and intend to stay in bills
I intend to hold on to the Union, and the it
guarantees under which this Union has grown; and I do not intend to be driven from it, nor out of it, by their unconstitutional enactments
Then, Mr
President, suppose , for instance, that a fugitive is arrested in the State of Vermont to- morrox.v, and under t.he personal liberty bill of that Slate, or the law—I do not remember its precise title now—which prevents, or is intended to pre- vent, the faithful execution of that law, Vermont undertakes to rescue him, and prevent the enforce- ment of the law: what is it
It is nullification; it is resistance to the laws of the United States, made in conformity with the Constitution; it is rebel- lion; and it is the duty of the President of the United States cnforce the law, at ail hazards good deal said

Theylook at in thatfiight; and I
see that the one in Vermont
which is quoted is the act of 1844
I see it is quoted inthe Constitution newspaper as being of the number
When Senators speak about their being in opposition to the fugitive slave law, undoubtedly gen.tlemen mean the tivc slave law of -1850
Now, will gentlemen bea:r in milld -that
that Very act of Vermont was made 
six years before that law was Bassed! 'It- had nothing in _the world to do with it
It should be remembered that in .1842, ip- the case of Prigg cs
The Commonwealth of Pennsyl- vania, the Supreme Court of the- United .Staæg decided that the owner of fugitive slav.é had right to go and recapture him in the same-way that a Aman might recapture any other personal property, subject to having a
suit brought abdut it afterwards
When a mun takes a suit cun be brought afterwards t.Q
try the title
The
Supreme Court decided that -it would be just like that, provided the man, in so taking his slave, did not violate•nny State law
Now, I say it is to be borne in mind that the court recognized two modes of reclaiming fugitive staves
One of them is ac- cording to the fugitive slave law of Congress, and the other is the one I have just spoken of
Now, the laws that are made in my State, so far as I understand them, with regard to the recapture or reclamation of slaves, have nothing whatever to do with proceedings under the.fugicive slave law•, they relatc to this other branch; this
other mode of getting baekzslaves
The- law was passed bc- fore the present fugitivc slave law was There was a fugitive slave law in 1793; but, any man .whc; will read this act of Vermont that'is now quoted read it in the light of what have now suggested to him, Will see that it does not
relate at all to any action under the law of Conuress
It goes upon the basis that every State is bound to protect
its own citizens; its own people that are residents of the State; those who are commorant in the State, let their color be whntit, may

Then, Wlien it WELB said that a man had a right to go and take hie slave in a free State by mere rhanucaptiøn, with- out resorting to any legal process whatever, can* not any man have candor enough to see that it was utterly impossible to protect our colored peo- ple against those persons who are kidnapperst Hence it was that we did what in effect the Su- preme Court of the United States.invited sh6uld be done; that is,_make such laws as would secure our people in their rights against the-assertion of the rights of those who go to take uppntheirvown strength

have never examined theseh'eeeht Statutes fully
is very likely that t'hcée•rntij; be features.in them that are e*eeption- dble
But/ Mr
President, it is to be borne in mind
that the people of the free States have never held the doctrine that Staté can nullify a United States law
I can easily see why people in the extreme South, who hold that a State can nullify a United States law, think that here is an attempt to nullify a law of Congress
Our people never have held such a doctrine in the world
The profession have paid very little attention to these statutes at any rate
We look upon them just in this light: that if there are any of them which arc ih any way inconsistent with the provisions of the United States Constitution, they are simply waste paper and void.- We deny that a State, by passing an •unconstitutional law, can take itself •out of the Union;• and we deriy, too, that if one State:passes such a law, it can justify another State lh going out of the•UniOn
Such laws are simply void under the Constitution
That is Our view of it, and therefore they are treated before oUr-courts, whunever they come before them, as they would be treated anywhere else—we judge of' their constitutionality with perfect fideliiy
Now, Mr
President, one word in relation to the recent proposition for their repeal which I have seen mentioned
A gentleman in the State Legislature presented a bill -for the repeal of these personal liberty bills, so far as they were incon- sistent with the United States Constitution, or somethincr to that effect
It was referred to a com- mittee, oFwhich he was made chairman—a spe- Cial committee
They made a report
It lay upon the table, and was not called up
When they had had their usual session, and came to the' last day but ohe of the sitting, having already fixed a adjourn, he called up his bill
What was the result
I ought here to state, further, that it is the practiceof the Staterof Vermont, abogt once ih twenty years,' to have a careful revision of her statutes
The time had Come to have it; twenty years had .passed since the last revision
In the course of-the session, the Legislature had raised a commission of i•eviéion, and had appointed upon it thi•ee gentlemen, ae •good we can fur- rush, and I'dO' not know that it would be much arröganee to gay, as good as any State could fur- nigh
Two of them were judges o," the supreme court, the other a very distmguished lawyer, for- merly a rnember of Congress—men holding no places, wanting none—men of high position and ability
These gentlemen were appointed to re- vise our statutes
On the last day of the session, when the bill to repeal thc personal liberty laws was called up, the gentleman who had presented it made a- Ion-g argument upon it, but
there was no time to consider it
They wanted all their statutes revised and considered
A motion was made•in the House dismiss the bill, and it was dismissed
The Senate immediately, on the same day, took up and passed a resoh.ltion referring all of these statutes that were said to be exception- able by people abroåd, to that board of revision, to report to the next session of the Legislature if any of those laws were ilHtny way inconsistent with the United States Constitution, or the Uni- ted States laws passed according to the Constitu- tion
It was passed, all saying we desire no unconstitutional Statutes on Our båoks; we will endure none; we shall have them examined by a competent body, and have just raised one." The Senate passed the proposition unanimously; they sent it to the House in the shape of a joint resolution; it was therepassed unanimously, and the subject was i•eferred to the board of revision
In all candor, is not' this dealing with the subject fairly and candidly, and on our own motion
It is no foundation for ground of Objection abroad that the State of Vermont is dealing unkindly or unfairly or uncandidly
Mr.-JOHNSON,0fTennessee
Mr
President, •I think 1 arm rather unfortunate to-day
In the fii•st instance I gave way foi• an hour, and in the next place for quite a lengthy speech to be injected into mine
However, as the Senator has made an explanatian on the subject, I wish to ask him if he believes the law passed in 1858 by the State Of Vermont in reference to persons of cok)r in that State is constitutional or unconstitutional
Mr
COLLAMER
The gentleman puts to me a question, and he is entitled to have that Sort' of candid ahswer which I take it the putting of the question implies
I said when I was up before that i had never examined those laws much my- self
I nevei• have
I do not know precisely what their condition is, nor what their provisions may be exactly
I have this, however, to say about it: it may be, after all, that though upon its face some of its provisions may look exceptionable, they may not really be so
It comes to this: I believe ihat statute declares, in effect, that all per- sons held to slavery who come into Vermont, voluntarily or involuntarily, who come there of their own accord, or are brought there by their masters, shall be considered and regarded as free I rather think that is the amount of it, persons
according to my recollection
Now, what is the reason for that
1 have already suggested that the Supreme Court have intimated, as our people understand the Chief Justice, thatcolored persons have no rights that the white man is bound to respect at a-II
Mr
BENJAMIN
Will the Senator from ver- mont permit me to Mr
COLLAMER
1 have heard the gentle- man 's explanation of that several .times
Mr
BENJAMIN
Will the Senator tell us that any man in New England honcstly believes the Supreme Court did decide that
Does he know any man who believes it
Mr
CÖLLAMER
1 can say that 1 believe the body of them honestly say they read it so
It reads just so
Mr
BENJAMIN
Does the Senator say that that decision reads so
Mr
COLLAMER
The opinion
The gen- tleman and myself, as lawyers, understand the difference between nn opinion and a decision
The opinion of the Chief Justice, in reciting the history of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution, and thc condition of society at the time wheri those instruments were formed, comes to the result that that notion was enter- tained at that period, stating it in about those words which I have before repeated ; and he leaves it
to be understood that nothing has transpired Nince to Change that condition of things
That ig thc way it IS in the opinion of the court; that is the way we read it; that is the way I understand it..myself
Mr
BENJAMIN
Does t.he Senator say that he understands the Supreme Court to say in the opinion, that now, at this day, colored men have no rights that white rnen are bound to respect 
Mr
COLLAMER
The gentleman gives his I Choose my own ver- version to my statement
Sion for my own statement
I understand the Chief Justice to say, as I have afready stated, that in the history of these transactions, •speak- ing of the period of time and the condition of society at the period of the adoption of the Con- stitution, that then— Mr
DOOLITTLE.
Here is the decision, which I will hand to my friend
Mr
BENJAMIN
Read the whole baragraph
Mr
COLLAMER
Speakingof the condition of the colorcd race at the of the Declara- tion of Independence and of the formation of the Constitution, the Chief Justice,- in his opinion, says: They had for more than a century before becn regarded as beings -ot• an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associ- ate with the white race, either in social or polit.ical rela- tions ; and so far inferior, that they had no rights which the White man was bound to respect; and that the nearo miaht justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit." These are the words, and this is all there is to qualify that clause
He does not say anywhere in the opinion that the status of the black man has been Changed since
He says nothing of thc kind
Now, I say thall believe the body of the people of Vermont read that, and, understanding the English language, understand it to mean just what it says
However, that diverts me from the question put by the Senator from Tennessee
I have answered I the Senator from Louisiana, and I have read the paragraph
Now, Mr
President, to go on with the ques- tion of the Senator from Tennessee, the State of Vermont, in legislating in reference to the action of her own tribunals, havin• nothing to do with the United States law in regard to fugitive slaves, but simply in relation to the conduct and direc- tions to her own tribunals in regard to this busi- ness of reclaiming slaves by the aci of the master himself, has said—her language 10 her tribunals is—you are to presume every colored man as free until the contrary appears
In the South, we understand, they presume every colored man to be a slave until the contrary is shown
Now, we say to you in our law that you shall regard every colorcd man frec, we care not how he gets here, until the contrary is shown
I say to you, Mr
President, that do not believe the people of the State of Vermont, or their Legislature, ever thought of infringine the United States Constitu- tion
They did noi suppose they had done it; they never tried to do it; they never intended to do It; and what precise version they would give to their words as merely a Jaw for their own courts, I am not prepared to say; but I do say that that law, like every other law in Vermont, whenever a question arises, will receive a fair con- struction
When gentlemen say that our laws have aided in the escape of fugitive slaves, I deny it
I do not believe there has been a fugitive slave in Vermont for these forty years
I never heard of one
Ido not believe there has been one there
I know that one fellow claimed to be a runaway slave; but he was an impostor, and was not runaway slave, and did not even from extrem- ists get public sympathy for that, only for short time
Nor has our law aided in any way to aflL•ct or impair the fugitive slave law of Congress
But, Mr
President, whether it has or has nor, if our law is in any way inconsistent with the provisions of thc United States Constitution, or the constitu- tional laws of Congress, tell you it will be set aside, whenever a question arises before a court of Vermont, as quickly as it would before a court of the United States
So, too, if there is anything in it which is at all inconsistent with the Consti- tution, or the constitutional laws of Congress, I tell vou that our board •of revision will see that it is not kept on the statute-book—no doubt of it

If that is agreeable to the wishes of the gentleman from Tennessee, •of course we shall make no objection

I am willing to go on now if the Senate desires me to continue; but there have been a good many interruptions • it is late in the day; and, if such be the pleasure of the Senate, I prefer resuming my remarks•in the morning

RESOLUTIONS
The people oÉthe city of Philadelphia, having assem- bled in cheerful obedience to the proclamation of the Mayor, issued by request of their Councils, for the purpose of testi- fying their love, for the Union, and their devotion to its per- petuation, and to the strengthening of those bonds which hold us together, whether -of the North or the South, the East or the West, as one great and united people, do Resolve, l
With one voice and united hearts, we pro- claim our attachment to, and* reverence for
the Constitu- tion of the United States, and dur earnest- and enduring love for that great Union which it creates and love which is not sectional, but national, and that greets our brother, from whatever State he
comes, as a partaker with us in that uoblest of all inheritances, the title of a citizen of the United.States
Resobed, 2
That the usefulness-and the endurance of the Union both depend upon afaitliful-observance by the people of an the States of all the requirements of that sacred instrument which-the wisdom and the- patriotism of our fathers framed, and under whose provisions we håve be- come a great and happy people, prosperous ahd renowned among the nations •earth
" ResoVved-, 3
That we -do therefore most deeply deplore the fhct, that some Of the States of' this Union have- placed upon their statute-books enaCtments which evade defeat provisions which the framers of the Constitution wisely inserted for the protection of valuable rights of citizens of other States; and that we pronounce all such acts to be violations of the solemn compact by- which we are made one people, and that we earnestly appeal to our brethren of thosc States instantly to repeal all such enactments
Resolved, 4
That the people of Philadelphia hereby pledge themselves to their brethren of the other States, searched by their rcpresentatives at the approaching session of the Legislature, and that every statute, if any such there be, which in the least degree invades the constitutional rights of citizens ofa sisteFState, will be at once repealed ; and that Pennsylvania, ever loyal to the Union, and liberal in construing her obligations to it, will be faithful alWays in her obedience to its requirements
Rcsotvéd, 5
That we recognize the obligations of the act of Congress of 1850, commonly known as the fugitive slave • law, and submit cheerfUIIy to -its faithful enforee- ment ; and that we point with pride and satisfaction to the recent
conviction and punishment, ih this city of' Philadel- phia, of those who had broken its provisions by aiding in t.he attempted rescue of a slave, as proof that Philadé}phia is faithful in her obedience to the law ; and further-more, that we recommend to the Legislature of our own State ihe passage of a lavv whicb shall give compensation iT ease-of the rescue of a captured slave, by theeounty in---whicb such case of destruction of property by tire' violence of mobs

The petition, which was read', is as follows: To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled : The petition of William Wheeler Hubbell, of Philadelw phia, attorney-at-law, and a citizen o
the State of Penn- sylvania, respectfully represents : "That your petitioner is intercsted as owner ot• •African slave enocts or personal property," and also real property," in the State of' South Carolina, as well as proberty in Pennsylvania, and i* otherwise interested in the state of the Union
And -your petitioner respectfully suggests and conwlains of grievances for which hc seeks redress.",
And 110 respect- hilly prays that the suggestions contained hercil'lat•ter fbr tbc pcuee and stability Of the Union, gnu the protection of cik)Cts or property, be carried into execution
Your petitiOnér_ rnaiutains that African slaves were per- sonat estate ot property*' or rights, bought and sold as e eces property, or money or value, the e.ttizensof bot tic northern an *southern States, the Constitution
of Che United States was formed and amended ; and [bat the Constitution, as to guéh " effects," in com- mon witli all other effects or personal cstate, declares, in ai•tiele-10ur of the tunendments, that right of the people sh_qll be secure against unreasonable seizure, and slau not be violated
And:in Artiéle five, nor be depri•ycd of property-without due process -of law
That the word effects," in the Constitution, means per- sonat cst,cdc; and thc word property" means both pcrsonaZ a_nd •real property; and that African slaves, at the titne, and :are now, personal estate or personal property
Thut Lhe Constitution rnakcs no distinction whatever as to ('flirts or property
It includes and secures all rights, or elli..•cts
or.property, both personal and real
And that the Constitution, by such clauses, guaranties protection in the enjoyinent or posscssiou of' tbc right" or estate in Afri- can skives, as
WQII as in any other effects" år personal estate, property" or rights whatsoever, that it shall not be eiolgted
All Lho cjtizcns have equal rights thereunder
T.h'at your petitioner's rights in slave effects or property are invadUd by the northern States, by the election of officers on issues •involving the exclusion -of such or prop- erty i'renn the
Territories 01 the people of the United States 
as a iaw{'uJ right; whereas such is an unlawful issue for tho elective franchise of the people under their Constitu- tian of the United& States; and wnercaa your petitioner has_a eonstitutiona! right', at ail times, to take and hold all of his effects or property, slave and all other, within the Territories of the people of the United States, protected from violence by the Federal Govermnent
And your petiti(jner further cornp)aing that laws or regu- lations have been luade• by several of tbc States—called personal liberty laws—which are intended to obstruct the execution ot' the fugitive slave law, and the provisions of tbe Constitution as to the renditioi) of fugitives from labor, both Slave and for a term Df years, and to interfere witli the rigbts of' property therein ; and* that such enaetnjents or regulations are in violation of the Federa; Constit.ution
That
Congress has not made provision tor declaring such State acts void by the :nosf speedy process in equity before the Supre.rne Court of the United States, as empowered by t'e Constitution
A nd your petitioner further maintains, that no State ofthe Union has any lawful right at present to pass any ordinance of pea coabie secession "from, or dissolution of the Onion under the Constitution ofthe United States as it now stands; that aithough under jt Congress has express power to eon- sent to the admission of a State, no power is g:anted by it to Congress to consent to the secession of any State ; -that a State; or the people thoreof, uot having been admitted solel! by thei! ,own -eonsépt into the Union, but also, bythe consent of all! the other people or States, cannot secede SOR•ly by their own, ; the power peaceably to destroy must be as great as the power peaceably to create- the Union ; tbåt 'the Constitution of the United States is made by the •people of •the, United States, and not 'by the, States in their capacity as Statcg; that it is a Federal Government of the whole people.of the United States, and not Gov- ernment of the States; that therc is no provision dis- solving -the Union' expressed in •the Constitution ; that a confederation of_ States apart frorn the Constitution is expressly prohibited ; that there is no provision of any kind ft)f the peaceable Sécession of any State, or of the people of any State, either expressed or implied in the Constitution ; that the Union under it is a pcrpetual Union of the peo- i)tC, -with a rescrvcd power of' amendment of the Constitu- tion; and that unless the Constitution be first amended, so as to expressly provide ft)t' and declare a manner of disso- lutiOn or secession of tlic people of the cori(cdcratcd States, it remains absolutely indissoluble and perpetual, and all the Statcs ahd people are cqually bound thereby, except that it bc overturned and destroyed by actual revolution and civil war, and superseded thereaftcr by another Government
Your petitioner maintains that ocert acts of aggression, or withholding of protcction from violence against ille slave property ,ot• the people, or any portion thcreof, or the pro- hibition thereof by the United StateS Governnient, either in the "l'erritories of the United States, or in the States which recognize and regulate slavery by statute law, would be just ground revolution and resistance ; for the rea- son, that the Federal power wili have ceased to be a Gov- ermnent under the Constitution of the United States, and become an unlawful, usurping power
It is the rapid ap- proach to this condition of national affairs which has justly aggrieved the South, and people owning slave property, or personal estate in slaves, or " effects." Your petitioner greatky deprecates the present proepect of war between the people ot the United States, through their State governments
and the Federal Goverrnnent
Your rights of property are deeply and im- mediately interested therein
He has rights of property in Charleston and vicinity, South Carolina; rights of prop- crty in Pennsylvania ; and rights of property in the posses- Sion of the United States Government; all of which arc greatly jeopardized by the existing condition of our internal national afihirs
Your petitioner is the inventor and patentee of the ex- plosive shell
with which all the shell guns of the Navy of the United States are now provided, to the number of over fifty thousand
It is the Inost destructive war projectile of modern times for naval use, and was employed to de- molish the Bogus Forts, where it exhibited its superior powers
Your petitioner has letters patent of thc United States thereon ; and under an express contract, Dlaced the United States in posseysion of the said projectilö; but the United States has not paid for the sarne according to contract
Your pctitioncr did thus invent aud intrust the Govern- rnent
with said war projeetile, with no other intent than that it should bc used exclusively in the defense of thc poopie, and property of the people, or the United States ; and would greatly deplore its use- against any citizen* of the United States, or their property, particularly against the property of his family in South Carolina, which he is bound to protect by dOrce necessary
Your petitioner, therefore, prays the prompt action of Congress on the basis he herein snagcsts ibr the peaceable deternUnation of present difficulties
First
For the rcéstablishntent at present by act of Con- gress of the Missouri compromise line extended to the Pa- cilic ocean
Second

Mr
FLORENCE
Why, sir, the gentiernan rose after the reading of the resolutious menced , and how could the objection then made when the unanimous consent of the House bad been expressly given fin• the recent of the resolutions
I would not have presented t ho reso- lutions if there had been word of objection
Mr
BURNETT
I would to the o•cn- tleman from Ohio that he objncted to tions after I had suggested that the readil)g• should be dispel')sed with; and the gentlernan .Peii11- sylvania had, prior to that tilne, asked the consent of the House to introduce the rt•solutions, and no objection was made at the time

SLAVERY
The SPEAKER stated the regular order of business to be the consideration of the resolution offered yesterday by Mr
CRAWFORD, and which is as fo}iows: Resoåued„ That the Constitution of the United States recoænizes property in slaves; that Congress has passed laws to aid slaveholders in recapturing thVeir slaves when- ever they cseape and 'nake their way into the free States ; that the Supretnc•
Courtot' the United States have decided that ne•vroes were not Included, cither in the Declaration of Independence or in the of the United States, except as slaves„ and that
they cannot become citizens ; and we, the n)embcrs of this House, hereby sttstain and •vvili support this construction of
the Constitutiön, these laws, and said decision of the Supreme Court
Mr

I desire to offer an amendment to that resolution
Mr

I object to any amendment
Has not the previous question been sustained

Mr

Some friend has for- warded to me the Illinois Journal of the 13th in- , in tbc city of Springfield, where the President
elect resides, and where also re- side, The Journal is nominally edited by a G warfed, perverted, ambiguous specimen of hu- manity by the name of Baker, a nephew of the President elect
Mr
LOVEJOY
Irise to a point of order
This is not a privileged question
Mr
McCLERNAND
The gentleman has not heard w l'iat i have to say
Mr
LOVEJOY
I make that point of order, Mr
Speaker
rose to a privileged question
The Chair stated that he would hear the gentleman fromelllinois upon his privileged -question, and for that purpose he had the order of the Chair and the consent of the House to proceed
When the gentleman com- menced his remarks, the Chair found that itA,vas not a privileged question within the decisions of: the Chair and the I-louse, and, objection being nmde, the
Chair cannot consent that tho gentle- man shall go on
Mr
McCLERNAND
Will the Chair let me make a suggestion 
The SPEAKER
The Chair would be very happy to hear the gentleman, but cannot undcr the rules of thc House
Mr
McCLERNAND
suggest whether the Chairis not in error upon a point of fact, that, although I stated that I rose to a privileged ques- tion, I Said afterwards that my object was to make a personal explanation, and in that connection asked the indulgence of the House that'l might I do so, and was permitted, by the silence of the House, to proceed for a time
The SPEAKER
The Chair thinks the gen- tleman cannot bc heard under tho decision that the House has made
SLAVERY—AGAIN
Mr
ADRAIN
1 •now ask to have read the amendment which offer to the resolution of the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr
CRAWFORD.] Mr
BURNETT
I wish to call the attention of the Speaker to the report in the Globe, which shows
that I was right in my statement that the previous question was called, by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr
SHERMAN] and seconded, the main question ordered, and the yeas and nays ordered on the adoption of the rosojütion
The SPEAKER
The opinion of the clerks is that that statement is correct; but
the fact of the previous question having been seconded, and the main question ordered, was inadvertently omitted from the Journal
The Chair was guided by the Journal; but of course, whatever the fact is must prevail
The previous was sec- onded; and therefore no amendmeilt to the res- olution is iii order
Mr
ADRA[N
Then 1 move to the vote by xvhich the main question was ordered

For that purpose, I •move to lay the whole su12iect on the

Mr
CRAWFORD
1 desire to say, in reply to what has fallen from the gentleman from Ohio, that I am very anxious, indeed , that we shall have a fair and square vote on the questions•involved in my resolution; and I want that to be done at Rut the motion made by the gentleman .once
from Ohio is not in order after the motion sub- mitted by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
Bo- COCK] to lay on the table the motion to reconsider the vote by which the main question was ordered
I would myself, ifpe!mitted by the House, offer an amendment tormy resolution, Which does noth- ing rnore nor less than make it conform more nearly, as 1 understand it, to the decision of t.he Supreme Court
To this the gentlemen on the other side would [lot, I apprehend, object

I wish all the members of the Houseto be present, and to record their votes on this proposition
The vote was announced as above recorded
Mr
SHERMAN
For the purpose of giving all an opportunity ofa direct vote upon this ques- tion, I svill move to reconsider the vote just taken, by which the House refused to lay the resolution Oh the table
That will give us all an oppor- tunity
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
If it be in order, I will mover that there tbc a call of the House
The SPEAKER
It would not be in order to move a Call Of the House, the main question having- been Mr
CRAWFORD
1 desire now, in order to accomplish the same object stated by the gentle- man from Ohio, that we may have a direct vote upon the issue which we on this side desire to present, to state modification which I propose to the resolution as submitted yesterday
I ask that it be read; and then gentlemen can determine whether they object to it
Several MEMBERS objected
Mr
STEVENSON, lay the motion to reconsider on the table, and upon that motion call the eas and nays
Mr
JURRY
1 desire to ask this question of the Chair: I wish to know whether it is in order to make the motion to reconsider twice
We have' just voted down a motion to lay the motion to reconsider on the table
The SPEAKER
The motion iust voted on was to lay the resolution on the table
Mr
BARKSDALE
-1 desire to inquire of the the motion to reconsider on the table, if carried by the House
What would be the next ques- tion before the House 
The SPEAKER
The question would then recur on the motion of the gentleman from Ken- tucky [Mr
STEVENSON] to lay on the table the motion to reconsider the vote by which the main question was ordered to be put
Mr
BARKSDALE
And if the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, the question will then come' up directly on the resolution
The SPEAKER
It will, unless another mo- tion to lay on the table be made
Mr
MORRIS, of Illinois
I hope v.ze shall be permitted to take a direct vote upon this question
Mr
SHERMAN
If 1 withdraw my motion to lay on the table, can we have one square vote upon the resolution 
Several MEMBERS
Yes
Mr
ADRAIN
The gentleman from Ohio can- not withdraw my motion
I moved to reconsider the vote by which the main question was ordered, and do not withdraw that motion
Mr
KUNKEL
I understand the previous question •has been called, and the main question ordered, on the resolution of the gentleman from Georgia
Am I correct 
The SPEAKER
The gentleman states cor-
rec.tly
Mr
KUNKEL
Then, sir, 1 make this point of order: that it is not now in order to move to reconsider the vote of the House refusing to lay upon the table the main proposition, or to vote upon any other proposition except upon the motion of the gentleman from Newy Jersey, or a motion to adjourn
The privileged ques- tions are specified in their order m the rules, and one of them is the motion to lay on the table
The vote has been taken on that motion, and I submit that it is not in order to move to' reconsider the vote by which the House refused to lay the res- olution on, the table, while the main question is still operating
'Tl')at is my question of order; and I ask that, before the Chair decides it, he will have the rule read which states what
privileged questions have priority
The SPEAKER
The Chair overrules the question of order, and decides that the motion of the gentleman from Ohio is in order
Mr
KUNKEL
ask the Clerk to read the rule stating the privileged motions which it is competent to make after the main question has been ordered
The SPEAKER
The Chair knows of no spe- Cial rule governing this case
If the gentleman will refer to the rule, it will be read
The Clerk cannot find such a rule
IVIu•
STEVENSON
If 1 withdraw my motion to lay on the table, will the question then arise directly upon the motion of the gentleman from Ohio
The SPEAKER
It will
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 understand that if the motion to lay on the table be withdrawn, the motion to reconsider, made by the gentleman from New Jersey, will then be withdrawn, and we may have a vote directly upon the resolution
Mr
SHERMAN
With the understanding that we may have one direct square vote upon the resolution, without division of the question, I am willing to withdraw the motion to lay on the table
Mr
A DRAIN
I desire that my amendment shall be acted on by the House; and to enable me to offer it, I moved to reconsider the vote by which the main question was ordered; and cannot withdraw that motion unless the gentleman from Georgia is willing to accept my amendment as a part of his resolution
Mr
UNDERWOOD
1 will not consent to any modification
of the resolution, unless it be done in order
Mr
KUNKEL
1 now ask that the Clerk may read, upon the point
of order which I a moment ago raised, from page 127 of the compilation made up by the Journal clerk of the House
The Clerk read, as follows: When a question is under debate, no motion shali be received but to adjourn, to lie on the table, för the previous question, to postpone to a dw certain, to commit or amend, to postpone indefinitely ; which several motions shall have precedence in the order in which they are arranged." Mr
KUNKEL
1 am aware that the motion to reconsider may be made after the main question Chair, what will be the effect of the motion to lay II hag becn ordered; but i submit that the motion I to lay on the table having been décided by the House in the negative, it is not in order to bring it again before the House on a motion to recon- sider; otherwise, we cou\d never be able to dis- pose of the preliminary motions, and come to a direct vote upon the main question
The SPEAKER
The Clerk will read the 49th The Clerk read, as follows: When a motion has been once made, and carried in the affrmative or negative, it shall be in order for any member of the majority to move for ibe reconsideration thereof on the same or succeeding day'; and such motion shall take precedence of all other questions, except a Inotion to ad- journ, and shall not be withdrawn after the said succeeding day Without the consent of the House ; and thereafter any member may call it up tör éönsideration." Mr
KUNKEL
In connection with that, 1 ask the Clerk to read down to the bottom of the page from the Manual
Mr
BINGHAM
1 object
The .Chair has decided the point of order, and there is nothing before the House upon which this reading can proceed
The SPEAKER
The Chair has decided the question of order
He, however, was willing to hear the rule read
The Chair is perfectly satis- fied that it is competent for the gentleman from Ohio to make the motion to reconsider
Does he insist upon his motion Mr SHERMAN
1 do
The SPEAKER
Does the gentleman from Kentucky insist upon his motion to lay the mo- tion to reconsider on tlO table
Mr
STEVENSON
do
The SPEAKER
Then the question is upon the motion of the gentleman from Kentucky
Mr
HINDMAN
Before a vote is taken upon the proposition pending, I would be glad to ac- cept of the proposition of the gentleman from Ohio, to e one direct, square vote upon thc matters in bntroversy between the different sec- tions which we respectively represent
But ac- cording to my understandine, the proposition as now presented does not, with as perfect accuracy as it might, make its statcments of facts; and in order that these statements may be made perfectly plain and palpable, that there may be no dodging, I ask that a substitute which I have before me may be read, and that the gentleman from Geor- Bia may be permitted to substitute it for his own, If he shall so wish
Mr
BINGHAM
1 object
Mr
HINDMAN
Then it is evident that gen- tlemen do not desire a fair and square vote upon this matter
Mr
GILMER
I have desired all the nn•ning to have an amendment which wish to propose to the resolution of the gentleman from Georgia read
Now, unless that can be done, must respectfully object to any other proposition being read
Mr
A DRAIN
I object to the reception of any amendment until my own is received, for it was the first one offered
The SPEAKER
Objection being made, the amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina cannot be entertained

REVENUE LAWS
The SPEAKER
The business first in order is the consideration of the special order for this day, which is House bill No
21, for the simplifi- cation and codification of the existing revenue laws of the United States, and for other purposes
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
That bill Was made the special order for this day
It is not proper, nor has it been understood by the friends of the bill, that' it should be -taken up and acted upon to-day
It ought at all events be acted upon at this session of Congress
As it has been suggested there is urgent business which ought to be passed upon to-day, I move that the further considera- tion of this special order be postponed until the third Tuesday of January next
The question was taken; and the motion was agreed to
PACIFIC RAILROAD BILL, Mr
CURTIS
1 now call up for consideration House bill No
835, to secure contracts and make provision for the safe, certain, and more speedy transportation, by railroad, of mails, troops, mu- nitions of war, military and naval stores, between the Atlantic States and those of the Pacific, and for other purposes, which was postponed to this dav
Mr
BRANCH
Mr
Speaker, it is perhaps necessary for me to state at this time that I ob- I object to ject to the consideration of that bill
it upon the ground that it must have its first con- sideration in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
I made this point of order at the time this special order was last under consid- eration
While I have no disposition to inter- fere with anv remarks which the gentleman from Iowa [Mr
CURTIS] may desirc to submit, still I presume that it is necessary for me to make and to insist on my point of order at- this time—that this bill, making an appropriation, must have its first consideration in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The SPEAKER
The Chair has distinct recollection that the point of order now stated was raised by the gentleman from North Carolina when this Pacific railroad bill was last under con- sideratfon
When it was about to be postponed, the Chair stated that when the bill again came up the point of order would be acted upon
The point of order, therefore, will now be considered and acted upon
Mr
BRANCH
1 will present the grounds upon which I base my point of order
Mr
CURTIS
I think that this matter was fully argued at the last session, and that the gen- eral opinion was thata bill like this might, under the amended rules of the House, be considered and acted upon without a reference to the Com- mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
I am, however, willing to submit the question to If it be decided that the decision of ethe Chair
the bill must go to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, I shall move that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, in order that we 1 hope may take it up and consider it at once
it may be considered and acted upon in the House
The SPEAKER
The point of order will now be considered and decided
Mr
BRANCH
The gentleman from Iowa is mistaken in supposing that this question was dis- cussed at the last session
i made the point of order when the bill was reported from the special committee; but on the postponement of the bill to this day, the point of order went over with it
This, Sir, is the first time that the point of order could properly be discussed and decided
The grounds upon which I make the point of order are these: the fourth section of the bill provides for the issuing of bonds of the United States in certain contingencies and in prescribed amounts
The 110th rule of the House requires that— No znotion or proposition for a tax or charge upon the people shall be discussed the day upon which it is made or offered ; and every such proposition shall receive its first discussion in a Committee of the Whole House." And rule 112 requires, further, that— All proceedings touching appropriations of money shall be first discussed in a Committee of the Whole House
As I have, already stated' 'the bill provides for issuing bondsof the United States on certain con• tingencies therein described:
The : act of Con- gress of 1853, tenth chapter of 'the Statutes
at Large, page 212, provides as follows: "sand be it further enacted, That the Secretary of.' the Treasury be, and he is héreby, authori±ed to purchase* at the current market price, any of the outstanding -stocks;of- tbé United States, as he may think most advisable, from "any surplus funds in the' Treasury : Provided, That the bältinéb in the Treasury shall not at any time be reduced below Under that section of the act of, 1853, the Sec• retary of the Treasury can purchase, or in other words, apply the- surplus-in the Treasury to- the redemption of the bonds provided for in this bill without any further appropriation by Congress
I therefore'hold that this bill does make an appro- priation of mongy, Such asis contemplated by the rules, and such as requires that it shall have its first consideration in the Committee;of the Whole on the state of the Union
- This same point was made during the last Congress,- on the -bill pro- viding for the payment of the claims for Flinch It was then fully argued.: It was spotiations
discussed by the möst skillful and experienced parliamentarians of the House
Mr
Speaker Orr, having taken full time for reflection, decided that the bill must go to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union; and to that committee it went
There was an appeal taken from the de- cision of the Chair, and the House at that time sustained the decision made by Speaker Orr by a vote of 128 to 59
I take it, then, that the point has been fully settled by the House itself
sustained by an overwhelming vote of the House itself
I might as well rest the case on this decision of the House, and On the plain language and intent of thc rule itself; but, Mr
Speaker, I think the gentleman from Iowa [Mr
CURTIS J will agree with me that a bill of the magnitude of this; a bill that, in all probability, involves a larger pecuniary interest, and more important material interests of this country, than any single bill that ever came before Congress, ought not to be passed under the operation of the previous question, withotit giving those gentlemen who are familiar with the subject- matter of it, and who desire to offer amendments and discuss it, an opportunity to do so
I think the very reason of It ought of itself to carry the bill to the Committee of the Whole
I should en- tertain strong hopes, even if the rules of the House did not require it, that a majority of the House would not take up, and undertake to consider and pass, a bill of the magnitude•of this, witho•ut re- ferring it to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, where an_opportunity will be given for amending and discussing it
I rest the case on that rule of the House, and the ruling of tho Speaker of the last House, sustained by the House itself; and therefore I insist that the bill shall be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
SICKLES
Is this question debatable
The SPEAKER
It is.„ Mr
SICKLES
I suppose that the question whether the bill ought, from its importance, to be considered in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union is wholly distinct from the point of order
There are many reasons adduced why this bill should properly be considered in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, but those reasons ought to be rendered upon a motion to refer the bill to that committee
The point of order is • technical one, strictly, and I do not concur with the gentleman from North Carolina in the view he takes upon that point
There are, I think, many precedents which may be referred to, where bills which have authorized contracts to be entered into have not been consid- ered in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
If I •remember rightly, a bill which was considered at the last session of Congress, authorizing a telegraph line to the Pacific to be con- tracted for, was not considered in the Committee of the Whole
That is my impression
At all events, the rule does not require that latitude of construction
An appropriation bill, we all -know, must be considered in the Committee of the Whole
This is not, in any fair sense of the- Word', - an appropriation bill
The point, I repeat, is a technical one, and must be
•decided by the rule
Whether or not the bill, from its importance,  126 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 18, be referred to the Committee of;the Whole, -will come up when the notion is made
That is a question for the House to consider
The other is for the 'Speaker to decide as p
technical propo- szlion
Mr
BRANCH
Ifthe Speaker is in any doubt upon: the point, I -will -ask -that- the : decision of Speaker Orr upon the French spoliation bill be read
The SPEAKER
.The chair would like to hear it read
Mr
SICKLES
myself, bc- fore Speaker Orr; upon the French spoliation bill
The decision was made upon that point of order
That was a bill IYjaking an appropriation tp pay a debt-—a wholly distinct proposition from this bill
- This bill authorizcs a contract
Mr
BRANCH
T.he gentleman from New 'fie point of order York has mistaken the case
in the case to which I referred luvas made by Mr
Letcher, of Virginia, and was fully discussed in the House for several hours before it was decided
-I ask that the decision beread
'llhe decision of Speaker Orr was read, as fol- lows: " The SPEAKER
The Chair•will decide the question of order
The Chair imagines there is a very oreat difference, according to his recollection,
between the bill now pend, ina, atld Ibe one to h.vhich the genticnmn from Georgia [MY
-St.ephcns] has reftrred
There was, certainly, no portion of- the' tax or charge, if-it was -'a charge upon the people, which -could have been -drawn from the Treasury under th"e pension bill
'I'lic difficulty in deciding thiS question gimvs, in- the Opinion -of the Chair,- out of the proper con- stfltetion 
thht is to be pihced upon t.he, last t,vvo lines ot• the seventh section of the bill, taken in connection with a clause in the act of '1853
'l'he words to which the Chair re.förs are these: and such- cerüficates ot• stock'—the $5,000,000 of stock which it is provided shall be issued— shall be redcanable at the 'I'reasury oti the United States.' Now; if the Chair could have the benefit of the opinion ot the Attorney General, as to what would be the interpreta- tion of Lll(s law, he perhaps, have less difhculty in de- ci(tinz now
'I'hc question depends upon that interpretation
Can the holders of' the stock present their certificates at the Treasury, aud (Itaw thcit• Inoney upon those certificates
'l'heC,hair was inclined to the opinion thaL it
would require t'urthcr lcgtslatlon; thc attention of the Chair has been called to the act of 18.33, (tenth chapter of Statutes at Large, paue 212,) in which this langnauc is used : bc it J*urther enacted, 'Thai the Secretary of' the Treasury be, and hc is hereby, authorized to rchase, at tho current 'narket prie.e, any ot' the outst.an(ltng stocks of the United States, as hc Inay think Inost advisable, froin any snrplus fund from the-Treasury, provided the balance from the '.rrcasury shall not, at any tiine, be reduced below NOW, if the- Secretary or-thc Treasury can, by virtue i't• thiS clattse, redeelll tbc stocks, unquestionably there is that iii tbc biii which an- appropriation
In de•ciding this (Idestion, the Chair has LO decide the legal point in- vowed, according to his judgment asa lawyer
the sev- enteenth line of the ninth pave
will be iöund what would sceni to indicate the understanding of I-hc fratner of the bill
He there speaks of the herein appropriated.' 'I'he Chiiir supposes that the bikk was fratned with a view that it should not be sent to tho Committee of the Who!e on the state -of the Uniån; hilt
be thinks, also, that in that pur- pose it has and the question being one of doubt,-the Chair is deternxined in hiS judgment by the precedents, which are
uniform, so (hr as Ille Chair has been able to examine them, in sending this French spoliation bill to the Conunit.teeoü the on the state of the Union turcon- sideration
Il'hc Chair decides that the bill t-nust go to the Ccnnrnittee of Ole WV hole on the state of' the Union." Mr
BRANCH
that decision there was an appeal, and the yeas and nays were taken upon, a motion to la_y the a_ppeal on the table
Tho déé,ision of the Chair was sustained
CURTIS
This bill is in form of au- thoriztn«r a-cOntract, and is like a bill authorizincy a•contract to be made for carrying the mail, or for any other purpose
It proposes to authorize a contract to ber made for doing a certain service in a e.erlain way
it appropriates no but proposes -to pa-y for the contract in two ways: by donatincr a certain amount of land; sec- ond,-by paying in bonds of a certain kind, and not in stock—the
bonds to .be paid by the Treas- ury of the United States in thirty years
It secms to me that here is a great difference between this bill and bills making approprigtions
I will read from the bill a desei•iptiön of the bonds: SEC
12
,and be it further enacted, That the bonds au- mittee of the Whole on of the Union, as money can be taken out of the Treasury, it is not any one will see by its general appearance
But that' kind of legislation that the roles require to inasmuch as this bill has been under considera- go to the Committee of the Whole on the stato of tion, has been published, and is well understood, the Union
But if our action, in conncctioo with it is not my purpose, unless the Chair so rules, to the laws of the Government, will allow money to have it go to the Committee of the Whole; and shall try to give good reasons why 1 think SC is not necessary so to• refer it
•I believe it never has been in the Committee of the Whole
It was not referred to that committee last year upon the ground that we supposed, under the new rule, we could consider and determine the xxvhole mat- ter without sen'ding it to that committee, I do not know whether that point was taken by the gentleman from North Carolina
Mr
BRANCI-I
The point of order was made; but it was suøgcstcd that, inasmuch as the com- mittce intended to move to postpone the consid- oration of the bill to a day certain, the point of order would go over with it
It was not pressed, therefore, it being understood that when the bill was taken up the point would be pressed
Mr
CURTIS
we had it up for consideration for two days; and the only reason why I could not get a final vote upon it was, that it was -re- committed to the committee, and when it was affain reported, we had not time to consider it
Mr
BRANCH
Docs the gentleman refer to this bill
Mr
CURTIS
1 refer to the general bill
Mr
BRANCH
Perhaps I may not under- stand the gentleman from Iowa
There was a bili for a Pacifw railroad that s,vas up, and was discussed for a day or two, and made no point of order upon it
Tl'he bill '•,vas recommitted to the committee by a vote of the House
"1'he bill now before the House was reported back to the House in consequence of its recor-n has never been considered in thc•Housc at all
IVIP
CURTIS
technically speaking, the gentleman is right; but this is tlle same bill, with amendments, which the conn•nittee made to meet objections which were urged to it in the House
Certainly the clause to which tho gen- tleunan from North Carolina refers was in the I former bill just as it is in this
rl'hc bill was considerod beföre in thc House without being re- ferred to the Cornmittec of the Whole on the state of the Union, and \vas tu•trued for two or tln•ee days
The changes that have been madc by the conunittec arc trifling in importance
rl'hcy ccr- tainly do not make a6y difference in the propriety of considering thc bill in the House as it was be- fore considered
Mr
GROW If the gentleman from Iowa will allow me, would like to ask l')im a question for information, as I have not got the bilk, and should not have time to examine it minutely if I had
Docs the bill provide for the issuing of bonds in such a way that, will) (Iu y furthe action of Con- oress, Inoney can bc taken out of the Treasury of the United States
That is the point, I take it
Mr
CURTIS
It does not
Mr
BRANCH
I hope we shall have this de- bate conducted with regularity
T be very point in issue upon which the, whole qneslion of order rests, is whether money can be taken out of the Treasury under this bill without further action by Concrress
Mr
REAGAN
I desire to direct attention to If the question had been pro- another feature
pounded whether the liability of the Government for the money was fixed, then it would have been easily answered
Certaiilly the liability of the Governmont for the amount of the bonds is fixed Mr
GROW
I only wrant to ascertain the fact
I take it that thero is no question about the rule, upon either side of the House, that any measure that will allow money to be taken out of the Treas- urv, without any subsequent action by Congress, , must first be considered in the Committee Of the Whole on the state of the Union
Now, it is a i simple qucstion of fact: not whether the Govern- thorized to be issued by the provisions of this act shall merit is liable for the bonds, but can the moncy be madc payabie to bearer, and redee\nable at the Treasury be drawn from Treasury without some fur- of the United States in thirty years from the date thereof, boating interest at the rate of' five per centum per annum, payable se;ni-ann aany at the Treasury ofthe (Jjiited States ; and if bonds be issund, they be coupon bond* or in- at the election of the said corporation or corporations
It seems to me here is nothing like an appro- priation
The bill was not drawn with any view to avoid the necessity of referring it to the Com- i' ther action by Congress
Mr
CURTIS
It cannot
MI'
GROW
If it can, then the bill should go to the Committee of the Whole on the State of the II Union; if not, then it need not go there, because it has been decided, over and over aoain, that we can impose liabilities upon the
Govei•nment; hut be taken out of the 'Treösury without any subse- I quent act.ion, then it must go the Committ.ee of the Whole on the state of the Union
And it was simply as to that question of fact that I •was ask- iliff the gentleman from Iowa
will say to the gentleman from Texas, if he will allow me, that the fact that the Government is liable to pay the bonds, does not make this such a measure as must necessarily be first considered It must be some measure of leeis- in committee
lation that will allow money to bc takcn out of the Treasury #ithout any subsequent action
Now, whether this bill does that or not, is the question which I have not examined
thereföre asked the question
Mr
REAGAN
The All proceedings touching appropriations of money shall be first discussed in a Committee of the VVhole House
Thé question is, whether the Government is made liable by this bill for money that is to be withdrawn from the Treasury
Ifthe bill is passed, the liability of the Government certainly fixed for this amount of money
There is bound to be so much money taken out of the Treasury, or the Government must repudiate its legal obligations
Ifthe payment of these bonds is to be made, it, in reality, whatever may be the phraseology of the bill, fixes the liability of the Government to pay so much money, and determines that the people, through this Government, shall be responsible for the bonds
Mr
GROW
Let me say a word just at that point
Congress can pass a law fixing the salary of an officer of the Government at fifty dollars a month, for instance, or at whatever amount you please, and it is not necessary that itshall first be considered in the Committee of the NM hole on the state of tl'le Union
But
a bill to appropriate
the money to pay that salary must be first considered in the' Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The Government, however, is just as much liable, when you have fixed the salary that an officer shall receive, for the amount of that salary, as in any other way in which you can fix liability upon it
Now, as to the question of fact in regard to this bill, I am not informed
Mr
REAGAN
The fourth section of bill , provides for the issuance of these bonds; it not only fixes the liability, but provides for the issu- ance of the bonds
Mr
GROW
I desire to ask the gentleman if the bill provides any means for their payment
The information I seek is whether the bill fixes any way for; paying the bonds 
Mr
SICKLES
It does not
Mr
BRANCH
The question, Mr
Speaker, as to whether this money can be paid without any further action of Congress, has already been de- cided by this House itself in the decision to which I have referred
The very language of this bill is identical with the language OF the French spolia- tion bill, in reference to which Mr
Speaker Orr decided that it must go to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Now, sir, let me read from the fourth section of the bill: The bonds authorized to be issued by tho provisions thisact shall be made payable to the bearer, and redeem- able at the Treasury ot' thc United States
The language of the French spoliation bill, the words upon which Mr
Speaker Orr based his decision, wcrc as follows
i read from his decis- ion: The words to which the Chair refers are these: And such certificates of stock [the of stock I,vhich it is provided shall be issued] shall be redeemable at the Treasury of the United States.' The Chair wili perceive that the words in the French, spoliation bill were identically the sarne as the words of the bill that we now have before us
The House in that case, decided that the bill enabled monoy to be drawn from the Treasu ry without further action by Congress; that bonds are issued, and made redeemable at the Treasury, then the act of 1853, which I have al- ready read, comes into effect, and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem those bonds out of any surplus in the Treasury, provided I always that he shall never reduce the surpxus until there is some action proposed, by which below $6,000,000
 1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOOE, 127 Isa t
weas precisely the point that was in issue :ase in the last Congress
The words in frifl weie the same
The reasons are the If' we should pass the bill now bcforc us, the- Secretary of the Treasury could, under the aet of' 1853, whenever there is a surplus in the Treasury, recieeln everv single one of the bonds provided the •bill, without Congress ever being called - upon to make an appropriation, or withoutour having an opportunity to exercise any control whatever over it
A general law of Con- gress makes an appropriation for the payment of 'I'he gentleman from 101,va shakes his bonds
head
The act of 1853, to which I have referred, expressly authorizes the Secretary -of the Treas- ury to pay any outstanding bonds of the United States whenever there is a surplus in the Treas- ury amount.ing to more than $6,000,000
This bill provides only for issuing the bonds
The ge.neral act of Congress then comes into play, authorizing the Secretary of the 'Treasury to pay these bonds
So that in the act of passing this bill we autl-lorize the withdrawal from the 'I'reas- ury of as much money as shall be required to pay the bonds provided for in the bill itself
Now, since have been a member of the House, I have never known any question relatincy to the proceedings of tbc House, more fully or more thoroughly discussed tllan was the question of the French spoliation bill, last Congress
The point of order was made by the honorable gentle- man from Virgikia, (Mr
Letcher.) It wag dis- cussed by the gentleman from Alabama, [Mr
HOUSTON,] and the gentleman f'rom Georgia
(Mr
Stephens.) 'l*he Speaker, himself an experienced parliamentarian, considered the question for sev- eral hours
He examined it thoroughly, and thc decision ho thon made covered not only the whole ground in that case, but ig identically I ' on all fours" with the case now before us
The language is so identically the sarne that we might very well infer that the fourth section of this bill had been copied from the section of the French spoliation bill on which the Speaker sent that bill to the Committee of the Whole on the 1 desire to take no advantage state of the Union
I only ask that the bill of the friends of the bill
shall take the course which our rules prescribe for bills not involving a hundredth part of the im- portant considerations involved in this, because the public interest demands full discussion and a fair opportunity of amending the bills; which opportunity cannot be had except in the Com- mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Tl'he gentleman from Iowa refers to the fact that this bill was before the House for two days last session, and that no point of order was made on it, as an arcrumcntwhy this point of order should not be now sustained
Does not the gentlenmn from Iowa perceive that it may be, that the very diversity of opinions that was made manifest during those two days in the discussion of the bill, may have been the very reason that induces me and other membcrs to desire now that the bill should mo to the Committee of the W hoic on the state of the Union, vv•here every gentleman feel- ing an interest in it, and whose constituents feel an interest in it, can have an opportunity to dis- cuss and amend it
I confess that no point of order was made
I do not know that I was pres- ent when the bill was taken up for consideration before; but if I had been present, and had failed to make the point of order, I am perfectly Well satisfied, from my recollection of the debate, that Mr
am of the practice of the House, he held that it was com- l)etent for the House to consider it without its that committee, and •I' desire to Say that; accord- having been considered in the Committee of -the ing to my -underständing, the bill', US recOrnmittéd Whole on the state of the Union
An appeal was to the cömmittee, underwent some
material-'niddi„• ficat.ions and changes, cmbracihg,.iij• fact, the fea- taken from the Speaker's decision; and on motion; the appe.al was laid on the table
I think the cases I ture in question in relation to thåSe-bohds.t The provisions in the original bill Néré •whdil',y are precisely analogous
Mr
GARNETT
f suggest that the case to which the; gentleman from Pennsylvania refers was before the passage of the act of 1853, referred to by the gentleman from North Carolina
The
SPEAKER
The Chair asks the gentle- man from Pennsylvania whether an appropria- tion had riot been previously made in that case
Mr
McKNIGHT
No, sir; This decision was made by a gentleman who was per- fectly familiar with parliamentary rules
Mr
BRANCH
What is the de- cision 
Mr
McKNIGHT
August, 1850
Mr
BRANCH
That was three years before the passage of the law on which I based lily Ob- jection
Mr
SICKLES
1 suggest that the act of 1853 only relates to the bonds then 
issued, and could not, havo a-prospective effect
It could not refer to bonds 1')0t then in existence
Mr
BRANCH
The House decided differ- cntly; because the French spoliation bill required bonds to be issued, and the House decided that they were mnbraced within the act of 1853
Mr
SHERMAN
It me that stated by the gentleman from Iowa settles this tnatter

Mr
McKNIGHT
to call the atten- tion of the House to a precedent referred to in Barclay 's Digest
It is a decision made in August, 1850, by Mr
Cobb, the then Speaker
Mr
Rich- ardson, from the Committeeeon Military Affåirs, had reported a bill for the relief of Jacob P
Mont- gomery, and it being proposed to discuss it at that time, the point of order was raised that, as the bill directed the payment
of a sum of money by the Paymaster General, it should be first, under the 133d rule, considered in the Committee of ' l" he Speaker Whole cn the state ot• the Union
decided that, notwithstanding the Pay lnaster Gen- eral was directed to pay•a cert.ain sum of money, there was no appropriation made by the bill out of which it would be paid; and in conformity with ment it was reported by the committee I made the point of order that it must to the Committee of It has never been considered in the the Whole

There were, how- ever, several modifications made
One-question which arose in the House, was, as to whether 
there should bo a corporation, and-in relation to that we introduced certain words into this -bill, which I wilt read to the House: Pro-vided further, 'l'hat the said persons and their- assö- ciates shall- not be:or
becomevested:wlttl any grant, right/ or interest intended to be secured by the provisions of this: act otherwise than in' a corporate character and capacity; to be first acquired by them or such of tfjern as shall a-céebtk the terms ahd conditions -Of t)iS aög, Within (lie -terri.törial ana State jurisdictions into •anß-througb whiCh the rai-froad.' contenvlated by this act shall ber constructed
That is one of the amendments whiclv we -in-: •serted, and a principal one, too
But to make the" provision still more definite in regard •to -mort- gages, we introduce another proviso, which is as follows: Proeided, That said corporation or corporations shäll have fifty milc sections ofa railroad and telegraph line -conv pleted as herein mentioned, and such State or territorial laws procured and first mortgaae executed as shall, in the opinion of the Attorney General of the United States, render
the mortgage lien herein conten)plate.d a legal security for the bond* advanced, betöre lands or bonds shall be con- veyed by the Government of the United States
Another amendment was attached-to the bill in committee, and this is in reality the most import- It is comprised .in "the ant change in the bill
thirteenth section, and provides for a southern Pacific railroad to be carried on in connection- with a central and northern, railroad
Still, t is, as I have said, substantially the same bill* as the one on which the House has already acted
Mr
BRANCH
If the gentleman will allow me, I desire to say that I have sent for and have before me the report of the select committee, in which they refer to the bill now reported as con- taining certain modifications of the bili which was recommitted to them
So that the honorable gentlem'an from Iowa will see that this is cer- tainly, in a parliamentary sense, a different biil* according to the report of the committee itself
Mr
CURTIS
Certainly
not; the report from which the gentleman reads states tl•nat it is sub- stantially the same bill
Mr
BRANCH
But it is not the same bill
Mr
CURTIS
Oh, that is a mere technical objection
Mr
BRANCH
It ié the same bill, with alter- ations
Mr
CUR'I'IS
It is the same bill
Certain sections are rnodified
It is a very
long bill', as the gentleman will see
I do not wish to consume the time of the House in relation to tlie- -matter, or to seem captious about it
•All wish is, that the question of order shall be fairly considered, and then, if the Speaker says it must go to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union i shall submit, and move that the House «o into committee at once for its consideration; butl shali do all I can to prevent its going there, because am very well satisfied, from the course taken the House when the matter was before under con- sideration, two or three days will be con- sumed, and I do not desire to occupy so rriuch of' the time of the House
It is my determination to press (be bill to ü final vote as speedily as possi- ble, and thm•efore I am desirous to keep it in the House
-I ask for the decision of the Chair upon the question of order
The SPEAKER
The Chair has some lection on his Iiind that when this subject
was last up, the question was propounded by the gentle- man from North Carolina whether, if the bill was posq.joned until this time, his question of' order would come up when the bill came affain before Chair replied in the affrmative, the House for the reason that the bill would come before the House in the precise condition in which it stood when tl'ie postponement took t)iace, The Chair therefore decides that in good faith' he is bound: to entertain the question of order raised by the gentleman from North Carolina
 128 The Chair, whether considering the question raised in the -lighi of decisions a-hecady made by his predecessors, or as an original proposition, cannot entertain a doubt that the bill does make an appropriation within the
meaning of the rule
He believes the great object and scope of the rule to be,l that when the House -is aböut to make a didposition ofasum of the public money, it_should have the opportunityofdiscussingthe p'roposition in the.Committee of the Whole
This bill makes the Govefnment liable, the Chair
finds, for a very large surn of money—some $60,000,000
The question:seems to be raised whether the binding of
the Gevei•nment-to pay a sum of-money is, within the meaning of the rule, an appropriation, unless there is a specific sum actually named for the payment of the debt or redemption of the bonds
Waiving the consideration of that question, how- ever, the twelfth section of the bill- does, it seems to the Chair, mhe a direct appropriation
It is in these words: That the bonds authorized to be issued by the provisions of this act shali be made payable to bcarer, and redeemable at-the Treasury of the United•States in thirty years from the date thereof, bearing interest at the rate of five per eentum per annum, payable semi-annually at the 'I'•reasury 01' the United States
Now, if that is not an appropriation, the Chair can hardly understand what is
The bonds are redeemable in thirty years
Independent of the provision of law permitting the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem any outstanding bonds when- ever there shall be a surplus in the Treasury, this act provides expressly that these bonds shall be redeemed
Now suppose, at the end of thirty years, - the Secretary of the Treasury redeems the bonds without further legislation: is not this an appropriation
Clearly
The Chair regrets that he is called on thus hastily to decide so important a question; but he has no hesitation in deciding, as he does decide, that the bill must go to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The bill will, in accordance with the decision just made, be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
CURTIS
Lmove that it be made a spe- Cial order
in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I suggest that it be made the special order for this day three weeks
Mr
CURTIS
1 cannot consent to that
want the bill to be taken up and considered at this time
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I make a privi- legcd motion
I move that the House adjourn
Mr
CURTIS
1 have the floor, and 1 do not yield to any such motion
I object to everything that interferes with the consideration of this bill for the construction of a Pacific railroad
I move that the bill bc madc a special order in the Com- mittec of the Whole on the state of the Union, until it is disposed of
Mr
JONES
I object to the motion making this subject a special order in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
GROW
This has been decided to be an appropriation bill; and, under the rules, an ap- propnation bill may be made a special order by a ma•oritv vote
dlr
BRANCH
The rule of the House rc- fers, not
to every appropriation bill, but only to the general appropriation bills therein specified
It takes the unanimouk consent of the House to make this a special order in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
ME, CURTIS
I move, then, that the rules be suspended, and -that the House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
I give notice that I will move to lay aside all other business in order to take up for consid- eration this Pacific railroad bill
Mr
BRANCH
Then the proposition to make this bill a special order is abandoned
The SPEAKER
The opinion of the Chair is, that the bill cannot be made a special order unless by unanimous consent
Mr
CURRY
1 move that the House do now adjourn
Mr
WASHBURNE,0f111inois
In myjudg- ment, the decision of the Chair on the point of order raised by the gentleman from North Caro- lina, [Mr
BRANCH,] involves the fate of this Pa- cific railroad bill
As that decision uow stands, I think the gentleman from Iowa may as well CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 18 give up this bill' for this session
With all re- spect to the Chair; 1 believe that*his decision is a I believe that it i3 against the pre-
vn•ong one
cedents x..vhich have been established
Certamly it is in opposition to the decisions which have been made since I have been a.member of this House
Mr
BRANCH
1 rise to a point of order
If the decision of the Chair is to be assailed, I shall I think that claim the.privilege of defending it
the decision of the Chair is correct; but it is not in order for the gentleman to assail it, or for me to defend it
Mr
CURTIS
1 have not surrendered the floor
The SPEAKER
Then the motion to adjourn is not in order
Mr
CURTIS
I move that the rules be sus- pended, and the House resolve itself into the Com- mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr
CURRY
The gentleman yields the floor,
and I move that the House do now adjourn
Mr
FLORENCE demanded tellers
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs
SMITH, of Virginia, and LED, were appointed
Mr
MARTIN, of Virginia
Isa motion for a call of the House in order
The SPEAKER
It is not, during division of the House
The question was taken ; and the tellers reported —ayes 19, noes 87
So the House refused to adjourn
Mr
GARNETT
There does not appear to be a quorum, by the last vote
Mr; WASHBURNE, of Illinois
A quorum is not required on a motion to adjourn
TERRITORIAL BUSINESS
Mr
GROW
I desire to make a statement in which we are all interested: There seems to be a misapprehension in reference to the Eime when the territorial business will be taken up for con- sideration
Wednesday and Thursday, and not Thursday and Friday, have been set apart for that business
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
The question was taken on Mr
CURTIS'S mo- tion; and it was agreed to
The House accordingly resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
Gnow in the chair.) The CHAIRMAN
The first business in or- der before the committee is the annual message of the President of the United States upon the state of the country
Several MEMBERS
That has been referred

Mr
SHERMAN
I hope that the message I make the motion that it be will be laid aside
laid aside
Mr
CURRY.
I withdraw my motion for the readirig of the message
The question was taken on Mr
SHERMAN'S motion; and it was agreed to
So the message was laid aside
REMOVAL OF HOUSE BDNCI:IES
The CHAIRMAN
The next business inorder is a resolution instructing the Clerk to remove the present seats from the House, and replace the old chairs and desks; and, with the view of giving time for this object, that this House (with the concurrence of ihe Senate) do adjourn for two weeks from and after Friday next
[Laughter.] Mr
CURTIS
I move that that resolution be laid aside
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
Iproposeto debate that resolution 
Mr
SHERMAN
1 make the point of order that it is not debatable
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair sustains the point of order
Motions in reference to priority of business are not debatable
The resolution was laid aside
SOLDIERS OF 1812
The CHAIRMAN
The next business in order I is House bill No
66; granting pensions to offi- cers and soldiers of the war with Great Britain of 1812, and those engaged in Indian wars during that period
Mr
CURTIS

The
CHAIRMAN
The first motion takes precedence
Mr
FLORENCE
1 withdraw the demand for It will be seen where are the friends of tellers
the soldiers of 1812
I thank God that they show themselves upon this side of the House
The bill was laid aside
APPOINTMENTS OF EX-MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
The CHAIRMAN
The next business in is a resolution deprecating the example which has of late years obtained, by the practice of the subordinate offcers of this House, of appointing ex-members of Congress to inferior places within their gift as derogatory to the dignity of the House, and calculated to impair its influence with the country
Mr
CURTIS
1 move that the resolution be laid aside
It ought to Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
be with the recomrnendation that it do pass
Mr
McCLERNAND demanded tellers
Tellers were ordered; and Nhssrs
LEE and GARTRELL were appointed
Mr
ANDERSON
1 ask for the reading of the resolution
Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
No debate is in order on a question of priority of business
The reading of the resolution is in the nature of debate, and therefore is not in order
I make that point
The CHAIRMAN
Members have the right to know what is the proposition upon which they are called to vote
The resolution was read in ectenso
Mr
BRANCH
I have no disposition to filli- buster; but it is proper that the House should know there are seventy-four bills upon the Calen- dar before the Pacific railroad bill
We wiil have to lay them aside, one after the other, before we can reach that bill
Mr
McCLERNAND
1 dall the to order
The gentlernan has no riffht to refer to other matters than the one before the committee, even if debate were in order
The CHAIRMAN
In the opinion of the Chair, the point of order is well taken
Mr
GARNETT
I appeal from that decision of the Chair
The committee was divided; and there were— ayes ninety-six, noes not counted
The CHAIRMAN ordered tellers; and ape pointed Messrs
GARTRELL and BURNHAM
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair state the exact question before the committee
The gen- tlcman from Illinois rnade the point of order, upon the motion to lay aside one bill and take up a subsequent one on the Calendar, that debate was not in order
The Chair sustained the point of order, and from that decision the gentleman from Virginia took an appeal
The question is, " Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the jndgement of the committee." Upon that question the Chair appointed thegentleman from Georgia [Mr
GAR- TRELLI and the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr
BURNHAM] tellers
Mr
McCLERNAND
1 suppose 1 viate all this diffculty by withdrawing my point of order
Mr
GARNETT
1 object to the withdrawal of the
point of order
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman has the right to withdraw the point of order at any time
Mr
GARNETT
I appeal from that decision
Mr
McCLERNAND
i withdraw my point
Mr
GARNETT
i rise to a point of order
It is, that the gentleman from Illinois has not the right to withdraw it, a vote by tellers having been ordered, and the count having commenced
Mr
CASE
I rise to a point of order
The question of order of the gentleman from Virginia was not made while he was in his seat
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will not enter- tain a second point of order until the first point is  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, TliE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C

CHAIRMAN
The Chair does not (lerstand that
(hatcan be raised as a point of ordct any than a point of order can be raised upon a decision of the Chair assicyninc a gentleman the floor
Mr
GARNETT
The Chair, then, decides that I have no right to makc the point of order
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair cannot make any decision on it as a point of order
The ques- tion is on thö motion of the gentleman from Iowa to lay aside this resolution; and the tellers will please take their places
The committee divided; and the tcllers reported —ayes 97, noes 26
So the resolution was laid aside

The committee divided ; and the tellers reported —ayes 46, noes 96

The CHAIRMAN
The question is upon laying asi(ie the bill
The gentleman from Mary- land calls for the reading of it
, The Chair de- cides that, upon a question as to the priority of business, it is not in order to have a bill read
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
1 appeal from that decision; it is a violent strokc at the first principles THURSDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1860
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will ask the Clerk to read the 66th rule again
The rule was again read
Mr
PHELPS
I desire to know the ruling of r l'here was so much noise I could not the Chair
understand
The CHAIRMAN
The 114th rule provides In Connnitt.oe of the Whole on the, state of the Union, the bills shall be taken up and disposed of in their order on the
Calendar; but
when objection is made to the consid- erat.ion of bill, a majority of' the comnlittce shall decide, debate, whether it shall be taken up and disposcd of or laid aside." Mr
PHELPS
The reads as 1 supposed; but I do not understand the ruling of the Chair
Suppose bill is called up, and an objection is made: it rests with the cornmittce whether it will proceed to consider the bill when it is read by its The C.I"IAIRMAN
The proposition was to lay aside a particular bill upon the Calendar
Mr
PHELPS
1 must to that mode of disposing of the matter
'l' ficre is no necessity for a motion to proceed to the consideration of a bill
A bill corncs up of course, unless solne member rises and objects
Upon objection, the Chair puts the quest'ion: " Shall the committee proceed to the consideration of the bill 
5' The CHAIRMAN
The Chair that that is only a di{Ferent mode of reaching the same ond
A gentleman moves to lay the bill aside; another gentleman asks that it may bc read
The Chair decides that, upon the question of laying aside a bill, it cannot be read
Mr
PHELPS
Ido not differ with the Chair upon that point, but only as to the mode of pro- pounding the qucstion
T hc construction which I crivc to the rule has uniformly prevailed in thc House
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will put the question to the committee in this form: " Will the committee now consider this bill 
' ' The Chair desires now to remind the committee that no debate, is in order upon this question
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
i appealed from the decision of the Chair; but the reasons of the Chair are so lucid and powerful that I withdraw appeal

decided without debate." The CHAIRMAN
The Chair decides that until u bill is up to be acted on, the gentleman is not entitled to have it read
That a bill is not read may be a reason for controlling his vote
Mr
SMITH, of Virginia
I desire to suggest that when a bill is called up on the Calendar, it is called för the purpose of being taken up and acted upon; and being called up for that purpose and no other, we have an undoubted right to know what •.,ve arc called to act upon
Mr

That is so
Mr

I ask unanimous consent of the committee to lay aside all the bills until we come to the Pacific railroad bill

The Chair decides that it was competent for the gentlcman from Ohio to rn•opose his amendment, and for the gentleman from Iowa to propose his tunendment io that; but the first proceeding of the committee will bc to rend the original bill by clauses for amendinents, as stated by the gentlernun fronl North Carolina.
The Clerk proceeded to read the first section of the bill for tunendlnent
Mr
REAGAN, (interrupting the reading.) I do not understand how this is
The CHAIRMAN
The bill is being read by clauses for amendment
Mr
REAGAN
The information I want is as to at what time, and in what manner, we can get to amend the bill proposed as an amendment by the gentleman from Iowa
The CHAIRMAN
The original bill is open to amendment, as it is read by sections
The Chair will hold that the next question will be upon the the gentleman from Iowa to the amendment of the g0ntleman from Ohio
Mt•
REAGAN
Will the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa be rend by clauses for amend Inont
The CHAIRMAN
The Clerk is now read- ing the original bill by clauses for amendment, and, unless the gentleman desires to propose an amendment, it is not in order interrupt tl'iat proceedine
Mr
REAGAN
I want to know if this is a parliamentary trick to defeat amendments to the bill that is really thc subject of the action of the committee 
The CHAIRMAN
The amendment of the gentleman from Iowa is in the nature of a sub- stitute for the amendment of •the gentleman from Mr
REAGAN
YVill it be in order to move to amend that amendment before it is acted on 
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will decide that question when it Brises
The Clerk then completed the reading of the first section of the bill
Mr
REAGAN
Mr
Chairman, 1 wish to inquire if it is too late now to make a question of order upon the offering of the amendment of thc gentleman from Iowa 
Tho CHAIRMAN
It is not in order now
The only thing under consideration at this time is the original bill, It must be read through by clauses, and is open to amendment, MY hen it has been read through, we shall take up tho amend- ments of the gentleman from Iowa and the gen
tleman from Ohio
REAGAN
Then, when the amendment Of' the gentleman from Iowa is proposed, I sup- pose I can make my question of order
CHAIRMAN
The Chair will decide these questions when they arise
The Clci•k will now read the second section of the bill unless the gentleman desires to offer an amendment to the first section
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I desire to makc an inquiry of the Chair for information
Sappogc the committee should now rise: wili not the bill
under Consideration be the first business in order when we go into the Committee of the Whole-on the state of the Union again
The CHAIRMAN
If no special order over
rides it, the Chair thinks it will be: but the pres• ent occupant of the chair may not then be in the chair
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
This is a very im- portant bill—one reported from the Commitlce on Public Lands by myself; and I feel very much disinclined to have it murdered in this way by a trick of legislation for the benefit of another rail• I move that the committee do now rise, in road 
order that we may look into this matter
Mr
SHERMAN
I wish to inquiry If the committee now rises, will of the Chair
not this bill, with the pending amendments, come up as a matter of course, whenever the House again resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The CHAIRMAN
The present occupant of the chair may not be called upon to decide that question; but in his judgment, under the amended rules, this will be the first business in order in tbc Cornmittee of the Whole unless overridden by special orders
Mr
SHERMAN
It is equivalent then to special order in committee, and I can sec no ob.
jection to rising now
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I insist on my mo- tion
Mr
REAGAN
I ask the gentleman to with- I want to understand the hold it for a moment

do not want to lose the right to raise that question of order, which I Inuy do if the committee now Mr
PHELPS
The amendments have yet been read, and I suppose questions of order cannot, be decided by the Chair until the amend- ments have been read; consequently, thc gentle- man's question of order can be as well raised at the next session of the committee as now
The CHAIRMAN
The point of of the gentleman from Texas will be in order when the committee goes into session again
Mr
REAGAN
I want to get a question of order raised now
The Clerk has been reading a substitute offered to the original bill, as I un- ders land
Mr
PHELPS
Cannot the question of order be raised at the next meeting of the committee 
T hc CHAIRMAN
The Chair sees no reason why it cannot
Mr
BRANCH
1 wish it understood, that when the substitutes of the gentleman from Iowa and the gentleman from Ohio shall be read, if they shall prove to be propositions for building other railroads than railroads in Nebraska, shall Object to their reception on the ground that they are inconcn•uous
The CHAIRMAN
The substitutes not now' before the committee for its action; nothing but the original bill
Mr
BRANCH
I only want to make that res- ervation of rny rights
Mr
REAGAN
My object is toknox.v whether I can now make my point of order
The question is this: this bill has now been read by sections
I wan t to understand whet her the mode that has been adopted by the gentleman from Iowa and the, gen- tleman from Ohio in making an amendment in the second degree will preclude us from the right of having the bill which is intended to be acted upon read by sections for amendment
The CHAIRMAN
The bill was being read by sections fbr amendment
The next business for the committee is to have the rest of it read
The two amendments referred to by the gentleman from Texas are not now before the committee, and therefore are not subject to points of order
I now insist on my Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
motion that the committee rise

PERSONAL EXPLANATION
Mr
SLIDELL
Mr
President, while waiting for the Senator from Oregon to appear in his seat, I wish to call the attention of the Senate to a.mat- ter which is personal to myself, and which may, perhaps, become question of privilege before the Senate
Ireeeived last night from New Orleans the following, dated December 18: The telegraphic dispatches to the assoéiatecbpress bbis morning include the following: In his speed•h to-day" I presume that must have been the 17111— Senator Slidell, of Louisiana, charged President Bu- chanan with imbecility, imputing to hill) the cause of the present troubles and the authorship of the present crisis.' Any correction needed Now, Mr
President, I need scarcely say, for the information of any member of the Senate, or, probably, of any resident in Washington, that there is not a shadow of foundation for this dis- I have never opened my lips on this floor patch
on the subject of the President's message, the
resolution of the Senator from Kentucky , nor upon any question connected , in the most remote degree, with the difhculties that now agitate the country
But I owe it further to myself and to the Presi-
dent to say that neither in nor out of the Senate, to •any Senator, or to • anybody else, in writing, speech, or by intimation, have I ever conveyed or encouraged such an idea
This is not the appro- priate time for me to pass that eulogium upon the character of the President that my
ft•elings would I ri.se simply for one special purpose
prompt
Now, MP
President, I shouid like to know how, by whom, and when this base fabrication wäs_cön- cocted; how, and why it was -se_nt over the-wires 
Was it by the agent o

i presume there can be nb'difference of opinion among Senätors upon the propriety of sucli a course and the necessity of sut•h ae,tnon
I may be •permitted to say tinother word: what was the object of this dispatch
About that ul entertail.i no doubt:
A canvass is now proceed- I-fig •iri my State for the election of delegates to a convention to •take into consideration the present state -of the c.ountty
It is not necessary for me to say now what the action of that convention will be
know it in advance
It wilt not be very long beföre we shall have most decided and au- thentie information on that subject
Now, sir, I do not make this charge lightly.- I state it in connection with another am sorry that my colleague is not now in his seat to corroborate rny stät-ernent
Du ring• the session of the Legislature, specially for the pur- pose of' passing a law to enable the people of Louisiana, in their sovereimn capacity, to decide upon the course that they will take ill the critical cmergencies of the time, this associated press spread throughout the whole extent of this Union, and, with particular care disseminated throughout all, the southern States, the assertion that my col- league wasabout to make a strong Union speech
I presume,his opinions are very well known here
What was, the purpose of this dispatch 
may be said, in the case of my colleague,- that these gentlemen, extremely anxious to obtain information of the
opinions of distinguished men in Washington, and, in fact, of any Senator or Representative in Congress, sometimes are de- ceived
Believing that -they are acting upon tol- erablycorrect information, they think It desirable to cater to the curiosity of the public
But I must be permitted to say that, in my opinion, and the opinion of' everybody who has observed the gen- eral tone and character of the dispatcbcs sent over this country by the associated press, they are evidently biased by a strong feeling of opposition to the great national Deinocratic party of' this country; and I do not think it would be unfair to say that they are but too ready, too prone, to re- ceive, and credit, or perhaps
to fabricat,e, what they may consider would tend to the detriment of that party, and to the advantage of the other
In my case, however, there is no excuse of this kind
This is a .base, deliberate fabrication, without one single of foundation in truth
I have nothing more to say; but if I do not re- ceive a very saiisfåctory explanation' bn this sul)- ject to-morrow, if, as I understand, the reporter from the time of disability may" be carried into effect; which was refrrred to the Committee on Pensions

POLK,] in line seventeen of the first section, after the word merits," to insert the words nor upon illegal grounds." The amendment was agreed to
The PRESIDENT
The next question is on the amendment proposed by the Senator from Maine
[Mr

POLK
think we had better not adopt that amendrnent; but let the bill stand as it is, , and raise the qnestion upon the merits of the bill
I atn one of those who think that when the Uni-
ted States assumed to pay Mexican debts up to a certain amount, and when the objoct of that pro- vision was merely that all those e,htiyns that had merit should have an opportunity of being adju- dicated upon, such a clause as this ought not to be stricken out
Under the provisions of this bill, if a commission is to sit at all, that commission should have an opportunity to examine into all cases that have merits
Now, I think m vself that there is just as much justice in allowino• a case that may have been presented, and that may have been thrown out fora mere techn icality with- out touching its merits, to be adjudicated upon and to be decided in favor of by the board, as there is in allowing a case that has not been pre- sented at all to be now presented and adjudicated
I think more, because in the Inst case the partsr having merits has used diligence; he has presented his claim, but il hae been rejected on technical grounds when it had merit
But as the bill wilt be when amended, a party, wbo has not used diligence to present his case at all, will have more advantage of the bill than a party who has been  diligent to get the benefit of the act as it was passed to c.a rry out the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo

Perhaps -i Was m;stakcn but it is not a matter of any const• about that; gucmnce whether the $3,250,000 was a part of the | or nn independent snm to be paid by the Government of the United States

The claims were before it.; they were adjudicated able and eminent men

It was alleged that they had rejected claims that ought to have been allowed in law and in equity

AMENDMM,TTS TO TifE CONSTITUTION
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Pint res- olution presented by the, Senator from lenncssee [Mr
J onN50N] is, as special order, now before the Senate for consideration, and upon it the Sen- ator from Tennessee is entitled to the floor
Mr
JOHNSON,0fTennessec
Mr
Pfesident, yesterday, while I was pursuing linc of argu- ment to provc that a Statc had no constitutional power to secede from the Union without the con- sent of the other States, I was diverted frmn it to gome extent by making use of an illustration in reference to the law of the State of Vermont upon I the subject of fugitive slaves, which led to the Senator from Vermont [Mr
COLI, AMERI making an explanation in refcrcnce to that law
did not think his explanation was entirely satisfactory; and the answer that he made to the direct question that I propounded .to him, I tl'iink is morc unsatis- factory than the preceding portion of his remarks
That Senator beipg,a gcntleman of legal attain- ments, having presided in the courts of the coun- try, arid having been for a long time in the coun- cils of the country, I asked him a plain question in regard to a law of his own State, about which there had becn much controversy in the news- papers
asked him whether he was of opinion that it was a constitutional law, or whether it did not come in conflict with the fugitive slave law which was passed by the of the United States in strict conformity with the Constitution of the country
I do not see him in his place; but if I remember his reply, it was an evasion
He said that it might or might not be unconstitutional
did not ask him what it might or might not be; I asked simply what was his opinion upon the subject, and there was no reply given to that ex- plicit question
I think it will -be determined by the courts, and will be determined by the judgment of the coun- try, that the acts passed iii 1850 and 1858 by the Legislature of Vermont are a violation, a gross, ted States
It is clear and conckasive to my mind, that a State passinc an unconstitutional act in- tended to impede or to prevent the execution Of a law passed by thc Congress of the United Slates which is constitutional, is thereby piaced, so far as the initiative is concerned, in a state of rebel- It is an open act of nullification
It is true that, so far as my information I am not aware that there has been any attempt in Vermont to wrest any persons out of the hands of the of- ficcrs of the United States, or to imprison or to fine any person under the operation of this law; but the passage of such an act is to initiate rebel- lion
I think it comes in conflict directly with the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States, and to that extent is an act of nullification, and places the State in open rebellion to the Uni- ted States
I stated, yesterday, that there was no power conferred upon the Congress of the United States, by the Constitution, to coerce a State in its sov- ereign capacity; that there was no power on the part of the Congress of the United States even to bring a State into the supreme tribunal of the country
You cannot put a State at the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
But, in this connection, I did say that the Congress of the United States had the power to pass laws to operate upon individuals within the lin•lits of a State, by which all the functions of this Govern- ment could be executed and carried out
Then, in this case, if Vermont, either by ans act of se- cession, which I take to be unconstitutional, or v,'ithout first having seceded from the Union of the
States by open force, in conformity with the laws of the State, should resist or attempt to resist the execution of the laws of the United States, it would be a practical rebellion, an overt act; and this Government has the power and the authoritv under the Constitution to enforce tho laws of the United States, and it has the power and authority to call to its aid such means as arc deemed neces- sary and proper for the exccution of the laws, even if it was to lead to the calling out of the militia, or calling into service the Army and Navy of the United States to execute the laws
Whilc I make this application to Vermont, I say the same principle applies to every other State placin& herself in a likc attitude in opposition to, aud in contravention of, the execution of the laws of the United States
I do not think it necessary, in order to preserve this Union, or to keep• a Slate within its sphere, that the Congress of the United Sta tes should have the power to coerce a State
NI t.hut is ne- cessary is for the Government to have the power to execute and to carry out all the powers con- ferred upon it l'.»y the Constitution, whether they apply to the State or otherwise
T Ilis, think, the Govermnent clearly has thc power to do; and so long as the Government executes all the laws in good faith, denying the right of a State con- stitut.ionally to secede, so lone• the, Sta_t.e is in the' Union, and subject to all the provisions of the Constitution and the laws passed in conformity with it
For example: the power is conferred on the Federal Govern ment to carry the mails through the several States; to establish post offices aud post roads; tbc power is conferred on the Fed- eral Govern ment to establish courts in the respect- ive States; thc power is conferred on the General Governrnent to lay and collect taxes i n the sev- eral States, and so on
• The various powers arc enu tnerated, and each and every one
oft.l') cse pow- ers the Federal Government has the constitutional authority to execute within the limits of the States
It is not an invasion of a State for the FederaE Government to execute its laws, to take carc of its public property, and to enforce the collection of its revenue; but if, in the execution of the laws; if, in the enforcetnent of the '_•onstitution, it nwets with resistance, it is the duty of the-Governmcnt, and it has the authority, to put down resistance, and effectually to execute the laws as contem- plated by the Constitution of the country
But this was a diversion fron"i the line of my I was goincr on to show that, accord- argument
ing to the opinions of the fathers, not only of the country but of the Constitution itself, no State, of its own volition , had the right to withdraw from the Confederacy after having entered into the com- I referred yesterday to the last letter Mr
pact
Madison wrote upon this subject—at least it is the last one that I have-been able to find—in which he i summed up this subject in a conclusive and mas- In his letter to Mr
Webst.er of i teriy manner
March 15,518.33, upon thercceiptof Mr
Webster's i speech, after excitement had subsided to some extcnt and the country had taken its stand, Mr
Madison said: The Constitution of the United States being estab*ishcd by a competent authority, by that of the sovereign people of the several States who were parties to it, it remains 0Biy to inquire what the Constitution is ; and here it speaks itself
It organizes a Governrnent into the usual legislative executive, and judiciary departrnents ; invests it with speci- fied powers, leaving others to the parties to the Constitu- tioti
It
makes thc Government, like other Governments , to operate directly on the people ; places •at its command the needful physical means of executing its powers ; and finally proclaims its supronacy, and that-of the laws made in pursuance of it, over the constitutions and laws of the States, the powers of the Govcrmnent being exercised; as in other elective and res"nsible Governments, under the control of its.constituents, people, and tbe Legislatures of the States, and :ubject to the revolutionary rights of the people in extrene cases
" Such is the Constitution of the United States de jure and.de facto; and the name, whatever it be, that may be given to it, can Inake it nothing more or less than what it is." This is clear and conclusive, so far as Mr
Mad- I showed yesterday isoh 'roes on the subject
that in 1789, in makiig his report upon the Vir- Tinia resolutions, he gave the true interpretation to those resolutions, and explained what, was mcant•by the 'vvord respective" beforc States
In his letter, in 1832, to Mr
Rives, and in his letter of 1832, to Mr
Trist, (to which I referred yesterday,) having had time to reflect on the op- eration of the various provisions of the Constitu- tion upon the country, in the decline of life, when hc had seen the experiment fairly made, when his mind was matured upon every single point and provision in the Constitution, he, at that 12tte pe- riod, sums up the- doctrine and comes to the con- clusion that I am contending for on the present occasion
In addition to this, Mr
Jefferson, who prior to the formation of the Const.itution was in Paris, writing letters on the subject of tbc formation of u stable Government here, saw tlle great defect in the Federal head under the old Articles of Con- federation , and he pointed with the unerring finger of philosophy and certainty to what is now in the Constitutioim, as what was wanting in the old Articles of Confederation
Mr
Jefferson, in his letter to Colonel Monroe, dated Paris, August 11, 1786, speaks thus: There never be moncv in the 'Treasury till the Coni>deracy show„ its t.ecth
'I'Le States Inust see the rod ; perhaps it must bc felt bv some ouc of them
I anl per- suaded all of them would rejoice to see every one obliged to furnish its contributions
It is not the difficulty of fur- nislling them which beggars the Treasury, but the tear that others will not furnish as lunch
Every rational citizen inust wish to see an effective instrtunent of and should fear to see it on any other element than the water." Here Mr
Jefferson, seeing tho difficulty that, under the old Articles of Confederation, the Fed- eral Government had not the power to execute its laws, that it could not collect revenue, points to what should be in the Constitution of thc Uni- ted States when formed
Mr
Jefferson, upon the same idea which was in his mind, and which l,vas afterwards embodied in the Constitution, said, in a letter to E
Carrington, duted Paris, Augitst 4, I confess I do not go as far in the reforms thought neces- sary, as some of my correspondents in Arnerica ; but if the convention should adopt such propositions, shall suppose then) necessary
My general plan would be 'nake the States one as to everything connected •,vith foreign nations, and several as to everything purely d01nestie
But, with all thc imperfections or our present Government, it is with- outr the best existinc, or that ever did exist
Its greatest defect is the imperfect Inanner in which mat- 
ters of ccnnmerce have been provided *Or.
It has been often said, as to be generallv believed, that Congress have no power by the to enlbrce anything—for example, coutributions of nroney
It was not necessary to give them that power expressly ; they have it by the law of nature
When tan parties make a compact, there •re.su,its to cach a Of compelling the other to execute it
When two parties make a compact, thei•e rc- sults to each a power of compelling the other to execute it.' 'This is Jefferson 's language
was not even expressed in the Constitution, the power to preserve itself and maintain its authority would be possessed by the Federal Govern ii)ent from the very existence of the Government itself, upon the great principle that it must have i power to preserve its own existence
But we find i that, in plain and express terms, this authority is delegated
The very powers that Mr
Jeffer-  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
son pointed out as being wanting in the old Gov- ernment, under-the Articles of Confederation, are granted by the Constitution of the United States to the present Government by express delegation
Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes; Congress has the power to pass laws to restore fugitives from labor escaping from one State into offces and post roads; Congress has the power to establish courts in the difü.n•ent States; and havincr these powers, it has the authority to do everything necessary to sustain the collection of the revenue, the enforcement of the judicial system, and the carrying of the mails
Because Congress, having the power, undertakes to execute its laws, it will not do to say that the Government is placed in the position of an aggressor
Not so
It is only acting within the scope of, the Constitution, and in compliance with its delegated pow.ers
But a State that resists the exercise of those powers be- comes the aggressor, and places itself in a rebel- lious or nullifying attitude
It is the duty of this Government to execute its laws in good faith
When the Federal Government shali filil to exe- cute all the lows that are made in strict conformity with the Constitution, if our sister States shatl pass laws violative of that Constitution, and ob- stcucting the lawg of Congress passed in conforzn- ity with it, then, and not till then, will this Gov- crnmenthavc failed to accomplish the great objects of its creation
Then it Will be at an end, and all the parties to the compact will be released
But I wish to a litt.le farther into the author- ities as to the power of a State to secedc from the Union, and to quote an opinion of Judge Mar- shall, given at a very early day
know it is very common to denounce him as a Federalist; but care
not where the truth comes from, or wherc a sound argument may be found to sustain a proposition that is right in itself, I am witling to adopt it; and have put myself to the trouble to hunt u.p these unquestionable authorities on this subject, knowing that they would have
more influence before the country, and before my con- stit•uents, than anything that I could sav
'Chouga I am not a lawyer, though I have not made thc legal proftßsion my study and my pursuit, I claim to have some little common sense and understand- ing as to the application
of general principles
I find that Judge Marshall , in speaking on the ques- lion of the right of u State upon its own volition to go out of' the Confederacy, in the case of Co- hans vs
Vircrinia, said: It is very true, that whenever hostility to the existing syst.c:n shall become universal' That is, the system of our Government— it will be also irresistible
The people Inade the Consti- tutiou, and the people can untnake it." I care not whether he speaks herc of the people in the aggregate or not
'I'he application of the principle is just as clear, whether you say thc people, through the States, madc the Constitu- tion, or leave out the qualifying words through the States

Now, whether you apply that, in a general sense, to the people in the aggregate, or to tbc States occupying the same rclaiion to the Fcderal Government that the people do t.o the States, the principle is just the same; and when you speak of States *ratifying and making the Constitution of the United States, one State, an ingredient—one of the community that madc the Constitution— has no right, without the consent of the other States, to witlidraw from the compact, and set the when it was understood—in the days of Madison and Jefferson; ahd this is his opinion upon that subject, as far back as 1821
In this connection, I '.vould call the attention of the Senate to General Jackson 's views upon this subject; and I would also •call their attention to Mr
Webster's views, if it were necessary, for hc is conceded, by some at least, to be one of the most able expounders of the Constitution •of the United States
General Jackson, though not cel- ebrated for his legal attainments, was celebrated for his sagacity, his strong common sense, his great intuitive power of reaching correct conclu- In sions, and understanding correct principles
1833, General Jackson, in his proclamation, takeS identically the same ground; and declares that, first, a State has no power of itself to nullify a law of Congress within its limits; and next, that notwithstanding a State may claim to have se- ceded, it has no constitutional power to withdraw itself from the Union of the States, and thereby set at naught the laws and the Constitution
He argues this question forcibly and clearly; and comes to the unerring conclusion, according to my judgment, that no State has the constitutional power to withdraw itself from this Confederacy without the consent of the other States; and It may do good to reproduce his views on the sub- ject
He says, in his famous proclamation, speak- ing of the nullification ordinance of South Car- olina: And whereas the said ordinance prcseribes to the peo- ple of South C,arolina course of conduct in direct vio}a- tion or their duty as citizens of the United States, contrary to laws (it' their country, subversive of its Const.itution, and having tör its object the destruction oc the Union— that Union which, coeval witlV0!tr political existence, led onr iåthers, without any other tics to unite t.hem than those of patriotisnw and a coinn•wn cause, through sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence—that sacrcdLUnion, hitherto inviolate, which, perfected by our happy Consti- tnt.ion, has brought us, by the favor of Heaven, to a state of prosperity at and high consideration abroad, rarely, 'l'o preserve if ever, equaled in the history of nations
this bon(1 political existence frotn 'Icetrnction; to this state ot• national honor and pros- Inaintnin _invi(llat.e aud to justify the confidence Iny have reposed in Ine, 1, ANDREW President of the United States, havc thought proper to issue this my procla- Imation, stating view* of the Constitution and the laws applicable to the measures adopted by the convention of South Carolina, and to the reasons they have put iörth to sustain them, declaring tbc course whicl) duty will require mc to ptll•sttc, and, appealing to the understanding and pa- triot.is:n of the people, warn thein of the consequences that must inevitably reeukt from an observance of the dictates of the convention." He arcyues thc question at len«th: Tili8 right to secede is deduced from the nature ot' the Constitution, which, they say, is a coxnpact betwceu sov- ereign States, who have preserved their whole sovereignty, and therct•ore arc subjcct to nq superior; that because they made the compact they can break it when, in their opinion, it has been departed froin by the other States
Fallacious as this course of reasoning is, it enlist.s State pride, and finds advocates in the honest prejudices of those who have not studied the nature of our Governrnent sufficiently t') see the radical error on which it rests." 'Phe people of the .(Jnited States fonned the Constitu- tion, acting through the State Legislatures in making the compact, to meet and discuss its provisions, and acting in separate conventions when they ratified those provisions ; but t.he terms used in its construction show it to bc a Gov- ernmcnt in which the people of all the States collectively are repyesented

It is a Government in which ail the people are represented; which operates directly the 
they retaincd all people individnally, not upon the States— the power they did not grant

Both of these positions are erroneous,'anå so-me ot• the arguments to prove them have been eipated
The States, severally, have not retained t"liéir

But the reserved -rightA of thc States are nnt sacred because they have, (Or their connm0*i interest, madc the General Govermnent the deihsitory of those powers." So obvious are the reasons which forbid this secession, that it is necessary only to allude
to them

No man believes that
any right exists in a single State to involve all the others in these and countless other evils, contrary to the cngagement solemnly-made
Every one must see that the other self-defense, must oppose it at all hazards." Having traveled thus far, the question arises, in what sense are we to construe the Constitution of the United States
assume what is assumed in one of Mr
Madison 's letters, that the Consti- tution was formed for perpctuity; that it- never was intended to be broken up
It was commenced, it is true, as an experiment; 'but the fouhders of the Constitution intended that- experiment should go on and on and on; and by way of mak- ing it perpetual, they provided for its amendment
They provided that this instrument could be amended and improved, from time to time, as the changing circumstances, as the changing pursuits, as the changing notions of men might require; but they made no provision whatever for its de- struction
•The old Articles of Confederation were formed for the purpose of making " a perpetüal In 1787, when the convention concluded union
their deliberations and adopted the Constitution, what do they say in the very preamble of that Constitut.ion
Having in their mind the idea that was shadowed forth in the old Articles of Confed- oration, that the Union was to be perpetual, they say, at the commencement, that it is -to make "a more perfect union" than the union under the old Articles of Confederation , which they called "i per• petuai."

It is above the Constitution; it is be- yond any provision that can be Inade by mortal Now, to expose the absurdity of the pretension that-therc is a right to secede, let me press this awument a little further
The Constitution has becn-förmed; it has been made perfect, or, in other words, means havc been provided by which it can be made perfect
It was intended to be pcr- petual
In reference to the execution of the laws under •it, what do we find
As early as 1795, Congress law, taxing distilleries throughou:t the .:country, *lid, what were called the' whisky boys of- Pennsylvania, resisted the law
"The Government wanted means
It taxed distilleries
The people of Pennsylvania resisted it
What is the difference between a portion of the people resisting a constitutional law, and all of the' people of a State doing so
eat because you can apply the term coercion in Æ)ne cusc to a State, and in the other call it simply the execu- tion of the law against individuals, you say there is a great distinction! We do not assume
the power to coerce a State, but we assume that Con- gress has power to lay and collect taxes, and gress has the right to enforce that
law when ob- structions and impediments are opposed to its enforcement
The people of Pennsylvania did object; they did resist and oppose the *egal au- thorities of the country
YVas that law enforced 
Was it called coercion at that day to enforce it
Suppose -all the •people of the State of' Pennsyl- vania had resisted: •would not the law have ap- plied -with just
the same force, and would it not have been just as constitutional to execute it againsts all the people of the State, as it was to execute it upon a part of their citizens

Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
we see that in that instance President Washington thought there was power in this Government to execute its laws
NM e see, too, that George Washington considered the militia the army of the Constitu- tion
We sec, too, George Washington re- fers to this Union as being inscparable
This is the way that the laws were executed by the Father c.)f his Country, the man who sat as pi•esidenl of the convention that Jnadc the Constitutior)
Here '.,vas resistance interposed—opposition to the exe- cutionof the laws; and George Washington, then President of the United States, went in person at the head of the rnilitia; and it showed his saga- city, his corrcct comprehension of men, and the effect that an immediate mov,mnent of that kind would have upon them
Ele ordered fifteen tbou- sand of his countrymen to thc scene of action, and went thc:rc in person, and stayed there till he was satisfied that t hc insa bordination was quelled
r_llhat is the 03anner in which George Washing- ton put down rcbcllion
'l"hat is the manner which he executed the laws
Here, then, we find General Washington oxe- cuting the law, in 1795, against a portion of the citizens of Pennsylvania who rebelled; and, I re- peat the question, where is the difference between cxecuting the law upon a part and upon the whole
Suppose the wholc of Pennsylvania had rebelled and resisted the excise law; had refused to pay taxes on distilleries: was it not as compe- tent and as constitutional for General Washing- ton to have executed the law the whole as against a part
Is there any difference
Gov- ermnental affairs illust be practical as well as our own dmnestic affairs
You Ilia y make nice meta- physical distinctions bctwcen the practical oper- at.ions of Government and its theory; you may refine upon what is a State, and point outa differ- ence between a State and a F)ortion of a Stoate; but what is it l.vhen you reduce it to practical opera- tion, and square it by common sense 
resistance was interposed to laws of the United States in another Slate
An ordinance was passed by South Carolina, assuminE to act as a sovereign State, to nullify a law of' the United States
in 1833, the distinguished man who filled the executive chair, who now lies in his silent grave, loved and respected for his virtue, his honor, his integrity, his patriotism, his undoubted cour- and his devotion to his kind, with an eye single to thc promotion of his country's best in- terests, issued the proclamation extracts from which I have already presented
He was sworn to support the Constitution, and to see t klat the laws were faithfully executed: and ho fulfilled the obligatior)
He took all the steps necessary to secure bhe execution of the law, and he would have executed it by the povv•el' of the Government if the point of time had arrived when it x,vas ne- cessat•y to resort to power
can see that he acted upon princ_u-nes to those acted upon by General He took the precau- tion of ordering a force there sufficient for the, pur- pose of enabling him to say effectually to the rebel- lious, and those who were interposing opposition to .thc execution of the laws: "The laws which we madc according to the Constitution, the laws that provide for the collection of the revenue to sustain this Government, must be enforced, the revenue must be collected
It iS a part of the compact; it is• part of the engagement vou have undertaken to perform,- and yoa of your own
will have no power
or authority to it aside." The duties were collected; the law M•'as enforced; and the Government went -on
proclamation, he made a powerful appeal
told them what would be done; and it would have been done, as certain as God rules on high, if the time had arrived which made it -necessary
Then we see where General Washington stood , and where General Jackson stood
Now, how does tbe present case stand
The time has come when men should speak out
Duties are mine; consequences are God 's
1 intend to discharge my duty, and intend to avow my understanding of the Constitution and the laws of the country
Have we no authority or power to execute, the laws in the State of South Carolina as well as in Vermont and Pennsylvania
I think vvpe have
As I before said, although a State may, by an ordinance, or by a resolve, or by an act of any other kind, declare that they absolve their citizens from all allegiance to this Government., it does not release i.hem from the compact
The com- pact is reciprocal; and they, in coming into it, undertook to perform certain duties and abide by the laws made in conförmity with the compact
Now, sir, what is the Government to do in Sol-Illi Cut-olina 
If South Carolina undertake to drive the Federal courts out of that State, yet tbc Fed- cral Government has the right to hold those courts there
She may attempt to exclude the mails, yet the Federal Government has the right to establish post offices and post roads and to carry the mails there
She may
resist the collec- tion of revenue at Charleston, 01' any other point that the Government has provided its collec- tion; but the Government has the right to co}lcct it and to enforce the law
She may undertake to take possession of the property belongino• to the Government which was originally ceded by the State, but the Federal Go verntnent has the rifflit to provide the rueans for retaining posses- Sion of that property
If she makes an advance either to d ispossess the Govern noent
of that which it has purchased, or to resist the execution of the revenue laws, 01' of our judicial system, or the carrying of the mails, or thc exercise of any other power conferred on the Federal Government, she puts herself in the wrono•, and u will be the duly of the Government to see that the lat.vs are faith- fully executed
By reference to the records, it will be seen that, on December 19, 1805
South Carolina granted all the right, , and clann of the State to all the lands reserved for Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan's Island, not exceeding five acres, with all the forts, törtifications, &e., thereon ; éanal, Ec
; the high lands, and part of the nrarsb, belongin«r to Fort Johnson, not exceeding twenty acres; the hui(l on which Fcn•t Pinckney is built, and three acres around it; a portion of the sandbank on the southeastern:nost point Charleston, not exceeding two acres ; not exceedin" ibur acres for a battery, or fort, &c., on Blythe's Point, at the mouth of Sampit river; Mustard Island, in BeautOrt river opposite Parris's Island ; not exceeding seven acres of land on St
Helena Island, for a principal fort; the whole on condition that the United States should, within thrcc years, repair forts, &c.; the United States to cotnpensate indi- viduals for property; the lands, &c., to bé free ironl taxes to the State." I-lere is a clear deed of cession
The Federal Government has complicd with all the conditions, and has, in its own right, the land on which these forts are constructed
- 'i'he conditions of the ces- Sion have been complied with; and the Govern- ment has had possession from that period to the present time
There are its forts; there is its arsenal; there are its dock-yards; there is the properly of the Governtnent; and now, under the Constitution, and under the laws made in pursu- ance thereof, bas South Carolina the authority and the tight to expel tho Fedpral uovernn•ent from its own property that has been o•iven to it i by her own act, ana of which It is now session
By resisting toe execution of the by attemptiY)g• to dispossess the Federal Govern- nnent., does she not put herself Does she not violate the laws of the United 
Does she not
violat.e the Constitution
not put herself, wit.hin the n"ieaning and purview of the Constitution, in the attitude of levying war  1860

What is it, then, I ask in the name of thc Constituti01'b in the meaninty of the term as there defined
It is treason, and nothing but treason; and if one State, upon its own volition, can go out of this Confederacy with- out regard to the effect it is to have
upon the remainino• parties to the compact, what is your Government ',vorth
what will it come to
and in what will it end
It is no Government at all such a construction
But it is declared and assumed that, if a State secedes, she is no longer a Inembm• of thc Union, and that, therefore, the laws and thc Constitution of the United States are no operative within her limits, and sho iR not guiilty if she violates them
This isa matter of opinion
I have tried to show, ft•orn the origin of the, Government down to the present time, what this doctrine of secession is, and there is but one concurring and unerrinccon- clusion reached by all the great and distinguished men of the country
Madison, who is called the Father of the Constitution, denies the doctrine
Senate, let me ask the country, if they dare per, mit it
Under and in compliance with the great lawp ofself-preservation, we dare not let her do it; and if she were a sovereign Power to-day, out- side of the Confederacy, and was formin«r an alli- ance that we deemed inimical to our institutions, and the existence of our Government, we should have a right to conquer and hold her as a province —a term which is so much used with scorn
Mr
President, I have referred to the manner in which this Government was formed
have re- ferred to the provision of the which provides for the admission of new States
Now, I lot me ask, can any one believe that, in the crea- tiou of this Government, its founders intended that it should have the power to acquire territory and form it into States, and then permit them to go out of the Union
Let us take a case
How fong has it been since your armies were in Mex- ico
How long has it been since your brave men were exposed to the diseases, the privations, the sufferings, which are incident to a
campaign of that kind
How long has it been since they were bearing your eagles in a foreign land, many of them falling at the point of the bayonet, consigned to their long, narrow home, with no winding-shcet but their blankets saturated with their blood 
How many victories did they win
how many laurels did they acquire
how many trophies did they bring back
T lie country is full of thcm
MT hat did it cost you
One hundred and twenty million dollars
What did you pay for the coun- try you acquired, besides

Peace was made; territory was acquired; and, in a few years, from that territory California erected herself into free and indcpendent States and, under the provisions of the Constitution, we admitted her as a member of this Confederacy
Washington, who was the Father of his Country, I After having expended $120,000,000 in the war; after having lost naany of our bravest and most denies tho doctrine
Jefferson, Jackson, Clay, and Webster, all deny the doctrine; and yet all gallant men; after having paid to Mex- at once it is discovered and ascertained that a i icoforthe territory,' and admiucd it into the Union as a State, now that the people of California have S!at.e, of its.own volition
can go out of this Con- federacy, without regard to consequences, without got into the Coniu.lcracy and can stand alone, regard 10 the injury and woe that may be inflicted according to this modern doctrine, your Govern- ment was just made to let them in, and then to let on the remaining members from the act! Suppose this doctrine to be true, Mr
President, that a State can withdraw frorn this Confederacy; aud suppose South Carolina has seceded, and is i.n what an attitude now out of the Confederacy: does she place herself
There might
be circum- stances under which the States ratifying the com- pact might tolerate the secession ot• a State, she But there taking the consequences of the act
might be ot.her circumstances under which the States could not allow one to secede
Why do i say so

Is it not absurd to say that., now that Califtn•nia is in, she, on her own volition—without regai•d to the consideration paid for her; without regard to thc policy which dictated her acquisition the United Slates—can walk out and bid you defiance
Is it not an absurdity, if you take the reason and object of Government 
But we need not stop here; let us go to Texas
Texas was engaged in a revolution with M.exico
She succeeded in tbc assertion and establishment of hcr ilidcpcndence•, and she became a sovereign and independent Power outside of this Union
She applied for admission, and she was admitted into this family of States
After she was in, she was oppressed by the debts of her war which istence of the remaining States might he involved
Then, without regard to the Constitution, dare the i resuitcd in her separation from Mexico; she •wras other States permit one to secede when it endan- harassed by the Indians her border; and in gers and involves ail the remaining States

that is a matter to be determined whcn it comes up
It is a question which must be left open to be determined by t.he surrounding circumstances, when the occasion ariscs
But conceding, for argument's sake, the doc- trine of secession, and admitting that the State of South Carolina is now upon your coast, a for- Pos.ver, absolved from all connection with the Federal Government, out of the Union: what then
There was a doctrine inculcated in 1823, bv Mr
Monroe, that this Government, keeping in view the safety of the people and the existence of our institutions, would permit no European Power to plant any more colonies on this conti- I nent
Now, suppose that South Carolina is out- side of the Confederacy, and this Government is in posso.ssion of the fact that she is formin(T an cl\iance with a foreign Power—with France, with England, with Russia, with Austria, or with all lyzed, lifeless
The Federal Government came along asa kind physician , saying, " We will take this dead limb from your body, and vitalize it, by giving protection to the people, and incorpo- rating it into a territorial government:- and in ad- dition to that, we will give you $10,000,000, and you may retain your own public lands;" and the other States were taxed in common to pay the $10,000,000
Now, after all this is done, 'Ilexas, forsooth, upon her own volition, is to say, "l will walk out of 'this Union Were there no other parties to that compact
We are told the compact
is reciprocal
Did ••.ve take in California, did take in Texas, just to benefit them
No; but to add to this great family Of States; and it is apparent, from the fact of their comin«y in, that the cornpact is reciprocal ; and having entered into the compact, they have no right to withdraw without the conscnt of tbc remaining States
Again: take the case of Louisiana
What did of 'Lho principal Powers of Europe; 'hat there is to be a great naval station established there; an we pay for hm• in 1803, and for what was she rcndezvous for their army, with a view wanted

It remunedin
a territorial condition for a while,.suståinQd •and protected by the strong arm of the Fedefal Go•VY erment
We acquired' the territory and the :nåvi; gätion of the river; and the money the benefit of all the States, and not of Louisia-nw exclusively
And now that; this -great v,ålley is filled up; now that the navigation (if' the.- Missis-, sippi is one hundred times more important than it was then; now, after the United States have paid the money, haOe acquired the title to Louisiana, and haoe iocorpora_ted her into thc Confederacy, it is proposed .that she shall go Out of the Union,! In 1815, when her shores were invaded;mwhen her city was about- to be sacked; when her booty and her beauty were about to fall a prey to British aggression, the brave men of Tennessee, and -of Kentucky, and o
the surrounding States, rushed into her borders and upon her shores, and -under the lead of their own gallant JackSon, drove the invading forces away
And now, after all this; aftOr the money has been paid; after the free nav- icration of the river has been.obtained—not form the benefit of Louisiana alone, but for her in common with all the Stales—Louisiana says to the olher States, 6' We will go out of this Confederacy; we do not cute if you did fwbt our battles; we do not care you did acquire the free navigation of- this river frorn France; we will go out if think proper, and constitute ourselves an independent Power, and bid defiance to the other States." It
is an absurdity; it is illogi- cap, it is not deducible from thestyucture ofdie Governmcnt itself
Mr
SLl DELL
Will
the Senator permit me to make a single rema*k-
Mr
JOHNSONÄ, The Spnator knows how I wåö intcfrnpted.yeslerday
Mr
SLIDELL, 1 wish to say to the Senator that I donot know a citizen of any south- western State bordering on the Mississippi who does not acknowledge the propriety and necessity of extending to every citizen of the country whose streams flow into the Mississippi the free navi- Ration of the river and the free interchange of Of the agricultural products of tbe valley of the Mississippi
Such a course is dictated
not only by every consideration of justice, but by the rec- o ized and well-understood interests of the south- western States
On this point, I can speak with entire confidence of the sentiment of Louisiana
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
That may all be very true; and I do not suppose that, at this moment, there is a citizen in the State of Louisi- ana who would think of obstructing the free nav- igation of the river; but are not nations_controlled by their interests in varying circumstances
-It strikes mg so; and hereafter, when a conflict of interest arises; when diffculty may rspring_ up between two separate Powers, Louisiana, having the control of the mouth of Lhe river, might feel disposed to tax our citizens going down there
It is a power that i am not willing to concede to be exercised at the discretion of any authority outside of this Government
The Senator's as- surance does not amount to anything
It depends entirely on the interest and condition
of the sur- rounding country as to what power Louisiana would want to exercise in reference to that river
So sensitive have been the people of my State upon the free navigation of that river,xthat as far back as 1796, now sixty-four years agos in their bill of rights, beforc they passed under the juris- diction of the United States, they declared: That an equal participation of the free navigation of the Mississippi is one of thc inherent rights of tbe citizens of' this State : it cannot, therefore, he conceded to any prince, potentate, Power, person, or persons whatever." This shows the estimate that the people fixed on this stream sixty-four years acro; and novyr we are told, if Louisiana does go out, it is her intention at this time to tax the people above
Who can tell what may be thc ii)tenti01) of Lou- rights of our citizens, arn we willi_ng to- place the travel and commerce of our citizens, at the dis- crucy
Just for the benefit of that particular 'i to ulterior objects, with u view of making ad- vanccs upon the restof these States: let me ask the locality

What did the United" States thihl' about having adjacent terri- tory outside of then: jurisdiction
.Let us turn to the güthorities, and see what proposition they iver6 willing to act upon
I find, in the statutes of the United States, this joint resolution: Taking into view thc peculiar situation of Spain, and of her- American provinces, and considering the influence which the destiny o
the territory adjoining thc southern border of the United States may have upon their security, tranquillity, and cotnmerce.• 'I'hcrefore, ' 'Resoåved by the Senate aud House of Representatives qf thc United States of wamerica in Congress a»emblcd, 'I'hat tbc United States;under the peculiar circumstances ot' the existing crisis, cannot, without serious inquietude, see any part of the said territory pass into the hands of any foreign I'dwcr; and that a due regard to safety compels thenl to provide, undcr certain contingencies, for thc tem- porary occupation of the said -territory
They, at the saine tinie, declare that the said territory shall, in thcir hands, remain subject to (uture negotiation." What principle is "t forth there
Florida was in the posscssion 'of Spain.
English spies were harbored -in het territory
Spain was inimical to the United States; and In view of thc grcat prin- ciplc of self-preservation, the Congress of the Unitcd States passed a resolution declaring that if Spain attempted to transfer Florida into the hands of any other Power, the United States would ta kc possession of' it
Yet Congress were m•acious and condesccrlding enough to say that it Bhould remain open to future negotiation
r i'hat is to say, Hereafter, if we can mako a negotiation that will suit us, we will make it; if we do not, we will keep the territory;" that is all
"l'here was the territory lying upon our border, outside of the jurisdiction of the United Statcs; and we declared, by ah act of Congress, that no foreign Power should possess it
MT e wen tstill further and appropriated $100,000, authorized the President to enter and take of it with the means placed in his lands.- Afterwards, wo did nccotiatc with Spain, tind gave for • the rerritory; and we established territorial government for it
What Jlext
We undertook to drive out the Seminole IndianS,and we had a war in which this Govern- ment lost more than it lost in all the other wars it was engaged in; and we paid the sum of to get the Seminoles out of the swamps, so that the Territory could he inhabited by white men
We paid for it, we took posses- Sion of it; and I remember, when I was in the other House, and Florida was knocking at the door for admission, how extremely anxious her then able Delegate w'as to be adrnitted
Hc now sits before me, [Mr
YULEE
1 I remember how important he thought it was then to come under the protecting wing of the United Statcs as of the stars of our Confederacy
But now tho 'l'erritory is paid for, England is driven out, $25,000,000 have bcen expended; und they watu longer the protection of this G-ovcrnment, but will go out without consulting the other States, withoutreference to lhe effect upon the remaining parties to the compact
Where will she go
Will she attach herself to Spain again
Will' she pass back- under the jurisdiction of the Seminoles
After having been nurtured and protected and fostered hy ail these States, now, without regard to them, is she to be allowed, at her own volition to withdraw from the Union
I say she has no constitutional right to do it; and when she does it, , it is an act of If she succeeds, it will only be a
succcssful revolution
If' she docs not succeed, she -must take the penalties and terrors of thc lav.,r
What is-Kansas now
Is she a Statc„or-is She, Territory
Does she revert back to her terri- torial condition of pupilage
Or, having been a State; and having applied tot' admission and been refused, is she standing out a State
You hold her as a territory; you hold her as a province
You prescribe the mode of e}écting the members of her Legislature; and pay them out of your own Treas- ury

Y.es, she is a province controlled by Fed- eral authority, and hot' laws arc made in conform• Is she not Tcr- ity With the acts of Congress
ritory
I think she is
Suppose the State of California withdraws from the Union
We admitted her
She was territory acquired by the United States, by our blood and our treasure
Now, suppose she withdraws from the Confederacy: does she pass back into a terri- torial condition, remain a dependency upon the Federal Government, or does shc stand out as a separate government
Let me tnkc Louisiana, for which we paid $15,000,000
That was a Ter- ritory for a number of years—yes, a province
It is only another name fora province
It is a pos- session held under the jurisdiction of the Unitcd States
W c admitted Louisiana into thc Union as a State
Supposc wc had refused to admit her: would she not sf.i]l have remained a Territory 
Would she not have remai»cd under the protec- tion of the United States
But now, if shc has the power to •writhdraw from the Union, does she not pass back into the condition in which shc was before wo admitted her into the Union
In what condition does she place herself
When thosc States which were at first Territories cease their connection with this Government, do they pass back into thc territorial condition 
When Florida is out, when Louisiana is going out, and these other States that wcrc originally Territorics go out of thc Union, in what condition do they place tltemselves
Are they Territories or States
Are they merely on probation to members this Confederacy, or are they States outside of the Confederacy 
Mr

Will the Senator allow me to ask a bingle question in this conticction 
Mr

I hope the Senator will not interrupt me
I do not refuse out of any discourtesy
Mr
WIGFALL
Let him alone
Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
Remarks of that kind never affect mc in tl'20 slightest degrcc•, ncvcr hear them
But; Mr
Prc.sident, I havc re- ferred to the acts of Congress for acquiring Florida as setting forth a principle
Let me read another of those acts: An act to enable the President of the Unit.ed States, t.tndcr certain contingencies, to take possession of' t.he countxv lying east of tuc river l'erdido, and south of the Statc df Georgia and the Mississippi 'l'en•itory, and Cor other pur- poses
Be it enacted b.} tic Senatc and Ilouse o.f -Representatives of the Uhit.cd Statis of d
mcrica in Con gress assetnh'ed., ' Phat tbc President of t.he United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to take possession of aud occupy all or any part of the territory lying east of the river I'c.rdido, and south of the Stutc of Georgia and the hlississippi 'I'erritory

thereof by any törcign Govern- ment; and he Inay, lör tllC purr)ose of taking possession and occupyin!Å the territory atörcsaid, in order t.o Inaintain therein the authority of t.he United States, ornploy any part of' the Artn.v and Navy of the United Statcs which hc lilay deern necessary." What is the principle avowed here 
That from the geographical relations of this territory to the United States, from its importance to the safety and security of the institutions ofthc Uni ted States, wc authorized the President to expend $100,000 to get a foothold there, and especially to take pos- of it
if it wore likely to pass to any foreiTn Power
W c sec thc doctrine, and principle there established and acted upon by out G-ovcrnmcnt
This was again avowed by distinguished Inen at Ostend
A paper v.ras drawn up there by Mr
Buchanan, Soulé of Louisiana, and Mr
Mason of Virginia, our ministers to the three , there is another question that sugcrests itself in this connection
Kansas, dm•ing last principal in Europe
They met at Ostend I and drew up a paper in which they laid down Congress, applicd för admission into this Union
She assumed to be a State, and thc difficulty in the wav xvas a provision in her constitution, and the manner of its adoption
We did not let Kan- sas in
We did not question her being a State; but on account of the xnanner of forming hct• con- stitution and its provisions, we kept Kansas out
certain doctrines in strict conformity with the apt of Congress that I have just read
They say in that paper, signed by James Buchanan, J
Y
Mason, and Pierre Soulö: Then, _t
It inust be clear to r•vcrv reflecting Inind, that, froni the peculiarity of its geozraphteal position, and the considerations attendant on it, Cuba is as necessary to I tbc North American Republic as any o
its present rnem- bet'S, and that it belongs, naturally, to that great family of States of *'bich the Union is the providential ntu•sery

ten years amounts to more than that ofthe entire Union at the t.imc Louisiana- was annexed to it
The natural and- inain outiet to the products of this entire population, the highway of their dircct intercourse with the Atlantic and Pacific States, can never be secure, but must ever bc endangered while Cuba is a d'.•pendency of a distant
Power in whose possession it has proved to be a source of constant annoyance and embarrassrnent to their interests." The system of immigration and labor lately organized within its limits, and tbc tyranny and oppression which characterize its immediate rulers, threaten an insurrection at any moment which may result in direful consequences to the American people
Cuba has thus become to us an unceasing danger, and a permanent cause of anxiety and alarm." •k •k Self-preservation is the first law of nature, with-States as wcll as with individuals
All nations have, at periods, acted upon this maxim
Although it has been bcen made thc pretext for committing flagrant injustice, as in the partition of Poland, and other similar cases which history records, yet the principle itself, though often abused, Our has a! ways recotrnizcd
past histor•.' forbids that we should acquire the Island of Cuba without the consent of Spain, unless justified by the great law or seliZpreserva1ion
We- must, in any event, preserve our own conscious rectitude, and our own sclf- respect
Mark you, we are never to acquire Cuba unless it is necessary to our self-preservation: While pursuing this eourse we can afford to disregard thc censures of thc world, to which we, have becn so often and so unjustly exposed
After shalt have offered Spain a price for Cuba far beyond its present value, and this shall lit,ve been refuged, it witl then bc titne to consider the quest.ion does C-nba, in the possession of Spain, seriously endanger our internal peace and the existence of our cherished Union 
Should this question be answered in tbc affirmative, thr.n, by every law, and divine, we shall be justified in-wresting it frorn Spa in if we possess the power ; and this upon very principle that .woul(l justdt'y an individ- in trariu•-' down thc burning housc of his nciahbor

I am for all of it
" such we ought neither to count the cost nor regard tho odds x.vhieh Spain might enlist

'-' -w c find in this document, signed by our three ministers, and approved by the American people, the doctrine laid down clearly that if the Un States believed that, Cuba was to be transferred by Spain to England or to France, or to other Power inhnicai to thc United States, tho safety of the A merican pcoplc, tbc sate of institutions, the ex.ist,cnce of tbc Governmen t

does this carry us
we find that doctrine was not only laid down, but practiced, in the casc of Florida
Suppose Louisiai'K1 was now out of the Confederacy, holding the key to the Gulf, the outlet to the commerce of the great West: under the doctrine laid down by those niinisters, and practiced by the Conaress of the United States, would not •this Govern nwnt have the right, in obedience to the great principle of self-preservation, and for the safety of our insti- t.ut.ions, to seize it and pass it under the jurisdic- tion of thc United States, and hold it asa province subject to the laws of the United States
I say it would
The same prmciple applied to Flor- ida
The same principle would apply to South Carolina
1 regret that she occupies the position that shc has assumed, but I accruing a prin- ciple, and do not refer to her out of any disrespect
If South Carolina were outsidc of the Confeder- acy, an independent Power, no connection with the United States, and our institutions were likely to be endangered, and thc existence of the Government imperiled by her remaininff a sepa- rate
and independent Power, or by her forming associations and alliances with some foreign Power that would injure our free institutions, [ sav we should havc a right, on the principle laid down by Mr
Mason, MI'
Buchanan, and Mr
Soule,  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
and upon the principle practiced by thc Congress of the United States in the case of Florida, to seize her, pass her under the jurisdiction of the United States, and hold her as a province
Mr
President, I have spoken of the possibility ofa Statc standing in the position of South Car- olina making alliances with u foreign Power
What do we see nom.v
Ex-Governor Manning, of that State, in a speech made not long since at Columbia, made these declarations: Cotton is king, and would enable us in peace to rule the nations of the world, or successfulivto encounter then) 'I'he "lillions in Francc and bngland engaged in in war, its rnanufacture, are an cffectual guarantee of the friendship If necessary, their armies would stand to guard its uninterrupted and peaceful cultivation, and thear men-of-war would line our coasts to guard it in its transit from our ports." Ali! are we prepared, in the face of doctrines like these, to permit a State that has been a mem- ber of our Confederacy to go out, and erect her- self into an independent Power, when she points to the time when she will become a dependent of Great Britain, or when she will want the pro- tect.ion of France
What is the doctrine laid down by Mr
Buchanan and Mr
Mason and Mr
Soulé
If Cuba is to pass into the hands of an unfriendly Power, or any Power inimical to the United States, we have a right to seize and to hold her
Whct•e is the difference between the two cases
If South Carolina is outside of t.he Confederacy as an independent Power, disconncctcd from this Government, and we find her forming alliances to protect her, I ask what becomes of that great prin- cipte, the law of self-preservation
Docs it not apply with equal force
We are told, upon pretty high authority, that Great Britain is operating in the United States; that she is exerting a power- i find that, in a paper issued from ful influence
thc executive offce, Little Rock, Arkansas, and addressed to the militia of the State of Arkansas, the- following language is used: It
is my opinion, that thc sctt,lcd aud secret policy of the British Governnjent is to disturb thc dotucstic tranquil- lity ot• the United States; that its object is to break up and destroy our Gover•unent, øet_ rid of a powerful rival, extend t.hc arca of t.he British dmninions on this Continent, and bccoxne the chief and controlling Power in America." will not read it all
He, gives many reasons why it is so
He says: I l)elievc that such a conspiracy e.xists against our Ped- era! Govcrnrnent, and that, if all tbc secret facts and trans- and the names of the secret actions connected iViti1 it, British Govertnnent, distrib- agent* and enlissaries of the uted throughout the United States, could be ascertained, well authenticated, and lnade public, the patriotic people of the United States would be fille(l with astonishment; and having discovered the reat author and instigator of Inischief', all discord between the States and the slave
States would at once be allayed, it' not entirely cease, and that tl)Cn they would becotne fraternally and more firmly united ; and that Ibe united indignation of the patriotic citizens of the "'holo Union atrainst the British Govern,- ment and agents aud emissaries would be so great that war would be ücclared against the British Governn:ciil in less than twehvc The Governor of the Saxte of Arkansas says, all the secret workings of Great Britain in this country could be ascertained, war would be declared in less than twelve months against the Government af Great Britain
What further does Entertaining these opinions, I deem it Iny duty to the people of the State, of zirkansas, to warn them to go tro work in
carnest and n•akc permanent and thorough preparations, so
that they nnay at all tilncs be ready to protect themseivcs and our State acrainst evils which I believe the British Government intellds shall not be temporary and trifling, irrepressible' and terri- but continuous and agrrravated, .Tllis is signed by " Elias N
Conway, Governor of the Staie of Arkansas, and commander-in- chief of the army of said State, and of thc militia But ox-Governor Manning, of South thereof
" Carolina,.declares that, cotton is king, and that the armies of Great Britain, and the fleets of France, and their mon of wa r, would protect them ; the one in the peaceful production of cotton, and the otvlier in its exportation to the ports of the world
What sort of times are we fal\ing• on
Whcrc arc going
A these the threats that we are to be met with
Is the United States to bc told by one of thc States attempting to ahsolve itself fronl its allegi- ance, wit!lout authority, and in fact in violation of (he Constitution of the United States, that heino disconnected with thc Confederacy, it will itself upon our coast to form an alliance with Franco and with Ene•land, which will proteCt her morc securely than thc protection which she now recewcs from the United States
The question recurs, have we not an existence, have we not institutions, to preserve; and in compliance ',vith the great law of self-preservation, can we permit one of these States to take the protection of afor- eign Power that is inimical and dangerous to the peaceful relations of this Government
Can We do it
I do not believe that we can
I repeat, for fear it may be misunderstood, that there are cer- tain circumstances and conditions under which the remaining States, parties to the compact, might tolerate the secession of one State; and there are other circumstances and
other conditions under which they dare not do it, in view of the I great principle of self-preservation of which I have been speaking
When any State takes such an atti- tude what will be our course of policy
The case must be determined by the existing circumstances at the time
But it is expected and said by some that South Carolina, in making this movement, intends to carry the other States alonc with her; that they will be drawn into it
Now, iar
President, is that the way for one sister, for one rebellious State, to talk to others ! Is that the language in which they should be addressed
I ask my friend from Cal- ifornia to read an extract from the message of Governor Gist, of South Carolina
1-10 will do me favor by so doing; and then we shall see
the basis upon which we stand, and the attitude in which we are to bc placed
Not only is South Carolina to go out of the Union in violation of the Constitution, impeding and resisting the exccu- tion of the laws, but the other States are t.o be dragged along with her, and we are all to be in- volved in one common ruin
Mr
LATHAM read the following extract from the mcssage of Governor Gist to the Legislature of South Carolina: The introduction of slaves from other States which may not become members of the southern confederacy, aud par- ticularly thc border States, should be prohibited by legisla- tivc enactment; and by Ibis means they will be brought to see that their safety depends upon a withdrawal from their enen)ies and an union with their friends and natural allies
If they should continue their union with thc non-slavc- holding States, let then) keep their slave property in their own borders, and the only alternative left them will be enmn- cipation by thcir own act, or by the action of their own conftderates
We cannotcongentto relieve them from their embarrassing situation by permitting them to realizc •the money value for their slaves by selling thcm to us, an(l thus prepare them, without any Ross of property, to acco:nmo- But should date thetnselves to the northern free-soil idea
they unite their destiny with us, and becmne stars in the southern galaxy—menibers of a great southern confédera- lion—we will reccive them with open arms and an enthu- siastic greeting." All hope, therefore, of concerted action by a southern convention being lost, there is but one course left for South Carolina to pursue consistent with her honor, interest, and and that is, to look neither to the right or the left, but go straight forward to the consumination of her pur- It is too late to receive propositions tor a con- t•erence; and the State would bc wanting in self-respect, after having deliberately decided on her own course, to en- tertail) anv proposition looking to a continuance of the pres cnt Union

JOHNSON, of Tennessee
will read an cxtract from the speech of Mr
KEITT, of South Carolina, it will show the determination and policy to be pursued
It is done with all respect to him; for hc is a man upon whorn I look as a perfect and entire gentleman, from all my acquaintance with him; but I merely want to quote from his speech to get at the policy they wish to pursue

Mr
greatly applaudc;t throughout his address." K 1,'.1TT Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
Mr
President, have referred-to .these extracts' to Æhow„tbe POI* icy intended to be pursued byöu.r,seceding.sist'er: What is the first threat thrown out
is •an cin- timidation to the bord er States al ludingespceiaily, 1 suppose, to Virginia, Missouri, They eonstitute the first .tiervof the border slave States
'Phe next tieB w0ülcF be North
Carolina and Tennessee and Arkansas* W c in the South have complained of and cons demned the position assumed by the 'Abolition' ists
•We have complained that their intentiotl was to hem slavery in, so that, Aike the: scorpion when surrounded by fire, if it did not die-from the intense heat of the scorching flames, it would perish in its own poisonous skin
Now, ter, without consulting her sisters, without caring for their interest or their consent, says that she will move forward; that she will destroy the Gov- crnment under which we
have lived, and that hereafter, when she forms a Government or a Constitution, unless the border States come in, she will pass laws prohibiting the importation of slaves into her State from those Stat_es,and thereby obstruct the slave trade among the States, and thros.v the institution back upon the border States; so that they w_ill bc compelled to emancipate their slaves upon the principle laid down by the Abe olition party
That is the rod held over us! I tell our sisters in the South that so far as Ten- nessec is concerned, she will not be dragged into a southern or any other confederacy until she has had time to consider; and then she will go when shc believes it to bc hcr interest, and not I tell our northern friends, who are re- before
sisting the execution of the laws made in con- formity with the Constitution, that we will* not be driven
on the other hand into their confed- acy, and we will not go into it unless it suits us, and they give us such guarantees as we deem right and proper
We say to you of the South, we are not to be frightened
and coerced
Oh, when onc talks about coergingn State, how mad- dening and insulting to the State; but when you want to bring the other States to terms, how easy to point out a means by which to coerce them ! But, sir, we do not intend t.o be
coerced
We arc told that certain States will go out and tear this accursed Const.itution into fragments, and drag the pillars of this mighty edifice down upon us, and Involve us all in one common ruin
Will the border States submit to such a threat
No
If they do not come into the movement, the pillars of this stupendous fabric of human free- dom and greatness and goodness are to be pulled down, and all will be involved in one common ruin
Such is the threatening langua«e -used
You shall come into our confederacy, or we will coerce you to the emancipation of your slaves." That is the language which is held toward us
There are many ideas afloat about this threat- ened dissolution, and it is time to speak out
The question arises in reference to the protection and preservation of the institution of slavery, whether dissolution is a remedy or will give to it protection - I avow hcre, to-day, that if I were an Abolitioi)- ist, and wanted to the overthrow- and abolition of the institution ofslavery in the south- ern States, the first step that I would take would be to break the bonds of this Union, and dissolve
I believe the continuance of this Government
slavery depends upon the preservation of this Union, and a compliance with all the guarantees I believe an interference of the Constitution
with it will brcak up the Union; and I believe a dissolution of the Union will, in the end, though it may be some time to come, overthrow the in- stituuon of slavery
Hence we find so many in the North who desire the dissolution of these States as the most certain and direct and effectual means of overthrowing the institution of slavery
What protection would it bc to us to dissolve this Union
What protection would it be to us to convert this nation into two hostilc Powers, the one warring with the other
Whose property is at stake
Whose interest is endangered
Is it not the property of the border States
Suppose Canada were moved down upon our border, and the two separated sections, then diflü•ent nations, were hostile: what would tbc institution of slavery be worth on the border
Every man• who has common sense will see that the takc up its march and certainly and as unerringly as general laws can opcrute
would commence to rctrcat -the very moment this  CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December- 19, Government Avas convcrted into-hostile Powers, andi you made the line between the slaveholdin• and States the line of division
Then, what remedy do we get for the institution Must we keep up a standing army 
Must we kccp •:upTorts bristling with arms along the whole border
-This 'is a question to be con- sidei•ed, one that involves the future; and no step ghouldÄBe'
taken- Without matåre reflection
Be: fore this Uniori is dissolved and broken np, we in Tennessee, as one oCthe stave States, want to bc consulted ; -lwe want to know .what protection we are to •have; whether we are simply to be made outpösts and- guards -to ,proteet, the property of others, at the same time that we sacrifice and lose our own
We want to this question
Again: if there is one division of' the States, will there not be more than one
I heard a Sen- atot say the other day that he would rather see this Government separated into th irty-tln•ee frac- tionnl parts than to see it consolidated; but when you once begin to divide, when the first division made, who can tell when the next will be made 
When these States are all turned looseb and a dif- ferent condition of things is presented, with com- plex and abstruse interests to be qnnsidered arid weighed and understood, •what combinations may I am opposed to the take place no onc can tell
consolidation of Goverrn-ncnt, and I am as much for the reserved rights of States as any one; but, ra.ther than sec this Union divided into thirty- three petty Governments, with a little prince in one, a potentate in auother, a little aristocracy in a third, a iittle democracy in a fourth, and a rc- public
-somewhere else; a citizen not being able to pass from xjne Statc to anotht,'i• without a pass- port or from his Government; wit.h quarreling and warring amon«st thc little petty Powers, which would r7sult in anarchy", I would rather see this Government to-day—I proclaim it herc in my place—convert.ed into a consolidated Government
It would be better tho A can people 3t would be better for our kind; it would bc better for humanity; better fbr Chris- tianity; bettor for all that tends to elevate and pn- noblc tnan, than breaking up this this magnificent, this stupendous fabric of human government, the most perfect that the world ever saw, and which has succeeded thus far without a parallel in the history-of the world
When you come to break up und turn loose the diiherent elements, there is no telling what com- binations may take place in the future
It may occur, for instance, to the middle States that
they will not get so good a Government by going a little further south as by remaining where we arc
It, may occur to North Carolina, to Tennessee, to Kentucky , to Virginia, to Maryland , to Missou ri— and perhaps Illinois- might fall in, too—that, by erecting themselves into a central, independent „ disconnected either with the North or the South, they could stand as a peace-maker— could stand as a Treat breakwater, resisting the heated and sn rging waves of' the South, and fal')aticai abolitionism of the North
think that they could stand there and lift them- selves up above the extremes, with thc sin- cere- hope that the lime would arrive when the extremes would come together, and reunite once more, and wc could reconstruct this greatest and best Government the world I-las ever seen
Ot• it might so turn out, our institution of slavery beino- exposed upon the i')orthern line, that by lookil'1g to Pennsylvania, to- New York, and to son-w of the other States, instead of having then) as hos- tile Powers upon our frontiers, they might come to this central republic, and give us such consti- tutional guarantees, and such assurances that they would be executed, that it might be to our inter- est to form an alliance with them, and have apro- tection on our frontier
1 throw these outas considerations
There will be various projects and various combinations made
Memphis is now connected with Norfolk, in thc Old Dominion; Memphis is connected with Balti- more within two days
Herc is a coast that lets us out to the commerce, of the world
When Vere look around in the four States of Tennessee, Ken- tuck y, Virginia, and Maryland, there are Illings about which our memories, otu• attachments, and our associations lingcr with pride and with pleas- ure
Go down into the Old Dominion; there is the place where, in 1781, Cornwallis surrendered his sword •to the immortal Washington
In the bosom •of her soil ate deposited her greatest and best sons
Move along in -that trail, and there wpe find Jefferson and Madison and Monroe, and a long list of worthies
We come next to old North Carolina, my na- tive State, God bless bcr! She is my mot.her
Though she was not my cherishing mother, to use the language of the classics, she is the mother whom I love, ånd I cling to her with undying af- fectiön, as a son should cling to an affectionate rnother
We find Mecklen, who was associated with our early history, deposited in her soil
Go to King's Mountain, on her borders, and you there find place on which tlic battle was fought that turned- the tide of the Revolution
Yes, within her borders the signal battle was fought that turned the tidc which resulted in the surrender of Corn- wallis at Yorktown, in t'l'le Old Dominion
Tra vel on a little rtl-u-n•, and we get back to Ten- nessee
I shall be as modest as I can m reference to her, but she hag some associations that rnake her dear to the people of the United States
Tennessee we have our own illustrious Jackson
'There he sleeps—that Jackson W'ho issued his proclamation in 1833, arid saved this Government
We have our Polk and our Grundy, and a lonff list of others who are worthy of And who lie in Kentucky
Your Hardings, your Bnons, your Roancs, your Clays, are
amon«r the dead; your CRITTENDEN among the living
A ll are identified and associated with the history of the country
Maryland has her Carroll of "Carrollton, and a long list of worthies, who are embalmed in the hearts of the American people
And you are talking about breaking np this Republic, with this cluster of associations, these ties of affection, around you
May we i')0t expect that some means Inn y be devised by which they can be preserved tocycthet• 
Here, too, in the center of the Republic, is the seatofGovernment, which was founded by Wash

No, sir; will cherish these endearing associa tions with the hope, if this Rc:ljublic shall he, broken, t llat wc may speak words -of
peace and reconciliation to a distracted, a divided, rnay add, a maddened pooplQ
Angry waves may be lashed into fury on Lhc•one hand; on the' other .b]ustering winds may rage; but we stand immovable upon our basis, as on our own native mountains—present- ing their craggy btows, thcii• unexplored caverns, their surnmits " rock-ribbed and as ancient as the "—we stand peace, association, and sun concert, to a distracied Republic
Bat, Mr
President, will it not be well Ijcfore we break up this great Government, to inquire w bat kind of n governrnent this new govern tnent in t 110 South is to be, with which we are threatened unless we involve our destinies with this rash and precipitate movement
What intimation is there in refcrence to its character
Before m-y State and those States of which [ I-lave been speaking, go into southern or northern confederacy, ought they not to have some idea of the kind of gov- ernrnent that is to be forrned
What are the in- timat,ions in the South, in reference to the form- ation of a new• o•overnment
'I'he of sorne speakers is that they want a southern "ov- errunent oblit_erating all State lines—a government of consolidation
It is alarming and distressing to entertain the
proposition here
What ruin arid disaster would follow, if we are to have a consolidated governtnent here! But the idea is afloat and current in the South that a southern government is to be established, in the languacre of some of the speakers in the State of Georgia, " obliterating all State lines;" and is that the kind of entertainment to which the people are to bc invited
Is that the kind of govcrnment under which we are to pass; and are we to be forced to emancipate our slaves a i)less we go into it
An- other suggestion in refin•ence to a sou thorn '"overn- ment is, that we shall have a southern confederacy of great strength a nd power, with a constitutional provision preventing anv State from changinø its domestic institutions wiihot_lt the consent three fourths, or son-le :xreat nutnber to be fixed upon
1B that the kihd of government under which we want to pass
1 avow here, that so fat as [ am concerned, I will never enter, with my consent, any government, North or South, less can, less denjocratic, than the oroe under which We now live
Where are We drifting
What kind of breakers are ahead
Have we a glimpse through the i that -develops the rock on w l)ieh the vessel of State is df•iftincr
Should we not considor tureiy, in giving up this old what kind of government is to succeed it
Ooehr, we not to have time to think
At•e we not entitled to respect, and consideration
In one of' the iead- ino• GeorTia papers we find some queer suarY\ s- tions; arid, as the miners would say, these ni.ny be considered as merc surface-indications, that develop what is below
-we ought to know the kind of government that is to bc established
When we read the allusions made various papers, and by various speakers, we find that there is one party who arp willing to give up this form of government; to change its character; and, in fact, to pass under a monarchical fi)rm of gov- hope that uny fricn•d will read - the ernrnent
I extracts which will hand him
Mr
LATHAM read the following extracts: If the Federal system isa faäu!e, the question mav well bc asked, is not the •republican system cz.fai.lurc
Very many wise
thinking men, say so
We forrned the Governrnent because the separate States, if was thought., were not strong enough to stand alone, and because they were likely to provc disadvatltaaeous, if dangerous each to the other, in their distinct organization, and with their varyinrr interests
When we break up, will the dis- advantages arid dangers of separate States be such as to require the i"onuatinn o
a new confederacy of those which are,.at present, supposed to bc hotnogcneons
we do a new coni@deracy, when the, old it would seem to be neither toisc, prudent, nor statesmanlike to frame it aJtcr the pattern of' t,lbe old
New sat'eguards and guar- antees must necessåri*y bc reqnired, and none but a heed- less maniac would seek to avoid lookingthis Inatter square- ly in the face
[t is true that we rnight inake
a constitution for the fif- teen southern States, which •.vould secure the rights of' all, ('t present, , fronn harm, or, at
least, whicå) svonid require a clear ciolation of its letter, so plainly that the world could discern it, when' uneonst itutional action was ntated
But then, in the course of years, as rnen changed, tirnes chanzcd, interests changed, bnsiness chant-zed, product iong changed, a violation of the spirit Inigbt occur, which would It niåy be said that not be clearly a violati01F or the letter

VVben any State goes out or the present Federal Union, it then becomes a foreign Power as to all the other States, as woll as to the world
Whether it will nnite again with any of' the States or stand alone, is for it to determine

Mr
President, I ha ve rnerely called attention to these surface in- dieations for the pu rpose of susta in ing the assump- tion that even the people in the southern States ought ID consider w bat kind of government they are going to pass under, before they change the present one
We are told that the present Con- I--;c adopted by the new confed- stitution would eracy, and in a short time everything would be here other indica- orffüllized under it.
W c find tions, and x,vc are told from another quarter that another character of government is more prefer- able
We know that, North and South, there is a portion of our fellow-citizens who are opposed to a government bascd on the intelligence aj)d wili of the people
We know that power is always stealing from the many to the few
We know' that it is alsvays vigilant and on the alert; and now that wre are in a revolution , and great chancres are to be made, should we not, as faithful senti- nels, as men who are made the guardians of the interests of the Government, look at these indica- lions and call the attention of the country to them 
Is it
not better to Bear those ills we have, Than fly co others that we know not of." We see, by thQse indications, that it is contem- plated to establish a monarchy
We see it an- nounced that chis Government has been a failure How has it been a failure
fronl the beginninff
Now, in the midst of a revolution, while the peo- ple are confused, while chaos reigns, it is sup- posed by some that we can be induced to return to a constitutional or absolute monarchy
Who inay comc when , after we have
exhausted all hon- and fair means, if this Government still fails to execute the laws, and protect us in our it will be at an end
Gentlemen of the North need not deceive themselves in that partic- ular; but we intend to act in the Union and under the Constitutton, and not out of it
We do not intend that you shall drive us out of this house that was reared by the hands of our fathers
is our house
It is the constitutional house
We have a right here; and because vou come forward and violate the ordinances of tliis house, I do not intend to go out; and if you persist in thc violation of the ordinances of the house., we intend to ciect you from the building and retain the possession, ourselves
We want, if we can, to stay the heated, and I atn compelled to say, according 10 rnyjudg- ment, the rash and precipitate action of some of our southern friends, that indicates red hot mad- I want to say to those in the North, com- ness
ply with the Constitution and preserve its guaran- tecs, nnd in so doing save this glorious Union I intend to stand by and all that pertains to it
the Constitution as it is, insisting upon a compli- ance with all its guarantees
I intend to stand by it as lhc sheet ancl'lor of the Government; and i trust and hope, though it seems to be now in the very vortex of ruin , though it seems to be running between Charybdis and 'Scylla, the rock on the one hand and the whirlpool on the, other, that it will be preserved, and will remain a beacon to guide, and an example to be imitated by all the nations of the earth
Yes, I intend to hold on to it as the chief ark of our safety, as the palladium of our civil and our religious liberty
I intend to cling to it as the shipwrecked mariner clings to the last plank, when the night and the tempest close around him
It is the last hope of human freedom
Although denounced as an experiment by some who want to see constitutional mon- archy, it has been a successful experiment
trust and I hope it will be continued; that this great
work may go on
Why should we go out of the Union
Have weanythingto fear
What are we alarmed about
We say thåt vou of the North have violated the Constitution; •that you have trampled under foot its guarantees; but we intend to go to you in a proper way, and ask you to redress the wrong, and to comply with the Constitution
We believe the time will come when you will do it, and we i do not intend to break up the Government unfil the fact is ascertained that you will not" do it

Mr
WIGFALL
I know' you do not
You do not want the facts stated
I know what Mr
JOHNSON, of Tennessee
the facts were, and in this Senate we voted for the passage of resolutions that Congress had the power to protect slavery, and that Congress ought to pro- tect slavery when necessary and wherever protec- tion was needed
Was there not a maiority on this floor for it; and if it was necessary th'en , could we not have passed abill for that purpose without passing a resolution saying that it should be pro- tected wherever necessary
was herc; I know what the substance of the proposition was, and the whole of it was simply to declare the princi- ptu that we had the power, and thatit was the duty of Congress, to protect slavery when necessary, in the Territories or wherever Se protection was needed
Was it necessary then
If it was,- we had the power, and why did we not pass the law

BROWN, to amend the resolution by  142 strikingoutall aner the word.' resolved,' and inZlieu thereof in-Serting ; That eexperience having already shown that the Con• Stitution and thé common law, unaided by statutory enact- ments, do not afford adequate and sumcient protection to slave property ; some of the Territories having failéd, oth- erg having refused; to pass such enactments,.it has become the duty of Congress to interpose and pass such laws as will afford to slave property in the:Territories that protec- tion which isgiven to other kinds of property
It was determined in the negative—yeas 3, nays 42
On motion by Mr
BROWN, the yeas aod nays béing desiréd- by one- fifth of the Sénators present
Those who voted in: the amrmative, are : Messrs.- Brown, Johnson of Arkansas, and Mallory
Those who voted in the negative, are : Messrs
Benjamin, Bigler, Bragg, Bright, Chesnut, Clark, Clay, Clingman, Crittenden, Davis, -Dixon, Doolit- tle, Fitzpatrick, Foot, Foster, Green, Grimes, Gwin, Ham- Iin, Harlan, Hemphill, Hunter, Iverson, Johnson of Ten- nessee, Lane, Latham, Mason, Nicholson, Pearce, Polk, Powell, Pugh, Rice, Sebastian, Slidell, "I'en Eyck, 'I'hozn- son, Toombs, Trumbull, Wigfall, Wilson, and Yulee." I was going on to say that the want of protec- tion to slavery in the Territories cannot be con- sidered a-grievance now
That is not the reason why she IS going out, and going to break up the Confederacy
What is it, then
Is there any issue between South Carolina and the Federal Government
Has thc Federal Government failed to comply 'Vith, and to carry out, the obligations that it owes to South Carolina
In what has the Federal Government failed
In what has it neg- lected the interest of SoUth Carolina
What law has it undertaken to enforce upon South Carolina that is unconstitutional and oppressive 
If 'there are grievances, Why cannot we all go together, and write them down, and point them out to our northern friends after we have agreed on what those grievances were, and say, here is what we demand; liere our wrongs are enu- merated; upon these terms we have agreed; and now, after we have given you a reasonable time to consider these additional guarantees in order to protect ourselves against these wrongs, if you refuse them, then, having made an honorable effort, having exhausted all other means, we may declare the association to be broken up, and wc may go into an act of rcvolution." We can thcn say to them, You have refused to give us guar- antees that we think are needed for the protection of our institutions and for the protection of our other interests." When they do this, I will go as far as he who goes the furthest
I tell them here to-day, if they do not do it, Tennessee will be found standing as firm und unyielding in her demands for those guarantees in the way State should stand, as any other State in this Confederacy
She is not quite so bel- ligercnt now
She is not making quite so much noise
She is not as blustering as Sempronius Was in the council-in Addison 's play of Cato, who declared that his voicc ',vas Still- for war," There was another character there, Lucius, who v..ras called upon to know what his opinions were; and when he was called upon, he replied that he must confess his thoughts were turned on l.)üice•, but when the extremity camc, Lucius, who was de- liberative, who was calrn, und whose thoughts were upon peace, was found true to the interests of his country
Hc proved himself to be a man and a soldier; while the other a traitor all)d a coward
We will do our duty; we will stand upon principle, and defend it to the last extrem- icy
We do .not think, though, that wc have just cause for going out of the Union now
We have just cause of complaint; but wc arc for remaining m the Union, and fighting the battle like men
•we do not intend to be cowpardly, and turn our backs on our own camps
We intend to stay and fight the battle here upon this consecrated ground
Why should we retreat
Because MI'
Lincoln has been elected Presidentofthe United States
Is this any cause why we should retreat
Does not every man, Senator or otherwise, know that if Mr
Breckinridge had been clected, we should not be to-day for dissolving the Union
Thon what is the issuc
It is becausc we:havc not got our man
If we had got our man, x,ve should not have bccn for breaking up the Union; but tis Mr
Lin- coln is elected, we are for breaking up the Union ! I say no
Let us show ourselves men, and men of coura n•c, How has Mr
Lincoln been qlected;and how have Mr
Breckinridgo and M 1'
been By the votes of thc American people, cast aecording to the Constitution and thc forms CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 19, Qf.iaw, though it has been upon a.sectional issue, It is not the first
time in our history that two candidates have been elected from the same sec- tion of country
General Jackson and Mr
Cal- houn were elected on the same ticket; but nobody considered that cause of dissolution
They were from the South
While I oppose the sectional spirit that has produced the election of Lincoln and Hamlin, yet it has been done according to the Constitution and according to the forms of law
1 believe we have the power in our own hands, and I am not willing to shrink from the responsibility of exercising that power
How has Lincoln been elected, and upon what basis does he stand
A minority President by nearly a million votes; but had thc election taken place upon the plan proposed in my amendment of tho Constitution, by •districts, he would have been this day defeated
But it has been done according to the Constitution and according to law
1 am for abiding by the Constitution; and in abiding by it I want to maintain and retain my place here and put down M r
Lincoln and drivö back his advances upon southern institutions, if hc designs to make any
Have we not ("0t the brakes in our hands
Have we not got the power
We have
Let South Carolina send hcr Senators back; let atl the Senators come; and on the 4th of March next we shall have a majority of six in this body against him
This successful sec- tional candidate, who is in a minority of a mil- lion , or nearly so on the popular vote, cannot make his Cabinet on the 4th of March next unless this Senate will permit him
Am I to be so crreata coward as to retreat from duty
I will stand here and meet the encroach- ments upon the institutions of my country at the threshold; and as a ruan, as one that loves my country and my constituents, I will stand here and resist all encroachments and advances
Here is the place to stand
Shall I desert thc citadel, and Ict the enemy come in and take possession
No
Can Mr
Lincoln send a foreign minister, or even a consul, abroad, unless hc rcccives the sanction of thc Set)atc
Can he appoint a post- master whose salary is overa thousand dollars a year without the consent of the Senate
Shall we desert our posts, sl-n•ink from our responsi- bilities, and permit Mr
Lincoln to come With his cohorts, as we consider them, from the North, to carry off everything
Arc we so cowardly that now that we are defeated, not conquered, we shall do this
Yes, we arc detöated according to the forms of law and the Constitution; but the real victory is ours—the moral force is with us
Are we going to desert that noble and that patriotic band who have stood by us at the North 
who have stood by us upon principle
who have stood by us upon the Constitution 
They stood by us and fought the battle upon principle; and now that we have been defeated, not conquered, are we to turn our backs upon them and leave them I, for one, will not
I intend to to their fate 
stand by then: 
How many votes did we get in the North
We got more votes in the North affainst Lincoln than the entire southern States cast
Arc they not able and faithful allies
They are; and now, on account of this temporary de- feat, are we to turn our backs 'upon them and leave them to their fhte, as they havc fallen for us in formcr controversies 
We find, '.vhen all the North is summed up, that Mr
Lincoln's majority there is only about two hundred thousand on the popular vote; and when that is added to the otLervote cast through- out the Union, he stands lo-day in a minority of nearly a million votes
What, then, is neces- sary to be done
To stand to our posts like men, and act upon principle; stand for the country; and in four years from this day, Lincoln and his administration will be turned out, the worst-de
feated and broken-down party that ever can•ie It is an inevitable result from the into power
combination of elements that now exist
What cause, then , is there to break up the 
'iVhat reason is there for deserting our posts and destroy- ing this greatest and best Government that was cver spoken into existencc 
I voted against him; I spoke against him; I spent uny to defeat him; but still I love my country; I love the Constitution; I intend to insist unon its guarantees
There, and there alone, I intenå to plant noyself, with the confident hope and belie
that if the Union rennins together, in less than four years the now triumphant party will be overthrown
In less time, I have the hope and belief that we shall unite and agree upon our grievances here and demand their redress, not as suppliants at the footstool of power, but as para ties to a great compact; we shall say that we want additional guarantees, and that they are necessary to the preservation of this Union; and then, when they are refused deliberately and calmly, if we cannot do better, let the South go togethcr, and let the North go together, and let us have a divis- ion of this Government without the shedding of blood, if such a thing be possible; let us have u division of the property; let us have a division of the Navy; let us have a division of the Army, and of the public lands
Let it be done in peace, and in a sptrit that should characterize and dis- I believe we can obtain all tinguish this people
our guarantees
I believe there is too much good sense, too much intelligence, too much patriot• ism, too much capability, too much virtue, in the great mass of people to permit this Government to be overthrown
I have an abiding faith, I have an unshaken confidence in Inan 's capability to govern himself
I will not give up this Government that is now called an experiment, which some are prepared to abandon for a constitutional monarchy
No; I intend to stand by it, and f entreat every man throughout the nation who is a patriot, and who has seen, and is compelled to admit, the success of this great experiment, to come forward, not in heat, not in fanaticism, not in haste, not in pre- cipitancy, but in deliberation, in full view of all that is beforc us, in the spirit of brotherly love and fraternal affection, and rally around thc altar of our common country; and lay the Constitution upon it as our last libation, and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Consti- tution shall bc saved, and the Union preserved
Yes, in the language of the departed Jackson, let the Federal Union, us exclaim that the Union, it must bc preserved." Are we likely, when we get to ourselves, North and South, to sink into brotherly love
Are we likely to be so harmonious in that condition as some suppose
What did wc find here tl'1C other day amon& our brother Senators, onc of whom rcfrrred to a southern Governor
I allude to it only to show the feeling that exists even among I am sometimes impressed with the ourselves
force of Mr
Jefferson 's remark, that we may as well keep the North to quarrel with, for it' we have no North to quarrel with, we shall quarrel amon• ourselves
We are a sort of quarrelsome, pug- nacious people; and if we cannot get a quarrel from onc quarter, we shall have it from another; and I would rather quarrel a little now with thc North than be quarreling with ourselves
Because the Governor ofa southern State was renusing to convene the Legislature to hasten this movement that was going on throughout the South ; and be- cause he objected to that course of conduct, what did Senator say here in the American Senate
The question was asked if there was not some Texan Brutus that rise upan(l rid the coun- try of the hoary-headed traitor! This is the lan- guagc that a Senator used
This is the way we begin to speak of southern Governors
Yes; to remove an obstacle in our way, we must have a modern Brutus who will go t.o the capital of a State and assassinate aGovernor to accelerate the movement that is goin«y on
If we are so unscru- pulous in reference to ourselves, and in reference to the means we are willing to employ to con- summate this dissolution, thén it does not look very much like harmony amonsr ourselves after we get out of it
Mr
President, I have said much more than I anticipated when I comrnenced; and f have said more now (though external appearances seem than have strength or health to say; but if there is any ctTort .of mine that would pre- serve this Government t.ill there is time, to think, till there is time to consider, even if it cannot be preserved any longer; if that end could bc secured by making a sacrifice of rny existence and ill" up my blood, I would be willing to consent to it
Let us pauscin this mad career; let us consider well what we are doing bc- itatc.; fore we make a movement
certain extent, dissolution is going take place, say to the North, you ought
to spirit which should characterize aud conu•ol the  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, nag North on this question; and you ought to give those indications in good faith that will approach what the South demands
It will be no sacrifice It is no suppliancy on ours, but on your part
simply a demand of right
What concession is there in doing right
Then, como forward
We have it in our power—yes, this Congress here to- day has it in its power to save this Union, even after South Carolina has gone out
Will they not do it
You can do it
Who is willing to take the dreadfui alternative without making an hon- orable effort to save this Government
Tl'his Con- grcss has itin its power to-day to arrest this thing, at least for a season, uutil there is time to con- sider about it, until wc can act discreetly and pru- dcntly, and I believe arrest it altogether
Shall we give ail this up to the Vandals and the Goths
Shali we shrink from our duty, and de- sert the Government as a sinking ship, or shall we stand by it
I, for one, will stand here until the high behest of my constituents demands me to desert my post; and instead of laying hold of the columns of this fabric and pulling it down, though I may not be much ofa prop, I will stand '.vith my shoulder supporting the edifice as long as human effort can do it
Then, cannot we agree
We can, if we will, and come together and save the country
In saying what I have said on this occasion, Mr
President, I havc done it in view of a duty that I felt I owed to my constituents, that I owed to my children, that I owed to myself
Without regard to consequences, I have taken the position I have; and when the tug comes, when Greek shall meet Greek, and our' rights arc refused after all honorable means have been exhausted, then it is that will perish in the last breach; yes, in the language of the patriot Emmet, I will dis- pute every inch of ground; will burn every blade of grass; and the last intrcnchment of freedom shall be my grave." Then, let us stand by the Constitution:, and in preserving the Constitution we shall save the Union ; and it) saving the Union , we save this, the greatest Government on earth

1 could not hope, Mr
President, to reply to the remarkable speech of the honora- ble Senator from Tennessee within the time that the Senate would be willing to listen to me; nor at this late hour could I expect to reply to his He has spoken very hand- very long speech
somely of tbe gallant conduct of that glorious band, the northern Democracy of the country, who, though in a minority at home, have strucr- gled for the rights of their southern brethern— mitted briefly to notice some of the points that the honorable Senator made as he welV along in his labored course
He took occasion to give an account of thc action of the Senate upon certain resolutions introduced here, setting fhrth the prin- ciples that were made the issue in the late contest, and that were overridden and trodden down
He called the attention of the Senate to' a proposition introdåced by the honorable Senator from Missis- sippi [Mr
13RowN] to declarc that now is the time foraction; that a law ought to be passed at this time protecting property in the Territories
Though It was my opinion then that it would havc been well to pass such a law, yet that Senator knew, and so did every other one, that it was impossi- bie in this Congrcss to pass such a law
We might have passed such a bill through this body, but it could never havé passed thc other
Then it was our duty, as it was our privilege, to set forth the principles on which this Governmcnt reposed, and which must be maintained, or the Government cannot exist
They were the prin- ciples upon which this great battle was fought, that resulted in the election of Mr
Lincoln
They were the principles presented to the American people, more plainly and directly put than in any canvass before in this country; and they were repudiated, voted down, and rejected, and a man elected because he hated the mstitutions of the State of the honorable Senatol• who has just ad- dressed the Senate—elected because of his oppo- sition and because of his hatred to those institu- tions
By the result of the election, the power of the Government is to be placcd in the hands ofa sectional party—a party that had placed them- selve* in opposition to the Constitution and the equality of these States, and to the decision of the Supreme Court, and which defied the Constitution and the decision of the court, and denied the equality of these States; a party which holds that the common territory belongs exclusively to the North; that the North should enjoy it, and that the southern States should have no part or lot in it
On account of Mr
Lincoln's hatred of le institt.ttions of the South and his devotion t ec- tional principles he has been elevated to the ghest office in the gift of any people
Is it strange then, sir, that the galla t State of South Carolina—always chivalrous in evcry war in which our country has been engaged; famous in the war of the Revolution, out of which grew our present Government; famous in the wur of 1812—15; famous in
the war with Mexico; just, honest, upright, and true to the Constitution— should refuse to romain in the Union us an inferior Is it expected that she shall sub- member of it
mit to insult, inferiority, and degradation
If she will not, does the Senator hold that forces shall go down there with a bloody banner and strike down the gallant sons of that gallant and glorious State
i say to him, when he undertakes it, the gallant band of Democrats North will neither join him
nor that Republican party that expect to take a united North against a down-trodden South
I now serve notice that, when war is made upon that gallant South for withdrawing from a Union for the equality and rights of all the States
which refuses them their rights, the northern belong to that, portion of the people of this coun- try; and I will say to that honorable gentleman Democracy will not join in the crusade
The that while they struggle for the constitutional Republican party will have war enough at home
rights of the other States of the Union, as they The Democracy of the North necd not cross the have always done, and as thcy will continue to border to find an enemy
The Black Republicans do, there is one thing that they will not do: they and their aiders and abettors need not promise will not march under his banner to strike down themselves that they can carry a united North a«ainst an honorable people contending for their a gallant, chivalrous, and generous people conu tending for rights that have been refused them by I rights
No such thing can be done
r ilhey will not The honorable Senator tells us where Tennes- the other States of this Union
march with him under his bloody banner, or Mr
see will stand •when that hour of trial may come
Lincoln 's, to invade the soil of •the gallant State
W I know a good deal of Tennessec; two of their of South Carolina when she may withdraw from regiments happened to be under my orders in my Confederacy that has refused her that equality brigade in one of the wars in which this country I know has been engaged
I know them X,vell
to which she is entitled, asa member of the Union, I under the Constitution
On the contrary, when I that a more chivalrous, more just, more gallant, he 0k' any other gentleman raises that banner and more honorable and bold people do not live on the face of this globe; and I can say to my hon- attempts to subjugate thatgallant people, instead of marching with him, wc Will meet there, ready orable friend that they will not march with him to repel him and his forces, He shall not bring to South Carolina to strike down the people there; with him the northern Democracy to strike down nor into any other southern State
These States, a people contending for rights that have been re- I Mr
President, must have their rights in this fused them in a Union that ought to recognizc the Union; they must have their equality there, or in honor they must go out of the Union
equality of every member of the Confederacy
would save this glorious Union; but it must Mr
President, to take up this remarkable speech , to analyze it, to review it, and to consider itin the be done, as i said on a former occasion, upon the the manner that it deserves, would require more i principles of the Constitution; upon the princi- timethan can expecttohave; but I may be per- I} pies of justice and equality; and I will say to the honorable Senat-01' from -Tennessee do: understand the framewoik Of thig •he understands it
I underståndttlifstö bp a„vo!} I understand that untary association of States
our fatheÉs met together at a proper tifi10 iri i:lid history of our country, and establishOd 'tu ernment, a Confederation—one, as he remarked; that it was declared should be " perpetual' V They lived under it a short time, and they foulid it would not answer the purpose
A few StatéS moved—five States; the glorious Old Dorniriion was one; and they said •that though it had been provided by the Confederation that the ment should be perpetual,they would break it up, Only five States met, but their suggestions were acted upon; the other States sent delegates; and the convention fixed the time for the breaking up of that Government that was to have been per- petual, and that time was when nine only of
the States would unite
They were seceders theg
George Washington headed the band
He went with those who chöse to secede from that Coh- federation to the city of, Philadelphia; 'became their President; made a Government; and pro- vided that when nine States should adopt it,- the old Confederation should be broken up
He Wds a seceder
What has the honorable gentleman to say to him and, his friends that went with him to Philadelphia, seceded from a government that was to have been " perpetuill, " and which did not provide for its alteration, except by the concur• rence of all the States, and made a new govern- mcnt, our present Government
When they sub- mitted it to the States, they made it upon the principle of that equality of States which I have mentioned
They provided that tho equality of States should remam Liever; for that article of the Co•nstitUtion providing for the equal repre: scntation of the States in this body cannot be changed
They brovided that the sovereignty of the States should be maintained; that their equal- ity should never 'be denied
When it was pre- sented to the States, they adopted it, with the understanding, and upon the principle, that they should bc equal, and should have equal protection ; that they were equal in sovereignty, equal in nity, and cqual in rights; and as long as th!3 eqality be maintained, this equality be preserved, the Union will endure, and no longer
But the States did not very hastily adopt the Constitution that was presented to them by those who seceded from the Confederation
They acted mnturely and deliberately, and considered wcll the Constitution, which they adopted at such times as suited their convenience, and annexed condi- tions, too
That gallant old State of Virginia, the glorious Old Dominion , made a condition upon which she adopted the Constitution
It became a portion of the compact
And not only Virginia, but New York, made the same condition when she adopted the Constitution;' and Rhode island also
I do not desire to take up the time of the Senate; but I will read two or three lines to show the condition on which Virginia adopted the Cons stitution, It became, as I say, a portion of, thé compact; and I believe it is a principle ih Iqw; that when ono member of a firm or Confederacy accedes to a condition , all the other members, being equals, have theadvantagc ofthatcondition
Each member of this Confederacy has the advantage of the condition on which Virginia accepted it; and they say that— We, the delegates of the people of Virginia, duly elect- ed in pursuance of a reconunendatlon from the General Assembly, and now met in convention, having and freely investigated and discussed the proceedings of the Federal Convention, and being prepared, as well ag the most mature deliberation hath enabled us, to decide thereon, do, in the name and in behalf of the peopie of Virginia, declare and makc known that the powers granted under the Const.itution, being derived from the people of the Uni- ted States, may be resumed by- them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or -oppression, and that every powcr not granted thereby remains with them, and at their will." This was the condition that Virginia made; and New York had a similar condition, and set it forth in plain English: That the powers ofgovernment may be reassumed by the people whensoever it shan become necessary to their häP- piness; that every power, jurisdiction, and riaht not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Con- gress of the United States, or the departmcnts of Goy- errunent thereof} remains to the people of the several States, or to their respective State goveruments, to whom they may have granted the same ; and that those clauses in the said Constitution, which declare that Congress-shall not, have or exercise certain powcrg, do .not imply that Congregs-is,  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 19
entitled to any powers not given by the said Constitution ; but such elauses are to be construed either as exceptions to certain specified powers
or as inserted merely for greater eaution." Now, I would ask the honorable Senator from Tennessee, if the time hae not arrived when these States ought to-resumc the: powers conferred on a Federal Government; or if it has not, I' should like to k')ow when
the- time can come
At anv rate, the Stutes think that the tirne has.' arrived; and if they choose to act, I am sure that he will think: better than to go down and to force them to remoin in this
Union
What would he do with them if" he wei•e to conqucr them
Ilo}d them as i I subjeéts
Hold a State as a colony, her people I as vassals
- He would not hang the State, hc says, but he would liaog -all the people in it, leav- ing, s
suppose, t.he soil within its limits unpun- ished
Then, he talked to us long about the whisky insurrection, and shoued ',vhat Washington did 
r.['he whisky insurrection was a very different thing from the solemn act of a sovereign State
It had no relevancy to the action of a sovereio•n State, acting in her sovereign capacity for the redress of her wrongs—redress that she cannot obtain in thc Union
There is no parallel
not a case
in point; and I wonder that he would talk about it
Cl'hese are sovereign States
'rhey have an equal right in thc Territories; and they have cause to act, in my honest judgment
Delay is sometimes dangerous
Ruinous resukts some- times, follow from it, But, sir, understand me; I am not a disunion- ist
I am for the right, and would have it in the Union; and if- it cannot be obtained there, I would go out of the Union, and have that out of the Union that I could not obtain in it, though I was entitlcd to it
Now, is there no cause for the action of these States
Let us look at it fbra moment
Let us examine the case a little, and then I will fbllow the
Senator little further
I war)t to notice some points hc nuadc
In the late canvass, as I stated in tho outset, the Issue was t,l-lat presented to t.l,e Senate in the res- olutions offered by the honorablc Senator from Mississippi, [Mr
DAY'1s.] ri'he principles of those resolutions were stricken down, and Mr
Lincoln was elected
I propose to look at his views very briefly, and see whether the States have not smne V little reason for alarm, or cause of action, if you please
I take it-, they are going- to act anyhow, whether we please or not; and whether I approve their action or not, I pledge
my word that I will never draw my sword to strike them down for exercising a right of
a sovereign State—a right
secured by the adoption of the Constitution to the members of this Confederacy
The gentleman who has been elected Presidentofthe United States is a stranret• to inc personally; I have never had the pleasure of seeing him; but
I have seen his opinions, and I will read what he said in some- what recent canvass with the honorable Senator from Illinois, [Mr
DOUGLAS.] take it, he was pretty closely pressed in that struggle, and k will make solne allowancc; for Ixe has said nearly the samc thing over on several difFerent occasions
He said: did not -even say that I desired that slavery shon!d be put in course of ultimate extinction
f do say so now, bow- ever, so-ther€y need be no iongcr any difficulty about tlliit
It may be written down in the great speech." * t have always -hated slavery, think, as much as any Abolitlonlst
have, been an old

I havealways hated it ; but have -always been quiet about it Hilti! this new era of the introduction of the Nebraska bill begun
I always believed that everyb()dy was against-it, and that it was in course of ultimate c.xtillction." "We are now-tar into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident pronüse ot• putting an end to slavery agitation
Under thc operation of that policy, that agitation has not onty not ceased, but has constantly augmented
In rny opinion, it will not ceasc until a crisis shall have been reached and passed
'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this Govern
ment cannot endure permanently half slave and halt' free
I do hot expect the Unithi to-be dissolved' Neither docs thc Senator from Tennessee— do not expect the house to ; but I do expect it '*Vill cease to be divided : it will becorzje all onc thing or all thc other, Either the opponents of slavery wilt arrest the f'ur- Ehcr spread of it, and place it where the pnhlic
'nind rest in the belief that it is in the course (fltinrate extinc- ti0ü, or its advocate$ push it till it shaii be- ail the old as well as new, alike in conie North as swell as South," Now, iB thcrc anv mistaking this language
IN through :Mr
Lincoln 's head When he uttered these words
That is not ali
He said, on another oc- casion, during the same canvass, in explanation of this language: only said what r expected would take place
I made a prediction only ; it may have been a foolish one, perhaps
i I did not even say that I desired that slavery shouåd be put do now, however_; so in course of Ultimate extinction
there need bemo Ionaer any difliculty about that."- If were' in Congress, and a votc should come up on a quegtion whcthcr slavery should be prohibited in a new R'.pe_rritory, in spite of' the Dred Scott decision, I would vote that it should." Then, sir, in spite of right, in spite of the Con- stitution, in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court, he would vote that slavery should be pro- hibitcd in t.hc.Tcrritoriés
Would you believe such a unan as tha.t his oath
Could you believe that a man who could hold that doctrinc would bc held by his otL1h
I would not; not
a bit of it
I would not trust a man that can defy the Constitution; that can trample upon the rights of the States; that can say that he disregards the opinion or dc- c.ision of the Supreme Court; that he would not respect it; and that, though he had taken an oath to support tl)C Constitution of the United States in the dischargc of his duty as a member of Con- m•ess, he would vote against the right of ti'lesc States in the common Territories
have i)0t the southern States a right to fecl con- cern
I-lave they Aot a right to feel apprehensive as to the course of the party that was reprcsented tho other day by the honorable Senator from Ohio, [Mr
'WADE,] who said in I-xis Place that slavery should never go on one other inch of the territory of this country
Can they mistake this thing
A Inajority of the pcople of the North havc decided •that it shall not
Their Preéidcnt says it shall not, and their Senators .say it shall not
Then how can the States, I would ask the I hQl')orable Senator frorn Tennessee, expect in this Union to get their rights when they are in a ity
What power have the
y to secure
them
Are sea running through several Governments shall be open equally to ull of them; and besides, as the honorable Senator from Louisiana said, there is no man in Louisiana that would think for a moment of depriving Tennessee of the right of navigating that great river
No, sir, nor Ken- tucky either, nor Indiana, nor Illinois, nor any other State whose waters flow into that mighty stream
No such thing would ever be done
On the contrary, if they should go out ofthc Union— and that is not a matte
for me to decide—I am sure that comity and good faith and proper recru- lations would exist and prevail between them and all the powers owninT territory upon that great river
Indeed, sir, if a dissolution of this Union shall take place, I look to the day when every one of those great northwestern States shall become a portion of that southern confederacy
They will not rernain with that portion of this *country that has agitated this question in season and out of season, in the school-house, and in the church, until they have poisoned tho northern mind
1 have no idea that they will remain with the feople that have brought so rnuch trouble on so great a country as this
'I'hey would say, you of the South have never attempted to encroach on the i rights of any northern State; you have never said that a State shall not come in without slavery; you have always voted to bring in free States; you havc been just in all things; you have stood by the Constitution, and we can risk you; but wc cannot risk these agitators and fanatics who have brought all this trouble upon the land." Sir, if dissolution comes, it wilbc.nme for reason; b ; and if dissolution takes it will come for rioht

indeed, if ever

last I " iV hat I '10 say is, that no Inan is good ('E)ough to govern another 'nan without the oihcr nuan•.s conscnt
1 sav tilis is the leading principle, the sheet anchor of American re- publicanistn
Our l)eclaration of' Independence says : W c hold these truths to be atl Inen are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with eertain inalienable right* ; that atnong these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of 'happiness ; that to secure these rigbt*, are instituted tunong men, derivil)" tlléir just power t•rcnn the consent of the governed.' have quoted so inuch at this tirne merely to show, (hat according to our ancient fhitli
the powers of govern- ment aro datived froth) the consent or the governed
Now, go into battle and flffht for the right; but I will the relation or Inaster asd slave is, pro tauto, a violation of this principle
The rnaster not only governs the slave •,vith- , out his conscnt, but he governs by set ot• rules alto- gethcr different "ront those t,vhich he preserihes for hilnseif
Allow all the governed an equal voice in the Government ; and that, and that only, is " And it is remarkable that while Mr
Lincoln does not want to govern neorocs without their consent, both hc and Ibe Senator from Tennessec arc for ryoverninff sovereign Statcs of w hitc men without their consent
Mr
Lincoln, it is percoi ved, wants necrro equal- ity
He wants to place tho neo•ro on an equality with the white man
He
xxvants the northern States to have negro citizens as well as white; and to render those States tho rulers of the south- ern States, because they will not have negroes for their citizens
But, sir, I want to return to the view of the Sena- tor from Ti'cnnessce for a moment
He spoke of thc price of the acquisitions of territory down South, and he spoke particularly of Florida
Hc looked at it as n matter of' dollars and cents, never at principle, never at right; but he counted what it had cost, and what it had cost us to turn a few Indians out of there; and now he says the people in that State, that
cost so much, are complaininff, I because, he ought to have said, they could not have the rights to which they are entitled under [hc Constitution
Then he is concerned about the navi•yation of lhc Mississippi river
-He says undertake to collect revenue
in South Carolina, hold courts there, and execilte laws there, when she is not a nu•mbeu• of this Confederacy 
I will sav, that that is bringing about civil war; n•muzurating a policy that will drench this country in blood
The man that will do it will be looked upon as the worst murderer that ever disgraced burnanity
Civil warin this conn- try! Conquer States, and hold them as provinces! Where is tbc authority t.o do it
'Ithank God, it is not in the Constitution
No such power is confened upon this Government
It cannot be exercised, and I feel proud of it
I am a man of dislike war
I would never make it or encourage it, except in defense of right, in defense of honor, in defense of truth arid justice
I would never force war upon a people, or inauffurate it, unlcss it is authorized, and unless it is my dut.y to do so in defense of right; but certainly I would not make war to conquer a people cobtending simply for (t right that has been refused, for a right that they cannot have in the Union, and for a right that they can have out of the Ullion, even if tyrants, or rulers that would be tyrants, should undertake to cocrcc them
The man that would do it, the man that would inaucyurate it, would drench this country in blood
My heart would pain me, and I could not rest at all, if I could be- lieve such a calamity sliould happen
If it
should come unfortunately upon this country, inaugu- rated by a tyrant, who would like to conquer and hold American citizens as vassals, then I will say to that covv'tu•d who would do it, "You will walk over your humble servant's body first
" I shall never coöperate with any portion of this country, North or South, that woufd strike down a people con tending for their rights
Now, sir, what chance have they to get rights in the Union
Even if a dissoluti02') takes place, if that calamity shall fall upon us, I look forward to the day when a reorffanization can be made
1 look upon a dissolution now asafixed fact; I look upon it as inevitable; but shall we not all look for- ward with hope, with anxious and patriotic hope, to the day when a reorganization shall lake place, when all these States can corne tot.rethcr in one the great Tennessee and he, himself, great arid happy Union, that si•n-tli sects'il•e right, justice, and equality, to every portion of the Union

It is in the power of that sectionøin which you live and which you represent, to yet save this Union, and to bring about the early re- organization of a great Republic upon a basis that will be permanent and lasting, if you would only speak earnestly and say, " Gentlemen, it is all an error; we never intended to deprive -you of the South of your equality in the Territories, and we are willing to provido in the Constitution that every State shall liavc her equal rights in the common territory of a cornruon country; 'that every Inan shall have a right to go with hlS propz epty tLcrc, and have il protected while the terri- torial condition remains," and live up to all other constitutional rights, Do this; meet the Democ- racy of tl')e North and South upon this great prin- ciple, and rnaintain the il)tegrity of the Constitu- t ion as it was handed down to us by our fathers, and we will go on prospering and to prosper until, indeed, this Shull bc tbc greatest country on the face of thc carth
Why, sir, to break up such fabric, to break up sach a Union, to destroy such a Constitution, is a matter of the deepest regret to every good man North and South
There is not one State •in the South that would do it without cause
Tliere is no State North, but for the influence of the Repub- lical) party, that would do it

Before I cast my vote, I de- sire the attention of the gentleman from Illinois, who offered this resolution, to a
surycrestion which I have to tnake
As I understand It, a difficulty has arisen on this side of the House, in relation to lhe resolution the gentleman has ofl'ered, in regard to the effect which it will have upon the power of the committees of the Housc to sit during the re- cess
Some of us are of the opinion that, if the resolution is adopted in its present
form, the com- mittees of the House, including the select com- mittee of thirty-three, will have no power to sit I think that the until the House ugain meets
resolution, in its present form, is liable to that con- Cial expenses of the Government for the year ending 30th of June, 1862; which was read a first and second time, referred to thc Committee of the I Whole on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed

Mr
WASHBURNE, of Illinois
1 will say to the gentleman from Virginia that if the resolution is not laid on the table, I will withdraw my de- mand for the previous question, and allow the gentleman to offer any amendment which he may suggest
I ask the gentleman, then, to allow the vote to be announced upon the motion to lay the resolution on tile table

1 just wish to finish what I was to say, arid then the gentleman from i.tlinois may modify his own resolution

Now, the suggestion i have to offer to the gen- tleman from Illinois is this: the House, the Constitution, has not the power to adjourn over for more than two days at a time, without the consent of the Senate
But if we obtain the consent of the Senate, we may adjourn over for more than two days at a Lime, and the committees of the House may continue in session as i

At that timc I was in favor, and I am now in favor, of this policy

SIR : '.['he
greater portion of the bounty due to the om- cers and of the vessels which captured the slavers Wildfire, Williams, and bark natuc unknown, on the coast of Cuba, in my last, is unpaid, and the appropriation heretofore made for service of that character is nearly ex- haustcd
An additional appropriation is, chere.fore, now required
Under direction of the President, on 22d OCtober last I entered iuto contract witli the American Coloniza- tion Society, iOr the support:and maintenance one year of the Africans recaptured fron•r the slavers Storm King and Erie, and delivered to the United States agent at Mon- rovia in Septclnbcr last
An appropriation will" be required to meet the liabilities thus incurred, and to pay the bounty due to thc captors
A fcw days since, this Departtncnt was officially advised that, on the 14th October East, the IJhited States frigate Constellation captured t.be slave ship Coru, having on board six hundrcd and ninety-föur Africans, all of wno:n were delivered to t.hc United Statcs agent at Monrovia
An op- propriation will be required tor their support and nnalntc- nauce
tor one year, and also to pay the bounty duc to those I by wh01n they were rescued
Offieiaf ill"ounation hag this day been received the ef- fect that, on the 10th October last, the United States frigate San Jacinto captured the slaver Bonita, with seven hun- dred and thirty-four negroes on board, all of whom have likewise been delivered to thc United States agent at Mon- rovia
An appropriation will also be necessary for their support and maintenance, and to pay the bounty due on their account
'I'l)e ag(rreøate anmount that will be needed for these sev- eral objects to the 30th June next, and to meet other ex- penscs incident to the service growintr out of the prosec u- already appropriated, is, as nearly as can be estirnateå, $450,000
It is fair to presume, judging from the past, that other slavers will yet bc captured during tbé present fiscal year, and to provide for the contingency, respectfully ask' tbat an additional amount be appropriated of $450,000; 'naking a total for this year-of $900,000
For the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1862, an appropri- ation should also be ruade of like amount, and the sanxe is respectfully reconnnended

MY DEAR SIR : You have doubtless reueived information that anotner slaver has been caughl, the Bonita and that  148 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 19, seveii hundred and* thirteen Africans havo been Eagded at .Mö1irovia, froin aboard: of her
For us, the Colonization Society, as weH as for
Liberia, this is an alarming and •an etnbarrassing state of things
In less than four months, thirty-seven h(indred and eighty-one wild Afriéans have been- laädcd in Liberia, vim: frömKey West, eight hundred and ninety-one; from slavers Storm King, six hundred and sixteen; Erie, eight hundred and sixty-seven ; Cora six hundred and ninety-four, and Bonita, seven •hundred and-thirteen.' We have reeéiVéd information-which leads as to expect that •many more will soon be landed
When Lhé Cora left the Congo river, -and the Bonita left Panta da Lenha•, there wcrc in the baraeoons between fivc and six tlk)USiiUd slaves waiting for vesselS ; and the vessels were and this amendment proposes to supply a defi- ciency of a million more for this item of for the present Four hundred and fifty thousand dollars year
are in-anticipation of captures to be made before the nekt fiscal year
I do not propose to discuss this question at length at this time, though may seek an opportunity to do so before the close of the present session
.1 have not before me the 
I doctuncntat•y matter to which I would invite the attention of the House
But I will present one or two iåcts in conncction with this suuject, import- in and;takc the-people aboard
The United Sttites men-of ant to bo known and considered
T lie slavc trade, war on that station are all wide awake
They have begun -io understand the -subject, and to feel the influence of the prize money
We may therefore expect to hear of Other captures by the
very next arrival from the coast
Under these circumstanees, Mr
Secretary, what is to be done 
We have now on our hands, and have had for from two to three -and a halfmonths, thirty-seven hundred and eighty- one peoplc to clothe and feed and take care of, and we have received but $27,208 33 from the United States for their benefit
For the last two caraoes no contract has been entered- into, and no provision made
In these times of commercial distress and financial erubarrassment, it can- not be considered reasonable or right that we should pro- vide tör these people for nothing
Our Liberia population is small and feeble ae best
To have nearly-lötn• thousand savages thrown in upon them, is an oppression which they ought -not to be caned on •to endure
They n)ight
justly prötest against it
And you will allow me tosay that, un- less the United States does speedily make provision ror those already landed, as well as iör others who may hcrc- after be landed, I, in the name of Liberia, being fully au- thorized to represent her,- and wo the American Coloniza- don Society, shall be compelled to protest against any mere being lauded in Liberia
L beg to call your attention to this subject at once
The welfare of the recaptivcs themselves, as well as the safety and happiness of.Liberia, deanand that immediate and amplc provision should be nuade for those already there, and that we should bc enabled to pronide somewhat in advance others who mav be Fandcd
I have the honor to be, most respectfuily, your obedient seroant W

'I'HOMPSON, Secretary Interior
Mr
SHERMAN
It is manifest, whatever may be the objection to the present law in refin•- enec to the African sfave trade, that wc must make prompt provision for the rescued negroes alrcady returned to Africa, and we ought at to pass this appropriation
It is improper and wrong to throw the whole burden of supporting thcm upon the Colonization Society, when theré is no money appropriated to enable the President to carry into effect the contracts already made with that society
Mr
JONES
I would suggest to the chairman of thc Committee of Ways and Means; that if he wants to suppress the African slave trade, he had better repeål the law of Congress of last session, which - authorizes all these recaptured Africans to be supported, at so much a head, by thc Colo- niz,alion Society
The law now in existence is, I think; a permanent one,and authorizes the Pres- ident to rnukc arranffement with the Coloni- zation Society to take care of those persons
Such contract hits been made, and we pay the Colo- nization- Society an enormous sum to t.ake care of the class of' persons referred to
Therefore you mnkc it for thc interest of that socicty to have the Africans recantnrpd, in order that they might be paid, and paid liberally, fbr taking carc of them
I say to those gentlemen upon the other side of the House, who arc so anxious to suppress the Africah slave trade, that they put 2.1 law upon the statute-book last session which will increase that trade- more than any other measure which has been adopted by this Congress; for it is manifest, that the more Africans there are recaptured the more tnoney the Colonization Society will get
Therefore they will send out persons purposely these Africans, in order, when they are brought in, they may get pay for taking care of them
And I do not wonder at the remarks in I the letter of the secretary which has been read here, He does not care how many are captured from 10 doomsday
I say to gentlernen•, if they are sincerely de- Birous to sni)press the African slave trade, abol- ish the law under which the Colonization Society receives so much money for taking care of these recaptured Africans, For, so long as that act stands, that society will send out men to capture Africans, that they may be turned over to them
so far as I know, is not carried on between this country and Africa
I am notaware that butasingle of slaves has for many ycat•s been landed in the United States—I allude to the cargo of the slaver Wanderer
T hc slave trade, practically, is carried on between the coast of Africaand the island of Cu ba, and pcrl)aps one or two other points in the possession of Spain
England has a treaty with Spain, by which the latter Government is plcdgcd, for the consideration of according to my recollection, to put an end to the slave trade wit.hin her dominion
Great Britain can enforce that provision of the treaty at any time she pleases so to do, and so shut up t.he ports to which slaves arc carried t.o be sold
And it is utterly futile for any apologist of that powerful Government to say that, if she chooses to do so, she cannot, with her police of the seas, closc such ports to-morrow, or at as early a time as her inclination may prornpt
Moreover, England has, in addition to that portion of the coast of Africa under her own ju- risdiction, treaties extending all along that vast continent closing that portion of the world to the African slave trade
So, then, if sliG chose to enforce those treaties, she could close the mar- ket.s to which slavers resort to make their pur- chases
But by her connivance, not to say her participation, this tramc is permitted to be car- ried on, and the United Stutes Government, by a treaty stipulation which she has entered into, and by' the prepositioris which are madc to her time to time by the British Government, is madc to play tho part
of police to capture such of those Africans as she may be able, at an expense to her of upwards of a million dollars n yea•r
It is attitude which we ought not to assume
It is a position our Governnient ought not to oc- cupy; and it is one ••.vhich the members of this Congress ought to to.ke stepsto change promptly, effectually, and efficiently
good faith is not to bc observed in this matter by the British Gov- ernment, the less ••,ve have to do with her the bet- ter for our national reputation and for the cause of humanity
Unless I am greatly mistaken, since thc adjournment of this present Congress in Junc last, a proposition has been directly and officially made by the British Governmen t, through Lord .Tohn Russell, to the Secretary of State, to enter into an arrantrement with that Government to ormqnize and carry on the cool y trade, for the avowedly, of furnishing labor to the purpose , tropical portions of the world
A resolution was introduecd at the last session of Congress by a
gentleman from South Carolina, whom I now see in his seat, calling upon our Government for information as to the disposition that the Government of Great Britain makes of her recaptured Africans
If my ear did not deceive me, a response to that resolution was made early this session, and it was ordered to bc printed
I have not seen the document
I shall read it witli i a great deal of interest, for it has struck me that it is a subject entitled to consideration
What becomes of' those persons
In the operations of the British cruisers on the African coast, so far, slavers aro never captured when going into a port, but only when coming out of port with their slaves on board
What t.he reason is, I know not
It may be that if a slaver is captured while going into port, the vessel itself alone becomes a prize; whereas, if she is captured when coming out of port with slaves on board, a premium is given to the captors of twenty-five dollars a head for each slave on board
Henco it is the direct interest of' the vessgls that are stationed on the coast of Africa M r: MAYNARD, Can the chairman of the II to let slavers go into the ports and get their car- in the West Indies
Does that apprenticeship ever terminate
What is the limit of it
What aro the terms of it
What is the end of it
I do not propose, Mr
Chairman, as said in the outset, to enter at large into the discussion of this question at this time; but certain it is that this appropriation now asked for by our Govern- ment is one that ought to make us pause before we ørant it
A quarter of a million dollars at the last session was supposed to be ample for all the exigencies of this service
Nearly four times that amount is now asked as a deficiency; and if' Eng- land and Spain are in this manner to cotinive at the carrying on of the slave trade between the coast of Africa and the Spanish colonies, to say nothing of the English colonies, this Government ought simply to say, s' Hands off; we will tect our own coast,and keep our skirts clear in the matter; but beyond that we do not choose to inter- pose." Mr
PRYOR
Do 1 understand the honorable chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means to say that the faith of the Government is pledged for the amount designated in the amendment
Mr
SHERMAN
Contracts have been made, I think, if I understand the report of the Secre- I tary of the Interior, for three of the cargoes
For the fourth cargo—the Bonita—no contract has yet been made
The four cargoes already cap- tured will consume $450,000
The remaining $450,000 is estimated upon conjectural captures to be madc between the 15th December and the 1st day of July next
Mr
PRYOR
Mr
Chairman, so far as the (hith of the Government is already engaged, of course I am obliged to vote the appropriation; but I do think, from the papers produced by the hon- oral)lc chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, that it must be obvious to every mind that we should revise and reform the system on which we are acting
What do we find
We find that already the Government is taxed a year for the subsistence of these captured Afri- cans
We find that there are now dependent upon the r Ih•easury of this Government in Africa three thousand persons
We find that cases of capture are increasing in a geometrical ratio
• Now, w bo knows what enormous appropriations may event- ually be required under the operation of this sys- tem
Who knows but this a contrivance by which this Government is to bc burdened writh the support of the Government of Liberia
Who knows, as sucrcyestéd by the honorable member from Georgia
[Mr
J0NEs,] but there is some
connivance, some arrangement, by which, in the shape of thesc appropriations for the suppression of the slave trade, the Colonization Society is to bo fastened upon this Government
Now, sir, am as averse as any gentleman to the
prosecution of the slave trade
I would not relax, but, on the contrary, I wouldonfirm and enforce every enactment for
the suppression of that trade
Still, do think that, in the prosecu- tion of this enterprise we should,consult our own exWencies
There is one consideration which I should imagine would appeal with decisive force to gentlemen on the opposite side, and that is, a suggestion for which am indebted to a para- graph; apparently authentic, in the newspapers, to that this promising Republic of' Li- beria is the extremity of being swamped by the Afri%risvpitated upon its bosom through the agency o his Government
Now, demand of those gentlemen that they g:ve tbc Republic of Liberia a fair chance to illustrate the capacity for sew-governrnent x.vhich they claim for the African race
Do not Oppress them by the presence of cannibals from the dominions of Dahomey
In every aspect, I do think, then—and I submit it to the honorable gentleman from Ohio himself— that we must change our policy
Can we not do something
Last year I suggested, without muéh thought, the idea of adopting the policy already practiced by the Government of Great Britain, and that is the policy of reducing captured Africans to a quasi-slavery—a species of appren- ticeship
I have thought much upon- the subj_ect since; I have read sot-new hut upon it, I only confirmed in the idea I then advanced
will cordially support whatever the u cn- tieman from Ohio may propose bavinry in v 'ow Gommittec of M/ a.ys and Means teli us what l.vas phe reøa!ar appropriation for the current year 
Mr

Mr.

in reply to the gent eman from Virginia, [IM 1'
PRYOR, I I will simply say that t11C Committee of Ways and Means )ave under consideration an appropriation tho next year of' $900,000, and it is probabte that that comrnittee mav report some modification of the law in re- gard to the slave trade; at least, propositions of that kind are pending before the committee; but we su npose that it would bc impossible for the committee to nMLture, or Congress to pass a law soon enough to affect the expenditures to accrue before the 1st of ,Tuly next
With regard to the colonization system, it is not com pulsory upon the Republic
of Liberia, It connpulsory upon the Colonizat.ion So- eict.v,to undertake the carc of these necyroes
'T.'hp P resident of the United States can, under the law, make a contract with anybody to take care of them; and if the Commonwealth of Liberia deem these Africans a burden upon them, they can re- fuse, a matter of' course, to receive them, and Colonization Society can refuse to enter into a contract

An amendment
to the d is in order

BURNETT
Then move to by and inserti; $900,000, ' striking out At the last of Con- thereof " gross, i, together with other gentlcrnen, voted for (ho act passed to ;unend the act entitled " An act in addition to the act prohibiting the shive trade." At that time I lhought the act would be humane in its provisions, and that the plan proposed would bc tbc best tneans that
could be adopted for dis- posing of the Afticans cant.ured and brought to r I'hero werc at that time, I believe, our shores
or shortlv before, some twelve hundred slaves on the coast of Fiorida, at Key West
I am now sat- isfipd that the act of last session is not only inhu- mane in its provisions, but is actually cruel
'I'he report of' the Secretary of the Interior shows t.l•utt among the Africans who were sent back to the coast of A the, rnnrtality ort board of our ves- sels, crossing and returning, xvas about fifty per The President of the United States was directed to Inalce a contract under this act with any party he might select, for thc purpose of returning these at the Africans, and having them taken care of, rnigbt, in his dis- price of per head; continue that contract for a period of five I am unwilling, at this time, to vote another dol- lar under this act
The act ought to bc amended;' and the only course that this Government can pursue, which would be, in my judgment, wise and humane, is, that when Africans are captured and brought to our shores, the apprentices*lip system, as adopted by England in regard to her colonics, should bc adopted by us
It would certainly tend to elcvate the character •of those barbarians landed on our shores; and not only civilize them, but give the philanthropists of this country, who are so fond of the negro, an oppor- tunity of christianizing them
W c do not render their position any bet-ter by the course pursucd by tbc Government; and yet we are called upon not only to expend for this year, but to make an additional appropriation of $900,000 for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1862
This has becornc a profitable branch of commerce
W c now not only pay to this Colonization Society #100 per head—the President being authori7.otl to con- tinue the contract fhr five years—but wc also, tn-uier the exisfing laws, pay to the ships' crews that capture thesp Africans, a bounty Of twenty- fivc dollars per head
We thus encourariD(P instead of suppressing the African slave trade; I and I think that the wisest course to be pursued E by tl-1C committee woukd be to reduce the appro- priation to $450,000, the amount st_vgested by the chairinan of the Committee of Ways and Means; and then let us amend this law
Mr
CRAV•JFORD
It seems tome, Mr
Chair- tnnn, that there is no diffculty about settling this It has been up for the last two three q upstion
sessions of Congress
T hc great
mistake has bceF) in thc construc.-tion of the" law of 181.9, probabili:y the st.u•n of $450,000, su,rroested by the fron"l Kentucky, is enough for the purpose required
According to my construc- tion of the act of 1819, tbc Preéident of the United States has no power whatever to and maintain these Africans one year after they have been returned
The difficulty is that the Presi- dent has been authorized to rnakc contract for that purpose
The law of 1819 looks to the, sup- port and maintenance of thosc Africans who are captured and brought into American ports, until they arc returl'led to Africa; but there is not one solitary word or line of the
act of 1819 that can I bc tortured into a construction allowing for their support and maintenance for one year after they defy the ablest lawyer are returned to Africa
in this 1.40nsc, or elsewhere, to show that there is any reason or justice requirin«r, on the part of the American Congress, an appropriation of $900,000 annually for tho support of these Afri- cans after they shall have been returned back

it has im-.)lied tbåt because of the use livered there to an (went," of tl•: words the law requires that the Government of the Uni- II tcd States shall them for a certain time I do not hold to any such construction thereafter
a w; and I think that, under a proper con- strucäon of the law, we can avoid the support and rna inte.llftll('c of these Africans for one year after I C there were any roa- t hpv are ret u t•ned home
son or prot•n-iety in our supporting them there for a year, should have any objection to doing I But the truin is, that there is so much oppo- silion in tho blouse and in thc country, south- as sent home, thcre is a generay Indignätioy aFOusOd against tho Aft•icah slave trade; arid the-money-is voted out of the Treasury contrary to law; ; Thätt• is the whole stato of the case
Let us construe the act of 1819 aright
LetüS look at it as lawyers
Lot us look atit as of sense
Examine that law; and you will 'find- that the captured Africans are to be eupported' and maintained while in this counti•y, but not- inr their own
Give it that construction, ahd then' the amount of money necessary to carry out the aet of 1819 will be far less annually than is nskédt I shall never vote a dollar, for in the prescrit bill
either in this House or elsewhere, for the -support* of A fricansabroad; butl will vote every dollar that tlle law requi res for their support and maintenance while in this country, and' for their return to their I am satisfied that that is the true own shores
construction of the law; and if those gentlémen on the other side of the House who are no more indignant at the reopening of the African trade than are many gentlemen on this gide, will vote according to that construction of the law, thero will be no diffculty about the amount Of money to be expended
I am very indiffcreht whether you appropriate or or any other sum

That is the only effectual -remedy which I can suggest for putting a Stop to this African slave trade
And I think that by that means we could accomplish another purpose; we could rid ourselves of.a class of per- sons who, while they are engaged in .this trafic abroad, are-at home absolutely engaged in engen- dering strife and contention among our people North and South
I want the House and the country distinctly to understand that the State of Alab4ma„ whethei• she secedes or not, is opposed tp.pheereopening of the" slave trade.
I certainly shall do my utmost to prevent it; but, I say, sink the Vessels all on board who are engaged in carrying on: the traffc, and I am satisfied that no southern man -w,ill go down either
I call upon my northern friends to put a stop to the practice of building ships in their own ports, and fitting them out with their own money to steal negroes on tile coast- of Africa
Mr
GROW
That is what we are trying to do
Mr
COBB
But the means you arc using are ineffectual
While you are _passing these enorm- Otis appropriations, your own people are fittinff out ships, and continued and repeated dcprcda- tions are being committed by these thieves
Now, Mr
Chairman, is it adrnissil)le to move as an amendment to this bill, that the ships shall
be sunk with: all
on board, after taking the negroes Thé CHAIRMAN
The Chair is of the opin- ion that, as an amendment to a deficiency bill, such an amendment would hardly be in order
It might, per-haps, i
it were a bill for raising a sinking fund, [Laughter.] Mr-
COBB
I had some doubt about the ad- missibilit.y of it myself, and that was the reason why I was desirous of getting the opinion of the, Chair; but I say that if sac.h -provisuon could be passed by this .House, it would furnish, rny opinion, the only means by which the slave trade could be stopped
I do not want to aid the build- ing of ships at the North fin• the purpose Df pros- ecuting the slave trade; nor do want to aid in capturing those fellows who engage in that slave trade, unless they are to be punished
I wanl to get clear of them and of the trade altogether
Mr
REAGAN
1 desire to offer an ment to the am_endment of the chairman of the Committce of w-ays Means
The CHAIRMAN
No further amendment isin order at this time
Mr
REAGAN
While am up, as gen- eral subject is open to debate, I will state the object I have in view in offering the amendment which I propose to offer whenever I have the op- portunity
Whenever the opportunity presents Itself, I shall propose to amend the clause making this appropriation, by providing that DO part of' the same shall be expended for the support of Africans captured on vessels not bound -for the United States
I am induced to do this for the reason that I am informed from a source on which I rcly—and if any gentleman doubts the correctness of it, he can apply to the Navy Department and satisfy himself in reference to it—that but one of the vessels=which have been captured with new roes on board was bound for tl)C coast of the U bitcd States.- That the Echo
The it is true, was
found in the United States, and was suspected of being a
slaver, but it was not kriown certainly that such was her character
'l'he Echo is the only one captured which was bound for •our coast: All the others were bound for Cuba
The trade is onc which is carried on between Africa and Cuba, and not carried on by the peo- II ple of that portion of this country which has been so frequently maligned as encraged in the African leave them entirely destitute upon their arrival in that they exist, there can be no doubt
Any one, who wili take the pains to apply at the proper Africa
No, sir; I am disposed to go as fur as this Government ought to go, under the proper source of information , will find t.bat the statements that I have made arc true: I hold, then, that while construction of the law
I am willing, while we the only slave trade which is being carried on to i are discharging our duty to ourselves, that we any considerable extent is between the coast of should at the same time discharge our dutv to Africa and the island of Cuba—a dependency of these Africans
And under this state of the case Spain—it is not proper that we should be taxing with a conflict between the Executive and this the Government of the United States, to the ex- House, $900,000 seems to me to bea remarkably tent which this bill provides, to take care of and large sum, especially in view of the fact tb we christianize the Africans which are taken by Yan- have the whole naval force of France, of Eng- kees, in Yankee ships, for Yankee speculations
land, and of this country stationed upon the coast It seems to me that this isa question deserving of Africa, and elsewhere, in order to prevent the of some consideration at the hands of this I-louse prosecution of the African slaveftrade; especially, —at least that it should have
some influence in controlling the policy of the Government in de- termining the course it is to pursue
I shall pro- pose the amendment W'h ich I have su troested when- ever the proper opportunity shall present itself
I wish to say further upon the general subject, that heretofore I have voted for atl the appropri- ations which have been called for, since I have been a member of this House, to bc applied in taking care of these Africans and sending them I have done it, because I sup- back to Africa
posed it thc best moans of sccuring the suppres- Sion of the African slave trade, to which I have been, and am, opposed
But seeing the tendency which the course of policy pursued by the Gov- ernment has had in working injustice to the tax- payers of theu nation, I shall now change the pol- icy I have heretofore pursued
I do not propose to vote for this appropriation, nor for any other appropriation, to carry out the policy which the Government is now pursuing, unless the plan which I have suprrested, of making provision for the support of such nccyroes only as were being sent to the coast of thc United States, shall bc I acreed to
M r
CLEMENS
I was not present
when the I ' discussion upon this subject took place in House at the last session of Congress; I.)ut, inas- much as there secn•'ls to be a difference ot•opinion between the executive departn•ent of tho Govern- ment and Congress as to the proper construction to be placed upon the act of 1819, I have taken pains to refer to lhc language of that act
I do not hesitatc to affrrn that, whatevcr mav be its hereafter, whether to increase or diminish the slave trade, the act of 1819 confers no power upon the Execut.ive of this Governrnent to not-untain nem•oes captured in slavers on the coast of Africa
incurring an expense, estimated at the balance of the present fiscal year, in support- ing these neurroes upon that coast
EI'he question, then, before the House is, whether we shall ac- quiesce in the construction, warranted as I say, given by the Executive; or whet.l"ler we shall diminish the estimated appropriation to such an too, in view of the fact that that trade is stigma- tized upon the statute-books of the United States as piracy
Was it contemplat.ed, when this act was that a trade stigmatized as piracv should passcd , be encouraged by the executive arm of (he Gov- ernment, and that a direct bounty should be held out for i ts con tinuance by appropriations of money on the part of this House
With these views, with the facts I have stated, I mn compelled to vote for the amendment of the o-éntleman from Kentucky, [Mr
BURNETT,] or I ibr• such a reasonable sum as mav be suffcient, under the actual facts of the case, to discharge whate;.may be deemed on our part our duty toward these Rurifortunate barbarians
Mr.+JOHN COCHRANE
Mr
Chairman, 1 • do nol rise for the purpose of discussing any fine question of humanity or -philanthropy
i rise merely to present my views upon a plain point submitted the consideration of this committee; and t bat i* , whether expenses incurred under the faith of a public act of the United States should be defrayed
whether money should be in answer to the call and claim upon the credit of the United States
It is very immaterial, to B) y mind, whethm• the law of the last session is a proper legislative construction of the law of 1819; but •were it a proper theme for discussion here, it seems to mc that the question could very
readily be answered, and that the criticism which has been bestowed upon the law of 1819 in connec- (ion with the law of tho last session, is amenable to Lhis sufficient and ptain answer: that when the law of 1819 demands that a body of he.lpless hu- nun) beings should be received upon the coast of Africa, it also requires that they should be re- coived there for tho purposes of preservat.ion and ['or tho exercise of the nat.ural promptings of hu- Yet the Executive has taken the responsibility manity; for conservation, and not for destruction; and that when appropriations are made to carry that law into execution those appropriations should be devoted to the maintenance, the support, the clothing, and the protection of these helpless creatures, and not for their destruction 
Mr
CLEMENS
If which 1 placo upon the law of 1819 is the correct one—and extent as only to cover the amount already due
the gontl€nnan from New York seems to admit 'That is the issue presented by the amendinent of that it is—then will he be kind enough to teli me the gentleman from Kentucky
I think the time has comc when this Congress should put its legis- lativc veto against these excessive expenditures and usurpations of pox,ver on the part of one de- pa.rtmcnt of the Government, against a plain pro- vision ofcxisting law
What is of•1B19
it before rne, and beg leave to refer to its explicit provisions
I svill not bc governed in my action, as a of this House, by the distracted state of feeling in t.he country
So far us I concerned, in carry- ing out the trust with which I am invested as a member of this House, shall endeavor to dis- charge my duties under the oath I have taken, and to look above all ou iside influences
In what direction ought that action to be
The act of 1819 provides that the President of the United States shall appoint the proper person or slave trade
IL is as well that it should bc under- II persons residing upon the, coast of Africa to act stood that the ships which are built for this trade as the agent or agents for rccciving the l')egroes, are not built in the southern States, so much II Inulattoes, or persons of color, delivered frorn on abused and denounced as being engaged in the board the vessels seized in prosecution of the siavc trade; they ure not owned or n'ianned by i! slave trade by tho connnanders of the Ijnited people fi'0E1) the South, and I hey are not enlrag•ed Slates
He is to appoint the person or persons carry ill" on the s„ave trade between the coast to act as acrents to receive, these captured Afri- ik anpropriations arc tnade for thc execution of of and the southern States
They
are cans
Now, what has the Presidel)t done
He bu.iit the very men who raise this outcry has not on: y appointed a person to receive them, slavery, and they aye owned manned i)ut he has appointed a oersorl to maintain them l} for one year after [heir return to and arrival upon by these sarne people, for the purpose of import- incr slaves from the coast of Afi•ica into the island it their native soil
I am not disposed to turn these of Cuba
barbarians loose upon Liberia; I am not disposed, These facts, I say, ought to be understood ; for so far as they are concerned, to desert them and under what constitutional authority, what i authority, this Government has the right to stretch its into Africa, and keep up a system of edu- cation and maintenance and christianization of the barbarians to be found there
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
that I can answer with as strict an adherence to the letter of thc Constitution as can my friend frozn Virginia, who is acknowledged to be a strict ex- positor of thatin.strument; but I may be permitted at this point to appeal to that higher law, recognized by my friend, I am sure—the law of humanity, the • law of preserving life; that law, sir, which we all recognize, the obligations of which we acknowl- edge in this House; the law that, when life is II within our power, our action should be taken for its preservation, and not for its destruction
But uny remarks were not directed to that point
They were directed to this sirnple construction: when a law of Congress directs an exe.cutive om- cer to take under his carc and protection human fife, the letter as well as the spirit of that lav.' is to the effect that that life should be conserved, not destroved—to the construction that a law, it confers upon the executive ofÖcer pov.:er W not to turn loose thcsc wild not to leave them between heaven and earth in expiation of some conceived offense—but to take care of tbcnn, to civilize them, to protect and xuainlain thejn, and to provide for the comfort of their future life
'Ithat was the construction put upon the law of 1819 by  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

That is the construction which I deem the proper one in this instance

It is, that t.hc amendment would change the ex- isting law
The present law authorizcs lhc Pres- ident of the United States to pay $100 a year for the support of all Africans captured by the naval forces of the United States
This amendment, of course, will limit the authority and change thc The CHAIRMAN
I would call the attention of the gentleman from Ohio to the uniform ruling upon this point
A distinction has always been held to exist between a provision which changes the existing law permanently, and a restriction merely upon one appropriation pending before Inasmuch as the amendment pro- the House
posed by the gentleman from Texas applies to the manner in which this particular money shall be used, and does not contemplate a permanent change, the Chair rules that it is in order
Mr
REAGAN
I ought to have said, in con- ncction with the other remarks I submitted, that the Governments of Great Britain and France have heretofore to take an active inter- est in thc suppression of the slave trade, and to hold, before the world, slavery ih gt•oatabh01Ttnce —a profession which, so far as the English Gov- ernment is concerned, still continues to be made
The object of my amendment is to place this mat
ter in such a form as to see whether they are sin- cere in their professions; to placc the policy of Government, in reference to this matter, upon such a basis us to test the
sincerity of Lhose Govern- ments
When we recapture we return them to the coast of Africa
It' that policy of our Government is to bc continued, I hove no objec- tion to it, so far as it applies to those Africans I whose destinat.ion is the United States
yet to the slave trade, beyond sla- ! } But I understand that whet) British or French very in the shall be done with the or Spanish cruisers capture slavers, they consiT1) free colored population of the free States or of the the captured Africans to an apprenüecship which slave States

Now, I not think it is just to put upon oar countt•v the bnr- den of returnir)g those negroes and makinT pro- vision for their snpporL yent , in cases where -l our citizens are not in the trade, or when the negroes recaptu red are not destined to the If this Government wiil enter into United States

I would vote for the appropria- tion of $450,000, which is necessary now, for the cancelmcnt of existing expenses; and, us \neas- ure of humanity, I would vote for $450,000 more, if it be probable, as it seems to me it may bc prob able, that in the future, before any further appro- priation can bc nmde, expenses to that amount wilt have been incurred for the saine purpose
that the amendment as it is think, therefore, offered should prevail

It follows,i fore , of necessity , that no appropriation will-be left

in voting money- for this —that Coneress, in the ninth section of purpose tbc first article, is thus invested with power over this subject: The immigration or Importation of such persons as any of' the Stati".s now existing-bhall think proper toadfl)it shali not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808 ; but a tax or duty tnay be Imposed on such ilnportåtion not exceeding ten dollars for each pcrson." The object, then, of the Constitution in vesting power in this Governmont5 by treaty or bylaw, to suppress tbc African slave exclu: sive!y to this country and not to other nations
'he duty, thereforr•, of the Navy of the United Slates, when employed for the purpose of sup: l.regsiug tbc African slave trade, should be; under a strict construction of' this instrument, exclu- sively directed to the prevention of thc importa- tion or immigration of persons of the description which, under the act of 1808, hag been bylaw prohibited; and we should thus fulfill all of our constitutional obligations and all the obligations which this Government could have the power to contract with other nations
Sir, we have known, we have eeen, it is fest and patent to every member of this House,- that the present laws, under the construction which hus been put upon them by the Executive.- Departments of the Government, have produced, not

She proffers to the American Government to receive these captured Africans and take them under her own kind nur- ture
Why shou{d we not commit them to hercare 
Gentlemen upon the other side of the House are, perha-ps,' in the habit of hearing, if they them- selves do not utter, fulsome eurogies on the negro philanthropy of Great Britain, chicf among ten thousand, the one who has gloriöd most in her Fabid abolitionism
Why not commit these Afri- cans to hcr care for nurture and for education
She has paraded herself and made a boast of her ca- -pacity to civilize and christianize and liberalize, though at the same time she tyrannizes over all the nations of the earth
She sets herself no',v on apinnacle, proud, defiant, exalted, and claims that all' the nations of the earth shall look unto her and takc example from her teachings and her practice
Give her the keeping of thcsc barba- rous Africans
Here is a feasible,- direct, and economical mode of getting rid of them
Why not adopt it
But, Mr
Chairman, while I am upon my feet, I cannot help adverting to some of the remarks of my friend from New York, [Mr
JOHN COCH- n ANE,] who addrcsscd the committee in reference te some of his peculiar notions of humanity
He stated that perhaps the act of 1819 would admit
of the construction that, Inasmuch as Qt.n• vessels and officers of the Government authorized to receive -these barbarous creat.ures, it nuty be im- plied by a fair construction and inference of law that it is thc (luty of tl')e Government to provide for their maintenance and their education, for the conservation of life; but while he
based his construction upon the idea of humanity, he Scöuted the idea suo•gested by the gentlelnan from I Kentucky, [Mr
BURNETT,] same other gen- t-leman; that, thésb captured Africans should be treated the British Government treats those cap- tured -by her own cruisers; that is, talccn into the colonies among white people, whorn he admitted to bc asuperior race,and there held in apprentice- ship until they work out a sufficient sum, not I only for their own maintenance, but to defray thc expense of sending them back own coun- try
He seemed to think that there was no hu- munity in such a policy as that
I think therc is
I think it is benefit aud a blessinm•to an inferior race, even to race of barbarians, to be brought in contact with a superior race
'l'he idea ought, therefore, not to be scouted
The example of Great Britain can be cited to show that there is some humanity in such course, something that shall commend itself to our approbation, or at least to our deliberate consideration 
Mr
JOHN COCHRANE
merely rise to set the gentleman :rieht as to an error into which I think, he has innocently fallen
I did not doubt the humanity of such -a procedurc as that wl)ich he suggests; but deprecated its adöplion in view of the more serious question which it would raise —namely, by incorporating pro tanto thc colored race with a- superior race, the question would be presented what in future should become of that Inferior and degraded race
That was the view took
Mr
KUNKEL
They would be in the dition which tbii'}k the Almighty, our common Creator, as '..vcll as the founders of this Govern- mcnt, wisely deterruined they shon\d Be, put anu that 15, of subordintuion to the superior race, by u denial on the pari, consatu t.i'd authoriaps of the country so- Cial 0k' politic-afa equality, I think i bat the decis iOl') of the founders of our Government, in determ- ining the condition of Africans, was wise, was proper, was based on experience of true govern- mental policy; and has not an inhumanity, but a blessing to the inferior race
I know that in these latter days it is the habit of tbc advocates of Massachusetts humanitarianisln to represent that all this system is wrong
They do not pre- tend to eo to the Bible for instruction on this subject
Some of its distinguished and honored advocatcs—men honored with prominent positions in both Houses of Congress—represent that the enlightened patriotism •humanity of Massa- chusetts exceeded the W'isdom of the prophets and apostles and martyrs, for the faith of Christ- endom, and that the time has come when we must throw Off not only tho Constitution of the coun- try but the ordinance of God himself
They set themselves up to be some of the great ones of the earth
They protess not to be as other men— sinners by nature, sinners by practice, and need- ing repentance; but they authoritatively teach their doctrines as though having a commission to speak ec cathedra; and they have been, regret to say, the prolific source of all the political, social, and religious evils now distracting our almost ruined country

So the committee rose: and the Speaker havino resumed the chair, Mr
gococK reported that the Committee of the Whole on the state of the U *'lion had had under consideration the Union generally, and particularly House bill No
866, to supply deficiencies in the appropriations for the year end- I ing June 30, 1861, and had directed him to report the same back to the House with sundry amend- ments
Mr
SHERMAN
i promised to give the gen- tleman from Kentucky an opportunity to offer his amendment, if he desired to do so
i Mr
BURNETT
The amendment which 1 propose is to strike out $900,000, and insert $450,000

The point of order ing been raised, the

Certainly; that is the very reason why the change has been made

It would not be debatable if the previous question had not been called

Iwish simply to say that 1 have so far voted against all these motions to adjourn over for any length of time; but 1 have become satisfied that the best thing we can do is to adjourn over a sufficient time to allow gentletne,n to go honxe uud consult their constituents upon the great emergency which we have reached in the affiiirs of the country

The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr

On the morning af'ter the resolu- tion was submitted by tbc Senator fl•otn Now Hampshire, [ offered a preamble and resolutions, and gave notice that when the resolution of tl-i(' Senator should come up for consideration, I would minc as au tncnt to or su bst.itute his
T hc Senator froin I Ilii)0is, u-ho is not now in his seat, [Mr
DOUGLAS,] Inovcd that the roso- lutions should be referred to the special commit- tee of thirtecn, and I supposed that his nootion embraced the resolution of the Senator from New I Hampshire as
well as my resolutions; hut it ap- pears that was nob tbc case
My resolutions were referred not his
Now, sir, as a portion of the resolutions that I introduced are perhaps of such a nature that they could not properly be offered as an amendment to or siibstitutc for this proposition, I will simply move to amend thc I Senator's resolution by striking out all after the word resolved/' and inserting the last two res- olutions of the set that I introduced; and I do this, MI'
President, becaus€A feel it Iny duty
I do it because I believe the peace of the country makes it necessary that the two resolutions I now propose should be adopted in placc of the one offered by tl'le Senator from New Hampshire; \ I and for reason The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair would sun ("rest to thc Senator from Oregon that tho now is on taking up the resolution the Senator frotn New Hampshire

It
relates to a most important and delicate Inattcr, involvinø nothing less, I fear, I than thc fate of this country

SAULSBURY
lhope that those Sena- I tors who are anxious that peace should be re- stored to a distracted country and the Union of i these Stat.es not agree to talcc up this resolution now', and that they will not agree to consider this resolution or the resolutions which have been offered by the Senator from Oregon, at any period of the present session— at least not now
No possible good can result from their consideration
They can only lead to excite- they can only tend to increase the excite- ment; rucnt which now unfortunately prevails
I there- fore think that, if we desirc peace, we desire harmony, if we desire to continue together as relates to matters that will surely produce cxcite- ment iri the country, tbut will o•ive to much concern -and uneasiness, and ii is not calculated to restore peace and good feeling and harmony in the country
My object, above all things, is to see peace prevail, and, if possible, to restore good feeiino• arnong the people of the entire country
'This resolution has for its object—at least it looks in that direction—the strengthel)ing of cer- 'i'hat may excite the public tain fortifications
mind, when it ought to bc soothed; and I think it ought not to be taken up and considered this ses- sion
Let us leave things as they are
I arn for peace; I vvraul to see peace in the country
I am opposed to anything that would bc likely to get up trouble, or unnecessary uneasiness and anxiety
"Ilhese aro tha reasons that I have for opposino• t.he taking up of the resolution, and they were tha rea ons that induced me to draw the amendment th t 1 shall propose if the resolution comes up; b tl think It bettor that it shall not be taken up

Of rncm bers of the sanu) 'treat ftunilv of States, these excitin(Y resolutions should not be i\ltroduced course will communicate nothing except in here to mar what little of harmony is left, and to his discretion
The resolution, as I understand, is so framed as to ask for information, iC in his destroy w I'ldt little of peace is left
Mr
CLARK
Mr
President, this is simply a opinion it is not incompatible with the public ser- I may be vice
Such resolutions have always been per- question of taking up my resolution
mitted to pass this body
r I' his resolution relates to say that I did not introduce this res- 
olution for the purpose of exciting anv angry to matters about which we are not informed; and debate, or iör the purpose of marring tbc peace it seems to mc that all of us, on all sides of the or happiness of the country, or endangering its Clnunbcr, be the question ever so delicate, should lf' it is of' that have information regard to it

If, when this resolution shall be u Y), there shall be found anyt.hing in it serious character which Senators on the other taken the peace of the country, no side tell us it is, kve certainly do not want, tn in the dark; and how this ean bc regarded as a more ready than I will be to sup Senator will war noeasure, or how the sensibilities of the Scri- press an inquiry or to suppress such a por- I' do not asrree with the ator from Delaware can have become I ( lie 
cannot conceive, when it is to obtain information Senator from I)claware, when he says this reso- II lution is calculated to irritate or endanger the as to what the Executive is doing, and only such any objection to taking it up

Mr
HUNTER
I hope, sir, this resolution will not be taken up
Do we not all sce that it cannot, be compatible with the public interest to reveal ali the orders which •the President may have issued, and thc correspondence which may have taken place between hirn and these offccr.s
Do we not know that the effect of the debate, which will take place when it comes up, will be such as to irritate public feeline, and, perhaps, to encourage and bring on a collision between the
State and thc Federal authorities, which will end no man can say where
Now, sir, I think it would at least be prudent, if therö be uny hope that anything can come of this Committee of thirteen, that there can be any- thing of com promise or of concession , to postpone all such irritating debate until there has been some action by that committee
Do gentlemen expect to bring this question up, involving directly the question of coercion, in which fifteen States of this I) Dion fcel a deep interest, and pass it through wit}tout debate, and exciting debate
Why, Mr
President, I am amazed at gent.lemen
I do hope they will postpone the considcration of these exciting subjects until wo see whether anything can be done or not
When it shall bccome their purpose, if such be their purpose, to introduce any mcasurc looking to force, then it will be time enough to be such inquiries as this; but until then I hope their consideration will bc post- poncd
Mr
MASON
Mr
should never have offered this resolution, l)ecausc I have all the information tl'lat is called for; not that I have derived it either frorn the President, or any member of his Cabinet, but I have derived it from sources equally open to the honorablc Senator who moved the resolution, and to the honorable The information is pub- Senator from Illinois
ernment created by the Constitution, and no sov- ereignt.y in the States who created it, then the proposition would follow, but not until then, that I the people of the States constituted an integral part of a common empire
I do not mean, however, to go into that argu- mcnt
None of us entertain a doubt that that question will bc presented in a direct and practi- cal form, to be disposed of during tbc present ses- Sion of Corprcss•, and until that tiine arrives, I would submit to honorable Senators that the only effect of
pressinc such resolutions as this to a vote will but increase and inflame bitterness, anger, and resentment
Mr
CLARK
Mr
President, I very much regret that the Senators from Virginia have so much misunderstood my object
I can only say to them that if angry debate arises it will be on that side; I do not know the informa- I trust not on this
tion the
honorable Senator from Virginia [Mr
MASON] *nay have; I have no doubt that he has more than tl have; but I will say to him that my object, one object certainly, in presenting this res- olution, was to get the information for which it He may be aware precisely of what num- asks
I have -l am not
ber of men are in these forts
bccn told, I have seen it stated in the papers, that in one of them there arc ninety men
I have been aoain told that in that same fort there arc but forty I have also scen it stated this morning that I men
there are sixty-five men there, and five or six musicians
But this resolution does not end si:n- ply with asking the number Qf men
It asks the Pl'esident.to sta-te the force, and then also to state whether, in his opiriion, that fot•cc is sufficient to protect those forts
Now, it may turn out, as has bccn rumored in the papers and elsewhere, that there is sorne understanding between the President and the authorities of South Carolina that these forts shall If so, hc can say it, and say not be molested
lished
We all know, illoßicially, that no troops that the inen are suflicient to protect the forts
have been ordered to these forts; a nd we know the number of troops that are there, from crenet•al public information
we receive a from the President according to the facts, if the President should think it compatible with thc pub- lic interest to communicate them, f presume the object of thc mover is, by some resolution of the two Houses, to require that troops shalt be sent I suppose that is the object
We cannot want the information, for, as I fave said, we have the information from sources beyond doubt., al- though they are inofficial
I agree entirely with my colleague that, at
pre- sent, the only effect of making the call, and the only effect of a votc of the Senate for the call, will be to inflame the public mind, North as well as South; and I submit that, unless it be the ()bject There are also rumors that various steps ho ve Incen taker) to put these forts in a condition of de- fense; that various works have been thrown up; that works also, on the other side of the harbor, have been thrown up by the authorities of South 1 do not knowhow that is; I desire to Carolina
be informed
The President can inform us
can inform us in such way as hc may deem for t.he interest of the public; or he may withhold that information; but [ prmnise the Senators on the be in a state of agitation all the time
Let us know the truth and certainty of the Ihattér; and then the public mind will be quieted
It ista measure of peace, instead of one of ",var or irri- tation
Mr
DAVIS
Mr
President, it is very diff- cult, in discussing the question as to tho proprie$y of taking up a resolution, to avoid to scync Oxtent the consideration of its merits
I think we have ',vandered somewhat from
the question befdre the Senate—that is, the propriety of adopting the •res- olution of ipquiry presented by thé Senator from Newr Hamvsbire, [Mr
CLARK.] Is it proper that we should call on the President to communicate the orders he has given and the correspondence he has had in relation to a ft)rt, and especially when the circumstances of that fort are surrounded by such cxtremcly delicate relations as belong to this
If it is improper that we should make such an inquiry, there is no propriety in taking up thc resolution
I propose, then, to show that it is improper that we should make the inquiry, It will be remembered that, under the Confed- eration, in the infancy of Our GOvernment,Con- cress had the control of the Army
Alarcre porßion of the embarrassments which surroundeä military operations, during thc war of the Revolution, grow out of that fact; and, taught by expenence, when our fathers formed a ncw Government, they transferred the control of the Army and Navy to the P resident
Rut here, while the President is conducting the affairs of a garrison, it is proposed to institute an inquiry to learn what correspond- ence he has had; what orders hc has given; what force therc is at the place; and thus to make pub- lic thc very facts which, above all others, the commander of the Army and Navy should have If it were an ordinary the power to keep secret
case, we might allow it to pass, and Icave the Pres- ident to exercise his discretion as to his answer
But it is an extraordinary casc
know, as tbc Senator from Virginia has said, that •it must infiarne the pubiic mind to agitate .the question
If thc President is derelict, in his duty in upy ye- spect, he is amenable; but ibis in the o_thcr I-louse, If the pres- not in this, hc should bc arraigacd
ident is supposed to be perforlnil)g• his duty in tho manner which best conduces to the peace of the country,wc should but embarrass him in his op- eration.s by interjecting such nn inquiry as is proposed
"SVhatever the garrison may be—and I belicve other side that, if they will not cornmence nn ano•ry del)ate, none shall bc commenced on this side, and the whole country has full opportunit.y to know what it is—the factis well known that the President tl-iC whole matter may go t.o the President, to be has not the power to increase it; that he could acted on in his discretion
Mr
NIASON
Will the Senator allow mea not send a company there without tbc fact bein known before the company arrived
'This woul moment
The resentment, the ano•cr, and the certainly precipitate action, as it would convey a bitterness to which I referred, are not to be in- threat, attended by preparation to execatc it, and (lulged in debate herc, but spread among the peo- i (which I certainly do not ascribe,) I i! naturally result in bringing about the very col- of the mover, ple of the two sections

I have never doubted the perföct and indefeasible right of one of the States of this Union to detet•mine for her- self whether her honor and her safety will admit lion the decision of which I thihk properly.xestS It may be the right and duty of the Pres- fairs
ident to communicate that information if, in his with the Executive, and of which
he isa better judge than we can bc, even if lie should present judgillent, the public interest requires it, or if it to us the full record of his correspondence and his is not incompatible with the public service
If, moreover, he has given such orders not propose to discuss the al)stract question of ordcrs
to thc commander of that garrison as, being pub- the right
of a State to secede
That is not ger- mane, it seems to me, to this resolution; but no i, lished,would becomethesubiectofanimadversion, perhaps of misconstruction, our inquiry might one will deny that the Government has a right result in an irreparable injury to tbc public peace to manage these forts, and put such a number Of men into them as are necessary for the public and future hope of those who look forward to an I desire to know whether the President amicable solution of existing difficulties

It seems to be a provision exactly adapted, if not intended, to give security to a State when distrustful of the General Gov- crnment, and to providc the means of defense within the Union, which, as a separate State out of' any dang(.n• of the seizure of forts where there is no •arri.son: 'llhere stand Forts Pulaski and Jackson, at thc mouth of the Savannah river
Who hears of any lest Georgia should seize them
There are Castle Pinckney and Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor
Who hears of any danger of seizure there 
The whole danger, then, Mr
President, (and it stands palpa- blv on thcface of the transaction,) arises from the presence of the United States troops
Is the rem- ed y, then, to increase the garrison
It is imprac- ticable to do it, if that were the remedy; and if it were practicable, I hold it would only increase the danger
It would only bc multiplying the chances of collision
I think, altogether, it is rnuc.h bettor we should not makc tho inquiry; but leave the Army, without intervention, to be commanded by the Pres- ident, as provided ill the Constitution; and, when events have transpired, if then we choose to know what the Executive has done, not to -embarrass him in thc performance of his duty, but to sit in judgment on his conduct, it may be proper for us to call, as well for thc correspondence as the or- ders given in the case; I think not till then
Mr
CLARK
Mr
President, 1 do not pro- poso to follow the Senator from Mississippi in his range of debate; but I wish to suggest to him whcther, if it is improper that the inquiry should be made, it would not be better now to take up this resolution from the
table and let it be rejected
That would dispose of it
If the Senators on the other side desire to escape irritating debate, that ends it, for then the resolution is disposed of; but, as it lies hcrc, it is liable to be called up at any tirne, by any person in the Senate who may wish to do so
We may havo this occurrence every mornincp until the resolution is disposed of
Let it come up, and let it be disposed of
If it is the sense of the Senate that it ought not to be passed, let it be rejected; I have no pride about it
for the public weal and the service
fcred it here for a good purpose I desire to have it
acted on; I desire the intormation that it may draw out, if it be not incompatible with the lic service to cotmuunicatc it
I leave to the President, who rnanturos this whole matter, to say what is con)pat.ible wit.h the public serviec and what is nog what be will choose to reveal, and what he will keep secret
Mr
TRUMBULL
Me
President, Sena- tors upon the othct• side, in upon this bare resolution, asking for information, have thought proper to lay down a position which is the basis of', I believe, all that IS said upon that side
They assume that the object of this resola- t ion is to provide the moans to coerce a State, or, as the fronl Virgiliia says, fifteen States
One oi'the Senators speaks of declarincr war affai nst If there is all ybody in t11iS Senate, or in this country, who ever talked of the United States war noaillst one of' its States, or of co- ercine• one of its Slates, or over entertained such i a notion, I know not who it is
I havc never seen him
This phrase, " coerce a Stat.e,' phrase calculated to mislead the public mind
is like another term that has often been employed by gentlemen in• speaking of the territorial ques- the rights of the States in the 'I"erritories
'Why, sir, the States, as States, have no rights in under the authority of another State
I would subinit to tbe Senator, when he talks about punishino• individuals and execut.!kik t.he tbc force of the If ed eval G-overnrneut., it is met by thc public Jore„e of a Sta tc go vee•n- mont, is not, that war 
can he avc,ld tho conclusion that it is war
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 suppose that 1 have the right to ask another questi0Yi of the Sen- ator
What does he by I Mr
MASON
I will tell thc Senator with ureat I understand, by rebellion, resistance to pleasur$ the laws by the citizens—a portion of them—laws emanating from a comrnon Goverhmcnt of those citizens, and the citizens being but an integral part of one Government—an empire, a k'qu.ib\ic, or anything else
The distinction, bold, is this —f shall detain the Smoator but a tnoment in put- ting it, and I ask his pcrmission to do it: State trovern :nents tu•e as sovereio•n at this day as they were Millen they formed the Constitution of the United States; and being so, the State govern- ments have the power of absoiving their citizens from their obliffat,ions to the Fed (i ral corn l)act which the State entered ; and when lhc State absolves its citizcns from their obligation to the Federal compact which the State entered into and formed, t.hoy become as corn foreign to this as Franco or nd
Mr
TRUMEULL
Mr
President, 1 that the Stales are as sovereiffl) as when they formed this Government
The States are 
sov- creiffll as to their reserved rights; but the rights they surrendered up to the Fedcral Gov6rrnnent do not now belong' to thc States
Certain rirrbts were surrendered when this Government, v,vas made, and this Constitution was formcd; but the State of Virginia, when sbc gave het• assent to this Constitution—or rather the people of the State of Virginia, when they gave their assent to this Constitution—agreed that it should be thc supremo law of the land, any law or any consti- tiltion of her State to the contrary m o twit h stan d i n b —I carc not w I'lether you call It an ord inanee or not
Is that superior to the con- stitution your State
You have surrendered up that power, and you have no ponrer to absolve yourselves from that allecrianc,o
'While, t tore, pn onc talks of war against a otate, that I anl aware of, and no one rococrn :zes, I ti•ust, t ho rkht of any- e:ate to put herself into n position w here Nvar be declared against l) or, ! under- stand that Constitution of the United Sttues, and the laws in pursuance of it, are the supreme law of the land, and that all officers are sworn to see them faithfullv executed
Now, sir, I tun sorry to have been drawn a.side to have said this much upon a resoluti()!] of inere I am especially surprised at the remark of the 'Senator from Mississippi, who represents the imbecility of this Government to be such that it has no power to protect its public property; no nower over the arsenals, and over the public forts ceded to the Federal Government by the States, and over which, by the Constitution, it has ex- clusive jurisdiction
It has no power whatever there; but it is at the mercy Mr
DAVIS
I)oes the Senator refer to me
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 do
Did 1 say so
Mr
TRUMBULL
1 understood the Senator the Territories—none whatever
The Territories from Mississippi to say that the Federal Govern- belong to the General Government, and no State ment had no power, or the President, perhaps, has any right whatever in a Territory, as a State
had no power to reinforce the garrisons at Charles- Nobody proposps to declare war arrainst a State
That would adn)it at once that the State '*vas out of the Union— a foreigrl Government
•Of course, we cannot declare war acrainst a State
Nobody proposes to coerce a State, or to convict a State of treason
You cani'10t arrai(rn a State for trial ; you cannot convict it or punish it.; but you can punish individuals
I trust the public 11)ind is not to bc misled or confused by this idea of cocrcincy ; States
Men who violate the laws of the country are amenable to those
laws, and if found guilty of the Union, she would possess to repel by force of violating the provisions of law they must sufiin• the invasion of her rights and the disturbance of her tranquiliity

I trust
that these troops arc to pert•ort-n [he ordinary, and, so- far as our own country is involved, the peace able function of holding that fort until transferred if tlhcre be danger, permit me tct other duty; bau here to say it is bccausc there are troops in it, not I the penalt.ies of' the lasv

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
167 received a letter from the agent hero, which sat- ;sfies me that, individually, he had no concern in this matter; but, there are agents all over the coun- try who belong to one body, and a comrnon re- sponsibility should attach, to them all
The agent here has given me no such assurancc as is satis- factory, that the true author of' this fabrication will be exposed and punished
Under these cir- cumstances, i offer the following resolution, and 
will allow three or four days to elapse beforc I call for action upon it, in order that they may have an opportunity of explaining: Resol.eed

With the consent of the Senate, I desire to say just one word in regard to the personal matter alluded to by the Senator from Louisiana
I have received a note from the agent of the associated press statii)ff that the dispatch the Senator yesterday alludei to was not trans- mitted throu«h the associated press of this city, and that he is altogether iamnorant of the source of It is due to him, I think, that that the dispatch

Mr
PUGH addressed the Senate
[His speech will be published in the Appendix.] Mr
NICHOLSON
Mr
President, 1 believe it is the general understanding that we shall give way to the Senator from Maryland, [MI'
KEN- I NEDY•,] and I therefore movc that the further con- I siderati01) of this question be postponed, with the view of taking up the bill which the Senator from I'vlarylnnd desires to have taken up
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr
in the chair.) The question is on postponing the joint resolution now .before tl'le Senate
Mr
DOOLITTLE
Did 1 understand from the Senator from Tennessee tliat the Senator from Mississippi desired to take the floor upon this resolution
Mr
DAVIS
No, sir
Mr
DOOLITTLE
Then, Mr
President, before this motion is passed to postpone this res- olution, with the leave of thc Senator from Ten- nesscc, desire to take the floor to make some remarks to the Senate upon this subject; but I will yield with the understanding that I shall have the floor upon this question to-morrow, or when it next comes beforc the Senate
Mr
DAVIS
I will answer the Senator from Wisconsin with reference to myself
The Sen- ator from Tennessee proposes to' take the floor, but to postpone the immediate consideration of the subject, in order that the Senator from Mary- land may have a bill considered which he has 
asked us to consider
Mr
DOOLITTLE
1 did not hear the lan- guage of the Senator from Tennessee
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on postponing the further consideration of the resolution beforc the Senate

Then 1 understand the Senator from 'I'ennessee has taken the floor upon the question that is pending 
Mr

Yes, sir; and 1 move to postponc it, with a view of allowing thc Senator f'rom Maryland to take up the bill indicated by The motion to postpone was agreed to
WEST POINT COMMISSION
Mr
FITCH
With the of the Sen- atcn• from Maryland, before his bill conus up, I desire to make a few brief reports from thc Com- mittee on Printintr
A resolution was referred to I the Committee on Printing, which was introduced I by the Senator from Vermont, [Mr
F00T,] rel- ative to the printing of the report of the commis- Sion appointed under the eighth section of the act of Congress of June 21, 1860, to examine the orgtu-)ization and system of discipline and course of instruction in the United States Military Acad- emy at West Point
They report it back, and ask for its adoption
'l'hc resolution was considered, and adopted, as follows: Resolced, 'That fivc thousand additional copies of the pointed under the eighth section of the act of Congress of June 21, 18150, to examine into the organization, system of discipline, and course of instruction, of the United States Military Acadetny at West Point, be printed
COLUMBIAN INSTITUTION
Mr
FITCH
The Secretary of the Interior, in asking for the publication of certain reports himself, as the
head of that Department, omitted to ask for additional numbers of the re- port of the pre.sident of tho Columbian Institu- tion for thc Deaf and Dumb and the Blind; but has to-day made a request that five hundred extra conies of that report bc printed
I submit the foflowing resolution on the subject: Resoh:ed, 'l*hat five hurldred additional copies of the report of the president of thc Colu•nbian Institution for the, Deaf and and Blind be printed for the use ofthat officer, aud s') rnueh of the late annual report of the Secretary of Interior reiates to the saine subject be printed therewith
The resolution was considered by unanimous and acrreed to
consent, ON INDIAN error occurred in a FITI'CYI
A ciemc.al prcv:ous report of (he conunlteee
relative to ex- tra numbers of the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs
The error was that of the clerk of the Committee on Printing
It should haye asked for two thousand copies; the usual- c*trå number, but it erroneously as'kéd for ono thou- sand
Isimply move the correction Of the error
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The correction can be made by unanimous consent.' The Chait hears no objection, and the correction z will be made
ADMIss10N TO FLOOR
Mr
BROWN
Before to the sideration of the bill of the Senator from Marye land, I ask the adoption of the following resolu- tion, xxvhich has relation to the subject: Resolved, That the Mayors of Georgetown and Wasl*- ington cities be aflowed the privilege of the flour of tho Senate on occasions when business relating to the District of Columbia is under consideration
Thcrc is a marked propriety in the resolution
I suppose there will be no objection to _it, and I shall not say anything about it
I take it for granted that everybody will agree to it
The resolution was considered by unanimous consent, and agreed to
ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY
Mr
PEARCE
I move that when the Senate adjourns to-day, it adjourn to meet on Monday next
Mr
CAMERON
Before the question is put on that motion, I desire to suggest that when we meet on Monday, we adjourn over again for three days, and so continue until the 2d of January
I hope that we .may have an understanding of that kind, so that gentlemen who desire to gcraway can dp so without the likelihood of, measures coming up in their absence
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator so ropose to amend the motion 
Mr
8AMERON
do
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Is the Senate prepared for the question on this motion 
Mr
DAVIS
I do
not know that we shall achieve much good by meeting; but in the pres- ent perilous condition of the country, I am not willing 10 takc a holiday
I propose that we shall continue our sessions good, if God grant it, and for evil, if wo will have it so
Mr
CAMERON
Ido not apprehend any evil from an adjournment of a day or two
I think a great deal of good may follow from allowing us to go 1101110, and seeing those who sent us here
Lct us get the wholesome influences of the fire- I sides of our constituents, and the good people who are
not in this strife; and let cach onc of us spend these Christrnas days as every man ought, with his wife, his children, and his grandchildren around him
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The question is on the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania
Mr
CLINGMAN
1 hope it will be stated
I wish to know exactly what the amendment is
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator from Maryland moved that when .thb Senate ad- journs to-day, it adjourn to meet On Monday next
The Senator from Pennsylvania moves to amend that motion by adding, that when the Senate journs on Monday next, it be to the Thursday fbllowino••, and when it adjourns on that day, It I bc to meet on the föllowing Monday
Mr
CLINGMAN
1 hope that will not be done
It will oblige gentlemen who choose to If a majority choose to attend to stay here
adjourn ovcr for one or two weeks, I have no ob- jection; but do not like meeting nominally every third day
I do not think it fair anyhow
It seems to me not to be carrying out that provision of the Constitution which provides that an adjournment shall not take place for more than thi•ee days
If we intend to do business, it is in- convenient to meet every third day to do it; and if we do not intend to do it, it is an evasion of that clausc of the Constitution
Mr
MASON
Let the amendment be reported by the Secretary
The PRESIDING OFFICER
will be read

As to the remark which I made in reference to the adjournment over from this time until next Monday, and then over again until Thursday, and then acrain until Monday, I i desired, if we should take such a recess, that we should adjourn by joint resolution and moot, the question fairly, so that if the House should con- cur with us, those who desire to go home may I have an opportunity to do so
It docs not con- sult my personal convenience
For myself, I shall reli)ain here during the whole of this period if the Senate docs adjourn; and would just as mark
r I' he Chair has found a great deal of diffi- culty in framing the committee, but has tried to compose it in the spirit which he believes actuated the Senate in ordering its appointment
be observed that upon this committee are two Sen- ators fi•om one Sta te
This ',vas unavoidable
Of course the author of the resolutions becomes the chairman of the committee; and I am sure the Senate will, for many reasons, recoonize the fact that it was proper that the eminent senior Senator from Kentucky should also be a member of that connnittee.

I thought it right to say thus much, lest, after hearing the views of the Senator, and not taking a part in the discussion, and voting with him a«yainst the ad- journment, my opinions might be misunderstood my own State or elsewhere

I hardly know how to reply, for I •wras not certain whether his rern„grks applied to me or not

I design to go on with it at sorne time
I have postponed it since the last ses- sion, on an objection raised by gentlemen on the other side, that they were not ready
I am now disposed to go on with the bill

1 the in- qniry for the reason that the Senatcm:ght under- stand, if the bill is gone on Wilh now, they irxay stay some time to attend to it; for I have many amendments to propose to it, and it will, of course, occosion a great deal of discussion
I have no objection if gentlctnen wish to consider it now
Mr
HUNTER
We may as well begin with it
Mr
KENNEDY
We may not get through with it; but want to begin it somewhere
The
bill has been postponed from time to time since the last session of Congress on an objection raised by gentlemen on the other side, that they have not had time to look into it.
By a common un- derstanding, it was agreed this morning that we should take this bill and at least begin with it after the spceeh of the honorable Senator from If we are to be postponed from day to day, I see no prospect whatever of accomplishing the purpose that we have in view

He cannot explain it now in the st.ate of the Senate

such so to Federal as w i' i all {he a na abi\itv of the Lar ments to takc such officers as t.nev (tan Theso are of the (hstrict coacts United States; and, in point of dignity and gcade,  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE, THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN THIRTY-SIXTH CONGRESS, 2D SESSION
they stand upon an equality with the.judgcs of the court of common pleas of the State of Ohio
An appeal going from those courts lies to the cir- Ouit court of the United States in the State
Cer- tainly that circuit court is not of higher grade than the supreme court of the State
The salary of the judges ofthc court of common pleas is $1,500 annually, and their duties are much more arduous than those of the district judges in the State
S a general rule the judges of the court of com on pleas have more cases, more labor, and e ploy more time in the discharge of
their du s, than the 4istrict judges of the United Sta s courts
'The district judges of the United ates courts now receive $2,500 ore than is received by the judges of the c rt of common pleae
Mr
HARRIS, of Marylan I would inquire of thc gentleman from Ohio whether hc considers $1,500 a reasonable compensation for the services of those judges; and if he does not, whether he considers that a proper argument against increas- fing the salaries of the judges of the district courts of "the United States in Ohio
Mr
STANTON
The Legislature of the State of Ohio is the proper of what is an adequate compensation for the judicial officers of the State
My objection is not to the fact that the salary is too high or too low; but there ought always to be a reasonable and fair proportion between the salaries of the State and the salaries of the Fed- eral offcers
Now, because the Federal Govern- ment is able to pay higher salaries to its officers, is no reason why we should adopt a line of policy that is calculated to degrade the State tribunals, and bring them into the contempt of the people of the State, and withdraw their confidence in the State government
I am a State-rights mari, and in favor of maintaining the honor and dignity of the State
Mr
MAYNARD
I would inquire of the gen- tleman from Ohio whether tho district judges are not required to discharge certain extra duties in the absence of the circuit judges
Mr
STANTON
Ceriainly
The salaries of the supreme court judges of the State are $3,000 per annum
Mr
PENDLETON
would ask the gentle- man if the salary of the judge of tho cornmon pleas court in Cincinnati not $2,500
Mr
STANTON
1 understand that busi- ness
The county of Hamilton, which includes Cincinnati, pays the judges of that particular dis- trict, out of its county treasury, a salary over and above what is paid them out of the State treasury, and in that way they realize a larger salary; and if, all over the State, the judges had the same sal- aries, there would be a propriety in putting the district judges on the same footing; but I do not think it is proper to adopt such a policy as will not maintmn the dignity and respectability of the State tribunals
The judges sliould not be de- graded by being put in a subordinate position by boing paid lower salaries than is paid to the Fed- eral offcers
Now, sir, I do not believe you will have any diMculty in getting judges at the present rate of salary
They are appointed for life, and if the present judges are not satisficd with $2,500, let them resign
There are plenty of gentlemen who will take the offees at that price, and I do not believe that either of these judges could make half as much money in the practice of the law
This thing of crying out about the smallness of the salaries of men who hold life offices, is all nonsense while they continue to hold them
There is no compulsion
There is no obligation resting upon them to retain their offices
They can resign, and there arc plenty of gentiemen who will take the places for the same salaries, and discharge the duties with quite as muclH1bility as 'Ihey are very clever gen- these gentlemen do
tlemen, büt they by no means belong to the rank in the profession in Ohio—neiiher of them; and my colleague will not deny that
I hope the bill will not pass
Mr
PENDLETON
Mr
Speaker, 1 hope that 11 SATURDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1860
this bill will pass
It does but justice to the men who hold the offices to which the salary is in- tended to apply
It only puts them upon the same grade, so fat as that district is concerned from which I come, as our own judges; and it pays them a compensation for their service correspond- ing with that which gentlemen of equal rank in the profession hold ing ourcountyjudgeships have
It does nothing more
I call the attention of the gentlemap and of the House to the fact that while we propose to in- crease the salaries of these iudges, we impose apon them additional labors
We fequire the:n to hold two additional terms of their courts in parts of t.he State in each year—one at Columbus and one at Toledo; and it is a notorious fact, so far as the southern district of Ohio is -concerned, that the judge of that court performs as much labor as any other judge in the State; perhaps more
He has less vacation, less time for atten- tion to his private affairs; he has less opportunity to recuperate his health and strength than any other judge in the State
I have placed in the hands of my colleague on the Judiciary Committee [Mr
BINGHAM] a state- ment, verified by the clerk of the court, showino• how many days in each year he has been com- pelled, for a number of years past, to hold his dis- trict court, and, in the absence of Judge McLean in other States, to hold the circuit court likewise
Mr
STANTON
Is not my colleague aware that ali the judges of the supreme court of the State are taxed to their utmost energies, and that they cannot discharge their duties and do all the business; tl')at the cases on the docket of the su- preme court are accumulating; that the judges do as rnuch work as they cun by any possibility do, and that they cannot keep up with the docket
How, then, can he say that the district judge does more than they do
Mr
PENDLETON
Because 1 believe he docs more work
'That is the reason
I say that the judges of the supreme court of the Slate of Ohio have as much work as they ought to have; they have more; they are not able properly to do all the work devolved on them; but my coi- league knows that it is not compulsory on them to hold district courts in the different counties
I have known cases in my own county svhere a supreme judge has 110t been present during a wholc term of the district court
They can omit that part of their duty
There is nothing com- pulsory on them in that respect, and they do frequently omit the performance of it
That is not the case, however, with the United States district judge
He sits alone; there is nobody to take his place, and it is notorious in our-scct.ion of the State that thc district judge is obliged to hold his district and circuit courts more days in the year, I believe, than any other judge in the State
Now, sir, my colleague says that he would not have tlue salaries of corresponding officers higher in thc Federal Government than in the State gov- ernmcnts
My friend was probably here when the compensation of members of Congress was increased
Did he forget that he stands only on a par with tbe members of the State Legisiaturc at home, and that they receive no such compen- sation as we do
It will not do to Carry this thing throughout
The gentleman himself would not do it, and I appeal to the House not to give to that argument greater weight than it iseutitled to Mr
STANTON
The gentleman will permit I desire to I rne to makea remark at that point
say that i voted against the bill increasing the pay of members of Congress precisely on the principle that opposed to increasing the pay of Federal judges, bécause I did not want Fed- eral offc.ials of any description paid so much higher tl'kan Stale officials; and I would vote to-
day to put the, compensation of members of Con- gress back where it {vas before that bill passed
Mr
PENDLETON
1 have doubt my colleague hus been very consistent, in his votes
Has hc bcen quite as consistent in his action un- I der the law, for that is within his control, cer- C
RIVES, WASHING(iON, C
SERies...;..N.o: tainly
ThO' question -is suggested to me not the President of- the ha.vé:tä little more compensation than üe Governor.ot•fa State
But, Mr: Speaker, let ns go a little further: you impose upon the judges of somc- of' these courts the necessity of living in a city: like -Cin- cinnati, where utoriously the expense of' •livin"o is double what 'it is in the; töwn from which: my colleague comes
- Will you give them
the same salary, when you create -a necessity for double expense
NOW, a noere matter of: iuStiee; is a matter that appeals to the justice Otfthe Houseb Shall the judges of the:Federal courts within the State of O'hio be put upon judges in- the surrounding States.d' Will-you-give them- salary enough to enable them
cently and properly, and place- thenY.upon zai•i equal footing With the judges off the 'tate- cou-rt•s in these localities
; The argument of rhy col}eaguo would require the judge in, the.ci!y of Cincinnati, who holds courts three hundred and forty days out of the three hundred and sixty-five, or three hundred, omitting Sundays, (laughter,] and is subjected to all the expenses attendant upon city life, -to do that and receive no moré pay than {f he
lived and held courts in the town where my colleague resides
I did not mean, by what ÉI said just now, to chargeJudge Leavitt with hold* ing court on Sunday; but I mean to say thai, omitting Sundays,-he holds; eaurt more days- in, the year than any other judge -in the State
Mr
COX
Mr.
Speaker, ,hold in my hand a certificxte from the clerk of the circuit and dis- trict courts for the southern district ofOhiö
I:can thcreforc speak, from statistics,•: as:to -the laböF8 performed by the judge for
that•.district•, Froi this paper it appears that thoinumbeli of cases on the dockets of the circuit and district courts on the 1st of October, 18.58, was 322; in chanOery; 43; at common law, 236; in-admiralty, 29; crim- inal cases, 14; judgmentsentered during that:time 155; jury trials within that year, 98; amount ot judgments rendered, $244,592 37
T.he number of days court was in session' from October L 1858, to October I, 1859, was 222; the ,number of days the court has been in session from October l, 1859, to March 20, 1860-, is 94
Leaving out the Sabbaths, this would be as much actual-serviee as any judge ought to perform for the proposed salary
Now, I believe that no iudge of the Ohio State courts does more than haif as much business as is performed by tlE district judge at Cineinnfiti", and this bill proposes to impose upon .himtaddi•
tional duties and other burdens
This sjqdgel•is to hold a courtat Columbus
Thére •will thereby bo a •largo expense saved •to the people of: the cen- tral- part of the State in- their
litigation, by this pro• vision
The capitol ofObiowas formerly the seat of the United States cöurt
It was only removed thence in 1854
The State of Ohio and the city of Columbus, for twenty years, furnished, free of rent, a •building for this United States court, and the Offccrs thereof
A business connected with the Uni ted States courts, in patent cases especially, grew up in the center of Ohio, to settle which at Cincinnati has been a large expense to litigants and witnesses
The increase of the salary of the judges proposed by this bili will thus have its am- ple consideration
My colleague [Mr
STANTON] says that hc is opposed to this increase ofxsalaty, and that he was opposed to the bill increasing the compensation of membcrs of Congress
Bui I,vould he vote just now to cut it down
am, afraid my colleague would -not go into the offce of the Sergean t-at-Arms voluntarily-and-pay back- the money he has received in thc shapc Of addi-.- tional compensation ! But, sir, has my colleague looked into this busi-,- ness which the Com rnittee on the Judiciary(liås inquired into so carefully
Has he.examinedthey tables, from both of these districts, showing, the business in these•courts
Or
has he -opposed, the bill, as I think, inconsiderately 2 Heosays that there ought to bea tariffOfsalarieSfixed, so as to  162 square with the sålm•ieS of the Statejudges
Now, if that done,- Mr
Speaker; you wbuld have to reform all your salaries of the district judges throughout the United States
You can have no In fixed and uniform rule as to salaries at all
somc of the States the salaries of the district judges are as large, and in Son-10 perhaps loss, than the amotin-t proposed by this bill
The truc rule of legislation in such matters, is: is the sal- ary an adequate compensat.ion for tho quantity and kind of business and for the dignity of the ofhce
Any other st.andard is unworthy of seri- ous legislation
-'Tliis bill only proposes to raise tho salaries of thc district: judges of Ohio up to the Salary of Lire norLhern distriyl judge for the in the district State of a year
of -Wisconsin, where thero is not so much busi- ness done as is done in either the northern or southern district of Ohio, the judges receive a In the District of Co- salary of $3,000 a year
lumbia, where, I venturc to say, the judges do not sit as many days in the year as either of the district judges of öhio, they receive $3,500 per annum
You cannot take the salaries of judges fixed by State Legislatures, under alk sorts of par- tisan (lemaoo«istn, the purpose of breaking down a good judiciary, as the basis of a calcula- tion for thc salaries of these United States judges
The district judge of the northern distr.ict of Ohio has all the- business incident to the criminal pro- cedure of the United States, and in patent cases, and to the, large- amount of admiralty cases aris- ing fronythe commerce of the lakes
It is sitting almost every •day in the ycar, cither in court or It does Federal business for in chambers
the half of a State of two and a half million peo- plc, having a large commerce and extensive inter- It is the same in the southern State intercourse
district of' Ohio
In addition to his other duties, the judge has to attend to the large admiralty business arising out of the Ohio river, and this business involves important questions and large amounts of rnoney
_From the statistics which were carefully examined by thc chairman of the judiciary Committee, that committec was unani- mously of opinion that the salary of these ju(lges I think, even without should be $3,500 a year
the additional duties
imposed , the salary is not exorbitant
Compared witli the salaries of tl'\e judges of the superior courts of Cincinnati and Columbus, it is not more than adequate
But, Mr
Speaker, therc is, as I say, an addi- tional labor Imposed upon these judges
'Ithe nortl•nern judge, by this bill, is compelled to travel to 'l'o\cdo, whicl'i has growl') beyond any c.ity in the West since the last census, and is now a con- spicuous point of commercial and grain business on our lakes, having a Itu•oe admiralty business
'I'he dis- He is compelled to hold 'court thero trict judge of southern Ohio is also compelled to travel from Cincinnati to Columbus, there to hold court at least once a year, for ,ihc convenience of thc public, and for the con venience the o•ent.lc- man 's [Mr
STANTON] owli const.ituents
in this House an hope and trust that it' there be appreciation of nn honest, finu•loss, and upright judiciary, it will bc demonstrated by giving a thir 'l'he gcnt-lemen compensation to these iadqes
Who fill these positions in Ohio are not such us my friend has described them
They are learned in tho law, nblo, honest, and upright judges; and I hope they will not reccivc a repulse from any Ohio member
Mr
SIMMS
Is it in order now to inovc to amend th6 bill
The SPEAKER
It is
Mr
SIMMS
Then I move to amend the first section of tl•xe bill, by inserting after the word Ohio," the words and Kentucky." My ob- ject in oflZring this amendment is not to preju- dice the bill reported from the Committee on the Judiciary
1 think that, above all the other pub- lic officers, the judges of our courts should bc well paid; not only the judges of the United Slates courts, but tbc judges of the State courts
There should be such salaries attached to the position as would justify the best legal talent of the coun- try in undertaking the duties of that offce
*The amendrnent offered by me to this bill I base on this o•round.• the State of Kentuckv has but one district judge of the United States—the v,rhole State composintr one district
The judge of that large district rnceives for his services #2,500 I'he State of Florida, with less popu„ a year
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 20, lation, and with less business to be transacted, has two United States judges, who rveceive be- tween them $5,250 per year
The Slato of Mis- souri has also two judges, receiving between them $5,000 per ycar
The Stato of Alabama, with a population not equal to that of Kentucky, and with less judicial business, V the jud«o there re- ceives $2,i50 per year
Now, I think that it is perfectly fair and right that, since thc districtjudxe for thc State of Kentucky has to perform all the duties of his office for the whole State—a labor certainly equal to that performed by•any other -in the southern or middle States—his salary should be increased so as to make it at Icast equal to that proposed by this bill to be given to thc move my district judge of Ohio
amendment, to make the salary of the district jud(re
of Kentucky #3,500 a year
Mr
HOLMAN
I suggest to the gentleman from Kentucky that hc shall amend his proposi- tion so as to embrace within it the district judge of the State of Indiana
Mr
SIMMS
I agree to that suggestion; be- cause the State of Indiana, which is one of the largest western States, has but onc district judge, and think it but right that his salary should be increased
I modify rny amendment accordinffly
Mr
SHERMAN
1 desire to submit a priv- ilcged motion

SPEAKER
The Chair understood the gentleman from Ohio to rise to a point of order
Mr
BINGHAM
My point of order is: that thc amendment of the gentleman from Kentucky is not germane to the bill at all
This is a bill for increasing the salaries of the judges for the northern and southern districts of Ohio
The gentlmnun proposes to arncnd it by introducinry legislation touching thc salary of the district judge for the district of Kentucky
That is not in order

I understood from the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means that the committees would not be called this morning, but that the House would at once go into the Committee of the Whole on the Pacific railroad bill

The SPEAKER

Mr

Iwant,asl have said, to have the bill specified on which the debate is to be terminated
I think we might as well settle the question here, to '•.vhat bill the 11101ion refers
Mr

Mr

1 deny that that is the bill pending in the Committee of the Whole on the I deny the fact upon which state of the Union
the gentleman's motion is based; and I deny that the 1110tion in the ibrm in which the gentleman states it is in order; because it is based upon a fact of which thc Speaker of this House can have no knowle&e
He cannot know what is pending in the Committee of the Whole on the state of If the gentlcrnan from Ohio will put the Uni01'1
his motion in the alternative, to close debate upon the Pacific railroad bill, provi4ed that is the bill pending in committee, I will not object to it; but I do object to the question being decided here in the House as to what is pending in the Commit- vole by which the resolution for adjournment •was tee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The rejected yesterday

the Calendar; but when -Objection is made to the consid- eration of a bill, a majority of _tbe committec shall' decide, without debate, -Whether it shall be taken up and disposed of, or laid aside." Now, I find that when the committee was in session on a previous day, a bill was taken up in committee, and, was under consideration when thecommittee rose
The gentleman will see, there- fore, that when the House again goes into com- mittee, the bill which was then under considera- tion, and which was reached on motion of the gentlenun from Iowa, will again.comeunder con- sideration as the business pending
The SPEAKER
The question is on the mo- tion of the gentleman from Ohio, that the general debate close on the bill pending in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union in ten minutes after the committee shall resume the con- sideration of the same
Mr
REAGAN
1 think there seems to be some misunderstanding as to whether this motion ap- plies to the original bill which was taken up m committee, or to some amendments which were offered in committee
Mr
GROW
1 obiectto all debate
The SPEAKER
Debate is not in order
The question was taken upon the motion to closc debate; and the motion was agreed to
Mr
SHERMAN
Now, Mr
Speaker, 1 ask for the vote upon the motion to go into the Com- mittec of the Whole on the state of the Union
The motion was agreed to
So the rules were suspended; and the House resolved itself into the Cormittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
GRow in the chair.) The CHAIRMAN
When the committee was last in session, it had under consideration House bill No
701, granting lands in alternate sections to aid in the construction of certain railroads in
the Territory of Nebraska
Mr
BRANCH
1 object to taking up that bill
I claim that, under the 114th rule of the House, the Chairman must commence the call of the bills in the ordcr in which they stand on the Calendar
The rule is in these words: In Committee of the Whole on the state oc the Union the bills shall be taken up arid disposed of in their order on the Catendar ; but when objection is ntade to the considera- tion ofa bill a Inajority shall decide
without debate,wbetljer it shall be taken up and disposed Of or laid aside." Now, I make the point that, under that rule, the Chair must commence the call of tl'le bills in the order in which they stand on the Calendar, com- mencing at the head
In addition to that, 1 make this point; that this committee cannot know what has taken place in any former committee
The committec keeps no record, and it is impossible to know what has taken place, or what was under consideration at the time the committee rose
And, Mr
Chairman, I make this third point: that at t.be, last time the committee was in session, it did not have under consideration this bill at all
It had under consideration the deficiency bill, which was passed in the House yesterday
Now, I know that, under the 56th rule, it was claimed the other day that the CommiJtee of the Whole must take up business where it was left off on the previous day; but if the Chair will refer to that 56th rule, he will find that it refers •exclusively to the order of business in the House
It
has no reference to the proceedings in the Com- mittee of the Whole, at all
By the rule applying in committee, we must commence at the head of It is true that it has sometimes the Calendar
been held that the committee must resumc its business where it left off on the preceding day
But that does not settle this question, because, as I" have said, the committee keeps no record; and, although it, may happcn that the same gentleman may now be in the chair who was in the chair when the Pacific railroad was u•ndeu• considera- tion, yet the records of the House will show that when the House was läst in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, thevrescnt cupant of the chair did not preside, but the chair was occupied by a gentleman from the State of Virginia; and that not the Pacific railroad bill, but the deficiencv bill was under consideration
Mr
SICKLES
The deficiency bill, to which I the gentleman refers, was before the Committee Of the Whole as a special order of die House; and it is therefore true that, when the committee it, this bill was under consideration; and that is the question which we have got to consider
Now, if the gentleman wili refer to what follows rule 114, in the Manual, he will see it is stated that— Where a bill has been taken up and is left
u'ldisposed of at the rising of the committee, it is the buSincss first in order when the House shall again resolve itself into' eom• rnittce." That expressly decides the point now under consideration
And as to the fact, that there is no offciai record, I think that is ari extremely technical objection upon a point Of hypothesis
While it is true that we have no journal of the proceedings of the Committee of the Whole, but a record of the proceedings of the committee in the offcial report made and recognized by the House as offcial, the Globe does contain an offcial record of our proceedings in committee; and therefore I say, that the fact- is clearly -befote the Chair that this bill was before thc committee when it was last in session
Mr
BRANCH
1 will not pretend to- doubt the correctness of the Manual of our excellent Journal Clerk, but it does not meet the point I have presented
Mr
SICKLES
If the gentleman from Noéth Carolina will permit me, I will suggest that it is also provided by -the rules of thc Housc that they shall have force m the Committee of the Whole, so far as the may be applicable
Mr
BRANCH
One point has been made by I admit that a the gentleman from New York
business in order at the rising of the committee, provided there wore means (f -finding out offcially from the record what that business was, would come up at the next session of the Committec
But, sir, by an order of the House on yesterday, making the deficiency appropriation bill u special order in the Committee of the Wholc on the stutc of the Union, the committee was discharged from the consideration of the unfinished business
The very act of making a special order in the com- mittee yesterday by a vote of the House, dis- charged the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union from the business which wasthen pending, and which would have been the unfin- Ished business of the day before
The record of the House shows all the facts upon which my point of order can be based
It shows no part of the facts upon which it is claimed that this Pacific railroad bill must be taken up
The gentleman from New York says that the facts are published in the Daily Globe
The gen- tlcman is too good a lawyer to contend that the Daiiy Globe is a record ih any sense of the word It is certainly not an offcial record of this at ail
House, and cannot be used as such
Our pro- ceedings are also publisbcd in the daily newspa- pers of the city o
New York, and they could not be brought here to prove to this House what is the business in order
You can no more bring the Daily Globe here to show,' what is, the busi- ness in order, and to show what is the condition of the business of this House, than the New York daily newspapers
The Journal of •the House, which •is•kept by your Journal' Clerk, is the only record that can be recognized, either by the House or this committee
By that Journal it is shown that-day before yesterday thc House went into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and that the Chairman, upon the rising of the committee, (the same gentleman who happens to-day to occupy the chair,) reported, that the Committec of the Whole on the state of the Union had, according to order, had the Union oenerally under consideration, and particularly the Pacific railroad bill, and had coine to no con- clusion thereon
Under the clausc read by tho gentleman from New York, that fact would have rnade the Pacific railroad bill the first business in order when the House again resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Admit that
There is, then, this additional fact: that -the House, seeing that the Committee of the Whole qn the state of the Union was blocked up witli the Pacific railroad bill, and desiring that the com- mittee should not again take it up, ordered that i whcn the House resolved itself-into thO Commit- I tee of the Whole on the state of the Union, it should take up the deficiency appropriation bill
By that order, sir, I insist that the House dis- charged thc Committee of the Whole on the state was lastin session upon the general ordcrs before i of the Union from t.he consideration of the Pacific railroad bill-
-the.bi-xs}-- ness regularly in- order 
Pacific, railroad bill, rana bee-n considered but for the •orde4rfoÉ'Æthe2 stand' to it that the: HOuse, by upöh: the reCOrd, and whiCh tb the committee, did mittee of the W-hOle on the slate from the considerationöf Pacifie railröad\bil)-, and order the' committee 'to-go ori 'with'thré• &åfi- ciency appropriation bill

lands' t'O aid ih the construétionb Of Certain Éailroads, in the Territory of Nebraska; it being the unfinished business before the committee at its last session
The gentleman from North Carolina rises to •a point of ordef, stating that vghen the committee was •last in session it had "the deficiency appro- priation bill' under consideration, and that, con- sequentiy, this railroad bill could not•be the un- finished business' before the committee
The Chair overrules the point of order.' The Journal kept by the Clerk shows that thé Chairman ported, on the rising of the cdnimiiteé/:thatit-ha-d under consideration this railroad bill ätid» htatl come to no conclusion -thereon
o The- next', day the House Ordered the deficiency appr6Priatiön bill to be considered in the committeeaSä.SPeeiål rn the opinion Of -the Chaif, that oi•der order
only held the regular order of -business in- 'abey- ance• until -tlie deficiency appropriation bill 'WAYS disposed of
Undmi -the rules they stand it is provided that* whenever a;class Of business is again reached which wag left• uznfinished, either in the House or committee, it must be resumed where it wds left off
The rules of the House, as has been stated, have force in the committee so ftu• as they are applicable
In this case they do apply to the extent of resuming the business which was for a time interfered with by a special order
The Chair overrules the point Of ordei•, and decides that the pending railroad bill, being the unfinished business before the committee, is now proper}y under consideration

The CHAIRMAN
The Chair overrules the point of order, and decides that the amcndmcnts are roperly in order to this bill
WI
REAGAN
I do not think that the Chair understands the point of order
The CHAIRMAN
Debate is not in order
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I do not propose to debate the point of order, but I presume that it is in order for me to state it
The CHAIRMAN

The Chair overrules the point of order

DAVIS, oflndiana, 1 do
Mr
JONES
If these amendments can bc of- fered at this time or before the bill was read by sections what, then, was the use of going through the Formality of reading it by sections 
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from ln- diana moves that the bill be laid aside to be reported to the House with the recommendation that it do pass, while amendments are pending
The Chair decides that the motion is not in order until the amendments are disposed of
From that decision the gentleman takes an appeal
'l'he question now Is: Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the committee 
' ' Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I hope that the Chair will state further, that tho amendments were of- fered before the bill was read, and that it is not in order to propose an amendment until the Clerk reads the bill by sections for that purpose
The CHAIRMAN
It •has been customary to offer amendments in the nature of substitutes, just as these were offered, The committee was divided; and there were— ayes 87, noes 32
So the decision of thc Chair was sustained
The CHAIRMAN
The question is upon the amendment to the amendment
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I made a point of order upon the amendment, and I desire to have the amendment read 
The CHAIRMAN
Does the gentleman desire that the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Ohio shall be first read, and then tl'ie amend- ment proposed by the gentleman from Iowa
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
Yes, sir
The Clerk commenced the reading of the amend- ment
Mr
REAGAN
1 desire to inquire if that bill is bill No
835
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair docs not know
He appeals to tl'ie comrnittee to lislen to the bill as read by the Clerk, and then they will know It is the amendment proposed by tille what it is
gentleman from Ohio to strike out and insert
The Clerk resumed the reading
MI'
REAGAN
suppose that we all desire common fiiirness, and my object is to know whether the gentleman from Ohio offered, as a substitute to the pendil')g bill, bill No
835, word -for word
The CHAIRMAN
The Clerk is reading the arnendmcnt of the gentlcmun from Ohio
Mr
CURTIS
1 would suggest that the ing of the substitute be discontinued, and that my amendment be read, because that is the one upon which we will have to vote first
Mr
REAGAN
I ask if the amendmcnt is not the same as the substitute 
Mr
CURTIS
It is not
The amendment and the substitute are different
The CHAIRMAN
All this conversation is out of order
When a gentleman calls for the reading of a paper, it is the business of the Clerk Lo read it
Mr
CURTIS
I wish to say, with the indul- gence of the House, that there can be nothing accomplished by reading the substi tute of the gen- tleman from Ohio
A vote first be taken, I suppose, unless some mode is found to prevent it, upon my substitute for his substitute
The two are different
I hope, therefore, that the amend- ment will be read which will be first voted on
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I withdraw 11) y call for the reading of the amendment, and will sub- mit my point of order
Mr
McCLERNAND
Did thegentleman from Ohio propose a sub*titute for the original bill 
The CHAIRMAN
He did; and the gentle- man from Iowa moved to strike out all after the enacting clause, and to insert
McCLERNAND
Then there is only one amendment to the bill pending
The CHAIRMAN
There is onc substitute to the original bill pending, and an amendment to the substitute
Mr
McCLERNAND
The proposition is to amend the substitute, and not the original bill
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair states that the original bill has been read through by sections for amendments, and any amendment proper to be made at the end of the bill can be received still; but the committee cannot go back and propose amendments to the previous sections
Mr
BRANCH
I suppose thatn point of order going to thc reception of an amendment upon the ground of irrelevancy ought to bc decided notv
The
CHAIRMAN
It would be in to hear the point raised by the gentleman from In- diana, which went to the relevancy of tliis amend- ment of the gentleman from
Iowa
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I found my point of order upon the 48th rule, which is as follows; No motion or proposition on a subject different from t.hat under consideration shall be admitted under color Of mnendmcnt
No bill or resolution shall, at any time, be amended by annexing thereto, or incorporating therewith, any other bill or resolution pending before the House." The point of order is, that the bill under con- sideration is a bill granting altérnate sections of land to the Territory of Nebraska for the pur- pose of aiding in the construction of a railroad
r he amendment proposed by the gentleman from Iowa is a difltn•ent bill in every respect whatever, and is not germane to the proposition under con- It is a bill, not granting public lands side ration
to aid in the construction of a railroad to one of the States or Territories of the
United States, but a bill to constÆct two railroads across the conti- Pacific railroad—and to pay for the con- struction of those roads out of the public T.reas- ury in money
The original bill proposes to grant to a rrerritory, to aid in thc construction of' a railroad, alternate sections of the public lands; the
other proposes a grant of rnoney to a corpo- ration, and therefore they arc wholly diflZ•rcnt•, and the substitute is irrelevant
Without elab- orating this point of order further—for I believe it i* clearly defined to every gentleman here—I submit it to the decision of thc Chair
Mr
SICKLES
1 desire to the attention of the Chair to the authorities upon this point in Which the same question has been raiscd and de- cided
A similar question was raised in both the Thirty-First and Thirty-Second Congresses
During the first session of the Thirty-First Con- gross, as appears by reference to page 1321 of the Journal of the House, a bill was pending entitled " An act
proposing to the State of Texas the cstablishmcnt of her northern and western bound- ary, and the relinquishment by the said State of all territory claimed by lierexterior to said bound- atics, and of all her claims upon the United " Pending that bill," the Journal says, States." " Mr
Boyd rnoved to amend by adding the fol- Here follows a bili of thirty-two sec- lowin(r
lions, establishing territorial governments for the Territories of New Mexico alid Utah
Mr
Mead raised the point of order that such amendment was not germane to the rncasure under consider- ation; that the amcndmcnt contained provisions similar to bills already before the House, and consequently, under the rules, was out of order
r Ithis, certainly, presents a case of dissimilarity much stronger than the one beforc the Chair for his decision
The, Speaker ruled that the urnend- mcllt was in ordcr, stating that he was of' opinion that the bill from the Senate under consideration brought before the House the question of terri- tory acquired from Mexico, and that all propo- sitions affectil')g that territory, or proposing to dispose of or provide for it, were Termanc to the bill, and therefore iVi order as an amendment
Mr
SHERWIAN
1 desire to state that the amendment have offered is not like any other bill before the House
Mr
SICKLES
aware of that, now upon a different point, and am citino' authoi•- ties upon the point whether the pending amend- ment is ffermane or not
From that decision of' the Chair Mr
Schenck appealed; and upon the question being put to the House, the decision of the Chair was sustained by a vote of 122 to 84
During the first session of the Thirty-Second Congress the same point was raised again and decided
The House had under consideration a bill reported bv Mr
Hall, of Missouri, from the Committee on Public Lands, granting the right Of way, and making donations of public lands, to the State of Wisconsin, to aid in the construction of a railroad from Chicago to the head of Lake Su- perior
Mr
Gray moved to amend the bill by an amendment granting to the State of Kentucky lands in aid ofvarious roads in Kentucky
On that amendment Mr
George W
Jones raised the point of order that the amendment was upon-a differ- ent subject, and consequently out of order
The Speaker decided that, inasmuch as the bill pro- vided for the donation of land to a State to aid in the construction ofa railroad therein, it was com- potent to amend it by a provision for other States for a similar purpose
He therefore overruled the point of order
An appeal was taken from that decision; and, on a motion made to lay the, appeal upon the table, the appeal was laid on the table
Another amendment was offered granting lands to other States to aid in the construction of rail- roads, and that amendment was received
Both the questions raised in this case were entertained and decided—first, whether the amendment was germane; and second, how far the bill contained provisions in substance likc another bill before It was held that, although a propo- the House
, sition may be in substance the same, yet, unless it was fora purpose different, it was notexcluded by the rule
And I desire to cfl the attention of the Chair, in this connection, to the remarks upon rule 48, on page 10, of the volume of our Clerk, John M
Barclay, where he states that förrnerly the rule was to exclude a proposition if it was not sub- stantially like the bill before the House; but that it had been held repeatedly, since, that amend- ments including the same provisi0)'1s, to a great extent, as other bills before the House, were in order
There are other decisions; but these are suffi- cicnt
Mr
BRANCH
I do not intend to consume I only want time unnecessarily upon this bill
tbc point of order distinctly made
The gentle- man from New York [Mr
SICKLES] will under- stand that the point of order made by the gentle- man from Indiana [Mr
Dnvrs] is not at all based upon the fact that this bill contained provisions similar to other bills pending before the House
I do not understand that point is made at all
The point is made, because the bill proposcd as an amendment is unlike to, and irrelevant to the bill for which it is proposed to be substituted
I call the attention of the committee to the titles of the bills themselves
The title of the pending bill is as follows: " A bill granting alternate scc- tions of public lands to aid in the construction of certain railroads in the Territory of Nebraska
" There is a distinct proposition set forth in the Its character, its object, its pur- title of the bill
poses, are mage clear by the title
The bill that it IS proposed to" substitute for it also has a title in the words: A bill to secure contracts, and make provision for the safe, certain, and more speedy transportation by railroad of rnails, troops, n-:uni- tions of war, military and naval stores, between the Atlantic States and those of the Pacific, and for other purposes." In all the cases cited by the gentlc\nan from New York, [Mr
SICKLES,] the bills were identically the same in their provisions, alike in their object, and similar in the means they proposed to attain that object
The decision of thc House in cach of those cases was based on the, fact that they were exactly similar
Mr
SICKLES
If the gentleman from North Carolina will pardon me, I can correct him upon that point
Mr
BRANCH
1 would rather state my point It is difficult to present these compli- of order
catcd points of order if irrterrupted 
Mr
SICKLES
I beg the gentleman's par- don, Mr
BRANCH
1 will hear the gentleman
Mr
SICKLES
1 desired to correct the gen- tleman as to the first authority which I cited
I think the gentleman did not honor me with his complete attention, or he would not have fallen into the error
The bill moved as an amendment then was a bill to provide territorial governments for Utah and New Mexico; the bill pending before  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL the House was a bill to run the boundary line be- tween Texas and Mexico
You may say that they both related to the public lands of the United States; but they were not even so far that they both related to the Territories; because Texas was a State at that time, admitted into the Union, and the bill before the House '.vas one to provide for running the boundary 'line between her and Mexico
T hc Speaker held that inas- much as both bills covered the onc great subject of the territory acquired from Mexico, a.nd inas- much as a portion of that territory vvrould have to be acted on with reförence to the boundary be- tween Texas and Mexico, it was germane within the rule
Mr
BRANCH
Those cases are, of course, no way similar to the case •now pending before the House, and it is hard to draw a parallel be- tween them, although it is very obvious that when a bill was pending before the House to dispose of the territory acquircd from Mexico, a bill pro- posing to establish one government out.ofa part of that territory, was relevant to a bill to provide a government for another part of it
The polnt, however, is this: that the i•ules of the House require that there shall be relevancy between the subject-matter proposed to be stricken out and the subject-matter proposed to be in- serted
The titles of the bills that [ have read to the Chair show distinctly that they are for totally different, distinct obiccts
One proposes to give lands in alternate sections for the building of a railroad in Nebraska, and the grant is made to the Territory itself; the other proposes to give lands, not to a Territory, not to a State, to enable them to build a railroad, but to a company of it is not private individuals named in the bill; even legislation forthe solc purpose of making a railroad; it is a bill to provide for thc transport- ation qf the mails and of naval and military stores between the Atlantic, and Pacific
You might just as well claim that a bill granting lands to the of Nebraska is relevant to and could bc moved as an amendment to the General Post Offco bill or to the post route bill that is passed here at each sessio» of Congress
A railroad is spoken of in the bill proposed as an amendment by the gentleman Iowa, but that is not the primary object of the bill at all; the buildincr of a railroad is not the ostensible object of his Bill; but the transportation of the mails and of muni- tions of war between the Atlantic and Pacific; and the object of the bill to which it is offered as an amendment, is to provide solely and exclusively for the building of a railroad in the Térritory of Nebraska
In every instance in which the House has decided that these bills have been relevant, it has been whcrc the one proposed as an amend- ment was similar in its objects and similar in the means by which it proposcd to attain those ob- jects to the one It was proposed to strike out
* I do think, NIr
Chairman, that upon an ex- amination of thcsc bil\s, the Chair cannot Ilesitate in the opinion that they are unlike, that t.hey are irrelevant; and if we establish now that this amend- ment is in order, my friend from Indiana, [Mr
COLFAX,] the chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads, may expect to see all the railroad bifls fastened on to his post route bill at the close of the session, or fastened on to the general appropriation bill for carrying on the postal service, or fastened on, to the military ap- propriation bill, or any other
The object of the bill proposed by the gentleman from Iowa is not solely or even mainly to build a railroad, accord- ing to its title; but it is to provide for the trans- portation of mails and of munitions of war be- tween the Atlantic and the Pacific
regret that I have consumed so much time upon this ques- tion, and will not further occupy the attention of the committee
Mr
CURTIS sought the floor
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair desires to re- mind the committee that debate is not in order; but the Chair will hear the gentleman if the com- mittee do not object
No objection was made
Mr
CURTIS
'I wish to say, in reply to the argument of the oentleman from North Carolina that the two biffs are not irrelevant, that I can hardly imagine how two bills could be more rele- vant
In the first place, as to the persons to whom the grant is to be made: the original bill is a bill to grant lands to a territory—a quasi-corporation; my amendment is to grant lands to a corporation; so that in that they resemble each other
In the next place, the original bill grants alternate sec- tions of land; the amendment grants alternate Sec- tions of land; so that in that they resemble each other
And finally, the object of the original bill is to build a railroad; and obviously the object of thc amendments proposed is to build a railroad
No matter what the title of the bill is, it is clear, from the whole text, that the object of the bill is, as was said by the gentleman who made the point oforder, to build two railroadsto the Pacific ocean
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from ln- diana [Mr
DAVIS] raises the question Of order that the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa is not relevant to the bill, and is therefore out of order'; and hc had the 48th rule readj wMchis ds follows: No motion-or proposition on subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under color of amend- ment
No bill or resolution shall, at any time, be amended by annexing thereto, or incorporating thercWith, any ottvr bill or resolution pending before the House." The Chair understood that to be the point of order raised
The overrules -the point of order on the question of relevancy, and would refer to the Manual prepared by the clerk, Mr
Barclay, and cited by the gentleman from New York, [Mr
SICKLES:] A bill granting lands to a State for railroad purposes may be amended by adding thereto a similar provision for other States." Novv', the original bill provides for a grant of lands in alternate sections for the purpose of build- ing a railroad on the western side of the-Missouri river; the amendment proposed provides for grant- ing alternate sections of land for the building of a railroad also on the west side of the Missouri river; for the same purpose, only more extended
The Chair therefore holds that the amendment is germane to the original bill
The title of the bill forms no part of it, and the amendme.nt has no title
Nothing can be argued from the title of a bill as to relevancy
Mr
DAVIS, of-Indiana
Justa word, sir
One bill grants alternate sections of public land to a Territory, or future State; the other bill is for a totally different purpose, and is for the construc- lion of two Pacific railroads and a grant of money out of the Treasury of the United States to pay for the construction of these roads; and it places the power of constructing them in the hands ofa corporation
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state to the gentleman, with the permission of the com- mittce, that he bases his decision upon the general purposes of the proposed legislation
The general purpose of these grants of land is to build rail- roads; and the mode and manner in which it is to be donc do not affect the question of relevancy
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
With all due respect to the Chair, I take an appeal from his decision-
The CHAIRMAN
Thcgentleman from Indi- ana [Mr
DAY1s] raises the question-of order, that the amendment of the gentleman from Iowæ[Mr
CURTIS] is the same as a bill now pending before the House
'Ehe Chair would inquire of the gen- tlcman from Iowa if that is the case
Mr
REAGAN
Have we reached the amend- ment of the gentleman from Iowa
The CHAIRMAN
That is the amendment upon which the point of order is raised, as the Chair understands; and the Chair now inquires, for information, of the gentleman from Iowa, if his amendment is the same as any bill now pend- ing before the House
Mr
CURTIS
It is not
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I withdraw that branch of my question, a.nd put it upon the point of rel- evancy, which is clearz enough
The CHAIRMAN
The raises the point of order that the amendment is not germane io the original bill
The Chair has overruled the point of order, and the gentleman from Indiana now appeals from the decision of the Chair
Mr
MA Y NARD
I desire information upon the point, whether the amendment of the gentle- man from Iowa is the same as House bill No

He says it is not
That is negative inform- ation
Before I can vote intelligently on this point, 1 want to know what his amendment is

Mr

Now, I beg to state what I I thought that was trying all the time to state
thc Clerk was reading the amendment of the gen- tleman from Ohio; and hence it was that I asked it to be read by sections for amendment, so that it might bc perfected before tho vote was taken on the substitute of the gentleman from Iowa

Mr

Mr
BRANCH
I think I can satisfy my friend from Texas in a moment, if the Chair will allow mc tho privilegc of doing so
This is proposi- tion made by thc gentleman from Iowa, to strikc out the wholc of the pendinc bill and t.o substitute another bill for it
takc it—and I think the •Chair will sustain mc in it—that before the motion to strike out is Pilt to the committee, a motion to perfect thc part proposed to be stricken out is in Thc CHAIRMAN
This is an amendm&ent in the second degree, and cannot be amended
Mr
BRANCH
The point 1 make is this: that thc motion to strike out is postponed until motions 10 perfect the part to bc stricken out are disposed of
I
think the Chair will, on reflection, be satisficd that there may, in this way, be a dozen amendments pending at once
But the motion to strike out is postponed until the part proposed to be stricken out is perfected to the I satisfaction of the committee
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair would say that all this debate is out of order
He can only state, in addition, more cxplicity, thc order in which these questions arise
The original text was first gendeman from Iowa moved to amend that amend- ment, which was an amendment in the second de- gree, and no further amendment is now in order
Mr
BRANCH
Exactly
But, as soon as the vote hag been taken on the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa, my friend from Texas may then offer his amendment
Mr
COLFAX
I must object to all further debate upon this question
I was ruled outin the last session, on the flaxseed question, on pre- cisely the same grounds
[Laughter.] Now, I must object to any further debate in reference to this matter
Mr
MAYNARD
I rise to a question of or- der
The CHAIRMAN
The amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio will bc read if any gentleman desires it
Mr
REAGAN
Will the Chair me to say that, as understand his decision, the only opportunity we have had, or can havc, to amend the Pacific railroad bill , to bc passed by this House , is to amend the text of thc bill granting lands to the Territory of Nebraska
Mr
MAYNARD
I rise to a question of or- der
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair desires to state that he has permitted this debate to go on out of order, but that hc must now enforce the rules
Mr
MAYNARD
rise to a question of order, and will bring myself within the rules
When this bill was taken up, an amendment was pro- posed by the gentlcn)illl from Ohio to strike out all aftcr the enacting clause and substitute there- for a proposition which hc sent up to the Clerk's desk, and which has not been read
Thc gentle- man from Iowa then moved to amend the substi- tute of the gentleman from Ohio, by striking it out and inserting a proposition which, he says, but not identical with is substantially thc same the bill reported to thc House from the select committee of which he is chainnan
The original text was read for amendment; and any amend- to that text wras in order while it was bcin• read
Now, the pointl present is, that before the vote is
taken upon the amendment of the gentle- rnan fron•) Iowa, it is proper that the substitute of the gentleman from Ohio should be read, and any amendments received to it which may bc offered with a view
to pcrfec.t it
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair overrules the question of order, and decides that only two amendments can be pending to the bill at the sumc time
By the rules of the House, the amend- nient of the gentleman from Iowa is an amend- ment in the second degree, and until that amend- ment be disposed of, no further amendment is in If that amendment shall be voted down order
it will then bc in order to amend the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio, by striking out and inserting
The Clerk will now report the amend- merit of the gentlcmun from Iowa

Not until the Clerk has finisl'tcd reading the amendment
The Clcrk finished the reading of the amend- ment
Mr
REAGAN
I now ask the Chairman whcther an amendment is not in order to the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio before the vote is taken on the amendment of the gentle- man from Iowa; and desirc to read the it)llow- ing clause from t.he Manual: When it is proposed to arnend by inserting a paragraph, or part 0k' one, the friends of the paragraph may rnake it as pcrfOct as they can by amendnrents before the question is put for inserting it." 1 submit that, in accordance with this rule, it is in order to perfect the amendment of the gen- tleman Ohio before striking it out
I have an amendment which I wish in perfect good faith to because I bblicve it will makc the bill more satisfactory
The CHAIRMAN
To what does the gentle
man propose to offer his amendment
Mr
REAGAN
To the first section of the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will state again to the gentleman from Texa.k, that the amendment of the gÖntleman from Iowa to strike out and insert, is, undcr the 46th rule, indivisible
The vote must be taken on striking out and inserting
If the committee, however, vote down the amend- mcnt of the gentleman from Iowa,
a motion to strike out and insert, applicable to the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio, will be in order
Mr
REAGAN
Under the clause of the Man- ual which have read, a motion to amend the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio, by way of perfecting it, would now bc in order
The CHAIRMAN
The clause of the Manual to which the gentleman refers has reference to amcndments to the original bill
The Bhair will ask the Clerk to read from page 8 of the digest prepared by the Journal Clerk, to show the gen- tleman from Texas that it does not apply to the case now before us
The Clerk read, as follows: An amendment may bc Inoved to an amendment; but it is not adlnittcd in another degree
But it is the well- settled practice of thc I-louse that there may be pending, at the sarne time with such amendment to the amendlnent, an an'lendn'lent in thc nature of a substitute for a p;irt or the whole ()t• the original text, and an ainendrnent to that annen'hnent
It was decided many years ago that if the motion to amend the original matter was first subniitted,.it was not then in order to submit an mnendment in the na- ture of a substitute ; but it was subsequently decided other- wise; and the, practice ever since has been in accordance with the latter decision
So, now, notwithstanding the pendency ota motion to amend an anlendment to tke ori- gina! nnatt,er, a inotion to amend in the nature of a substi- tute and a Inotion to amend that amendment may be re- ceivcd, but cannot be voted upon until the original mat.ter is pcrtocted." The CHAIRMAN
The Chair will remark acrain, that thc amendment of the gentleman from Iowa, being an amendment in the second degree, If the committee, however, is not amendable
shall vote (lown that amendment, the amendment of the gentleman frorn Ohio will bc open to amend- ment
Mr
BRIGGS
I wish to ask whether, by the conscnt of the committee, it is not competent for them to accept an amendment without re.quiring a vote on it
The CHAIRMAN
The committee which reported this bill have not the power to accept any amer)dment
Mr
BRIGGS
I refer to this Committee of the and I ask whether they have not the power, by unahimous consent, •to agree to an amendment to the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa, before the -vote is taken on adopting that amendment
CHAIRMAN
By unanimous consent, Ibis connnitLec can, of course, agree to any amend- Mr
BRIGGS
Then 1 ask the consent of the connnittee to accept an amendment, which I pro- post' to have read
Mr
COLFAX to the amendment
1 object to its being read, and I desire to enter standing objection to all further debate
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
I do not propose to debate this question; but I do desire to present an and have it read for the purpose of indicating to the comnlittee what I propose to offer if the pending amendment shall bc voted down
Mr
COLÉAX
There is evidently a majority of the House in favor of this bill as embodied in the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa, and I object
Nil'
DAVIS, of Indiana
Have I not the right to have the amendment read for the purpose of indicating what 1 propose to offer
ThcCHAIRMAN
Not objection be made
Mr
DAVIS, of Indiana
Well, sir, Imustsay that this is remarkable courtesy coming from my colleague, The CHAIRMAN
Debate is not in order
Mr
McCLERNAND
Has not the gentle- man from Indiana the right to offer his amend- ment as a substitute 
The CHAIRMAN
The Chair has already  1860
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE; stated that there are two amendments pending in the nature of a substitute, and that no further amendments are in
order; The question now is on the amendment of the gentleman from Iqwa, [Mr
CURTIS,] which is to strike out and insert
If agreed to, no amendment will then be in order except to add
Mr
McCLERNAND
no not wish to with the opinion of the Chair
The CHAIRMAN
Does the gentleman take an appeal from the decision of the Chair
Mr
McCLERNAND
i do not
wish to state, if the amendments pending are in the nature of substitutes, that I think we have the right to make amendments to them before the question is taken on their adoption
The onc for which the other is offered as a substitute, is, think, open to amendment as if it were the ori- ginal text
The CHAIRMAN
If the gentleman con- sult Barclay 's Digest, at page 80, he will find thc Chair's decision to be the correct onc
Mr
KUNKEL
to a pointofotder
undcrstand—and if I am wrong I hope that I will be corrected—that the substitute offered by the gentleman from Iowa [Mr
CURNS] is the same as House 'bill No
835, which is upon the Calen- dar, and near thc end of it
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman from Iowa has stated that his substit.ute is not t.he same as i any bill pending in the committee or before the House
Mr
KUNKEL
1 have not the substi- tute read, and I am unable to tell whether it is like the House bill to which I have referred or If it be the same as the bill now upon the not
Catendae•., then it is not in order
The CHAIRMAN
The gentleman is ing undei• a inistake
The substitute is not the same as the bill to which he refers, and it has been so stated by the gentleman from lovva, who submitted it
Mr
KUNKEL
1 desire to call the attention of the Chair and the committec to the facts
'l'he CHAIRMAN
Debate is not in order If the gentleman rises to a question of order, he will state it
Mr
KUNKEL
do: and 1 to a rule of the House before the Chair decides upon the point I present
By a vote of the House, a few days ago, Substantially the same proposition as the pending substitute was refl.l,sed to be consid- ered in the House, and was referred to thc Corn- mittec of the Whole on the state of the Union
It was determined to bc an appropriation bill of that character wlfich required it to bc first con- Iowa, the amendment as amended, is not now m order, except by a motion to add to it
Nothing which has been inserted can be now stricken out
Mr
BRANCH
Does the Chair decide that a portion of -what has been inserted cannot be stricken ouQ The CHAIRMAN
The Chair decides thatit is not in order to move to strike out what :has just been inserted 
Mr
BRANCH
The Chair is certainly cor- rect, so far as striking out the whole of what has been inserted
But does-the Chair decide that it is not in order to move to strike out a portion of what has been inserted 
The CHAIRMAN
What has been inserted has been adopted as onc amendments and it is now op_cn to amendment only by addition, In the opinion of the Chair an amendment in the see- ond degree, adopted as a substitute for an amend- ment in the first degree, is not open to amend* ment, except by addition
Mr
REAGAN
I have an amendment to offer, adding several new sections
Mr
MAYNARD
If the gent'cman will per• mit me, I will make a suggesiion
It is this: •it is man-ifbst Lhat we cannot debate this substitute in the Cömmittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
I therefore su&gest that we take the bill into the House with the understanding that it nqay there
be discussed—say for one, two, or throe ' hours—and that amendments may be offered, such as may be sug«rested by the gentleman from T as, as well as other gentlemen
Mr
REAGAN

THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 20, the majority by which -this amendment was few minutes since, that the House is decidedly in favor of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa
I venture to assert, if you will tho report of the committee of fifteen, you wili find that the amendment metes out justice to each and every portion of this Con-., feddracy
You will find that it gives a Pacific railroad to the South, and a Pacific railroad to the North; that it appropriates the common do- main for their construction; and also appropriatcs the bonds of the United States, which we are all responsible for
Now, sir, while •I am .willing to pay all duc deference to the opinions of gentlemen, and whilc I may approve of the action of those gentlemen in
presenting their different amendments, con- ceiviag that they xare performing their duties to their cönstituents, I say again, that this railroad bill-is the product of the joint labors of tho coni- mittee of fifteen, rcpresenting all sections of the country, and adopted by them according to the best of their judgment, after careful invesfigation and due deliberation
They reported a bill wllich will give every portion of thc country a link with I thercforc say that, while the Pacific slope
gentlemen may think it their duty to offer amend- ments, I shall oppose and vote agail'lst them, because the insertion of amendments to the bill will, in my judgment, prejudice its passage in the other House
I am led to believe, from conver- sation with Senators, that if thc House adopts the bill Row before it, the Senate will pass it; and that if additional amendments are put to it, if it is burdened with a dead weight, in order to repre- sent the peculiar views of.gcntlemen representing particular sections, that will jeopardize the pas- sage of tho bill ih the other body
Being one of the R.epresentative.s who feel a (Icep and abiding interest in this nuttter, and believinz that it is about to culminate in what
the fi•icnds of a Pacific railroad have becn waiting for eleven years, I shall opl')ose, and strel'iuously oppose, all y and ull an'lendments which Inn y be offered to this bill

I have no question that the selectcommittee of fifteen upon the Pacific railroad sought to do justice to the great interests of the Pacific coast, as welt as to the interests of the States and Ter- ritories on tho Atlantic; butl am equally well con- vinced that, practically, they have not done justice to the great and growing interest of that Pacific I contend that their bill is not a measure of justice either to our present or to our future ! development
The bill of the committee proposes not a northern and a southern route, but a south- ern and a central route; for the linc of location of what is there called a northern route, goes mostly upon the parallel of forty and forty-one degrees of north latitude; in other words, through thc geo- graphical contor of this continent
MT e claim that the great intcrcsts of conunerce, and the develop- ment of our interior, should cause this committee to vote for the amend rnent of my friend from Min- ncsota
Why, Mr
Chairman, this very last season we have been compelled to send troops to Oregon and Washington over the route of this northern line
They went up the Missouri; they crossed over by the wagon road' recently constructed, and were th&hce distributed to the different military posts If this committee in the department of Oregon
and the House are determined to decide that thcre shall bc .no northern route, Ict mc their atten- tion parti*larly to thc decision they make
That decision will be putting ofF indefinitely this north- ern routc, so far as Americans are concerned , icrnoring the great linc of commerce and the great linc of cormnunication from our lakes to that north west Pacific
Tho question is simply this: will this Congress sec to it that we have a linc of travel on that great line of cornmerce; or shall solidate, and with a ()thcr legal and duly organized corn panies nr corporations incorporated i by any of the States, ibr the purpose nt- aiding in the eon- equitable struction ot• said road, upon just and and said corporation or corporations shall entilled to such a linc ('If corn tuu nication be the work of our Brilish neighbors

Gene fernen talk of the glowing fu turo of • this country and the growing strength of the Pacific; but, if pass this bill without amend- n')ent, you will yield up that
Pacific and the north- western portion o
our country to our British neighbors and to Britisly advancement; for they have thcre• a growin• empire northwest of our borders
We have there, not simply Puget Sound, but great inland waters now alive with cmnmerce, alid reverberating frorn the forests of their shores the shrill sound of the steamer

this question dofinitely
I have suc(rcsted that this northern route is the great route of corn- rncrce; that

of presenting

GARNETT
Mr
Chairman, 1
should not have participated in this debate, but for a
re- mark which I heard fall from my friend from Cat- ifornia, [Mr
SCOTT,) who said, when- speaking of the bonds which one of these bilk proposes to issue, that xe were all to be responsible for them
Sir, know that it would be useless to debate this bill in this House, for its course has shown that it will not permit any rational discussion' of the principles of the bill; it hats shown
that it is de- termined to pass it under the lash andispur of the previous question, without hearing the merits of the bill or its constitutionality discussed
I know that there are gentlemen here, who, like my friend from California, believe that the bill ought to, be passed ; that itis constitutional, and that It is•prac- have •no dreams that this road would ever be corr- structed if youwere to pass twentybills, ahd with whom the whole subject is simply a foot-ball for parties in the game of President:making; and I would advise those gentlemen, before they pursue this game further, to inquire whether -they wiil ever have an opportunity of electing another Pres- ident
I return now to the remark of the gentleman from California, who says that we are all respons- ibie for these bonds
Who are " au P' Who are au ." Why, sir, even while your bill is under debate, one of the sovereign States of this Con- federacy has, by the glorious act of her people, withdrawn, in vindication of her rights; from the Union, as the telegraph announced to us at half past one o'clock; and I havc to say:to the gentle- man-from California
and to the, House, that the people of Virginia—ninety-nine in a hundred-— believe this bill to
be unconstitutiöial, and' though , like mariners on thepointof shipwreck, you mav break into the store-room for the pufpose of plund- ering it, though you may squander the publiclands and attempt to increase the public debt, -it is my solemn belief that the people of Virginia, when my State takes that course which thc thronging evcots will lead her to take; will not hold them- selves responsible for the first cent of these bonds and appropriations

Under that impression, gentle- men upon this side of the House did not ask a division; but the Chair, when he came to an- nounce the result, said that the ayes had it.

The CHAIRMAN
Debate having been closed on the bill, questions of order are not debatable
Mr

I will simply say, that since I have been a member of this House, I have never seen a bill passed through in such utter disregard of the rules of order of this House

Mr
PHFÆ,PS
My colleague [Mr
BARRET] has an amendment which he wishes t.o propose I have not bccn in thc Hall to-day during the proceedings on this bill, but came in at thö time when the gcntleman from Indiana was speak* iir
BARRET
1 offer the following amend- mcnt, to come in as an additional section: SEC
16
Jlnd be it, furl,hcr cnacted, If, upon proper sur- veys and estimates, it shall bc ascertained that the route by thc vicinity of the great Salt Lake, as provided for in Section first, is not tbc best, those llavin« in charge the location and building Df this work arc hereby required to locate the sa:nc on thc shortest
most econon'iicai and prac- tical route from the mouth of t'he Kansas river to the city of San Francisco, in thc State of California
do not rise, Mr
Chairman, for the purpose of making a spccch at this time
My object in offerintr that amcndment is this: by tho first sec- tion of thc bill the route of the road is •located by thc vicinity of Salt Lake City
I have always contended that this body had not thc necessary il')fornmtion to enable it to direct tho location of railroad routes
That should be loft to the en- gineer
Elencc, I propose, by this amendment, that in case it shah bc ascertained by actual sur- vcys that the route by Salt Lakc City is not the best, the parties having in charge the location and building of this road shall locate it by the.short- est, most economical, and most practical route
Mr.MORRIS, of Illinois
I move that the committee rise
I make' the motion in order to give members time to consider this bill
The I-notion was not agreed to
Mr
CRAIG, of Missouri.
I have repeatedly stated in this House 'that I would vote a Pa- cific railroad bill starting anywhere above' the Gulf of Meiicö and sot-ith of the British line
, But I object to the amendment of my colleague, C Mr
BARRETj] for the reason that it is evident to this House and to the country, that the special com- mittec in proposing the line as specified in the amendment repor,ted by the gentleman from Iowa, meant t.o force this road through the gold fields in thc region of Pike's Peak and Carson's Valley
There is no population on any other routc that can be proposed, while there gre thousands and hundredsofthousands of American citizens on the linc indicated in the amendment of the gentleman from Iowa
I am, therefore, satisfied that it is not only the right, bat the duty of this Congress to send the Pacific railroad through that part of the continent where it will accommodato the greatest number of American citizens
I wish to make a formal objection to, and hope the com- mittee will vote down, the amendment offered by my colleague
The question was taken on Mr
BARRET'S amendment; and it was rejected
Mr
BRANCH
rise to a privileged motion
I move that the committee do now rise
Mr
SICKLES
I move, as an amendment, that the committee rise and report the bill to the House, with u recommendation that it do pass
The CHAIRMAN
There is still an amend- ment pending

If a majority of tho com- mittee dcsirc that the bill should be reported back with a recommendation that it do pass, they will then vote arrainst thc motion of thc gentleman from North Carolina, with a view of votincr in favor of a motion that the committee rise, and report the bill to the House
The CHAIRMAN
If the motion of the gen- tlernan from North Carolina prevails, the commit- tec will rise
If not, the committee will still bc in session
That is all the dccisiou the Chair can make about it
Mr
HINDMAN
And then we can make such further motion as wc see fit

CRAIG, of Missouri, and EDWARDS, werc appointed
The committe•e divided; and the tellers reported —ayes 60, noes 76
So tho committee refused to rise
Mr
PHELPS
1 offer the following amend- ment, to come in as an additional section: SEC
JO
Jlnd be itfurthcr enacted, That the persons to whom the grants in this act arc Inadc, shall have the ri"ht to seicct the nearest and most economical route for a rail- road to San Francisco
I had dcsired, Mr
Chairman, to participate in thc debate that has taken place on this bill, but I was en«yaged during the day in service on the spe- Cial committee, and therefore was not able to be present l)ere
I have heretofore taken occasion, Mr
Chair- man, t.o express the opinion that it was unt.visc on the part of Congress to indicate the route for a Pacific railroad
I expressed that opinion at the last session of Congress
Hence I desire that this bill shall be amended so that the persons to whom the grant of land and money is made by this act may bc at libcrty to select the best and most eco- nornical route to the Pacific ocean
By the terms as this bill proposes, I should still feel constrained to vote against it
There are other questions to engage the attention of the legislative department of the Government besides the ques- tion of the Pacific railroad
The preservation of the Government is DOW the great question of the day; and yet* while members of Congress are aware that our Government is crumbling into piecesg they are proposing to add to the burdens of the people, while the national Treasury is not able:to pay its honest debts
I am unwilling, by my vote, to increase the indebtedness of the na- tion, when I know the Government is compelled to borrow money to defray its ordinary expenses
The securities of the Government are now selling at a heavy depreciation, and I am unwilling to still farther aid in their depreciation by creatino• a debt of $96,000,000
If this was a proper time for the consideration of the subject; if we had not thc more important question of the preservation of the Government pressing upon us; and if the Gov- ernment securities were not depressed by a fear of a dissolution of the Government, I would cheer- fully give my vote for the construction of one road, and for suitable aid by the Government towards it
I am in favor of a railroad to the Pacific; but, under the present circumstances, I cannot vote for this bill
Mr
COLFAX
I oppose the amendment pro forma, and ask for a vote upon it

Mr
STEVENS, of Washington
1 have only a word to say, for 1 do not wish to occupy the time of the committee
The amendment which was proposed by the gentleman from Minnesota, to which I spoke some little time since, provided for money grants
This amcndmcnt provides simply for a grant of land
In conversation with gentlemen upon this floor, I do not find that any one denies the importancc of this route, and I now ask whether this House will not agree that there shall be a grant of land to aid in the con- struction of a road over this route
The amend- ment proposes ten sections to the mile
While you give land and money for the support ofa cen- tral and a southern route, I ask if you will refuse a grant of land for a northern route
Mr
CURTIS
I am opposed to the amend- ment of the gentleman from Washington, and ask for a vote upon it

BRAGG
J think that is a bill of too much importance to be made a special order of this body; and at a periop of time so ncar at händ, par- ticularly at this season of the year, when many Senators are going home, without its being re- ferred
I understand that the Senator from Mis- sissippi made a motion to refer it
1 •was on feet for the purpose of making the saine motion
I understand that the biil involves a very large amount of expenditure on the part of the Gov- ernment—something like $100,000,000 to begin with
I have not had an opportuhity to read the bill myself, and 1 really think it ought to be re- ferred, either to some standing committee of the It is a matter of body, or to a select committee
too much importance to be hurried through this body in this way
Mr
G WIN
I will statc to the Senator from North Carolina that my object is -not to hurry it through the Senate
Being a House bill, it is printed, as• a matter of course
I named next Monday week in order that there might be full and ample time to examine it
It is well known to thc Senate that there are bills for this purpose now on the Calendar of the Senate that have been elaborately considered by select committees of this body
Six select conm•ittees have been ap-
pointed by the Senate, who have reported bills, all of which are on our files
This bill has been elaborated by a special committee of the other House, and passed that body yesterday; and I am sure no committee this House could appoint could prepare the bill more elaborately and care- fully than the bill I now propose to make the spe- Cial order has been prepared
There are many similar bills already on the files of the Senate
There will be ample opportunity offered for dis- cussion; so far as I am concerned, I shall not in- terpose any objection to the full consideratiön of it
I hope Senators will not object to making it the special order
Mr
CAMERON
1 wish thc Senator from
California would name Tuesday week, instead of Monday week
Mr
FOO'i' and others
That is New Year'S day
Mr

say Wednesday week, so that we may have a full Senate'

Which motion will have pre- cedence—a motion to refer or motion to make the bill a special order

With the view of testing the sense of the Senate, I move that it be referred to a special committee, to be appointed by the Pre- siding Offcer

Mr
KENNEDY
If there is nothing else be- fore the Senate, I move to take up the bill which was set for half past twelve o'clock to-day
The njotion was agreed to; and the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, resurned the consid- eration of the bill to authorize the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to extend the -Washing- ton branch of their road to the Potomac river, I and across the
same by an extension of the prcs-  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
ent strupture known as the Long Bridge, for the purpose of connecting with the Virginia railroads at that point
The first section proposes •to empower the Bal- timore and Ohio Railroad Company to extend the Washington branch of their road from a point in Washington city, near G street north, passino• through First street east, to near D street south, thence by a curve crossing New Jersey avenue, south Capitol street, and the canal, to E street south, and through the last-named street to the Potomac river, and to extend this line of railroad across the river by means of a pile structure, adjacent to and connected with the Long Bridge, for a railroad track on the eastern side of the bridge, so as to form a connection with the Vir- ginia shore, and with such railroads as may be made, or already have been made, by authority of the State of Virginia to said point; with a pro- viso that such widening or extension of the Long Bridge shall be constructed with suitable draws for the convenience of navigation
The second section proposes to authorize the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to con- struct a tunnel upon that portion of the line lying between a point near C street north and the west side of New Jersey avenue, so as to involve no injury to the public grounds or permanent ob- strnction to the use of those streets for ordinary purposes; and to use steam or locomotive power on the whole or any part of the route
The third section proposes to empower the com- pany to lay a track, and to use the same for the transportation of passengers and freight, from some suitable point on the route authorized to be extended to tide-water, between the Long Bridge" and the Navy-yard, so as to be connected with southern lines of steamboats plying on the Poto- mac river
The fourth section provides that the company shall have authority to lay a street track from some convenient point on the main route author- ized by the bill to the depot of the company in Washington, and to transport upon it cars for burden and passengers until such time as the tun- nel authorized by the second section shall be com- pleted
The fifth section proposes to authorize the Bal- timore and Ohio Railroad Company to charge for ,the transportation of merchandise or freight, of every description, upon the connecting railroad authorized by the bill, to the termini thefeof at tide-water and on the Virginia shore, at the rate of not exceeding twenty-five cents per ton net, and for the transportation of passeno•ers at a rate not exceeding twenty-five cents for each passen- ger carried by them upon the said connecting rail- road
Mr
SAULSBURY
Mr
President, on the 4th of May last there was a memorial of a com- mittce of the corporation of Georgetown submitted to this body, and a motion was made to print it
That motion was referred to the Committee on I have been requested by the Mayor Printing
of Georeetown, this morning, to ask that their memorial be read for the information of the Sen- ate; and in compliance with that request, I ask that the memorial be read
The Secretary read it
The Committee on the District of Columbia, to whom the bill was referred, reported it, with amendments, which the Secretary proceeded to read
The first amendment was in the eleventh line of the first section, tö inseft the words, ot• other suitabie" between " pile " and " structure," so as to make it read, " and to extend said line of railroad, by means of a pile or other suitable structure, adiacent to, and connected with, the Long Bridge:" The amendment was agreed to
The next amendment was, in lines fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, of the first section, to strike the Virginia shore, and with such railroads out as may be made, or already have been made, by authority of the State of Virginia to said point," and in lieu thereof, to insei•t " the Alexandria and Washington railroad on the Virginia shore;" so as to make the clause read, " so as to form a con- nection with the Alexandria and Washington railroad on the Virginia shore.' Mr
CAMERON-
I desire to move an amend- ment to the first section
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Does the Sen- ator offer that as an amendment to the amendment
Mr
CAMERON
It is a proposition -to be added to the end of the first section
The PRESIDING OFFICER
Thatis notin order at presen{, and the Chair will restate the question to be on the second amendment of the committee
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 should like to the first place, what bill is up— The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Senator will Suspend his remarks
The Chair will remark that it is impossible to transagt .business with so much confusion in the Chamber
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 desire whether this is the original bill, or that which was reported from the committee with amemdments
Mr
KENNEDY
It is the was re- ported from the committec with amendments
Mr
FESSENDEN
Has there been any action on any of the amendments
Mr
KENNEDY
we have acted on two of them, I think
Mr
FESSENDEN
Theypassed without any observation
I should like to inquire of the Chan• what amendments have on
ThePRESIDINGOFFICER 'rhefirstamend- mentreported by.the committee has been agreed to
Mr
FESSENDEN
Which is that
The PRESIDINGOFFICER
In line eleven, page 2, after the word pile," to insert or other suitable" before structure." Mr
FESSENDEN
Iwasnot aware of it
1 was conversirp with another Senator while it passed
It was to that particular amendment that I wished to make objection
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Chair will say, that it is not in order at this stage of the busi- ness to debate thata mendment,as we have reached the second amendment
After that is disposed of, it will be in order for the Senator to move to re- consider the first amendment
The second amend- .ment of the committee is now before the Senate
Mr
FESSENDEN
Which is the second amendment
The PRESIDING OFFICER
The Secretary will read that for the information of thc Senator
The Secretary read it, as follows: in section one, lines fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen, to strike out the Virginia shore, and with such railroads as may be Ipade, or already have been madc, by the authority of Virginia, to said point," and insert the Alexandria and Washington railroad on the Virginia shore." Mr
KENNEDY
I will only state, for the information of the honorable Senator, that that amendment was put in to obviate any diffculty about connecting with other roads
It was merely to compel this company to connect with the Alex- andria road, which is already constructed
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 have no particular 0b- jection to that amendment
The amendment was agreed to

Thereisanother amendment from the committee, which will be read
The Secretary read the next amendment; which was, in the fifth section, to strike out the words " at the rate of not exceeding twenty-five cents per ton net, and for the transportation of passen- gers at a rate not exceeding twenty-five cents for each passenger carried by them upon the said connecting railroad," and, in lieu of them, to in- i sert such rates per ton for merchandise and such rates per capita for passengers as may be agréed upon from time to time by the Connecting rail- roads interested in this extension." Mr
CAMERON
I hope thatamendment will not be agreed to
It wili give the power to these I connecting railroads to raise -the toll on freight, and the passenger fare, whenever they may think proper, and to just such price as they may please
The price in the original bill is too high
Twenty- five cents for carrying a passenger across these four miles, is at least twice as much as ought to be paid
Ten cents would be a high price
object to this amendment; and when it is disposed of I shall make a motion to reduce the sum for carrying passengers across, to ten cents
that no Senator here will be in favor of this amend- II ment if he will reflect a moment about it
No one would be willing to give such immense power to two or three corporations here, who may be induced by their avarice or their interests at any time to impose exorbitant rates on the trade and travel passing across

per passengers as may be agreed upon firom-„lirne _tö time by the connecting -railroads:intérested
in;this extension." That
is a very vague veipression
The only connccting railroad, it would seem from the amqndmeht betöre- adopted, is the little- Alex- andria railroad; and it would be dißcult to tain what other railroads- are interested in this connection
My friend from Maryland tells me that all the roads south of it, upon -the- great mail route,• are interested
If so, • they ought Bto be specifically named; for, as the matter now stands, it seems to me -theregulation ofthe tolls on freight and of the- rate of carrying: passengers will with the Alexandria road and
-the road
which it is proposed to extend
I think, if that: amend- ment IS insisted On, it should be mademo.re cet- tain than it is now; for from uncertainty it would be void, I think, except as to- the two, roads YI have mentiöned; and do not- think the public ought to be put:in their power
Mr
KENNEDY
In order to gentlemen, I am perfectly willing that they may make it as specific as they please
They rnay specify every road—the roads north and the roads south of this—by name if they choose
The ob- ject was no t to give this particu larcompany, which is to make the extension, a right to charge any specific rate, but to restrict it to-just, the amount that witl be agreed upon by the roads south of it and the roads nortwof it, •which connect with it
mean by that, the rOads that lead from-the Balti- more and Ohio road in Baltimore, to Philadelphia; the road from Washington to Alexandria,-connect- ing south and southwest with •the Orange and Alexandria road ; and the whole line of toads run- ning to the southwest
The amendment was rejected

I would ask if -this has .particular reference,to any substantial provisions of acts
which haye heretofore been passed,- and what-lhey are
Mr
KENNEDY
to  174 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 21, bring this extension under the same restrictions, rights, and privileges, upon which the company now operates its road within the limits of this District
Mr
FESSENDEN
It refers to acts that have been passed by Congress, I suppose
Mr
KENNEDY
Of course—the existing laws that Control the road herc now, as this is a mere extension of it
Mr
FESSENDEN
lthink, then,there should be an amendment
I would suggest to thc Sena- tor from Maryland that, after all, his explanation is notquite satisfactory
It will be observed that the language is, thc G' tn•ivilccres" which " have heretofore been,granted " " by the act to which this is a supplement, and the supplement thereto." Now, the title of the bill refers to nothing, that I ,can perceive—to no other act
'This is the first reference to any other act
We ail understand that remarkable privileges were granted to this company by the Legislature of Maryland; and it may bc that the former acts of Congress refer to them
1 think the Senator, to make it satisfac- tory, should insertsomc words by which it should have some reference by way of amendment to the acts that have heretofore been passed by Congress in relation to this road
Mr
KENNEDY
have no objection to that
The PRESIDING OFFICER

* 1 move to reconsider the votc by which the first tunendme.lit of the com- milt.er•.' was adopted
It passed my ob- I wish to state a sil')gle objection to it
servat.)on
'l'he motion to reconsider was agreed to; and the question recurred 01k agreeing to the ment, which was, to insert the words " or other suitable " pile " and " structure.' between Mr
FESSENDEN
It tile amendment to inscrt t.hc words " or other suitable." Now, I have understood—it has bccn E urged to me as an arcrun-nent by this coynpany— i that the design was simply to erect a pile struc- ! ture, which would not offer any additional serious obstruction to navigation or create any very great difficulty, and which could be removed if neces- Bary without very much trouble
By the inser- tion of these words, however, or other suita- be," you will authorize the company to build a solid stone
bridge there, if they see fit, which is different entirely from the suggestion that was made to rne, on the subject
Now, sir, i want to know whether the counpany design an v such thing
interfere in any way whatever with the rights of other corporations or other roads; nor do I want to take advantage of anybody by these words, and I am perfectly " or other suitable structure;" willing myself that the
gentleman shall word the clause in his own terms
The only object we
have is to «et across the river, and connect with the continuous line of railroads that runs all the way to New Orleans, and to do it safely
1 am perfectly willing that this bridge shall be' built with such guarantees and restrictions in regard to the draw, and all other matters connocted with it, as may suit all parties who have any opposition to it
rl'he main objection to this bridge •has been urged heretofore from Georgetown
Their ob- jection has been based upon the idea that the pile bridge that stands there now has so greatly ob- structed the navigation of the river that the com- naerce of Georgetown has been destroyed by it
That is not so
All the reports from the topo- graphical department, since 1804 to the present time, go to prove the fact that the navigation of the river has been ilnproved by it
This day the water in that channel stands deeper than it did before that causeway and bridge were built
The evidence is all here before mg
1 am perfectly willing, however, to agree to the Senator's prop- osition, if he wants to put in any definitc or spe- cific plan for building this bridge
Ali that we want is the right of way across
You may give it with such checks and guards as you please
Mr
FESSENDEN
The Senator does not understand me
I do not feel disposed to discuss the question of the effect that has been produced by the former bridge, or what effect will be pro- duced by the new one
I only say that there has been a question which has continued for some period of time, whether the present bridge should If you grunt this privilege to this rernam or not
company of such a suitable structure as they may deem proper, the result is that that question is deterrnined•, because they may put down a bridge which, froni its very nature and character, cannot be retnoved at all; and the ques- tton with regard to a solid, permanent bridge over the Potomac river at that l.)lace will be precluded forcver by the very character of the erection itself
Now, I want the Senate to understand ivhat the question is
If they are disposed to vote forcon- tinuing this structure, very well
I have always been opposed to it
Strike out the words now proposed to be insert.ed, and the company can erect a pile
bridge to answer their purposes, which is the ordinary bridge
Mr
KENNEDY
say such suitable ture as shall be approved by the Commissioner of Public Buildings," or any other governmental authority that rutty be named
Mr
FESSENDEN
That does not save the question
You must nmnc the kind of bridge, and that was done by the committee originally
Mr
KENNEDY
well, strike out those words
Mr
YULEE
1 hope that no amendmentwill be made which may render valueless this bill
If a majority of the Seriatc are in favor of allowing the connection bet.ween the roads in Virginia and Maryland, i hope that the bill which provides for that connectio•n will be in such shape as will sc- still secure and economical enough to permit its being made
Mr
FESSENDEN
Will the Senator allow me to ask him whether the bridge he speaks of will cost as much as a solid stone masonry struc- Mr
YULEE
1 cannot say
Mr
FESSENDEN
It is very easy for any- body to answer
The expense does not stand in the way
Mr
YULEE
The diffcult.y would be, that at one part of the river they might safely use piles, and at other parts stone structure would be requi- site; but under the amendment as now proposed, they would be obliged to use piles altogether; and inasmuch as the ordinary wooden pile would rict answer the purpose, it would have to be pneu- matic piles all the way across, which would bo extremely expensive
I cannot say exactly what the cost of one pile is; bat I think some ten or fifteen thousand dollars
Mr
DAVIS
More than that
Mr
YULEE
More than that each pile
Mr
MASON
if it is intended, Mr
Presi- dent, to connect this line of communication, North and South, by a bridge across the Potomac river, I suggest to the Senator who offered the amend- ment, and to the Senate generally,- whether it would not be unwise to restrict the company in such manner as might really either disable them from doing the work, or compel them to make it so incomplete and destructive as to last buta very short time
Now, to build a railroad or viaduct across that river will be a very important and ex- pensive undertaking
The river there, I suppose, must beat least a mile, or more than a mile, wide
We all know that, in the freshets in the early sprincr, coming down with immense bodies of ice, thcsc structures arc very seriously endangered, and more than once they have been carried away
I presume, therefore, that the best engineering skill will be called in aid by the company to see that it is properly done
Now, the amendment which was proposed from the committee leaves it discretionary with tho company to rnake it a pile bridge, " or other suit- able structure.' The Senator from Maine pro- poses to strike out those words, and to limit-Ehern to a pile bridge
have very little knowledge of encrincering; but I have some knowledge of tho force of this river when it has the freshets in the sprincr with the great tnasses of ice which are brought down vainst anv structure in it; and I think it would be unwise," therefore, if we intend to enable them to make this connection, which is really a very important one, to disable them in effect by restricting them as to the mode in which it shall be done
The Senator says that if these words " or other suitable structure" are left in the bill, it will bo in their power to put so solid a work there as to be unsusceptible thereafter of being removed, if it should be contemplated at a future day to make a very solid structure for a highway as well as railroad
Well, a very solid structure, I suspect, will bc put there, if it is necessary to effect the object of connecting the two roads; but it will be no mpre solid than will be necessary to effect the objects of the company to make a permanent cure us the advantage designed by the proposed I j bl*dgc
The bili guards what is really the im- I apprehend that a difliculty, which portant matter; for it provides that no matter what legislation
may defeat the purpose of tl)is bill, will grow out structure is there, it shali have the necessary fa- of' the amendment proposed by the Senator from for keeping open navigationby draws, &c
Maine, and wliich I find my friend from Mary- In the present bridge, Which I have been familiar land disposed to adopt
A wooden pile bridge, with for a great many years, many Senators may I fear, would not have the strength and solidity know there is a causeway, probably one fourth necessary to make a safe structure for thepassage the distance of the bridge, running from the Dis- trict side over to the Virginia shore—a permanent across the river, especially in seasons of the year when very large drifts of ice are moving down causeway of carth and stone—which obstructs the river
A phcumatic pile bridge would bc the tide and the flow of the water, not iniuriouslY strong ehough, but it would be exceedingly ex- at all, for it is built near the shore, and, lacts If not, they may confine themselves, f apprehend, pensive to cross that wido river with pneumatic where it does not affect the navigation; and bc- pro- piles; and I apprehend that the cost of crossing yond that the whole structure is upon piles
Now, vision vyvhic,h was inserted by the committee, on the statement, as I understood, of the persons who appeared on behalf.of the company
It will bc scen manifestly that, if these words be inscrtcd and this act be passed, this company will have authority to put down a solid stone structure, sirn ply leaving draws, as in thc ordinary case, for I should be opposed to the of vessels
that in the present state of things there
hope, thereforc, the amendment will not be adopted
Mr
KENNEDY 1 have no desire at to on pneumatic piles would probably defeat the what this railroad company may contemplate I do not know
purpose of the bill, and defeat the construction, i should presume, however, that for the same reason that a construction by the the structure which iS already there, would be way of Georgetown is prevented, because the cost the best guide for our Government
They may is beyond the
advantage to the companies on design, and probably do, merely to enlarge that I hope, therefore, that causeway, to widen it, so as to give them a whom it will bc thrown
if a wooden pile bridge is not found to be a suff- breadth there for their railroad
ciently safe and strong structure, the bill will open i Mr
KENNEDY
I can say to the Senator to the parties who arc to construct the crossing that that is their view; to build a bridge alongside the privilege of making it in some other form, as of thc present onc on piles
little obstructive to navigation as possible, but II Mr
MASON
I should suppose it was
Now,  1860
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
1.t5 to dimit them, as you would do by a pile bridge, from widening that existing causeway, when that causcWay will be required to be used for a high- way, and limiting them to piles—a destructible material ; or to prevent them from making a cause- way, if necessary, on the Virginia side—I do not know how that would be—would be really prom- ising the right of way across •there in form, and can see no proper-rcason in denying it in fact
limiting this privilcge in any other way than it is limited by the bill—that it shali keep open navi- gation
That is provided for in tl•æ bill
Mr
FESSENDEN
Mr
President, iftheSen- ate is disposed to place in the power of this com- pany the control of that river, so far as it may be necessary for them to havo the control of it, in order to effect their p.u•pose in their own way, very well
All the argument of the honorable Senator from Virginia is then applicable
I do not know but it is so
But, sir, my experience has taught me tliat it is very unsafe to legislate in this way, namely: to påss a bill which gives power to a company to a very great extent, and then take the words of Senators and their own as to what they mean to do with that powkn• after they get it, or that they do not mean to use it, I shall explain to the Senate, by and by, that in this very case -of the Baltimore and Ohio road is an instance of the danger of giving power and taking the declarations of the ()flicers of the company as to how they mean to use that power aftcr the» Now, sir, I do not say that it is not all right that they should have pracisely the power that is granted by the words of this bill, to which I have adverted,.in order to effect their purpose; but my idea is this: if they meant to guard the river, and did not intend to have complete control over it, so far as the nature of their structure was concerned, they would have put the proper language in the bill desc.ribing to whatcxtent they wished to make this bridge solid, and •upon •mat part of it they would_be content with the structure upon piles alone; which, undoubtedly, is adequate to the pur- pose, for it is used everywhere in riversas well as other places
Now, all I have to say to the Senate is this: I have been utterly oppoked to precluding the idea that that is to be an open river at some time or I have been overruled by the Senate in other
that view several times, although sometimes that view has been sustained; but not of late
If, therc- fore, thc Senate choose to adherc to the idea which it has held heretofore with reference to it—that a bridge was to exist there, and that it might as well be a solid structure, and that all the interests of Georgetown which might be involved in it are to be considered as nothing—then it is very well to pass this bill in its present language
But if they Intend to keep that an open question, and not to part with the power which Congress has over the rivcr at that point, then they must strikc out these words; for nobody can help seeing tha•t if you say they tnay erect such a bridge as is suitable, leav- ing it to them to decide what it is, the whole power is zone from Congress with reference to that mat- ter; and they may do anything writh the river and its channel, provided they leave a draw there, that they please to do
Senators witl see that it is a very great power to put into the hands ofa com- pany of this description
Experience has shown me with reference to these companies, that, how- ever well they may be omcered, when they once get.a power under a charter, the interests of the public stand very little in thc way of their own Individual and corporate interests; and therefore my view is always to restrict them in the begin- •ning, and never to grant power which is subject to their own construction, and which we have no control over
Mr
KENNEDY
Mr
President, when this application was made by the Balt.imore company, they took into consideration their interest in this long line of toad
They found themselves with a break occurring at the branch of a lateral road They have but forty miles in tho entire chain of roads from New Y ork to New Orleans
They this road in order to fill up this broken 'link which has been so long demanded by the public interest, They are ready to come forward and build it, provided it does not take too much of their means
They have already expended vast sums of money in completing their connections with the far West, Finding •that this break exists here, and that no other companies have come forward to fill it up, or have been able to do so, they are willing to undertake it
Their interest is a very small one in comparison with the roads further south, and further north
This break operates as a bar, not only to travel, but to transportation, over this road between New York and New Orleans; and they are now willing, provided the expense of building this connection is not too great, to fill up this broken gap
Some three or four years ago there was a report made, in obedience too resolution of Congress, respecting the construction of a new and substan- tial bridge across the Potomac
It has always been regarded that the Government was bound to keep up a permanent bridge for the travel be- tween this city and Alexandria
In 1808a charter was given to a bridge company, who, after they had completed their bridge, formed connections with var:ous turnpike new inter- ests, extending into different parts of Virginia
In 1832 this b12idge company was bought out by the Government of the United States
Two hun- dyed thousand dollars were paid for it, upon the express condition on the part of the Government that it should keep up a good and sufficient bridge there permanently
The people of Georgetown, at the same time, made application to Congress for $150,000, in consideration of what they claimed to be the damage done to them by making this a permanent bridge
They asked, in a memorial which I have here before me, this appropriation of $150,000 to improve their harbor, and to make a bridge across the Little Falls, leading into the upper part of Fairfax and Loudoun counties, in Virgima, and a free road to that point
That sum of $150,000 was given to them by Congress upon the same day that the $200,000 was appro- priated to build a good and' sufficient and perma- nent bridge here
The Georgetown people have in this way been paid for any supposed damage that they laid claim to by the building of this In the memorial in which they made bridge
that application, they state distinctly that they have lost their trade, not by obstructions in that river at all, but by the fact of other railroad com- munications being made into that portion of Vir- ginia from whence Georgetown drew her supplies, and to which shc furmshed supplies in return; that the Baltimore Ohio railroad running into the valley of Virginia at the town of Winchester, in Frederick county, tl'lere tapped the valley coun- ties of Virginia, with their large amount of prod- uce, which, prior to the construction of this road, was all brought to Georgetovvrn•, from which, in return, they obtaine4 supplies by the wagons that brought the grain and produce from that section
It is clearly stated in their memorial that the trade of that vast valley has been carried down to Bal- timore on this line of railroad; but since then, Alexandria, which was also a sufferer, has run her line into the valley of Virginia; and Alexan- dria is now receiving a large amount of the prod- uce brought by these roads out of the upper part of the of Virginia, and supplies, rn groat part, the wants of the city of Washington over the road to the Long Bridge
I forget now the amount of travel, the number of cattle, the num- ber of wagons, &c., passing over it last year; but it '.vas some very large amour! Georgetown has been seeking to prevent this connection with the hope that, some day or other, this•bridge will be taken away, and she thereby get clear ofa troublesome this market; because, if the produce that goes into Alexandria, and that is now brought from there over this free bridge into the city of Washington, shali be excluded, Georgetown will have a great advantage
She has her free bridge running over the Little Falls with a road into the counties of Fairfax and Loudoun, connecting with the Lou- Without going -füriher in!o•", I come back to •the question nowÆ•beforxeøü8öönå that is, simp,y as to granting -Way acros this •bridge to connect with!thé great«sySteni of railreads leading to'the South weSt.- "An,otder was made, in •1857, to the topographieul: cOrp4t&, survey the differentroutes, and report iri'ifavdicof.i permanent structure

Rivesgoes on to say, in accordance withåis instructions and orders: With regard to railroad connection, the Long Bridge site presents every desirable- facility

Ri ves, the topographical engineer, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company have made an examination and
an estimate for this proposed structure, and their estimate for the whole work does not exceed $250,000
It is therefore evident that theydo not contemplate (x.vhat the honorable Senator sup- poses might be their object) making a permanent structure to the injury of Georgetown hereafter
Mr
FESSENDEN
Will the Senator allow me to ask him a question
I have listened to what he has said, and I wish to ask him whether, Twe pass this bill, they cannot vary from their esti- mates, vary from their plans, throw them all aside, adopt other plans, and do just as they please with reference to the river

bed of the said coinpany within said Dtstrict
I will state the grounds upon which I offer the amendment
I do it f the request of certain gen- tlemen connected with the city corporation here
I understand that when the original charter was granted by Maryland to this company, there was an exemption from taxation, in consideration of the tact that a certain sum was levied upon each passenger for the benefit of the State of Mary- land—fifty cents, I think, on a person passing through the State—and which was in full of all taxes and assessments whatever
When Con- gress passed the bill allowing the road to be ex- tended into the District of Columbia, there was a clause in it which gave the right to the company upon the same terms with their original charter
I understand that the attention of the offcers of the road was called to it at the time and the an- swer was made, that they did not irhend to avail themselves of that exemption here in the District of Columbia; but, as a matter of fact, they have objected, and all their property of every kind and description in the District of Columbia, including their valuable real estate, is holden free from as- sessments for the support of the governmen t here, to which other property is subject
I suspect that it is the only instance of the kind on record
The property of these corporations, the real estate especially, is always considered as fit for taxation, like all other property
It will be at once per- ceived that it has the benefit of the protection of the City, of the police ot• the city—such protection as it n-nty afford; and il has all the other privi-legcs that are cointnon to other property in the city
Now, is there any reason in the world why this large and valuable property of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Corn pany within the District of Columbia should not pay its proportion to the support of the several items of nhumcipal expense like other property
I can sec none; and i think now, when we are grunting them additional priv- ileges in this city—the privilege to pass across it and to pass across the river within the, District— they should subject themselves willingly to what all other companies of the same character are subjected to; pay their proportion of taxation according to the property that they hold within the limits of' the District, for municipal purposes; and I have moved the amendment for the purpose of effect.ii')g that object
It strikes me as emi- nently proper
Mr
MASON
The effect of the amendment, I understand, will be not only to subject to ulxva- tion this new structure that this company will make
through the city of Washington, but to subject to taxation their present property within the' District, which, I understand, is not now sub- ject to taxation, MI'
FESSENDEN
Certainly; that is my purpose
Mr
MASON
1 would ask the honorable Senator if that right or privilege is asked for by the city of VVashington 
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 said that 1 offered the amendment at the request and suggestion of some gentlemen who are members of the city corpora- It was suggested to me by the Mayor of tion
Washington this morning, and it had been before
Mr
MASON
1 did not know how that fact was
I do not know anything about the previ- ous legislation on this subject; but I had pre- sumed that if the city of Washington allowed the railroad company to make its present structures within the city limits without at that time asking that they should be subject to taxation, it must have been upon some arrancrement or actual com
pact between them, tacit, if not express
Mr
FESSENDEN
It was stated to me, as I said, that at the time when the original act was under consideration to allow them to extend their road into this District, this objection was made is a mere branch, small ih extent, small in its and pointed out to the omcers of the company, it being said to them that they were not -subject to taxation in Maryland, and
that by the terms of the act all their property- here would be holden from taxation
The answer was, that that might be so; but that they did not intend to avail themselves of that privilege within the District
But after the act X,vent into operation—and it is in accordance, of course, with the proceedings of all companies in like cases—when the attempt was made to subject them to assessment, then the legal objection was made; and from that time to the present they have paid nothing
Now, it is manifest to my mind that all the property OF this company ought to be taked just like all prop- erty of olbcr corporations and of individuals
No consideration w!latever is received by this city more than is received by other cities in like cases
Mr
MASON
The informant of the honorable Senator, whoever he was, meant, of course, to ascribe bad faith to the company
Now, Irave hardly a personal acquaintance with any member of the coinpany that I know of, and no other feel- ing than a desire to facilitate this connection; but submit to the Senate and to that Senator, whether, upon loose and informal conversations in that way with gentlemen who are members of the City Councils, or whoeverthey are, it would be respect- ful or respectable in us necessarily to ascribe bad faith to & companyin which I doubt not there are men of as high character as are to be found in the country
If 'they did plant their public works within the city of Washington with an exemption from taxation under existing laws in Maryland, statino• at the same time that they would not avail themselves of that exemption, and afterwards did, there was not only bad faith but mendacity
Now I can hardly conceive that if the city of Wash- ington designed or desired to tax that property, if it was a greater object to the city to tax it than to have the benefit of its presence and the terminus of the road here at thut time, they would have been content with loose con versation
I am sure the Senator frotn Maine would not have been; I um sure I would not have been
Men arc not accustomed to transact important business in that loose manner, subject to the caprices, or subject to the improprieties, as it n'HIY be, of one of the parties
know nothing aboul the facts; but I can hardly conceive it, possible thata railroad com- pany, with a law that exempted them from tax- ation, could have satisfied the authorities of the city of Washington that they did not mean to avail themselves of the privilege of that law
These loose and informal conversations are Inore apt to rnislead than to enlighten judgments
This Flew structure that the company are to make wili be one, doubtless, of very great cx- pense; because they are to tunnel through the Capitol Hill under some of the streets, and they are to make an erection across the river
The increased emolument they will derive from that portion of the road will be véry little in propor- tion to the expenditure; and now, to avail our- selves of their request, to extend the of tux- alion over property now exempt from taxation,- would be burden that [ should think they could hardly bear
Mr
FESSENDEN
1 do not consider it ma- terial ut all, whether therc was this bad faith or not
It ',vas to rne as an explanation of the It is very clear, therc is no dispute about matter
the tact that they are not now subject to taxation
If that is so, it appears t') me just and reasonable that they should be
If I have been misinformed in any particular—and I have not looked at the acts—of course what I have said will go for noth- i ing
i shali be very happy to be corrected, if I am in error at all; but if the fact is that this large amount of property in this city is not subject to assessment for taxes at this time, and no consid- eration has been paid for the exemption, I think on every principle it should be subject to taxa- tion; and therefore 1 shall insist on the amend- ment, unless gentlemen can give a better explan- ation than f have heard
Mr
DAVIS
I suppose the connection of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, through the city of Washington, with the great system of southern roads, is to the advantage of other persons rather than of the company
it is well known that the great capital of that company is invested in the Baltimore and Ohio road
The road to this city I amount of business compared with the other; and the connection of that branch with the system (.)f southern roads is to the advantage of other people ratherthan of the company; and any incumbrance, either by -taxation in the District or by any oner- ous
requirement as to how the connection shall be formed, may deter the company from the un- dertaking
1 think the connection of this vacant link of great importance to others; of some im- portance to the company certainly, or they would not undertake it; but only important when every facility is afforded to them to enable them to make I regret, therefore, it at the smallest expense
that any condition should be imposed upon them in relation to the bridge, other than such as was necessary to secure the navigation
The remarks of the Senator from Maine, so far as they were directed to the public question of the navigation of the river, thought entirely correct; and I con- curred with him in all his remarks so far as they tended to that result
Beyond that, I do not see why we should engage in the question' of the i bridge
The railroad company have an interest in making the best bridge they can afford to build
A bridge which resists the ice, and which bears the sudden concussion of the track runnino• over it, rnust be a peculiar structure
If they avail themsel ves of the present causeway for the greater portion of the
bridge, the remainder of it must be constructed upon a plan which will serve the pur- pose of the railroad company; and if we impose the restriction that it shall not interfere with the navigation of the river, I think we do all that the public interests require
I will say here that I have known no occasion in which Congress have u l')dcrtaken to interfere with an engineöring ques- tion, to direct how any engineerinff problem should be solved, that they have not done mischief and mischief only; and I Should be glad on this occasion if we would simply allow this company to construct the ccmnection of their branch with the southern roads, svithout throwincr in any hin- drance, either in the form of taxation or in direc- tions as to thc enffineering problem of how they shall cross the river
Mr
CAMERON
Mr
President, 1 am sur- prised that there should be any objection to pay- Ing this tax to the city of Washington
This is the most profitable piece of railroad in the United States—forty miles of railroad on which the charge s $1 50
They pay say fifty 'cents of that to the Slate of Maryland; but one dollar is the highest price paid for traveling the sarne distance on any road north of this
The road is constantly crowded Wilh passemrers,and so profitable is it, that within a month [ will guaranty to find a company who will make a road alongside of it, and who will agree to pay taxation on all their property, and give you a bonus besides, if you wish
The truth is that there is business enough for two roads here
This is a close corporation, N.vhich has been man- a•ing its affairs entirely for its own benefit
'I'he Senator from Maryland believes those gentlemen are not anxious to make the connection
Ele tells us every now and then that if we do not hurry up and give them this privilege, they will make their arrancrcments to go around the town
I an') not in favor of their going through this town unless they do it to the satisfaction of the citizens of Washington and of Georgetown
The Senator from Maryland said, a little while ago, that the channel above this bridge was deeper now than ever before
That is probably true;.but the reason for it is, that the city of Georgetown paid, during the last summer, more than ten thou- sand dollars for deepening the channel and remov- ing the deposits which have been made there in consequcncc of this bridge, as they say
A large portion of the citizens here say that this new road is to bc an injury to them
They have nobody in this House or the other to represent their wishes; but it is the duty of Congress to take care of their interests
I believe that this company should be willing to pay these taxes
They ought to do it
They have possibly $300,000 worth of property in this town
I do not know how much It is; but I presume it is that much at least
The taxation which is charged property-holders here I understand is sixty cents on the $100
That rate on $300,000 would give $18,000 a year—a sum of money srnall, probably, to the company, but which would be very large and useful to the people of this city
There is no reason why a poor  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

Certainly, if' it had been Ilienlioned that they intcndcd to pay to the State of Maryland twenty per cent
upon all their receipts in this District, no mernber of Congress would have given them the right to come into the District
'I'he road runs for about six miles in the District; Crom this city out to Bladensburg; and that twenty per cent
is taken off every passenger who travels over it
Every man going over this road is com- pelled to pay a bonus of twenty per cent
on the chargc of the company; and the charge itsclf is a very high one
Besides that, they permit no- body to come across here who they think inter- fin•es with their business
No man traveling north Baltimore can have his baggage checked through here, or can have any copnection at all, unless it just happens to suit this coxnpany
They will not check that baggage through 'because they say the northern travel is a rival; the reason that some eighty or ninety miles i)orth of Balti- more a road branches off to the west at Harris- burg, which they regard as a rival to their road
What if it is
What right have they to obstruct this channel
What right have they to close the gates between this city and Baltimorc and other cities north, east, and '.vest
We have a chain of railroads runnincr froin Baltimore to the north, reaching the lakes at Niagara Falls, bringing the distance between Niagara Falfs and the city of Washington withil'l ten miles of what it is from Niagara Falls to the city of New York
have another
railroad up through Penn- sylvania going to the northeast, at Nort'humber- land , going out to Lake Ontario, passing through Syracuse, and all that section of New York
We have railroad from Harrisburg runnin«y directly to the city of New York; but here we are taxed fifty cents in throuo•h, because it costs you fifty cents to get your baggage carried across Baltimore frcnn the depot of this company to the o•t.hea• depot
• They will check through the bag- gage of those going to Philadelphia directly, bc- cause they have a connection with and a pecu- niary interest in common with that road; and this is a combined appeal on behalf of the Balti- mote and Ohio Railroad Company and the Phil- adclphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Counpany, to exclude all others
I shall offer an amendment in regard to that connection after a while
I intended now to speak more particularly to the question of taxation
I think it but right that the propert.y of this company here should be taxed
Mr
KENNEDY
May 1 ask the honorable Senator a single question
Do I understand him to say that there is no connection now between the Baltimore and Ohio road and the road running to Harrisburg
Mr
CAMERON
I say there is no c.onncction by which your baggage can be checked through
You can carry it yourself and get it along the best way you Can
Mr
KENNEDY
1 do not know anything about the baggage being checked
The two roads do not join; one is on one side of the city and the other on the other; but the advertisement of the Northern Central railway shows that they do connect with two trains a day
Mr
CAMERON
So they do; but we do not get our baggage carried over

Merely—nothing* further—that this company shall pay upon its property in the city of Washington, which re- ceivcs the protection of the municipal authorities here, such as it may be, its fair proportion of the taxation, in order to pay the expenses of thåt protection
Nothing more, nothmg less
This IS not imposing any burdens on thesc corpörators which they ou•ght not to bear
It is throwing no diffculties in their way
The amount, to be sure, is not large, but it may be important to the city

1 have only one word in addition, Mr
President, and that is this: expe- ricnce proved some years ago, when it used to be customary to grant these charters, and these large powers were given to corporations, that the pub- lic suffered very great detriment from them, from tbc fact that the Legislature had parted witl) all its power on the doctrine of vested rights; but the modern Democratic doctrine for the last twenty years in all these cases has been, in to retain absolute control over it, in order power, tö see that the powers granted were properly ex- ercised, and retain the power to cnforcc it

KENNEDY, 1 hope that amendment will not be adopted
I do not really see what the great Senate of the United States has got to do with checking baggacre
on roads in other States
We are notquite prepared to play the part of baggage- masters, I think
1 hope the amendment will be • Mr
CAMERON
1 am very much delighted with this evidence of dignity—very much indeed
The Senator would like to know what we have got to do with checking baggage in the States
I think we have everything to do with the public's comfort and convenience
Here is railroad that makes the connection with Philadelphia, going North, by one route, but will not do so with others
Why shall a man living away up in Pennsylvania and going to Charleston, South Carolina, bc cornpelted to pay a tax of fifty cents on going through t.he city of Baltimore because of this railroad
No man going North from Balti- more, or coming from the North to Baltimore, going to the South, can do so without paying fifty cents for getting his baggage carried across from onc depot to anothcr
He is even prevented from Inaliing the con nection at Pittsburg and otbcr just because his baggage is not places North chocked, unless he travels by the Baltimore and Ohio road
For instance: a man leaving Pitts- burg, coming down to Baltimore and Washing- ton by the Baltimore and Ohio road, and göino• further south, can get his baogagc checked at Pittsburg and delivered at the erid of his journey Charleston; but if he thinks proper to comc from Pennsylvania by another route, by Pitts- burg and down the straight road, then they will not do so
Now, I can see no barm that this amendment can do to anybody; bat it will do a great deal of good to the public
I cannot imagine why this is to be made a party question on the other side; because all the votes upon this bill to-day, on that side, have been brought up as closely as if it had been the most strict party question in the country
Are the North and the South herc to be divided about checking travelers' baggage or about compelling railroad companies to do their cannot imagine that this duty to the public
It is a fair proposition, and I take is to be so
it for granted that every n'}an who has the public convenience at heart, and who desires to travel conveniently himself, will vote for it
Mr
KENNEDY
I disclaim any design on my part to make it a party question in any view wrhatever
We havc asked simply for the right of way to go through the public property, to •If we facilitate the transportation of the mails
carry out the amendment of the Senator, we may i just as well be compelled to check baggage with I c very other road in the United States
I do not conceive that it is thc business of the Senate at It is a thing for the railroads themselves to all
settle hereafter
Mr
CAMERON
Why, Mr
President, they do chcck baggage with cvery road in the United States' goinrr on their favorite route
A man at Beston can- get his check therc and receivc his bacrgacrc in Washington by this road; but a man coming from the northeast, from Syracuse or Osweo•o or from Niagara Falls, cannot do so, because ib does not suit the interests of this com- pan y, which has a close connection with the Phil- adelphia and Wilmington road
Mr
WADE
Or the northwest
Mr
CAMERON
No in that direction
It is just what every other railroad in thc United States does for a passenger starting from any point in the United States
is no other road or no other piece of road of this extent in the whole country on which you cannot pass from one point of the country to another, wit.h your baggage checked through, except this one
Mr
DOOLITTLE
the object of this mnerldment it IS simply this: when this railroad company comes here to ask for a o•reat convenience for themselves and the traveling pub- lic to go through this city and connect with the railroads south, I think It is but just that we some limitation upon this privilege
Now, thiis Baltimore and Ohio railroad wilf check baggage from here to Chicago, if you will go over the v,' hole linc of their road, and go to Indianapolis, and in that way to Chicago; but if you desire to go there by a morc dire•ct route, by Pittsburg and Cleveland, your baggage cannot be checked it not fbr the simple through at all
Now, sir, question of checking baggage that we want to put a little restriction upon this great mammoth corporation that is taxing every passenger that over it a much higher rate than is charged upon railroads generally
Sir, the vote which we have just taken by yeas and nays gives to me one of thc tnost instra»ctive lessons in the whole political history of the coun- try
For twenty years, x,vhen stood in the ranks of the Democratic party, and helped to fi2ht its battles and win its victories, one of its rallying cries was not to give, by legislative power, au- thority to corporations beyond the power of the Legislature to repeal it
What do we see here
The whole party calling itself the Democratic party of the country, voting in a solid mass to put beyond the control of Congress any power over this corporation
Now, sir, i am willing to "rant a reasonable II privilege to this corporation, and to accommodate the public; but when they ask favors, let them It is no rnore than right to ask yield favors
that this company, if it checks baggage from Washington over one route, shall be required to check baggage and also to makc connections with the other roads that connect with it at Baltimore or at Alexandria; that this road which asks priv- ilcges here for the benefit of the public, shall act fairly and justly with the traveling public and with the railroads that run into it
Mi
DOUGLAS
I am willing to insert any provision in the bill that is proper to secure equal facilities to all the railroads that may be con- nected witli the one that will use this tunnel; but it seems to me that when they merely ask the privilege of making a tunnel under the hill to make this connection, it is hardly right for us to try to regulate travel and transportation on all It strikes me so
the other roads
I cannot understand the attempt to make this a party question
are told about the Democ- I racy all being in favor of one doctrine
Well, if this side has all changed on this subject, it seems to me the other side has changed too; and there- fore, on the question of consistency, are even
I do not think it is necessary to put in any reser- I think the power exists to make vation at all
any modification of a corporation of this kind, whencver the public interests require it, without a reservation of power
It is a curious thing to find apartyquestion made upon an underground railroad, * ' '-this side-- all for
it, and that I' know it is the first 'timefIÆvéi vas agairiSt it
in favor of it, and the first'titné'l ever knexi them to bc against it'
Mr
KENNEDY desire to sirigle word to correct the misapprehension • of
gentle- men on the other side, éspecia-lly"the SenåtOÉfröm Wisconsin
You can check baggage now by tJiis route all the way from New Orleäns to New York, and from 'New York
to New Oi;leanS
Mr
DOOLITTLE
1 admit thät
-That is just the thing of which I complain
This road will check baggage upon some particular'favorite routes of their own, With svhich they are connectéd; but they will not check baggage for other routes -that run into their road
From here to Chicago, over the PittSburg and Fort Wayne rOad—- Mr
KENNEDY
You apprehension
It does not connect with that'road

These lines on which 'it does cÅeck all the way It is continuous frail a)] the through all connect

Mr
CAMERON
If the Senator from Wis- consin will allow me, 1 desire to correct the .Sen& ator from Maryland'
The Senator from Mary- land lives in thc city of Baltimore, and it is most surprising that hc should bc so ignorant of the connection with his own city
Hc says this road is on one side of the town and the Baltimore and Ohio road on the other
They.conneét just as much as the Philadelphia and Wilmington road connects
They connect with the Philadelphia and Wilmington road by a road running through the city , and they have another connection through Howard street m Baltimore; and the Senator cer- tainly ought to know it
Mr
IVERSON
Mr
President, 1 am disposed to favor this amendment asa matter of public con- venience
I know the diffcult_ies and annoyances that occur to travelers; because have experi- enced them in my own case, when we are com- pelled to give up our baggqge at certain points and recheck it frequently upon the road
It is a very great convenience to travelers to have their bacgage checked {Ili•ough from one point to the other, and not be compelled to break for the con- vcnicnce or the interest of the railroad companies
In this case this corporation corne to Congress and ask for what, of course, must be considered a very important privilege
If it was not so, they would not ask for it
Undoubtedly we have the right to impose terms upon them; and if we give them an important monopoly of this kind, a priv-
ilegc which is important to them, it is and proper that we should impose such restrictions upon them, and such terms as will conform and I think it is conduce to the public convenience
just and proper that this road should be compelled to check the baggage of passengers _through all the roads that connect with it, and not put them to the inconvenience of rechecking at Baltimore, or any other point
The Senator from Maryland says thatthis Penn- sylvania road does not connect at Bältitnore
That is a matter of no consequence
: One •runs into Baltimore, and the other runs out of Baltirnore, and they can connect
They can carry the bag- gage by transportation by omnibuses or by bag- gagc-cars, which is freqUen tly donc on other roads
Between here and my residence in my own State, there are numbers of breaks in the railroad
There is one at the city of Richmond; there is another It is more than a mile, at the city of Petersburg
perhaps a mile and a half, between the two de- pots; and yet our baggage is checked through, and we never have any difficulty
They can check through at Baltimore, and carry the bacgacre across to the Pennsylvania road without any in- convenience, and with very little expense to them
If the railroad company is not compelled to do it, then the passengers must do it* and attend toit in person
It is a very great inconvenience, espe- cially to females, who sometimes travcl without I think this provision ought to any protection
bc put in the bill; and as we are giving them an important privilege, they should bc at least com- pelled to extend this convenience to the tråvelipg pu blic
Mr
GREEN
I shall vote against this ymend& It is true, we have a right to impose terms ment
and conditions within this District; butato impose terms and condit.ions on -a business thousand  180 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
December 21, miles off, or anywherc beyond tho jurisdiction of by the Pennsylvania Central or the Fort Wayne the, Federal Government, is certainly wrong
We road, he can only purchase a ticket to Baltimore, would have just as much right to say that they I and can only get his bvmage checked to that should use exclusively Pennsylvania iron and I point
If he is traveling with a colored servant It affects business beyond Pennsylvania coal
our jurisdiction, and we have no right to impose any such conditions
Within this District we have a right to put what conditions we think ne- cessary, but not anything affecting the roads out of it; and I shall therefore vote against it
Mr
BRAGG
I think the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania goes further than the gentleman intimates—the checking of [t requires this company to pro-rate passenger fare '•.V1th all railroad companies or lines which terminate either at Alexandria, Washing- ton, or Baltimore; and the object is to compel business relations for the convenience of thesc cross-routes, one of which, i presume, the hon- orable gentleman alludes to in his own State
MY e all know, as to checking of baggve through, that done on the main lines North and South ; but as tf) these cross-routes, I do not know how it is in the gentleman's section of country, but in my section vou have to attend to your bago•aee when you reach those lines
It cannot bc expected thal a great through line like thisfrom Boston to New —I do not knovv' Orlcans, or perhaps further north how far north you can check your baggage— Mr
KENNEDY

Mr.- CAMERON
As to that portion of amendment in relation to the fare, do not care about it, and are willii$g to strike It out; but want thc right to ha baggage checked through to the city of Washington on all routes
The Senator is not corrccl when he says that they only check baggage through on main routes
r [they do so on all rot.ltes extending to n like this from any part of the United States

Mr
BRAGG
barely s•ucrgesl to tl)C but I will mattor•, f'rmn Pennsylvania, that this thing would not be mutual
We require this road to check bacrcrarrc
Y Qu have no right to require t other lines to check baggage ill this direction
You it, however, obligalory upon this corn pan y di roc.tion, t when t.he is going in one check the If that be the case, thc whole c xpeuse of the thing will fall upon this company, for they must have acycnts comtnon to both roads, or else this company will have the whole ox-nense At all events, it is of that arrant7ement to bear
not obligatory upon the other companies
You by thc Pittsburg road, o-r thc Wheeling road, it is o,nly necessary for him to give a bond here to enable him to go through without any further If he wishes to go by the Pennsylvania question
Central road, he is not only compelled to give a bond here, but he must givc another in Baltimore
If the amendment of the Senator from Pennsyl- vania is to correct this, I shall vote for it
Mr
CAMERON
It is precisely as the sen- ator from Minnesota has staled
Mr
MASON
I know very little of these rad- I road arranxcmcnts; but, as I understand it, if a gentleman is traveling from here to Baltimore, yond our jurisdiction, in the city of Baltimore
The State of Maryland can regulate the road there ; but Congress cannot
The State can make them check the baggage; but we cannot
We can rec- t ulate the road within the limits of this District, but not beyond; and to impose terms of condition, and say that, when we go to the depot in the city of 'Washington, that is within out' jurisdiction, is unfair, unfriendly legislation, indirect legislation, unconstitutional legislation , affecting the road out- side of our limits
Shall we do by indirection what we have no right to do by a direct act
I think clearly not
Mr
CAMERON called for the yeas and nays; and they were ordered
Mr
IUCE
I would ask if that portion of the amendment has been stricken out, to the striking whether he can get his baggage checked from here out of which the Senator from Pennsylvania said i to Baltimore must depend upon the pleasure or he would consent
Mr
CAMERON
1 have no objection to strik- wilt of the railroad company from here to Balti- and then there is a company from Balti- 
i ing it out

I have just this instant been informed of that Fact unless there is some arranoement with thorn
And so, croin•r south, there are halfa dozen com- panies, probably more, from here to New Orleans; und although, presume, there may be some arrangement made by which baggage may be chocked from here to New Orleans, it must be by the consent of those companies, because they cornc under a responsibility by it

Mr
KENNEDY
1 would
rather not, have that in, for the same reasons which I
stated when the Senator offered his amendment before
not disposed to debate it
Mr
FESSENDEN
This is new property which they propose to bring into the city
The question is simply whether you mean to extcnd their exemption from taxation, not only to what is now exempted, but to what they may hereafter brivn% Certainly nobody wouid conter)d for that exclusive privilege

I ment that is to bc rri&do at o•reat expense under hill; and really I do not think we ought t') tax the underground work of this company, taking the whole cost of the work as the basis of taxation
[t can be of no harm to the city of Washington to have the work done
It is underground
It does not release the land above from taxation

The Secretary read the amendment as modified , as follows: sand provided further, That the extension of the said road hereby granted, and the real property of said company cori• nected therewith, shall be Subject to taxation as real estate in the city of Washington, to the same extent as-the-real estate of individuals

1 have I will state to thc Senator from mcnt to proposc
Maryland, and others, that deem it very import- ant, exceedingly so, that the corporate autliorities of the city should have, for the protection of life, and the protection of property, some : power to makc regulations with regard •to thc running of these locomotivcs through streets
Bv the bill as -it now stands confined it to that
they inay run their cn«rit'les through the Streets of this city, within thc limits assigned, by day or by night
There is not a provision in the bill With reference to thc creclion of gates where they cross main streets going lhe whole length of the city, or for lighting the crossinzs, for the -ring- ine of bells, 01' for anything
They have power ri tention, certainly, if this work under the hill should cost hundred thousand dot- I b lays, and be no property in itself, that it should be l! taxed; but where a certain amount of iron is laid down to rnakc the road-bed, that might very well be subjected to estimation and taxation
Nobody can pretend Cor a moment that municipal COP- poration would have u right, in tho asscssment of II wiil be se•en that the object of the amendment taxes, to predicate its assessments upon what a thing happened to cost
That is never done to is pu rely to accomrnodate local travel
the Senator froin Maryland has no objection to my know}edxe, at all
The idea of the amend- I hope it will be, agreed to
I ment is simply this: that where they have prop- it
