 Mr POWELL Mr President move
 that the resolution which I
 håd thc honor to present
 a few dys ago be
 taken up foi action The
 motion was agreed to and
 the Senate pro boedk d
 to the consideration of the
 fohöwing reso lution submitted by
 Mr POWELL on the 6th
 in stanü ResÖb ed That
 so much Of the President
 s message as relates to
 the present agitated and distracted
 condition of the country and
 the grievances between the slaveholding
 and the non slaveholding States
 be referred to a special
 eoinmkttec of thirteen Incmbers and
 that said committee be instructed
 to inquire whether any additional
 legislation within the spherc of
 the Federal authority and duty
 be necessary for the protection
 and security ot property in
 the States and Territories of
 the United States and if
 so that they report by
 bill And that said committee
 be also instructed to consider
 and rcport upon the expediency
 of proposinr such an amend
 nent or amendments to the
 Con stitution of the United
 States as may be necessary
 to give certain prompt and
 full protection to the rights
 of prop erty ot the
 citizens of every State and
 Territory of the United States
 and insure the equality of
 the Statésjand the equal rights
 of all the citizens aiöresaid
 under the Federal Constitution Mr
 POWELL Mr President the object
 of the resolution under consideration
 is to initiate measures to
 save the country frorn its
 present perilous condition to avert
 if possible a dis harmony
 happiness and security to a
 distracted and divided people Events
 arce rapidly crowd ing upon
 us which if not arrested
 will speedily overthrow the Government
 The mere anticipa tion of
 these sad and melancholy results
 have already caused distrust alarm
 and ruin in many parts
 of the country For the
 first time in the history
 of our country we are
 in the midst of a
 fearful commercial and financial revulsion
 now rapidly approaching a most
 alarming and disastrous crisis which
 will reduce thousands upon thousands
 of our people to want
 bankruptcy and ruin which has
 been guch is the produced
 alone by political causes disease
 in the body politic that
 it requires prompt and effcient
 remedies Delay in a crisis
 like this is equivalent to
 destruction The remedy must bc
 promptly and quickly applied or
 all hope of preserving a
 constitutional Union will be lost
 Five of the States of
 this Confederacy acting upon the
 avowal that there is no
 hopc or expectation of security
 for their equality of rights
 within the Union haveiaitiated measures
 which are rapidly tending to
 consummation to form a separate
 Con federacy and three or
 four other States are pre
 paring to follow them in
 the event they should secede
 The resolution proposes to refer
 So much of the President
 s message as relates to
 the present agi tated and
 distracted condition of the country
 and the grievances between the
 slaveholding and non slaveholding States
 to a committee of thirteen
 Senators with instructions to inquire
 whether any additional legislation within
 the sphere of Federal authority
 be necessary for the protection
 and se curity of the
 property of the citizen in
 the States and Territories of
 the United States and if
 so to report by bin
 and also to consider and
 report upon theexpediency of proposing
 such an amend ment or
 amendments to the Constitution of
 the United States as may
 bc necessary to give certain
 prompt and full protection to
 thc rights of prop erty
 of the citizens of every
 State and Terrilorv of the
 United States and insure the
 equality df States and the
 equal rights of tall the
 citizens afore said under thc
 Federal Constitution I do not
 believe that any legislation would
 be a remedy for the
 disease Legislation in my judg
 ment will not restore harmony
 or give just hopes of
 security to the people of
 these distracted States it would
 at best be a palliative
 That palliative if within our
 power we should promptly admin
 ister it would be an
 earnest of what we will
 do and would indicate to
 the country a temper and
 disposition on the part of
 Senators and Repre scntauves that
 would cause the people of
 this vast country who are
 anxiously looking to this Cap
 itol to hope and believe
 that remedies wduld be speedily
 applied that wouid restore harmony
 I peace and pcrmanent security
 to the people of every
 section of the country Unequivocal
 con stitutional guarantees upon the
 points indicated in the resolution
 under consideration are in my
 judgment the only remedies that
 will reach and eradicate the
 disease give permanent security and
 restore harmony concord and fraternal
 feel ing between the people
 North and South and save
 the Union from speedy dissolution
 bvery Senator must see the
 necessity of prompt action If
 something is not done to
 avert it In less than
 thirty days in all human
 probability some of the States
 will have withdrawn from the
 Union Senators every impulse of
 honor duty and patriotism demands
 that we without delay ex
 haustevery constitutional means within our
 power to restore harmony and
 quiet to the country and
 I prescrve a wise and
 just constitutional Union i Our
 Government if administered in the
 spirit and genius oftbe Constitution
 given us by our fathers
 IS the best Governmentcver devised
 by man and it should
 bc the governing motive of
 every patriot to preserve it
 and labor to have the
 Constitution executed as it is
 There is no rational liberty
 save in the supremacy of
 the laws If experience I
 points out defects in the
 organic law let us give
 our best energies to its
 perfection instead of de siring
 its destruction jt cost our
 patriot fathers much toil bloöd
 and treasure to form this
 Gov ernment It was not
 easily or quickly done It
 memberment of the Union and
 restore peace perfecting of the
 Government which was at first
 required the most devoted patriotism
 and the grcotest wisdom to
 accomplish it Our wise ancestors
 devoted themselves assiduously to necessarily
 very dcfective They first resorted
 to what hos been aptly
 called the revolutionary Government Which
 existed from ahe meeting of
 the first continental Congress until
 the finzü rati fication of
 the Articles of Confederation a
 period of about seven years
 I h e Governmen t
 under the Articles of Confederation
 lasted about eight years when
 it was superseded by the
 present It was found that
 the Constitution Constitu t ioo
 defective and required amendment At
 the first session of the
 First Congress after the adop
 tion of the Constitution twelve
 amendments Weie proposed to the
 Constitution tcn of which we
 rc ratified by three fourths
 of the States and became
 part of the Constitution In
 1794 the eleventh amendment was
 proposed by Congress and subse
 quently ratified by the States
 hi 1803 the twelfth amendment
 was proposed by Congress and
 after wards ratified by the
 requisite number of States and
 became part of the Constitution
 Every amendment made to the
 Constitution was made in the
 manner now proposed Let us
 follow the worthy example of
 the noble patriots who have
 gone before us When the
 coun try was imperiled and
 surröiinded _by dangers that threatened
 its ruin they never thought
 of a disruption of the
 Governmentasa re medy They went
 to work like sensible and
 patriotic men to remedy the
 evils by providing additional securi
 ties by perfeczirw the Government
 first by the Articles of
 Confe eration then by the
 adoption of the present Constitution
 and at three different times
 amending it in such manner
 as to meet the exi
 encics ot the times and
 give more ample se curity
 to the people in their
 persons property and religion and
 curing such defects tis experi
 once had pointed out That
 is our duty to day
 Let us never despair of
 the Republic but go to
 work promptly and so amend
 the Constitution as to give
 prompt certain and full guaranteesto
 the rights of cvery citizen
 in every State and Ter
 ritory of the Union Unless
 we proceed to this wrork
 without delay and exhaust every
 teffort to accomplish it wc
 will not have discharged the
 duty we owe to ourselves
 our country and those who
 are to come after us
 Let us employ consti tutional
 remedies for the correction of
 the evils by which we
 are environed and to avert
 thedan gers that threaten to
 ingulf us in inevitable ruin
 Unless we exhaust every means
 within our reach to preserve
 and perfect the Constitution and
 save our common country we
 will be degenerate sons of
 the noblest sires the world
 ever saw Mr President I
 trust the resolution will pass
 unanimously and that the committee
 may be composed of the
 ablest and most experienced Senators
 rcpreScnting _every political party and
 every section of the country
 and thåt they may make
 a repon which will receive
 our sanction and the approval
 of those ve represent and
 thus restore unity quiet and
 security to distracted and divided
 people Such an event would
 cheer and make glad the
 hearts of the lovers of
 consti tutional liberty throughout the
 world I have intentionally forborne
 to enter into any discussion
 of the causes that have
 led to the un fortunate
 state of affai7s by which
 we are sur rounded for
 the reason that it would
 be mani festly improper at
 this time We should indulge
 in no crimination or recrimination
 in a crisis like this
 Let us if possible rescue
 the country from impending ruin
 It will require all of
 our forbearance patriotism and abilitv
 to accomplish this the most
 desirable of all earihly objects
 to a patriotic heart I
 have not stated specific amend
 ments to the Constitution believing
 it best to leave that
 for the consideration of the
 committee contemplated by the resolution
 Mr Prcsident I have briefly
 stated the object of the
 resolution I have no further
 remark to make until the
 committee if it should be
 the pleasure of the Senate
 to pass the resolution shall
 report Mr KING Mr President
 I am not one of
 those who despair of the
 Republic I believe we shall
 go safely through this crisis
 as we have passed through
 many others that in my
 period of time have been
 said to exist I should
 have pre ferred H proposition
 to refer this subject to
 a standing committee and that
 we should go foi 1860
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE ward in
 the regular course of our
 business but I have no
 particular iöeling or choice about
 it and shall make no
 question on a point of
 that kind I propose to
 offer some amendinents to the
 resolution whicb I presume the
 Senator from Kentucky will be
 willing to accept I propose
 to insert next after the
 word necessary where that word
 first occurs in the resolution
 the words to maintain the
 constitutional power of the Fed
 and next after the word
 eral Government or security to
 insert the words of pcrson
 or and nextafterthe word rights
 where that word first occurs
 to insert the words of
 person and Mr YULEE Read
 the resolution as it will
 be if it be so
 amended I he Secretary read
 the amendments Mr HALE Let
 whole resolution be read as
 it will bc when amended
 as proposed The Secretary read
 the resolution as proposed to
 be amended as follows Resolved
 That so much of the
 President s message as relates
 to the present agitated and
 distracted condition of the country
 and the grievances between the
 slaveholding and the non slaveholding
 States be reterrc to a
 special cotnnrittce ot thirteen Inernbers
 and that said com nittee
 be instructed to inquirc whether
 any additional legislation within the
 sphere of Federal authority and
 duty lic neces sary to
 ntaintain the constitutional power of
 the Federal Governrnent or for
 the protection and security ot
 person or property in thc
 States and Territories of thc
 United States and if so
 that they report by bill
 And that said cornutittee be
 also instructed to consider and
 report upon the expediency of
 proposing such an amendrncntor arnend
 Ineut s to the Constitution
 of the Uuited States as
 Enay e necessary to wive
 certain protnpt and full protection
 to the rights of person
 aud of property of thc
 citizens of every State and
 Perritory of the United Statcs
 and insure the equality of
 the States and the equal
 rights of all une citi
 zens afOresaid under the FQderaI
 Const itution Mr COLLAMER I
 desire to call the atten
 tion of the Senator from
 Kentucky to the pro pricty
 of striking out of the
 resolution all about the condition
 of the country and the
 rights of property and simply
 i efer that part of
 tho mes saffe which relates
 to the stage of the
 Union to a special committee
 Mr YULEE I would ask
 the Senator from Ncw York
 to explain the purpose of
 the amend ments he proposes
 Mr KING As intimated I
 doubted whether there was very
 good reason for raising this
 com mittee at all but
 if there be a fitness
 in it I do I
 not desiFe to limit the
 inquiry We hear a great
 dcal of disturbance and diffculty
 and disaffect ion to tbc
 Union The President s message
 indicates to us a diffculty
 in the enforcement of the
 laws and speaks of devices
 by which the legitimate and
 constitutional power of the Governtnent
 is If there is to
 be any inquiry at to
 be exercised all it is
 a very proper subject of
 inqun y whether there be
 any additional legislation necessary to
 maintain its constitutional power which
 trust indeed that every good
 citizen which i know desires
 to see fully sustained and
 exercised T hc other amendments
 direct the attention of the
 com mittec to the security
 of persons as well as
 of property YVe hcar occasionally
 of a mob de stroying
 property and we also hear
 occasionally think of a mob
 which assails an individual the
 security of person is as
 important as that of property
 and I would therefore extend
 the in quirv to all
 these objects if it be
 made at all Mr GREEN
 Mr President 1 to vote
 foi this resolution whether it
 be one way or the
 I do not dee1Yi it
 to be material whether other
 the amendments arc adopted or
 rejected I his is a
 very critical period in our
 country s history and I
 think every effort fairand honorable
 that ances whether they be
 real or imaginary It frequently
 occurs in the course of
 human events when the passions
 are excited and the judgment
 swayed that we must make
 some concessions even where a
 proper sense and a proper
 judgment would say no real
 grievance exists I do not
 intend to pronounce judgment and
 say that this is one
 of those events but I
 will say this there is
 an excitement and embittered feeling
 which without being allayed will
 prove the death knell of
 the Union Shall we then
 stop and permit these conse
 quences to follow without making
 a little effort Union And
 when I say the Union
 I mean the Union of
 the Constituüon I do not
 mean a mere association or
 a conglomeration of States but
 I mean that old constitutional
 Union under which we have
 prospered and under whiph we
 can continue to prosper in
 the future This committee may
 fail ill its good offces
 I there are desponding minds
 and desponding hearts who look
 upon it as a futile
 effort hope I know there
 are excited they arc mistaken
 passions in the extreme South
 ready to close their 1
 hope that they too ears
 against all appeals will pause
 and reflect until we have
 had an oppor tunity to
 consider to compare notes to
 reason Surely in the United
 States a republican Gov ernment
 the popular intelligence IS to
 be repre sented by an
 equality of intelligence in the
 Senate and in the House
 of Representatives Surely we will
 not precipitately hurry over the
 precipice and fall into the
 yawning gulf without an effort
 to reason together to pause
 a moment to reflect and
 see if something may not
 be done That suffcient cause
 to irritate exists I admit
 I will not attribute it
 to the one nor the
 other I shall not say
 the fault is upon the
 one side or the other
 It will be time enough
 for that when the commit
 tee investigates and proposes the
 remedy My main purpose however
 in seconding this resolution and
 in saying that I intend
 to support it is to
 indicate a line of policy
 which I briefly suggested in
 a resolution which now lies
 on your table It is
 this amendments to the Constitution
 or legal enactments unless the
 popular sentiment goes with them
 or the strong arm of
 the Govern ment goes with
 them are not worth a
 straw To talk about amendments
 to the Constitution while a
 vitiated and corrupted state of
 public sentiment prevails North and
 South or either will amount
 to nothing Hence I say
 there must be efforts brought
 to bear on the public
 sentiment to correct what is
 wrono in that or the
 last alternative you must arm
 the Federal Government with physical
 power to enforce the Constitution
 every where These are but
 the two peaceable means I
 would not snap my finger
 for an amendment to the
 Constitution except so far as
 it indicates pub would not
 snap my finger för a
 lic sentiment legal enactment except
 so far as it indicates
 pub lic sentiment I mean
 on the part of the
 States But when we come
 to enforce the Federal Consti
 tution you must arm the
 Federal Government with I hope
 I shall not be met
 with power to do it
 the plea that you will
 build up a central despotism
 f would rather have a
 despotism than anarchy Within the
 lililits of the existing Constitution
 there can be no despotism
 To the extent that the
 power is conferred by the
 present Constitu tion there can
 be no wrong in exercising
 the power of Congress in
 arrning the Executive in arming
 other public functionaries and in
 arming States with power to
 enforce and maintain con stitutional
 rights A repeal of those
 nullifying laws of the North
 would not amount to a
 straw uilcss that repeal comes
 in consequence of a change
 of public sentiment A change
 of the Federal Constitution especially
 guarantying every point named in
 this resolution will not wcigh
 a feather unless it comes
 as evidence of the sentiment
 of the people There are
 but two modes of governing
 any country one is by
 common consent and an ap
 proved and enlightened public judgment
 the other is power physical
 force I propose in the
 reso lution which I submitted
 to employ adequate physical force
 to maintain existing constitutional I
 do not want any additional
 constitu tional rights As a
 matter of course I shall
 never be a stumbling block
 in the way of any
 reason able adjustment and I
 will forego my own opin
 ions arid yield to those
 of my fellow citizens and
 fellow Senators who surround me
 for the sake of peace
 and harmony and security but
 I have no If we
 will enforce the l feeling
 of confidence in it 1
 call Constitution as it is
 we have got enough upon
 the Secretary to read my
 resolution if he pleases The
 Secretary read it as follows
 Resoined That the Committee on
 the Judiciary be in structed
 to inquire into the propriety
 of providing by law for
 establishing an arrned police force
 at all necessary points aiong
 Ehe line separating the slaveholding
 States from the non siaveholding
 States for the purpose of
 maintaining the general peace between
 those States of preventing the
 in vasion of one State
 by citizens of another and
 also for the eficient execution
 of the fugitive slave laws
 Mr GREEN In drawing that
 resolution Mr President as a
 matter of course it was
 suggest ive The details and
 the precise manner in which
 it is to be out
 I lave for the committee
 on calm cool reflection arid
 deliberation BLit the fugitive slave
 qanriot be erally A repeal
 of the enacted by sOme
 of thé northern States Will
 not sure its execdtion But
 thei d is ghe power
 im this Government as it
 is a constitutional Obli e
 gution I trust we shall
 not say it is too
 weak tol enforce and maintain
 its own the emergency Ai
 e we prepared to go
 tot work and Call out
 that power and exercise it
 in the ériél forcement of
 this constitutional right There is
 not a single Senator on
 the other fideofihe Cham ber
 in my opinion who disputes
 the right Thefe is not
 pne upon this side who
 does not asSért the right
 When we see that in
 the attempt to enforce it
 diffculty is interposed and obsiåéles
 thröwn in the way what
 ought we asa Congress to
 do but to go to
 work and provide the necessary
 strength and power in the
 Government to insure the faithful
 execution of the laws And
 if that be done one
 of the great pretended grievances
 of the South if they
 be pretended will be removed
 So far as Missouri is
 concerned her gfievanée is real
 Raids I believe has now
 be come Anglicized have been
 made iritp that Siate time
 and time again As many
 as twelve slaves have been
 taken in into the wagons
 of t heir masters and
 marched off with from ten
 to twenty five horses and
 two or three men killed
 to intimidate the immediate neighborhood
 A force is raised and
 sent after them Before it
 gets there they are all
 dispersed and gone and six
 weeks after it is renewed
 There IS now a cbn
 flict on the border of
 Ibat State under this same
 Montgomery whoj I betieve was
 a lieutenant under John Brown
 and we had to send
 six hundred men against him
 it will cost Missouri 100
 000 and yet they cannot
 cross the border If there
 had been a Federal police
 placed line at proper points
 along there our propell ty
 would have been protected our
 lives would have been preserved
 our money would have been
 saved and the peace of
 the country would have been
 promoted You can never accomplish
 it with I we separate
 into divided communities out it
 a northern confederacy and a
 southern confed cracy such a
 police will be necessary then
 a standing army and forts
 and bristling and ponderous_ cannon
 from one end of the
 line to the other costing
 a thousand times more while
 the peace of the country
 is ddstroyed and that union
 and concentration of effort that
 give im petus and progress
 to a people will all
 bölost and destroyed forever Give
 us that peaceable po It
 may be best to put
 it under mikitary com lice
 mand l do not pretend
 to say Imam only throw
 I am only making the
 re ing out suggestions mark
 that the case is nota
 hopeless one that as grievous
 as the wrong is as
 unfortunate as our circumstances are
 there is adequate power yet
 if we make use of
 it to save the Government
 and redress this wrong On
 the other branches of the
 subject I shall say nothing
 at present I shall wait
 untii the committee reports But
 beföre I close 1 shall
 take the liberty of referring
 tö the fact that this
 falls appropriately within the dUtj
 of the Federal Congress Section
 four Of article four of
 the Constitution says The United
 States shall guaranty to every
 State in this Union a
 republican törm Of government and
 shall protect each of them
 against invasion Now it is
 not enough to say that
 Congress can provide means to
 punish the invaders after thc
 Invasion has been made Congress
 has the right to provide
 the preventive remedy and an
 ounce of prevention is worth
 more thanapound Of cure And
 shall protect each of them
 against invasion Virginia has been
 invaded Missouri has been invaded
 What has Congress done to
 protect any State against invasion
 Nothing except to provide means
 to punish the invaders after
 the mvasion is over Keep
 the peace prevent in vasion
 and the only way to
 do it is to have
 an armed military power And
 on application of the Legislature
 or of the exec utive
 when the Legislature cannot be
 coneened against domestic violence I
 do not propose to go
 into that subjecti_ be cause
 that depends on the application
 of the exec utive but
 you can prevent invasion Then
 the other good result from
 it will be this tthere
 will be a total prevention
 of the abduction of slaves
 there will Be a totäl

 a slave did cscåpc Wc
 found as many friends ready
 to assist us in his

 want that good time to

 you Cannot do it now
 but give it timc to

 the present state of the
 public sentiment of tlie North
 was to bé enduring was
 to be permanent I would
 say it is folly to
 talk about patching up the
 Union but I look forward
 to ja reaction of that
 public sentiment look for Ward

 I hope therefore to clog

 enlightened statesmen of the land

 writers and jurists on this
 subject It not because they
 are new to the Senate
 but because I want them
 to go before the public
 Judge Baldwin in thc case
 of Johnson vs Tompkiiis said
 The foundations of the Government
 are laid and rest on
 tbc rights of property in

 Virginia convention Were it right
 to mention what passed in
 convention on the occasion l
 might tell you that tbc
 southern States even South Carolina

 by these vords That is
 the clause on the subject
 of reclaiming fugitive slaves Judge
 Iredell in the North Carolina
 conven tion referring to the
 fugitive slavc clause in tho
 Constitution said some of the
 northern States they have cinancipatcd
 all of their slaves It
 any of our slaves go
 there and re Inain there
 a certain t ilnc they
 would by he present laws
 be entitled to their freedonn
 So that their Inasters could
 noi got them again I
 his would be c xtretncly
 prejudicial to the inhabitants ot
 the southern States and to
 prevent it this clause iS
 inserted in thc Constitution Charles

 obtained a right to recover

 of Amerlca they ruay take

 Hamilton made the following state
 I ment to the New
 York convention assembled at I
 Poughkeepsie in June 1788 to
 pass on the new Constitution
 submitted to the States by
 the gen era convention assembled
 at Philadelphia It is extracted
 from Elliot s Debates page
 212 n order that the
 committee may understand clearly the
 principles On which the general
 convention acted l think it
 necessary to explain some preliminary
 circum stances Sir the natural
 situation of this country seems
 to divide its interest into
 different classes There are navigating
 and non navigating States the
 northern are properly the navi
 gating States the southern appear
 to possess neither the means
 nor the spirit of navigation
 This differencc of sit nation
 naturally produces a dissilnilarity of
 interests and views respecting foreign
 commerce It the interest or
 the northern States that tbcrc
 should be no restraints on
 their navigation and that they
 should have full power by
 a luajorit y in Congress
 to make commercial regulations in
 favor of their own and
 in restraint of the navigation
 Q foreigners The southern States
 wished to impose a re
 straint on the northern by
 requiring that two thirds in
 Congress should be requisitc to
 pass an act in regulation
 of commerce they w cre
 apprehensive that the restraints of
 a navigation law would discourage
 toreigncrs and by oblig ing
 them to employ the shipping
 of the northern States would
 probably enhance their freight I
 his being the case they
 insisted strcnuously on having this
 provision engrafted in the Constitution
 and the northern States werc
 as anx ious in opposing
 it Much has been said
 of the ianpropriety of representing
 men who have no witl
 of their own whether this
 be rea soning or declamation
 I will not presume to
 say It the unfortunate situation
 of the southern States to
 have a great part of
 their population as wen as
 property in blacks The regulation
 complained of was onc resalt
 of the spirit of accomtnodation
 which governed tho convention and
 without this indulgence no Union
 could possibly have been formed
 And sir considerin r some
 peculiar advantages which we derive
 it is entirely just that
 they should be giat Ified
 I he southern States possess
 certain staples tobacco rice indigo
 c and now abovc an
 cotton I which must now
 bc capital objects in treaties
 of conuncrce with förcign nations
 and the advantages which they
 necessarily procurc in these treaties
 will be felt throughout all
 t11C States t became necessary
 therefore to coinprornise or the
 convention would have dissolved withoc
 it effecting any Would it
 have been wise and prudent
 in that body in t
 his critical situation to have
 descrtcd their country No Every
 man v110 hears me evory
 wise Inan in the United
 States would have condemned them
 l hc con vention were
 obliged to appoint a committec
 for accmn naodation In this
 ctnntnittee the azreclucnt vvas förrned
 as it now stands and
 their report was accepted delicatc
 pöint and it vas necessary
 that all parties should bc
 ind Mr Justice Story in
 book 3 chapter 40 of
 his Commentaries on the Constitution
 of the United States considers
 together the subject of fugitive
 offenders and fugitive slaves After
 quotiug the clause respecting fugitiveS
 from scrvicc he says This
 cla use was introd uccd
 into the Constitution solely ibr
 thc benefit of the slaveholding
 States to enable to reclain
 n their fugitive slaves who
 should have escaped into other
 States where slavery was not
 tolerated want of such a
 provision under the Confederation was
 felt as a gricvous inconvenience
 by the slaveholding States since
 in many States no aid
 whatsoever would be allowcd to
 the owners and somctimcs indeed
 they Inet with open resistance
 And in the next section
 he thus expresses him self
 It is obvious that these
 provisions for the arrest and
 removal of fugitives of both
 classes contemplate sunnnary nainisterial proceedings
 and not the ordinary course
 of judicial investigations to ascertain
 whether the complaint be well
 ibunded or the claim of
 ownership bc cstalJisl cd beyond
 all legal controversy In cases
 of suspected crimes the guilt
 or innocence of the party
 is to be made outat
 his trial and not upon
 the prclinlinary inquiry whether be
 shall be delivered up All
 that would seem in such
 eases to be necessary is
 that there should bo prima
 facic evi dence before the
 executive authority to satisfy its
 judgment that there is probable
 cause to bel ieve the
 party guilty such as upon
 an ordinary warrant would justify
 his corn mitinent Ibr trial
 And in the cases of
 fugitivc slaves there would seem
 to be the same only
 prima facie proofs of ownership
 without putting the clai nant
 to a formal assertion of
 his rights by a suit
 at the common law Congress
 appear to havc acted upon
 this opinion and ac cordingly
 in the statute upon this
 subject have authorized summary proceedings
 beföre a tnagistratc upon which
 he Inay grant a warrant
 Or a rcrnoval In the
 case of The Commonwealth vs
 Griffin Chief Justice Parker of
 Massachusetts holds this language This
 brings the case to a
 single point whether the stat
 ute of the United States
 givin power to seizc a
 slave without a warrant is
 constitutional It is difficult in
 a case like this ibr
 persons who are not inhabitants
 of slave holding States to
 prevent prejudice from havintr too
 strong an effect on their
 minds We must reflect however
 that the Constitution was made
 with sornc States in which
 it would not occur 10
 the rniild to inquire whether
 slaves tt Ivas a very
 serious question when they came
 to gnake the Constitution what
 should be done with stitütion
 That instrument was a compromise
 It was a cotnpact by
 which all are bound We
 are to consider then What
 was the intention ot the
 Constitution words of it were
 used out of delicacy so
 as noG to offend smne
 in the convention whose tt2ehngs
 I verc abhorrent to slavcry
 but we there entered into
 an a rreement that slaves
 should be considered as property
 Sla very would still have
 continued if no Constitution had
 been xnade The Constitution does
 hot prescribe the mode of
 rc claiming a slave but
 leaves it to be detcrmincd
 by Con gress It is
 very clear that it Was
 not intended that appli cation
 shouid be made to thé
 executive authority of the State
 It is said that the
 act which Congress has passed
 on this subject is contrary
 to the amendtnent of the
 Con stitutioa securing the people
 in their persons and pi
 operty against seizures c without
 a complaint upon oath But
 all the parts of tbc
 instrument are to be ta
 ken together ft is very
 obvious that slaves are not
 parties to the Constitu tion
 and the arnendment has relation
 to the parties it is
 said that when a seizure
 is madc it should be
 made contOrmablc to our laws
 This doe not follow from
 the Constitution and the act
 of Congress says that the
 per son to whom the
 service is due lna v
 seize Ec Whether the statute
 is a harsh onc is
 not för us to deterrnine
 But it is objccted that
 person may in this summary
 manner seize a freeman It
 li lay bc so but
 this would be attended with
 mischievous consequences in the person
 making the seizure In the
 case of Jack cs Martin
 Chief Justice Nelson of New
 York now of the Supreme
 Court of the United States
 indulged in similar reasons I
 le said I he counsel
 for tbc plaintiff in error
 contends the mode of naking
 the clairn and of delivering
 up the fugi tivc is
 a subject exclusively of State
 regulation with which Congress has
 no right to interfere and
 upon this view the constitutionality
 of the law of this
 State is sought to be
 sustained It is Inaterial to
 look into the object of
 this clause of the Constitution
 tho evil to be guarded
 against and the naturc and
 character of the rights to
 bc protected and en forced
 in order to cmnprehend its
 rneaning and determine what powers
 and to what extent may
 be rightfully claimed undcr it
 At the adoption of the
 Constitution a stnall minority of
 the States had abolished slavery
 itllin their limits either by
 positive enactlnent or judicial adjudication
 an the southern States are
 known to have been tnorc
 deeply interested in slave labor
 than those of the North
 where slavery yet to so
 ne extent cxisted but whcre
 it must have bccu seen
 it would probably E oon
 disappear It was for that
 portion Dt the Üuion to
 tear that the latter States
 Inight under the influence ot
 this unhappy and ex citing
 subject be tenujtcd to adopt
 a course or legislation that
 ouåd cnrbarrass the Hvncrs pursuing
 their fugitive slaves it not
 discharge them fro n scrvicc
 and invite es cape by
 aflördiug a place of refuge
 They already had sollic experience
 ot the perplexities in this
 respect under the ConfQdoraliou which
 coutaincd no provision on this
 subject and the serious and
 altnost insurmountable diffi cutti5S that
 this of property occasioncd in
 the con vention were well
 calculated to confirm their strongest
 apprehensions J this source luust
 be attributed no doubt the
 prov ision of thc Constitution
 and which directly Incets thc
 cvil by not only prohibiting
 thc States from enact in
 any regulation diseharging t he
 slave from service but by
 directing that he shall be
 delivered up to the owner
 implies a doubt whether they
 would in the exercise of
 un restraiucd power regard the
 rights t the owner or
 prop erly protect the n
 by lorai legislation Ithc object
 tho provision being thus palpable
 it should receive a construction
 that will operate most effect
 ually to a ccomplish the
 cnd eonsistcnt with the terms
 of it I his We
 may reasonably illfer will be
 in accordance with the irnent
 of the niaket s and

 especially interested in its exe
 cution Which power then was
 it intendéd should bc charged
 with the duty of prescribing
 the mode in which this
 injunction of the Constitution should
 be carried into effect and
 ctltorcing its execution the States
 or Congress It is very
 clear tf left to the
 former the great ptirpose of
 the provision might bc deiéated
 in spitc of the Constitu
 tion I hc Sta cs
 light otnit any legislation on
 the subject and thereby leave
 the owner without any known
 tneans by which to assort
 his rights or they might
 so encumber and o nbarrass
 the proc eéution of them
 that their legis lat i02i
 on thc subject would be
 tantamount to denial That alf
 this could not be done
 or 01nitted without disregarding the
 spirit of the Constitution true
 but the provision itself is
 founded upon thc assmnption that
 Without it the acknowledged rights
 of tho owners would not
 be observed or protected it
 v ras Inade in express
 tenns to guard against a
 possible act of injustice by
 thc State authorities idea t
 bat the frtuners of thc
 Constitution intended to leave the
 regulation of this subject to
 the States when the pro
 vision itself obviously sprang out
 ot their föars Of partial
 aud unjust legislation by the
 States in respect to it
 cannot readily bc adlnitted It
 would present an inconsistency Of
 action and an unskillfulness in
 the adoption of rneans for
 the in view too remarkable
 to have been overlooked by
 a rnuch less wise body
 of men They must naturally
 have seen and felt that
 the spirit apprehended to exist
 in the States v llich
 Inade this provision expedient would
 be able to Crusi_rate its
 object in rcgulating the mode
 and Inannet of carrying it
 into effect that the remedy
 Dt the evil and the
 security of rights would not
 be complete unless this pmver
 was also vested in the

 purpose are instituted to set

 prob Able grounds iör believing
 that the ctainr 01 the
 master to the service of
 the supposed slave is invalid
 Mr Justice Story of the
 Supreme Court of the United
 States in the case of
 Prigg Us The State Of
 Pennsylvania thus defines the rights
 of the slaveowner under that
 article of the Constitution The
 clause inanifestlv contemplates the existence
 ofa positive unqualified righi on
 the part of the owner
 of the slave which no
 State law or regulation can
 in any way quality regulate
 control or restrain The slave
 is not to be discharged
 from service or labor in
 consequence of any I he
 question can never be how
 State law or reutuation much
 the slave is discharged from
 but whether he is dis
 charged froni any by the
 natural or necessary operation of
 l he question is not
 one State lat vs or
 State regulations of quantity or
 degrec but of withholding or
 controlling thc incidents of a
 positive and absolute right tllis
 be so then all the
 incidents to the right attach
 also the owner must therefore
 have the right to seize
 and repossess the slave which
 the local laws of his
 own State contor upon him
 as property Upon this ground
 we have not the slightest
 hesitation in holding that under
 and in virtue of the
 Constitution the owner of a
 slave is clothed with entire
 authority in every State of
 thc Union to seize and
 recapture his slave whenever he
 can do it without any
 breach of the peacc In
 this sense and to this
 extent or any illegal violence
 this clause of the Constitution
 nmy properly be said to
 ex ecute itself and to
 require no aid fronl legislation
 State or national But the
 clause of the Constitution does
 not stop herc nor indeed
 consistently with its prolOssed objects
 could it do so Many
 eases must arise in which
 if the remedy of the
 owner svcre confined to the
 incre right of seizure and
 recaption he would be utterly
 without any adequate rc He
 may not bc abic to
 jay his hands upon the
 slave He nay not be
 able to cntörce his rights
 against persons who either secrete
 or conceal or withhold the
 slave He may be restricted
 by local legislation as to
 the modes of proof of
 his ownership as to the
 courts in which he shall
 sue and as to the
 actions which he Inay bring
 or the pro cess lie
 tna v use to compel
 the delivery of the slave
 Nay the local legislation inay
 bc utteriy inadequate to furnish
 the appropriate redress by authorizincv
 no process in rein or
 no specific mode of repossessing
 the slave leaving the owner
 at l cst not that
 right which the Constitution designed
 to secure a specific delivery
 and repossession of the slave
 but a mere reinedy in
 dannagcs and that perhaps against
 pcrsous utterly insolvent or The
 State legisla tion Inay bc
 entirely silent on the whole
 subject and its ordinary remedial
 process franncd witti different views
 and objects and this Inny
 be innocently as well as
 designedly donc since every State
 is perfectly competent and has
 the exclusive right to prescribe
 the remedies in its own
 judicial tribunals to Iirn t
 the titnc as well as
 thc mode of redress and
 to deny jurisdiction over cases
 vvhich its own policy an
 i its institutions either prohibit
 or discountenance if theretöre the
 clause of thc Constitution had
 stopped at the recogniti0i1 of
 the riaht without providing or
 contmnplating any Incans which it
 might be established and enforced
 in cases where it did
 not execute itself itäs in
 a areat variety of cases
 plain that it would have
 been a delusive alid ennpty
 denunciation And this leads us
 to the consideration of the
 other part of the clause
 wilie h implies at once
 a auarantee and duty it
 says But he thc s
 avc shall be delivered up
 on claim of the party
 to honi such labor or
 service is due in what
 Inode to be deliverea whmn
 to be dciivered up up
 flow if a refusal takes
 place is the right of
 delivery to be enforced Upon
 what proofs When and under
 what circumstances shall tinc possession
 of the owner after it
 i obtained be conclusive of
 Ilis right so as to
 pre ciude any further inquiry
 and c xan ination into
 it by local tribunals or
 otherwise while the slave is
 in possession of the owner
 or in t ransitu to
 the State from which he
 fled i hese and many
 other questions will readily occur
 upon tbc slightest attention to
 the clause and it is
 obvious that they can receive
 but one satisfactory answer They
 require the aid of legislation
 to protect the right to
 enforce the delivery and to
 sceurc the subsequent possession of
 It is historicaliy well known
 attain thec ends proposed I
 that the object of the
 clause of the Constitution relating
 to persons owing service and
 labor in one State escaping
 into another was to secure
 to the citizens of the
 slave holding States the ccnnplcte
 right and title of ownership
 in their slaves as property
 in every State o the
 Union into whiell they might
 escape fronr tbc State where
 they were held in servitude
 I he full recognition of
 this right and titte was
 indis pensable to the security
 of this species of property
 in all che slaveholding States
 and indeed was so vital
 to the pceservation of their
 domestic intcrcsts and institutions thå
 t it cannot be doubted
 that it constituted a fundamental
 artil le without the adoption
 of which the Union could
 not formed Its true design
 was to guard agaiqst the
 dö trines and principles prevailing
 in the non slave holdin
 St ates by preventing them
 from intermeddling witli 01 bstructing
 or abolishing the rights of
 the own ers ot sli
 es The clause in the
 Constitution relating to fugitivcs from
 labor manifestly contemplates the existence
 of a positive unqualified right
 on the part of the
 owner of the slave which
 no State law or regulation
 canin any way quality regulate
 control or restrain Any State
 law of regulation which interrupts
 limits delays or postpones the
 rights of the owner to
 the iminediate command of his
 ser vice or labor operates
 pro tanto a discharge of
 the slave therefrom The owner
 ot a fugitive slave has
 the same right to seize
 and take him in a
 State to which he lias
 escaped that hc has in
 a State from which he
 fled The court have not
 the slightest hesitation in holding
 under and in virtue of
 the Constitution the owner of
 a slave is clothed with
 the authority in every State
 of the Union to the
 slave If indeed the Constitution
 guaranties the right and if
 it requires th e dc
 i xery tibon the claim
 of the owner as cannot
 well be iöubte d thc
 natural inference certainly is that
 the nationai Gove nment is
 clothed with the appro The
 funda Inental principle appiicable to
 ail cases of this sort
 would seem to be that
 where the end is requited
 the means are given and
 where the duty is enjoined

 func tiouaries to whom it
 is intrusted I he clause

 the natural abd necessary conclusion
 is that the national lczisiative

 and duties imposed by the
 Constitution It sviil probably be
 found when we took to
 the char acter of the
 Constitution of the United States

 secures as well as to

 absolute positive right and duty

 an cqual and supreme force

 T he right an i
 duty are coextensive and uni

 the cvgnt of the secession
 Of several of the States
 of the Unidn California would
 avail herself of the opportunity
 to declare ber own independence
 and in conjunction with the
 other territory of the United
 States on the Pacific form
 a Pacific Republic Mr President
 there is not a word
 ot trutll in this idea
 and it does great injustice
 to the people of that
 State This Union has no
 more loyal subjects than the
 people of California and out
 of i belicve there are
 her half million population not
 many who are for disunion
 in any shape California will
 remain in the Union as
 it is and as it
 may be And if as
 seems now to be con
 ceded the cotton States from
 the Union and are eventually
 followed by all the southern
 States California I am certain
 will still remain with the
 great West and the North
 with whom she is identified

 upon the 16th of April

 or wrong of the presentagitatingquestion
 a qucstion in which California
 has no present or vital
 interest I feel it my
 bounden duty to thus give
 not only my own opinion

 representatives to state what I
 believe to be the voice
 of hec majority Thero is
 but onc thing which will

 of the people of the
 Pacific from the Union as
 it is or as it
 may be and that is
 a failure to give thern
 a Pacific railroad and until
 it is completed overland mail
 facilities Upon this question they
 are unanimous and since the
 great West and North are
 thoroughly committed to this material
 idea t heir loyalty cannot
 be questioned I shall Mr

 Mr BOWELL It was to
 strike out all after the
 ivord members and insert DOUGLAS
 and others Let the resolu
 tion be l eäd as
 it now stands Mr POWELL
 very well The Secretary read
 the resolution as proposed to
 be amended as follows Resolved
 That so much of the
 President s mcseage as relates
 to the agitated and distracted
 condition of the coun try
 and the grievances between the
 slaveholding and non slaveholding States
 be to u special ccnnmittee
 of thirteen members and that
 said corrnnittee be instructed to
 inquire into the present condition
 of the country and report
 by bill or otherwise Mr
 KING Mr President if therc
 be any thing whatever that
 ought to be inquired into
 In my judgment it is
 whether the laws be sufficient
 to enable the Government to
 maintain itself and to enforce
 its constitutional powers but I
 suppose that by parliamentary rule
 my amendment alsö fails when
 the original proposition fails I
 have no disposition to embarrass
 this matter in any way
 and if no instructions are
 given then I take it
 what I have proposed will
 be a subject matter fdr
 the consideration of the committee
 The VICE PRESIDENT The proposition
 ae ncjw amended is before
 the Senate Mr FOSTER I
 am extremely rejoiced for one
 Mr President Mr IVERSON 1
 rise to a point of
 order 1 desire _to know
 whether there is not a
 special order geta art for
 to da at one o
 clock The PRESID NT The
 Chair asks pardon of the
 Senate he observes that the
 hour has passed by a
 few minutes and he must
 call the attention of the
 body to the special order
 Mr CRITTENDEN hope we shall
 pro ceed with the business
 before us FLORIDA CLAIMS The
 VICE PRESIDENT The order is
 the bill S No 230
 declaratory of the acts for
 carrying into effect the ninth
 article of the treaty between
 the United States and Spain
 Mr IVERSON As neither the
 Senator from Florida MÉ MALLORY
 nor my colleague Mr TOOMBS
 who have taken a very
 dee i mterest in this
 bill is present I move
 with the concur rence of
 the friends of the bill
 that it be post potied
 for one week and madc
 the special order for Monday
 next at one o clock
 MIE HALE 1 do not
 rise to oppose the mo
 tiop but I want to
 make a suegestion to the
 chair man of the Committee
 on Claims who has the
 bill in charge It is
 a very important measure which
 excited i Éreat deal of
 discussion at the last ses
 sion and the action öfthe
 Senate was rather ad verge
 to it Since then I
 have been appealed to by
 some gentlemen who feel an
 interest in the matter and
 am earnestly desired to examine
 it I spoke and voted
 against it at the last
 session and I am desirous
 to examine it and willing
 to do so I shall
 give it a fair examination
 but f want to suggest
 to the Senator from Georgia
 that it is not possible
 that that can be done
 between now and next Mdnday
 If he will putit ofuntil
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 10 est
 one to promote peace and
 hdrmony in the after the
 holidays I think he will
 have an oppor country I
 certainly must not be understood
 as tunity to get a
 more intelligent vote on it
 I am committing myself to
 some in the desirous of
 examining the case and if
 it is worthy resolution in
 regard to amendments to the
 Consti ofa vote givirv it
 tution and so forth but
 1 do commit myself to
 Mr IVERSON We can postpone
 it again any patriotic effort
 to promote harmony and peace
 on Monday if the Senator
 should not be in a
 con in OUR country As
 the resolution stands it seems
 dition then to consider it
 I propose to postpone to
 me certainly to be quite
 unexceptionable to it until Monday
 because I am not advised
 of the any one It
 covers the whole ground It
 can movements either of my
 colleague or the Senator It
 as tnuch not be said
 to have any party aspect
 from Florida both of whom
 feel an interest in the
 belongs to one side of
 thæ Chamber as the other
 bill I prefer to have
 it postponed until Monday It
 is broad and liberal as
 language can make it and
 no longer for thc present
 and then of course And
 if there is as I
 trust there is a disposition
 we can be governed by
 circumstances we ca here and
 I hope elsewhere to promote
 the har postpone it until
 after the holidays and goon
 t n mony and peace
 of the country a resolution
 of as the Senate may
 think proper this sort is
 certainly a most appropriate one
 under The VICE PRESIDENT put
 the questi on Mr IVERSON
 s motion and it was
 agreed which we may make
 the effort Mr DOUGLAS Mr
 President 1 only rise STATE
 OF UNION to express my
 regret that the Senator from
 Con The VICE PRESIDENT The
 resolution of necticut should have
 deemed it consistent with the
 Senator from Kentucky is before
 the Senate his duty to
 try to bring party politics
 and party and the Senator
 from Connecticut is entitled to
 discussion into this question at
 this time had the floor
 hoped that we could lay
 aside our party feuds Mr
 FOSTER 1 have no disposition
 Mr until we had saved
 the country and then if
 we President to occupy the
 time of the Senate I
 must let us quarrel about
 who shall govern it af
 hope the question may be
 takel l on the resolution
 terwards I am ready to
 act with any party with
 and that it may pass
 I for one feel very
 much any individual of any
 party who will come to
 rejoiced that the honorable Senator
 from Ken this question with
 an eye single to the
 preserva tucky has proposed it
 not because I suppose tion
 of the Constitution and the
 Union Mani there is any
 great need of legislation here
 but festations of approbation in
 the gallery i trust that
 the country is looking towards
 us and if we we
 may lay aside all party
 grievances party do nothing public
 excitement will be rather in
 feuds partisan jealousies and look
 to our coun creased than
 diminished If we take a
 step which try and not
 to our party in the
 consequences of looks toward consideration
 of the distracted con our
 action Sir I am as
 good a party man as
 any dition of the country
 it may tend to allay
 public one living when there
 are only party issues at
 excitement to some extent and
 if it do to any
 stake and the fate of
 political parties to be pro
 extent it is surclv desirable
 that it be done I
 vided for But sir if
 I know myself I do
 not should have voted for
 the resolution of the hon
 desire to hear the word
 party or to listen to
 any orable Senator from Kentucky
 without amend party appeal while
 we are considering and dis
 mcnt had hc not agreed
 to amend it not because
 cussing the qnestioÖs upon which
 the fate of the I
 could agree with its terms
 and phraseology al country now
 hangs Applause in the galleries
 together I was much better
 satisfied certainly Mr DAVIS oljtained
 the floor With the resolution
 as proposed to be amended
 by The VICE PRESIDENT Will
 the Senator the honorable Senator
 from New York but still
 from Mississippi pause moment The
 Chair I say I sh
 c uil l have voted
 I think for the ori
 has observed several times this
 morning as dif ginal resoiu
 acn had the amendments not
 been ferent Senators have been
 speaking a disposition acceptable to
 the Senator who moved it
 and I to applaud in
 the gulleries It has not
 been usual should have done
 so for reasons satisfactory to
 in the Senate and at
 this time pan be productive
 my own mind of no
 good and cannot be tolerated
 No matter Our Federal Government
 Mr President to what Senator
 is addressing the Chair the
 Chair day is and for
 many years pasthas been in
 the will deem it his
 duty to enforce tbc rurcs
 pf the hands ofa great
 political party called usually I

 and ordep in these the
 Democratic party The President of
 the Uni large galleries ted
 States belongs to that party
 all the heads of Mr
 MASON The Senator from Mississippi
 Departments belong to that party
 a large major will me
 in adding to what has
 fallen from ity of the
 members of this Senate belong
 to that the President that
 it not only has not
 been usual party The only
 exception to the remark I
 have but it can only
 bc considered an indignity to
 the made if any exception
 can be made is the
 House Senate for those in
 the galleries to express appro
 of Representatives where that party
 may not bution or disapprobation
 at anything that passes and
 indeed does not have a
 numerical maprity here and I
 trust that if it occurs
 again the Pre Still the
 rcmark is true that the
 Federal Govern siding Offcer will
 order the galleries to be
 cleared ment is now in
 the hands of the great
 Democratic It is an indignity
 to the Senate whether the
 party of this country manifestation
 be of approbation or disapproba
 Under tbese circumstances we are
 told that tion our Union

 The Senatorfrom falling to pieces
 In that stxe of things

 gallant and patriotic u State
 as any been little in
 the discussion this morning to
 cheer one in this Union
 of States comes forward with
 or illumine it When the
 proposition of tbe Sen a
 proposition which I should feel
 it my duty to ator
 from Kentucky w as presented
 not very support because it
 looks toward allaying the hopeful
 ofa zood result l was
 yet willing to wait excitement

 it might produce exist in
 the country and it looks

 the first time it has
 been con ing back harmony

 have we country received One
 Senator presente as a cure
 for The disruption of the
 country and its falling to
 the public evil impending over
 us to invest the pieces
 even though it happened in
 the hands of Federal Government
 with such power the Democratic
 party would be deplored by
 me as properly belongs to
 monarchy alone Another as much
 as by any man in
 this body and such announces
 that his constituents cling to
 the fred an event wou14
 be as much deplored by

 another rises atives here to
 do all that honorable and
 patriotic to point out that
 the evils of the land
 are of a men could
 do to avert that catastrophe
 She party character Sir we
 have fallen upon evil would
 expect them to rise far
 above all party times indeed
 if the great convulsion which
 now considerations if by so
 doing they could prevent shakes
 the body politic to its

 so disastrous a result With
 by such quack nostrums as
 these Men I therefore entertaining
 the opinions I do in
 must look more decply must
 rise to a higher alti
 regard to the amendments proposed
 by the Sen tude like
 patriots they must confront the
 danger ator from New York
 should have voted for the
 face to face if they
 hope to relieve the evils
 which original resolution and would
 very cordially now disturb the

 i the causa 1860 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE of the evils
 which beset us The diagnosis
 of the disease must be
 stated before we are prepared
 to prescribe Is it the
 fault of our legislation here
 If so then it devolves
 upon us to correct it
 and we have the power
 Is it the defect of
 the Federal organization of the
 fundamental law ofour Union I
 hold that it is not
 Our athcrs learning wisdom from
 the experiments of Rome and
 of Greece the one a
 consolidated Republic and the other
 strictly a Confederacy and taught
 by the lessons of our
 own experiment under the Confederation
 came together to form a
 Constitution for a more perfect
 Union and in my judgment
 made the best Government which
 has cver been instituted by
 man It only requires that
 it should be car ried
 out in the spirit m
 which it was matlc that
 the circumstances under wrhich it
 was made should continue and
 no evil can arise under
 this Gov enunent for which
 it has not an appropriate
 rem edy Then it is
 outside of the Government else
 where than to its Constitution
 or to its adminis tration
 that We are to look
 Men must not creep in
 the dttst of partisan strife
 and seek to make points
 aTainst opponents as the means
 of evading or meeting the
 issues before us The fault
 is not in the form
 of the Government nor does
 t he evil spring from
 the manner in which it
 has been administered Where then
 is it It is that
 our fathers formed a Government
 for a Union of friendly
 States and though under it
 the people have been prosperous
 beyond comparison with any other
 whose career is recorded in
 the history of man still
 that Union of friendly States
 has changed its character and
 sectional hostility has been substituted
 for the fraternity in which
 the Government was founded do
 not intend here to enter
 into a statement of grievances
 I do not intend here
 to renew that war of
 crimination which for years past
 has disturbed the country and
 in which I have talccn
 a part perhaps more zealous
 than use ful but cull
 upon all men who have
 in their hearts a love
 of the Union and whose
 service is not merely that
 of the lip to look
 the question calmly but fully
 in the face that they
 may see the true cause
 of our danger which from
 my examination believe to be
 that a sectional hos tiiity
 has been substituted for a
 general frater nity and thus
 the Government rendered pow crless
 for the ends for which
 it was instituted The hearts
 of a portion of the
 people have been perverted by
 that hostility so that tbc
 powers dele yated by the
 compact of union are regarded
 not as means to secure
 the welfare of all but
 as instruments for the destruction
 of a part the rninority
 section How then have we
 to provide a remedy By
 strengthening this Government By instituting
 physical force to ovcrawe the
 States to coerce the people
 living under them as members
 of soverci n communities to
 pass under the yoke of
 the Fedoral Government No sir
 I would have this Union
 severed into thirty three fragments
 sooner than have that great
 evil befall constitutional liberty and
 representative govern mont Our Government
 is an agency of dele
 gated and strictly limited powers
 Its founders did not look
 to its preservation by force
 but the chain they svove
 to bind these States together
 was one of love and
 mutual good offces They broken
 the fetters of despotic power
 they had separated themselves from
 the mother coun try upon
 the question of community independ
 ence and their sons will
 be degenerate indeed if clinging
 to the mere name and
 forms of govern mcnt they
 forge and rivet upon their
 posterity thc fetters which their
 ancestors broke But it has
 been said this morning that
 we should not discuss the
 cause of existing evils Then
 how arc we to ascertain
 the appropriate remedy It is
 duty to discuss the cause
 and confront the danger as
 men resolved to perform the
 public service as best may
 serve the common good and
 equally resolved not to engage
 in a scramble of that
 section here and now to
 say so if your people
 are not hostile if they
 have the fraternity With which
 their fathers camc to form
 this Umon if they are
 prepared to do justice to
 abandon their opposition to the
 Constitution and the laws of
 the United States to recognize
 and to maintain and to
 defend all the rights and
 benefits the Union was designed
 to promote and to secure
 Give us that declaration give
 us that evidence of the
 will of your constituency to
 restore us to our original
 position when mutual kindness was
 thc animating motive and then
 we may hopefully look for
 reme dies which may suflice
 not by organizing armies not
 so much by enacting laws
 as by repressing the spirit
 of hostility and lawlessness and
 seeking to live up to
 the obligationsofgood neighbors and friendlv
 States united for the common
 welfare To dwell upon anti
 fugitive slave laws is to
 deal with the symptom only
 valuable as it indicates the
 disease which demands attention What
 though all the personal liberty
 bills were repealed would that
 secure our rights Would thatgive
 us the Union our fathers
 made Would that renew good
 offces or restrain raids and
 incendiarism or prevent schools being
 founded to prepare mis sionaries
 to go into lands where
 they are to sow the
 seeds of insurrection and wearing
 the livery of heaven to
 serve the Devil by poisoning
 wells and burning towns These
 are offenses such as no
 people can bear and the
 remedy for these is in
 the patriotism and thc affection
 of the people if it
 exists and if it does
 not exist it is far
 better in stead of attempting
 to prcserve a forced and
 there fore fruitless Union that
 we should peacefully part It
 is not to and each
 pursue his septu ate course
 this side of the Chamber
 that we should look for
 propositions it is not here
 that we can ask ftn
 remedies Complaints with much amplitude
 of specification have gone forth
 from the members on this
 side of the Chamber heretofore
 It is not to be
 expected that they will be
 renewed for the people have
 taken the subject into their
 own bands States in their
 sovereign capacity have now resolved
 to judge of the infractions
 of the Fed eral compact
 and of the mode and
 measure of redress All can
 usefully or properly do is
 to send to the people
 thus preparing to act for
 themselves evidence of error if
 error there be to transmit
 to Lhem the evidence of
 kind feeling if it actuates
 the northern section where they
 now believe there is only
 hostility If we arc mistaken
 as to your feelings and
 pt u poses Five a
 substan tial proof that here
 Ilia y begin that circle
 which hence may spread out
 and cover the whole land
 with proofs of fraternity of
 a reaction in public sovereignties

 Confederatiom feüiid ib to Ibe

 and the great American idea
 that Ian governments rest on

 But our existing Government is
 not the less sacred to
 me because it was not

 it the more because it
 was the fræ will offering
 of men who chose to
 live together It roo_ted in

 not to disband armies and

 Declaration of is not the
 Union to which we were
 invited and so carefully was
 this guarded that when our
 Independence Mr POVVELL The Senator
 from Mississippi fathers provided for
 using force to put down
 in surrection they required that
 the fact of the in
 will allow me to say
 that I spokc of the
 Govern I said time and
 money surrection should be communicated
 to the author mcnt not
 of the Union ities of

 When it was to give
 to personal advantage It is
 only by laying bare the
 ment Mr DAVIS The Government
 is the ma I Congress
 power to execute the laws
 against æ disease that we
 are to find a remedy
 It is an ulcer I
 chinery established by the Constitution
 it is the i delinquent
 State it was refused on
 the ground Cautery not plasters
 must be applied to it
 Then where is the remedy
 the question may agency created
 by the States when they
 formed that that would be
 making war on the States
 the Union Our fathers I
 was proceeding to say though
 I know the good purpose
 of rny lion asked In
 the hearts of the people
 is the ready reply and
 therefore it is that turn
 to the having fought the
 war of the Revolution and
 orabic friend from Missouri is
 only to P 0 tection
 to constitutional rights I fea
 i Ins propo other side

 break the tion to the
 section in which have been
 commit ted the acts that
 now threaten the dissolution of

 Government feeble chain provided and

 1 call on you the
 representatives of of Great Britain
 these States as independent intended
 to guard That Government 30
 iS aboUt toinstitute by passing
 into hos tild hands beeömes
 a weapon for his destruction
 not his proEection All dangers
 which we may be called
 upon to confront as independent
 communities are light in my
 est imation compared with that
 which would hang over ms
 if this Fed eial Government
 had such physical force if
 its character was changed from
 a repreSentatiVe agent of States
 to a central Government with
 a military power to be
 used at discretion against the
 States To day it may
 be the idea that it
 will be used against same
 State which nullifics the Constitution
 and the laws some State
 which passes laws to obstruct
 or repeal the laws of
 the United States some State
 which in derogation of our
 rights of transit under the
 Constitution passes laws to punish
 a citizen found there wit
 h property recognized by the
 Constitution of the United States
 but prohibited by the laws
 of that State But how
 long might it be before
 that same mil itai y
 force would be turned against
 the minority section which had
 sought its protection and that
 minority thus become mere subjugated
 provinces under the great military
 government that it had thus
 contributed to establish The minority
 in capable of is of
 necessity always on the deftnsivc
 and often the victim of
 the deser tion of its
 followers and the faithlessness of
 its allies It therefore must
 maintäin not destroy barriers I
 do not know that I
 fufly appreciate the purpose of
 my friend from Missouri whether
 when he spoke of establishing
 military posts along the borders
 of the States and anning
 the Federal Government with adequate
 physical power to enforce constitutional
 rights l suppose hc meant
 obligations hc meant to confer
 upon this Federal Government a
 powm which it does not
 now possess to coerce u
 State If hc did then
 in the language of Mr
 Madison hc is pro viding
 not fora union of States
 but for the dc struction
 of States he is providing
 under the name of union
 to carry on wnr against
 States and I care not
 whether it be against Massachu
 setts or Missouri it is
 equally objectionable to me and
 I will resist it alike
 in the one case as
 in the other as subversivc
 of the great principle on
 which our Government rests as
 a heresy to be confronted
 at its first p esentation
 and put down there lest
 it grow into proportions which
 will rendm us powerless bcfore
 it The theory Of our
 Constitution Mr President is one
 of peace of equality of
 sovereign States It was made
 by States and madc for
 States and in the abundance
 of caution they passed an
 amend ment doing thal which
 was necessarily implied by the
 nature of the instrument as
 it y as a mere
 instrument of grants But in
 the abundance ot caution they
 deckarcd that everything which had
 not been was reserved to
 States to the people that
 is to the State governments
 as instituted by the people
 of cach State or to
 the people in their sovereign
 capacity I need not then
 go on to from the
 his tory and n ature
 of our Govern Inent that
 no of coercion exists in
 It It is enough for
 me to demand the clause
 of the Constitution which con
 fers the power If it
 is not there the Govern
 ment does not possess it
 Tl l lat is the
 plain con struction of the
 Constitution madc plainer if possible
 by its amendment This Union
 is dear to me as
 a Union of fra ternal
 States It would lose its
 value if I had to
 regard it as a Union
 hcid together by physical would
 be happy to know that
 every force State now felt
 that fraternity which made this
 Union possible and if that
 evidence cot lld go out
 if evidence satisfactory to the
 people of the South could
 bc given that thqt feeling
 cxisted in the hearts of
 the northern people you might
 burn your statute books and
 we would cling to the
 Ünion still But it is
 because of their conviction that
 hostility and not fraternity now
 exists in the hearts of
 the people that they are
 looking to their reserved rights
 and to their independent powers
 for their own protection If
 t here be anv good
 then which ve can do
 it is by sending evidence
 to them of that svhich
 i fear does not exist
 the purpose of your constituents
 to fulfill in the spirit
 of justice and fraternity all
 their constitutional obligations If you
 can submit to them that
 evi dence I feel confidence
 that with the evidence that
 aggression is henceforth to cease
 will term CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 10 inate all the measures
 for defense Upon you of
 the majority section it depends
 to restore peace and perpetuate
 the Union of equal States
 upon us of the minority
 section rests the duty to
 main tain our equality and
 community rights and the means
 in one case or the
 other must be such as
 each can control Mr FOSTER
 Mr President Mr GREEN Will
 the Senator allow me The
 VICE PRESIDENT Does the Senator
 from Connecticut yield to the
 Senator from Mis souri Mr
 FOSTER 1 have but to
 say Mr GREEN Then 1
 shall not interposc now Mr
 FOSTER I was singularly unfortunate
 Mr President in being so
 misunderstood by the Senator from
 Illinois and the Senator from
 Mis sissippi I surely have
 made no party appeal and
 have made no charge against
 any party as reSponsiblc at
 all for the evils now
 existing in our country I
 can scarcely imagine that those
 gen tlemen did me the
 honor to listen to me
 for if they did they
 surely could not have fallen
 into such a mistake I
 think I can appeal with
 great satiety to any gentleman
 who did me that honor
 to bear me witness that
 I made no such charge
 no such imputation no such
 appeal i did it is
 true say that our Federal
 Government was in the hands
 of the Democratic party Is
 it not true I didnotmakc
 the assertion in any offensive
 sense i did not couple
 it with any intimation that
 that party was at all
 responsible for the evils under
 which we are now laborino
 Having alluded to that fact
 I said that a Senator
 connected with that party and
 representing as gallant and as
 patriotic a State as belongs
 to the Confederacy came for
 ward with a resolution looking
 toward the resto ration of
 peace and harmony in the
 country and that in that
 state of things although its
 phrase ology was not entirely
 acceptablc to me and al
 though it would be Inade
 far more acceptable by the
 amendments proposed to it by
 the Senator from New York
 still if the amendments proposed
 proved unacceptable to the Senator
 from Ken tacky would vote
 for his resolution as it
 was vithout an endmentr for
 the reason that under those
 circumstances I considered it my
 duty to aid and I
 believed that thc Statc which
 sent me here would hold
 accountable if I did not
 at tempt at least to
 perform the duty of aiding
 in the restoration of peace
 and harmony to the country
 Sir if that is a
 party appeal or if that
 is making a party charge
 I have misunderstood and now
 greatly misunderstand the English language
 in its plainest and most
 obvious forms and words That
 is all I said which
 can be construed into any
 party appeal or any party
 charge My object was to
 show that I was ready
 to discard all these considerations
 and discard them fully and
 abso I am sorry that
 I was so misunder stood
 Mr GREEN Mr President 1
 am a surprised and not
 only a little but greatly
 sur prised that the Senator
 from Mississippi should deem it
 his duty to make use
 of languace which 1 think
 so very unparliamentary in surr
 ycstions Ilu own out for
 the purpose of super inducing
 reflection as quack nostrums There
 are quacks and they expect
 to accompkish results without means
 Without considering the con I
 slitulion and feeling the pulse
 or exarnining thc I condition
 of the patient and the
 fitness of the adrninistcrcd rued
 icine to the of the
 desired result they hope something
 without loincr They are quacks
 and so in po litical
 science there are quacks who
 secing the i diseased condition
 of the patient will do
 nothing to relieve him But
 he is not a quack
 who as an advising physician
 does not adüiinister medicine but
 havin yconsidered the condition of
 the patient su rcyests a
 proper subject for consideration There
 I is no quackery in
 that and how he should
 feel it build up a
 central military despotism No but
 to maintain constitutional rights according
 to the plan of the
 Constitution as given to us
 by our fathers That is
 all we ask Do you
 ask more Is there a
 Senator from any State in
 this Union that will rise
 in his place and say
 hc wants more than that
 If he does I do
 not go with him But
 it is said it is
 utterly impossible to get this
 because the state of public
 sentiment North is wrong I
 said that too and I
 said that wre must devise
 some means to hold our
 rights until an opportunity a
 fair reaSonable opportunity is grven
 for a reaction of public
 sentiment As I remarked but
 two principles controlled anv Gov
 ernment one consent and the
 other pfiysical power If the
 consent the good feeling is
 gone you must have the
 physical power How much Enough
 to make a central despotism
 Enough to build up a
 military power and overawe the
 States and do what my
 friend from Mississippi condemns No
 To do what then To
 simply enforce the Constitution as
 it now exists and If
 my friend will be a
 little more specific and not
 resort to the use of
 these quackery terms and read
 the fourth section of the
 fburth article of the Con
 stitution he will find it
 says this It is the
 duty of the Federal Government
 to protect the States acainst
 invasion without any application upon
 the part of the Executive
 without any application upon the
 part of the Legislature When
 domes tic violence springs up
 and you want to quell
 that with Federal power Federal
 power cannot be ex opted
 until the Legislature or Executive
 demands it But when invasion
 is about to occur thc
 Fed eral power is adequate
 to it without any request
 I want him to read
 the Constitution once more and
 then his notions of quackery
 I hope will be dissipated
 The United States shall guaranty
 to every State in this
 Union a republican form of
 government and shall pro tect
 each of them against invasiort
 When does the other part
 apply And on application of
 the Legislature or of the
 Execu tivo when the Legislature
 cannot be convened against domestic
 violence The Federal authority therefore
 cannot be exerted to suppress
 domestic violence until the Executive
 or the Legislature demands it
 but to prevent invasion it
 is the duty of the
 Federal power to exert it
 whenever it is nccessary Now
 It it be the duty
 of the Federal power thus
 to protect I only propose
 to tu rn the Government
 with that power contemplated by
 the Constitu tion which might
 be necessary Is that military
 despotism If it is Madison
 and Washington and Pinckney and
 Hamilton established that Government I
 propose to do nothing but
 merely to make an inquiry
 to see whether this thing
 might notaccomplish some beneficiai result
 within the limits of the
 present Constitution of the United
 States and to carry that
 out To call that build
 ing up a militm y
 despotism amounts just to this
 we are going out of
 the Union right or wrong
 and we will misrepresent every
 proposition made to save the
 Union Now Mr President I
 undertake to say that thc
 state of public senti nent
 in the North is wrong
 There may be a sentiment
 in the South that is
 wrong for aught I know
 Within my i State I
 know of no southern sentiment
 that is wrong for know
 of no Inan that demands
 anything except what the present
 Constitution cruaranties and provides I
 aln compelled to re main
 in the Union I will
 not say compelled but it
 is my duty to remain
 in the Union unless in
 the lovelopmcnt of future c
 vents I find that a
 resort to a revolutionarv ri
 Fht find the establish m
 t lt of new order
 of things will bettcr promote
 I the happiness of thc
 people of Missouri As it
 IS nobody talks of it
 there As it is every
 one says therc arc these
 complaints these orievances It is
 the opinion that we have
 not had justice and because
 the Constitution has not been
 carried out When I suggest
 a mode by which one
 to be his duty thus
 to characterize it is to
 rne branch of the Constitution
 can be carried out I
 most extraordinary indeed Hc has
 a right to am to
 bc taunted with the expression
 that it is u il
 condemn it to oppose it
 to vote against it to
 quack remedy show wherein it
 is wrong but to call
 it a quack Sir this
 Constitution is good enough for
 the remedy is such an
 expression as have seldonl I
 Union and as I remarked
 bcfore an amend heard in
 this Senate Chamber So in
 regard to w ment of
 the Constitution unless it indicates
 pub my friend rom California
 so in regard to others
 lic sentitnent is not worth
 a straw and as I
 also i we are making
 svgestions we are hoping that
 said before the passage of
 a new law or the
 re reflection may set in
 and that a proper consid
 peal of these nullifying laws
 of the North are eration
 may devise something to do
 what TO worth nothing except
 so far as they indicate

 Let us have it c
 Do lic sentiment To give
 that sentiment opportu will not
 despair of nify to react
 I wish to arm the
 Federal Govern you say wc

 power contemplated in the it
 Do you sa Lt is
 utterly impossible to have Constituuon
 no more no less not
 to transcend it Have we
 made the necessary efforts to
 get it it one inch
 Whether it shall ever react
 or not There have been
 bitter speeches and complaining If
 it never does react then
 we i remarks and insulting
 remarks all of which have
 we cannot tell shall have
 to go but I want
 to make every effort i

 those honest fair I desire
 if possible to petitions and
 rernonstrances and appeals to the
 that I possibly can first
 let every man refft et
 When the passions are sections
 of this Union that ought
 to be made aroused when

 Why for me to go
 on the stump or in
 this Sen It may be
 that the ate Chamber and

 will not regret and it
 may be that the Union
 or the other section of

 let me appeal to the

 I propose a means that
 the Constitu tion contemplates and
 provides for to secure my
 self he who has suffered
 no wron except an i
 ideal an imaginary wrong says
 the stutc of pub lic
 sentiment of tho North is
 so corrupt and viti ated
 that I dare not stay
 in association with them i
 I know that that sentiment
 is corrupt and thero fore
 as I said before and
 now repeat that senti rnent
 must react or we shall
 have to go with you
 remains if you construe the
 Constitution one way and I
 construc it another let us
 as brethren put in an
 explanatory amendment which will remove
 the whole difficulty that we
 may go on together in
 harmony and peace hereafter A
 rigid enforcement of the fugitive
 slave law a rigid protection
 of the States from invasion
 and an éxplanatory amendment of
 the Constitution de fimng the
 rights on every point where
 there is any dispute will
 give us the same old
 peace we had and we
 will go on with the
 same prosperity as we formerly
 did I do not urge
 this but I throw out
 these sug gestions and hope
 that my friend will do
 me the justice to believe
 that I do not do
 it for the pur But
 I want to give them
 an opportunity to have to
 coerce any State in our
 Union pose of tr that
 reaction Do you say they
 have had twenty five years
 to would co cc no
 State but I would coerce
 indi do it Ehe agitation
 has been fanned and fed
 viduals as longas that State
 remains in the Union If
 you are in tbc Union
 and they saw not the
 impending danger They I I
 deny nullification sat v not
 the precipice that they were
 drivincr us i you arc
 subject to the Union laws
 and I will en If
 you are force the laws
 against individuals to In a
 deadly conflict you may wrestle
 with me and may throw
 mc over but I will
 prove to out of the
 Union you are an independent
 Power and I have no
 right to undertake to enforce
 Fed you that both fail
 to the bottomless pit together
 If the era laws over
 you It is like the
 travelers upon the Andes I
 did not intend even to
 be drawn into the dis
 path be not broad enough
 for both they will come
 Into conflict and one must
 fall and he drags the
 cussion of that nor to
 express an opinion upon it
 but I do it to
 prevent myself from being mis

 say understood I am providing
 this force to protect If
 we can avert this Ict
 us do it I hope
 and trust in God that
 our rights in the Union
 while our States are in

 it we may do it
 Whether am successful or not

 say some am bitious chieftain
 will pervert that power and
 use I will stand upon
 the will make the effort
 I do not belicve it

 and used every effort in

 The corrective of public sentiment
 thc rigors and the guards
 of the law will always
 be able to pre my
 ri Yhts in the Constitution
 and to save the i
 know it is a very
 unpopular theme vent such a
 result Union also Mr President
 I only deem it necessary
 to make in some sections
 of the Union to sav
 a word for the Union
 Let it be so I
 hope that that feel this
 explanation because I think my
 fr_iend from I hope the
 sober second thought I Mississippi
 really misunderstood what I had
 said ing will react will
 again induce them to see

 Mr LATHAM Mr President my
 friend being content with constitutional
 guarantees and from Mississippi in
 his allusion to me cither
 misunderstood me or unintentionally did
 me great wheh means proposed
 to enforce the Consti I
 did not say because I
 did not think injustice tution
 and carry it out do
 not ridicule it by call
 it and if I did
 say it I did not
 intefld so to be ing
 it a quack remedy that
 the State which I had
 the honcn Mr President I
 havc not undertaken as I
 underst ood here in part
 to represent would think it
 any cause before remarked to
 give the details of the
 plan I have within the
 resolution offered embraced whatever for
 separation because of her failure
 to 1 constit t_ltional provisions
 and if the committee obtain
 the great measure to which
 I alluded goes bevond them
 and erects a military despot
 merely said this that it
 would weaken her attach Ism
 h shall go aæainst their
 report but if they ment
 but would not c ertainly
 destroy her alle confine thcnose
 ves strictly within the limits
 df giancc to thc Government
 at any time or in
 any the Constitution find give
 adequate power sense Mr DAVIS
 I am very happy indeed
 to hear to carry it
 out and enforce it I
 shall go for it thc
 explanation of my friend from
 California As to this idea
 that that power will bc
 in the hands of Mr
 Lincoln an Opposition President with
 whorn i låve so often
 coincided and from hitn as
 whom I shall part with
 so much regret upon any
 I do not stop to
 consider it much power to
 enforce the Federal Constitution great
 political principle He wil find
 however e as I would
 åpon examining the report I
 think that I under and
 protect the rights of the
 peopl stood his language f
 arn happy to find I
 did mis anybody else and
 I will hold him just
 as respons ible for manner
 which hc exercises it Do
 understand his meaning and very
 glad to be cor you
 say that that gives him
 power to overawe recled The
 Senator from Missouri has taken
 special I say it does
 not Hc cannot in t
 he States vade a single
 State but hc can pve
 vcnc States offense at the
 use of the word quacker
 or quack remedy quack nostrums
 quires the Federal Government to
 repel invasion I have but
 to of the GoVernment foi
 the meaning of eiause Was
 it to establish a military
 the States W as it
 to raise afrn aments should
 frown terrifieaTlyÉdbivn the people of
 a State No not at
 all sir It wasao repel
 foreign aggression That poWe2 Was
 dele gated when these States
 united for common de fense
 It was to bind their
 one whole so that the
 power of all might be
 used against any common enemy
 that invaded either of them
 not the invasion of one
 State by ah other That
 was a thought which would
 h åve deterred from union
 that is the sad reflection
 which experience alone could have
 suggested to our minds The
 Senator from SMissomi there fore
 uses the phrase of the
 Constitution in a mean ing
 which it cannot have in
 an intent which our fathers
 had not and does to
 them the great injus tice
 of believing that whilst they
 were sweeping away even the
 barriersrto the freest trade between
 the States they were providing
 to build up mili tary
 cordons to keep the people
 apan I am glad that
 before thc Senator closed his
 remarks he answered the on
 y question which 1 asked
 him and that because it
 was the point on which
 I did not understand him
 His answer was so satisfactory
 that if it had not
 been necessary for me to
 make the acknowledgment that I
 would take him out of
 the list of quacks and
 put him on the rolls
 of learned pundits a nd
 political doc r I he
 construc tors I should not
 have replied tion Of the
 Constitution is the question which
 we have to regard and
 when we arc told that
 military power is to be
 given to enforce the Constitution
 knowing that that Constitution has
 as many con structions as
 clauses and seeing the great
 error into ivhich this State
 rights and clear headed Senator
 has fallen this morning wc
 are warned not to confer
 new and extraordinary powers upon
 the Federal Government to be
 exercised as that Government may
 construe the Constitution The States
 in their sovereignty the Stat
 es in their in dependence
 the States havc full power
 over all local affairs and
 this Federal Government is the
 agent to conduct their foreign
 intercourse and I htlt is
 the provide for the common
 deftnse Government our fathers made
 gnd that alone is the
 Government to which I am
 willing to bear al egiance
 Mr GREEN I wish to
 remark that thank the Senattn
 fop the compliment Gf taking
 me out of tho list
 of quacks and making me
 a political I an sorry
 I cannot return it doctor
 Mr CRITTENDEN Mr President what
 is tbe question before the
 Senate The VICE PRESIDENT The
 proposition offered by the Senator
 from Kentucky i he Sec
 retary will read it Mr
 CRITTENDEN He proposed an ment
 Was that amendment made as
 a matter of right by
 themmover The VICE PRESIDENT It
 had better be read for
 the information of the Senatc
 The orie 2111al resolution and
 the amendments of the Sena
 Eor from New York were
 withdrawn and the Senator from
 Kentucky proposed a general reso
 lution Mr CRITTENDEN The Senator
 from tacky modified his original
 resolution Mr POWELL 1 propose
 that all of ori resoluti01
 1 after the word members
 be stricken out and what
 is now in the hands
 of the i Secretary I
 suppose is to be added
 VICE PRESIDENT The Secretary will
 read as hc has it
 the last proposition of thc
 Sen ator The Secretary read
 it as follows And that
 said comrnittce be instructed to
 inquire into from being invaded
 He cannot take one particle
 the present condition of the
 country and report by bill
 or of property but he
 can protect your property puts
 the three phrases in my
 mouth although I otherwise It
 is one of those i
 do not remember used cither
 of them but from being
 taken by others preventive means
 but why do I stop
 here to let t hat
 go I will not quurrcl
 with him about l it
 and if he is satisfied
 will agree that hc is
 explain it I a learned
 pundit that he is thc
 hiehcst authority As before remarked
 I am not urging it
 on parliamentary etiquette that he
 is the hicrhest only throw
 it out at as one
 of those suggestions but I
 must protest as one of
 those thoughts that might be
 taken into authority on political
 merit cvrainst his mode of
 quoting what anybody has consideration
 by your committee for the
 purpose said to whom he
 replies and I cannot consent
 if possible of givin r
 us that protection which we
 t to his coilstruction of
 the Constitution When cannot get
 with the present state of
 public senti ment so that
 in the mean time there
 might be a hc selects
 a clause from the Constitution
 which reaction in that sentiment
 and the good old Union
 he reads with peculiar emphasis
 and invites me that clause
 in the Constitution which remain
 such as it was when
 my praised it to study
 so highly and lauded it
 to the skies as bringing
 so agthot izes the Federal
 Government or rather re II
 Mr CRITTENDEN That requires no
 ques tion if understand it
 It is a modificationwhicll the
 mover can make II The
 VICE PRESIDENT Both the other
 olution and the tunendments werewithdrawnj
 and this is now the
 resolution before the Senate sim
 ply Mr CRITTENDEN Then l
 hope we shall i have
 the question on it Mr
 WADE Let us in full
 i The Secretary read it
 as follows i Resolved That
 so much Of tbe President
 s message as 32 THE
 CONGRESSION L GLOBE December 10
 relates to the present agitated
 and distracted eondition of ibe
 grievances between the slaveholdinrv and
 the ion Slaveholding States be
 referred to a special ccjmmittee
 of tliirtec n members and
 that said cornmittee be instructed
 to inquire into the present
 condition of the country and
 report by bill or otherwise
 Mr CRITTENDEN have not a
 word to say upon the
 proposed resolution It is nothing
 more than the ordinary fbrm
 of the motion for a
 reference of the President s
 message It presents no snbject
 of debate I hope we
 shall have the question It
 is very important to us
 I think sir to avoid
 premature debates upon this subject
 however interesting they may be
 We are always in danger
 of collisions produced or excitements
 ceeated I wisl to see
 the Senate as 1 wish
 to sec one and all
 of us observe a perfect
 calmness and coolness of judgment
 to act upon the specific
 measures that we shall so
 soon ha ve presented to
 us for our action hope
 that without further debate we
 shall take the question I
 surrender my right to debate
 it Mr SUMNER Mr President
 1 sire now to make
 a speech nor to take
 any part in the discussion
 that has been commenced I
 can bear yet a little
 longer the misrepresentations in the
 President s message and I
 believe the North can bear
 them yet a little longer
 The timewill come perhaps when
 I shall deem it my
 duty to sct forth those
 things in the light of
 rea son and of history
 Meanwhile I content my self
 witlb simply offering to the
 Senate a piece of teStimony
 of direct and most authoritative
 bear ing upon the present
 state of the Union may
 kid opt the language of
 the Senator from Mis sissuppi
 Mr I xvls it wiil
 help us to make the
 diagnosis of the present disease
 in the body pol hold
 in my hand an unpublished
 autograph letter written by General
 Jackson whilc Presi dent of
 the United States and addressed
 to a cler gyman in
 a State Omitting certain sentences
 which are of a purely
 private nature the leuer is
 as follows pies that a
 slaveholding comm ity has given
 to with regard to the
 manner in which this subject
 is to be treated I
 desire to say for myself
 and our common country Mr
 BENJAMIN I do no rise
 to discuss this for that
 portion of my constituents whom
 rep matter at all My
 own State is about to
 discuss resent and I desire
 to say it decidedly and
 dis it for herself and
 I do not feel at
 liberty to speak tinctly that
 shall not treat the subject
 in apar for her She
 will speak very soon in
 person But tisan manner nor
 shall 1 treat it in
 a menacing I think it
 is a matter of some
 interest to the coun If
 there are those here who
 desire at manner try that
 gentlemen who are here assembled
 as the this time to
 use menaces if there are
 those who accredited representatives of
 the public sentiment desire to
 threaten war in any event
 I wish to say of
 their different States should understand
 so far as communion bctween
 them will enable us to
 understand what the views of
 the people of the different
 States are and for this
 purpose I desire to addiess
 a question to the honorable
 Senator from New York who
 offered an amendment this morning
 and I would also desiro
 to address the same question
 to the Senator from Connecticut
 who has spoken I was
 notable to catch the exact
 intent of the amendment offered
 by the honorable Senator from
 New York and which I
 under stood met the approbation
 of the Senator from Connecticut
 I rise therefore for the
 purpose of inquirincr with a
 view to this comparison of
 opin ion whether the intent
 of that amendment was to
 indicate the opinion either on
 the part of the gen
 tleman who offin ed it
 or on the part of
 the party of which he
 is a distinguished member of
 a duty or purpose of
 the employment of physical armed
 force by the Federal Government
 against the State which might
 think proper to withdraw from
 the UD ion and declareits
 independence that Ofco urse being

 the only good Government on

 and happiness we enjoy over
 every other portion of the

 ought to be the fate
 ot all such ambitious inen
 who would involve their country
 in civil war and ali
 the evils in its train
 that they might reign and

 underscores the word now known
 wag a mere pretext its
 burden was on your coarse
 woolens By the law of
 July 1832 coarse woolen was
 reduced to five pcr cent
 tör the benefit of the
 South Mr Clay s bill
 takes it up and cla

 per cent reduces it gradually
 down to twenty per cent

 all the nullifiers agree to
 the principle llhe cash duties
 and home valuation wiil be
 equal to fifteen per cent
 nore and after the year
 1842 you pay on coarse

 I cannot understand therefore the

 ANDREW JACKSON The Rev ANDREW
 J CRAWFORD I here is
 the original autograph letter in
 the un mistakable well k
 nown bold broad handwriting Here
 Mr SUMNER held the letter
 up These are the words
 of a patriot slaveholder of
 Ten nessee addressed to a
 patriot clergyman of a slaveholding
 State and they are directly
 applica ble to the present
 hour Of practical sense of
 inflexible purpose and of various
 experience Andrew Jackson saw intuitively
 the springs and motives of
 human conduct while he loved
 his country with a firm
 and all embracing attach ment
 Thus inspired he was able
 to judge the present and
 to discern the future The
 tariff in his opinion wasa
 pretext only disunion and a
 south ern confederacy the real
 object The next pre text
 says he and you sn
 will mark the words will
 be the negro or slavery
 question These sir are his
 words not mine _ This
 is his emphatic judgment These
 words and this judg ment
 now belong to history nor
 can they be as sailed
 without assailing onc of the
 greatest exam of the Federal
 laws now existiDff Mr KING
 Mr President as he question
 seems to be asked in
 fairness I have no objection
 to express my opinion and
 what I believe to be
 the opinion of the gl
 eat body almost the entire
 body of the people of
 New York Their senti ment
 upon this subject is that
 the Union of these States
 must and shall be preserved
 We hope that the civil
 powers of the Constitution and
 the good sense and patriotism
 of thc people of the
 whole country arc sufficient for
 that purpose but we hold
 too that resistance to the
 law and constitutional power of
 the Federal Government is as
 xnuch an object demanding its
 attention and that it is
 as much its duty to
 overcomc and sup press any
 such resistance as it is
 to protect a hum ble
 individual w I ll may
 be assaulted by another Secession
 which is talked about here
 is but an other name
 for insurrection and rebellion lieve
 that this Government cannot be
 dissolved because I believe the
 great body of its people
 are attached to it and
 that they will defend and
 pre serve it If the
 gentlernan talks about a Seate
 seceding I take it that
 those who violate and re
 sist the law will meet
 thc penalty which the law
 inflicts Mr BENJAMIN I had
 hoped to receive an answer
 from the honorable Sen ator
 from Con necticut whom I
 understood to approve of the
 amendment of the Senator from
 New York was really desirous
 to ascertain whetl erhis views
 also werc that in thc
 evcntofa declaration of in dependence
 by a State it was
 proper or it was intended
 to wage war against that
 State for the purpose of
 reducing it to obedience from
 its rebel Mr FOSTER Mr
 President 1 no 0b jection
 at all to give any
 views that I may have
 upon this suuject to t
 he hoioraBle Senator from Louisiana
 but i must say that
 I see nothino in the
 amendment proposed by the honorable
 gen ator from New York
 to the resolution as intro
 duced by the honorable Senator
 from Kentucky that involves any
 such question as that pro
 pounded to me by the
 honorable Senator from Louisiana I
 have not however any difficulty
 in answering the question at
 any proper time although 1
 do not suppose that my
 answer would give very much
 light to the Senator from
 Louisi ana or strengthen him
 in any opinion he may
 have upon thé subject one
 way or the other Mr
 DIXON 1 certainly did not
 understand my colleague to refer
 to the fact that the
 Demo cratic party noware and
 long have been in power
 in this Government in any
 partisan or offensive sense but
 only as a fact in
 history but whatever may be
 our differences of opinion as
 to the causes of the
 present troubles the great truth
 is apparent and we cannot
 either as partisans or as
 patriots shnt our eyes to
 the great truth that nothing
 less than the total disruption
 ofthis Government is the peril
 to which weare now exposed
 And now sir decidedly for
 myself and for that portion
 of my constituents whom I
 represent in opinion that I
 am not with them But
 I do not understand that
 to be the policy upon
 this side of the Chamber
 In such an event it
 is useless to inquire which
 section of the country would
 suffer most oc suf fer
 longest Enough for us to
 know that every portion would
 long and suffer deeply Enough
 for us to know that
 a dissolution of this Union
 for whatever cause and however
 brought about would be not
 only the great event but
 in its effects on the
 race of mankind the great
 calamity of the age Mr
 President the public mind is
 aroused to the perception of
 the fact of the existing
 danger to our at the
 precise moment when we have
 just passed through a presidential
 elec tion I ence it
 may bc supposed that the
 result of this election is
 the cause whereas it is
 only an occasion The cause
 lies far deeper In a
 very short time a crisis
 differing only from the pres
 ent in the occasion of
 its happening would have occurred
 if either of the candidates
 for the Pres idency had
 succeeded at the recent election
 The controversy on the subject
 of African slavery which has
 been going on for several
 years between the northern and
 southern portions of this country
 has now reached a point
 where its final und rightful
 adjustment conser ted to by
 the people of both sections
 seems to be indis pensable
 to the continuance of our
 Government In its present form
 The election of Mr Lincoln
 hastened the critical day His
 defeat could only have postponed
 it In saying that the
 controversy respecting sla very is
 the cause of our present
 diffculties I do not intend
 to say whether one section
 of the country is in
 fault more than another whether
 both are equally in fault
 or whether the blame is
 wholly on one side Crimination
 and recrim ination are now
 useless nay dangerous be possible
 tbc first thing should be
 to restore the fraternal spirit
 which once existed ought to
 exist and may still exist
 How shall this be done
 I know of no other
 mode than by cl ieerfully
 and honestly assuring to every
 section of the country its
 constitutional rights No section professes
 to ask more no section
 ought to offer less As
 to what are these constitutional
 rights that is a question
 to be con sidered in
 a spirit of confidence and
 mutual good will and furthermore
 in a spirit of devotion
 to the Union for the
 preservation of which my eon
 stituents are ready to make
 any sacrifice which a reasonable
 man can ask or an
 hollorable man ean grant consistently
 with principle In this spimit
 är 1 shall meet this
 great question and in doingso
 I believe I shall be
 sustained by an ma jority
 of my constituents If time
 shall show that I am
 wrong in this belief I
 shall instantly cease to represent
 them in this Senate Sir
 it this spirit could prevail
 in our councils how different
 would almost instantly be the
 con dition of the country
 Whether it shall prevail or
 not depends wholly on that
 great power which underlies all
 laws and all constitutions in
 this country and by which
 alone they can be sup
 ported the thinking intelligent public
 mindi of the nation The
 people under God must save
 this Union if it is
 to be saved Politicians can
 not do it The people
 are now learning what they
 have never brought themselves to
 believe that the Union is
 in danger and they and
 they alone must apply the
 remedy What I may be
 witling to do or what
 the Senate may bc willing
 to do will avail nothing
 unless supported by the intel
 I ligence and conscience of
 the people If the evils
 of disunion and civil war
 could bc delayed until thc
 action of the people could
 be had should have entire
 confidence that the result would
 be the perpetuation of our
 Government inits present form and
 that these confederated States would
 continue 10 be bound torether
 in eternal Union by the
 golden chains of mutual advaNage
 But the danger is that
 anger and precipitation on the

 one side and blind incredulity
 on the other may involve
 in ruin the happiest people
 and the best Government on
 the globe and that history
 will record the fact that
 the people of the United
 States were incapable of selfügovernment
 One word more There is
 a class of men small
 in numbers and in influence
 who assume that the present
 controversy is a conflict as
 they say of two civilizations
 that it cannot be reconciled
 that freedom o r slavery
 must now perish The great
 body of those whom I
 represent do not thus believe
 We believe that there is
 no conflict of systems of
 labor in the different States
 which is incompatible with the
 peaceful existence of our Unipn
 We believe that the slaveholding
 and non slaveholding States may
 still revolve in har monious
 spheres and that if the
 question of slavery shall destroy
 our Union it will not
 be because it could not
 be satisfactorily and ri ll
 t fully adjusted but because
 the statesmen of the day
 are incompetcnt to the task
 Mr BROWN Mr President cannot
 vote for the resolution introduced
 by the Senator fron n
 Kentucky and I desire in
 a single word without making
 a speech to state the
 reason Things have reached a
 crisis The crisis can only
 be met in one way
 effectually in my judgment and
 that is for the northern
 people to review and reverse
 their whole policy upon the
 subject of slavery I see
 no evidence anywhere of any
 such purpose On the contrary
 the evidences accumulate all around
 day by day that there
 is no such pur In
 their newspapers in the action
 of so pose many of
 theii Legislatures as have assembled
 in the speeches of their
 Senators with but one or
 two rare exceptions we have
 accumulated evi dence that there
 is no purpose on the
 part of the northern people
 to reverse their action or
 their judgment upon this question
 The southern States do not
 expect that they are going
 to do it and having
 despaired of that reversal of
 judgment and that change of
 conduct they are procccding ill
 the only mode left them
 to vindicate their rights I
 cannot vote fot the resolution
 and their honor of my
 friend from Kentucky because it
 wolPld be an intimation darklv
 given it is trnc bu
 t yet an intimation to
 my Sate which is moving
 that there is a hope
 of reconciliation I do not
 believe I see no evidence
 upon there is any such
 hope I sec through this
 dark which to base a
 hope cloud that surrounds us
 no ray of light To
 mc it is all darkness
 midnight gloom I therefore standing
 here as onc of the
 Senators from my WEDNESDAY DECEMBER
 12 1860 of New York
 understand the public sentiment of
 that great State the members
 of the electoral college are
 the men They understand it
 better perhaps that the two
 Senators and thirty three Representatives
 They rebuked that journal for
 holding out the olive branch
 for an instant Are these
 evidences that there is any
 disposition on the part of
 the Republicans to abandon any
 part of their programme No
 sir what was said only
 yesterday as reported 96 me
 by a Re publican member
 of the House is true
 We never moan to ground
 our arms until we have
 emancipated the last slave in
 merica That is their purpose
 disguise it a they may
 and we never mean to
 sink down that position Bet
 ter ten thousand times tter
 that we separate in peace
 but if that c not
 be done then we o
 be under your dom must
 separate in war ination we
 cannot and will not Calmly
 delib erately dispassionately thc southern
 people have made up their
 minds to that I make
 Gentlemen talk about making appeals
 no appeals because I will
 not appeal where know my
 appeal is to be rejected
 I will not make appeals
 that my own friends will
 read as a hope that
 this difficulty may be reconciled
 prefer to present to them
 the plain stubborn facts as
 they are to tell them
 that Republic anism has shown
 no disposition to rccedc and
 we stand face to face
 and all that is left
 to us is either a
 peaceable or a violent separation
 I deem it hardly necessary
 Mr President to say a
 word on the resolution introduced
 by my friend from Missouri
 It is sufficient perhaps for
 me to say that the
 resolution coming from that quarter
 amazed mc That a southern
 Sen atop representinff a State
 even as much exposed I
 as Missouri should deliberately in
 times like these propose to
 arm the Federal Government for
 the purpose of protectinx the
 frontier to es tablish military
 posts all alöng thc line
 struck mc with astonishment Why
 sir if thev are only
 to protect the linc the
 whole army of Rus If
 they are to make sin
 would be insufficient incursions into
 the States North and South
 and capture those who are
 supposed by military judg ment
 to havc offended against the
 laws how far are they
 to eo and what are
 they to do when they
 get there I see in
 that proposition the germ of
 a military despotism established in
 advance of the period when
 we can sufficiently have vin
 I want no mil dicated
 our honor and position itary
 force on the frontier or
 anywhero else to State to
 report faithfully what is croin
 y on will compci American
 citizens American States to I
 vvill not say to them
 hold out no false hope
 even by implication that I
 believe that which upon my
 soul I do not believe
 If the same spirit could
 prevail which actuates the Senator
 who has just now taken
 his seat Mr l 1xoN
 a different state of things
 might be pro duced in
 the next twenty days but
 wc know that is not
 thc spirit of Republican Senators
 it is not the spirit
 of Republican Representatives it is
 not the spirit of the
 dominant party They have forced
 the matter to the present
 crisis and they mean t
 o stand by their arnos
 We have regis tered our
 oaths in high Heaven that
 we wili not submit Submission
 to us is the deepest
 dis honor that ever fell
 upon a free people I
 will not do their duty
 If the States will not
 make their own citizens obedient
 to the laws of the
 country there is no power
 left to make them obedicnt
 belongs to cach State for
 itself to compel obe dience
 to tl ie laws on
 the part of its citizens
 and to the Federal Government
 by military force I do
 not know what is to
 become of these artilies or
 w llat is to be
 done with these military posts
 I fancy that in the
 hands of tho enemy they
 might be turned against us
 tiney would hardly I sir
 for one ever be turned
 against the North believe as
 my colleaoue believes that this
 Union was fbunded in affection
 and can only be main
 that if the same spirit
 in tained in affection which
 it was founded could be
 made to prevail while things
 are progressing as they now
 are in it would go
 on prospering and to prosper
 as it my State intimate
 to the people there that
 I have did during the
 first half century of its
 existence any hope of a
 different course On the Contrary
 to day speaking in this
 presence under all the solemnities
 of this occasion with all
 the responsi bilitics which surround
 me I say to them
 there is no hope that
 this matter is to be
 remedied We have heard what
 the Senator from New York
 has said we have heard
 what the Senator from New
 Hampshire has said we hear
 in pri vate discourse what
 others say We read your
 newspapers We have noted the
 fact that the great leading
 journal of New York next
 to the Tribune I speak
 of the Albany Evening Journal
 proposed something which looked to
 a recon ciliation and the
 electoral college of that great
 State assembled dah or two
 after and rebuked If any
 thirty five men in the
 State them for it 3
 but it sectional hate has
 sprung r up you cannot
 extinguish it by acts of
 Congress or by resolu lions
 You might as well undertake
 to extracta cancer with a
 mustard pla stel as to
 root up this political disease
 by means like these If
 it be true that the
 northern people have been taught
 in the schools and in
 the churches follow ing the
 advice delivercd to them by
 the Senator NEW SERIES NO
 3 people with all the
 bitterness with which yöu hæv
 e taught them to hate
 us is it not nonsense
 to brmg forward resolutions like
 these with thé hope remedying
 the evil It has taken
 you gwehty five years to
 teach youi peoplé thus intently
 to hate us If I
 could believe that you would
 goto work in earnest and
 unteach them in twénty fiVe
 years to come I would
 wait for it but I
 see no evidence of this
 Your teaching is going On
 it is going on now
 in your newspaperS in your
 churches and _in your schools
 and even your gray headed
 Senators go home and inculcate
 it We have been driven
 to a position where it
 is absolutely necessary for us
 to take care of our
 selves will hold up no
 false lights to the State
 which 1 represent r will
 tell them thépläin and stubborn
 truth and let them acts
 as I think they ought
 to act for themselves I
 hope they will act like
 men and freemen and whatevei
 the r action may bc
 I shall stand by them
 for goodOr ff Senators on
 _the other side have prop
 for evil ositions to submit
 which look to reconciliation I
 will consider them but they
 must be proposi tions which
 in my judgment strike at
 the root of this evil
 not mere propositions for delay
 such as that introduced by
 my friend from Kentucky I
 can understand why a lawyer
 in court who has been
 driven to the wall may
 filé an uflidavit for delay
 or put in a plea
 for delay but I cannotr
 understand why a southern Senator
 in the present condition of
 affairs puts in a plea
 or an affdavit or makes
 any application for delay We
 are bet ter prepared to
 defend ourselves now than we
 Shakl be next year The
 people are ripe for it
 Let them go on Hold
 out no delusive hopes Lct
 them rnect thc issue as
 it is and undertake to
 give my judgmcnt that they
 will mcet it suc cessfully
 Mr PUGH Mr President 1
 did not intend to utter
 one word in regard to
 this resolution ox cept to
 vdtc for it but I
 cannot permit the speech of
 the Senator from Mississippi I
 Mr BROOWN to pass wit
 hout some particular observation Grant
 mg the premises of his
 argument which Ido not entirely
 grant he has failed to
 justify the conclu Sion announced
 After more than seventy years
 of liberty and happiness and
 prosperity as a con federation
 of States must we now
 acknowledge that our constituents some
 thirty million in all with
 every advantage that men could
 desire for self government are
 unable to decide their differ
 ences in a satisfactory manner
 Why sir what hope is
 left for mankind anywhere Wil
 you pretend that the southern
 people are capable of frec
 govern men thereafter if they
 cannot now com mune with
 their northern brethren upon fair
 and honorable terms of adjustment
 Or shall we o our
 side indulge a pretension equally
 vain We stultify ourselves all
 of us in saying that
 we can not hear cannot
 discuss apd cannot compromise the
 controversy with which we are
 threatened That is to say
 in so many words that
 our ex periment of the
 Union is a failure and
 more than that your southern
 confederacy will be a failure
 and all other confederacies to
 the end of time Mr
 President I have not attained
 any such con clusion am
 not of opinion as yet
 that a ma iority or
 any considerable number of the
 people South or North desire
 the bonds of this Confed
 eracy to be torn asunder
 There has been crim ination
 upon both sides there have
 been outrages on both sides
 there have been thingswhich ought
 to be redressed somc by
 the arm of the law
 some by a more faithful
 administration of our Federal and
 State Governments but there has
 been noth ing which cannot
 be redressed promptly fairly I
 believe and in the most
 efficacious manner before God and
 my country that ninetv nine
 hundredths of tho people in
 every State North I from
 New York Mr SEWARD more
 than twelve and South aro
 anxious this day to redress
 all slavery must be and
 all causes of reasonable years
 ao o when he tom
 them W h v then
 do we hear such defianceg
 and that abolished and you
 and I mast do it
 I heard them on the
 mode to do it was
 to begin in the schoolaand
 i chatved in the churches
 if this kind of teaching
 has so when I came
 hither and rov_ seized on
 the minds of the nonhecn
 people that I heard the
 Georgia the rising generation and
 even the young and I
 declare that of the North
 hatedÆhe activegeneration have learned to
 hate the southern people of
 South find the people of
 the South 34 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 10 believe the
 Sen reciprocated that sentiment atöi
 has pronounced a calumny on
 his constit uents as well
 as on mine I do
 not mean to speak disrespectfully
 of hina L speak of
 his accusation and not of
 himself I understood the Senator
 from New Hampshire Mr HALE
 to proclaim like manner not
 the gospel of peace between
 brethren but a circumspect waiting
 to ascertain whether Mr Buchanan
 would or Woukl not send
 a Federal Army tö coerce
 the State of South Car
 olihaæ tfUst sir if Mi
 Buchanan should com mit so
 high handed and fatal an
 act of violence as that
 his terny is not too
 brief as President of the
 United StateS for him to
 be arraigned at our bar
 by an impeachment would South
 Carolina be worth tot herself
 or to us if she
 were frägged captive in chains
 I wish no State of
 this Ünion to be subjugated
 by her Sisters If she
 cannot be retained by the
 bonds of affection OT if
 estranged cannot bc brought back
 to us by the arts
 of kindness why then in
 God s name horrible as
 I esteem such an alternative
 let her depart in sorrowful
 silence agree sir with much
 that Whs said by the
 other Senator from Mississippi Mr
 DAVIs this morning I believe
 it is no question of
 personal liberty bills no question
 of Pacific railroad pro jects
 no question whether the fugitive
 slave act shall or shall
 not bc enforced by arms
 not even a question what
 our territorial policy ought to
 be The diffculty is that
 we of the North do
 not un derstand the southern
 peoplQ and they do not
 rightly understand us I fear
 that no remedy is within
 the reach of Congress and
 therefore I deprecate any discussion
 of particular questions 1 hope
 the committee now to be
 appointed in virtue of this
 resolution will look beyond and
 abovc all present controversies and
 if it can do nothing
 else as I think it
 cannot will advise us to
 declare to our constituents in
 some solemn ibrm that no
 methods of legislation no method
 of constitutional amendment to be
 inaugurated here can bc of
 the slightest efficacy or use
 We n ust tell the
 people in every State to
 follow the example of their
 fathers to choose delegates for
 conventions of all the States
 separately and after wards for
 a convention of the States
 together The ento c field
 of controversy should be reviewed
 and patiently considered in order
 if possible to lay more
 deeply more broadly and I
 trust more wisely the foUndations
 of our comrnon liberty and
 security and happiness It is
 easy for Senators from New
 Hampshire and Massach usetts upon
 the one side and Senators
 from Georgia and Mississippi upon
 the other to debate Union
 or disunion ns a logical
 controversy but to you the
 Vice President in the chair
 and to me to our
 wives and children to our
 im mediate neighbors it is
 a question of life and
 death I hope there is
 no Senator who will not
 under such circumstances bear patiently
 with us hope the S
 enator fromMississippi Mr P Rowx
 will reconsider his determination I
 do not be lieve that
 his noble constituency would think
 worsc of him because in
 response to an appeal of
 arnity und friendship he planted
 himself In the very door
 of reconciliation and kept it
 open as long as any
 one would speak a single
 kind word Mr BROWN The
 Senator wilk allow me a
 I never intimated that wc
 would not moment listen to
 appeals 1 never said that
 this case could not be
 adjusted but I said there
 was no disposi Tion On
 tbc Republican side to do
 it My friend from Ohio
 and I have not the
 power to do it He
 is not speakirp for the
 Republicans They are the power
 in Govcrnmcnt and so far
 as we have had any
 intimations from theni they have
 no propositions to make and
 none to accept My friend
 from Ohio and I might
 talk to the end of
 the next century and agree
 or disagree as much as
 wc pleased Mr BENJAMIN You
 and he could agree in
 five minutes Mr BROWN He
 and 1 would have no
 diffl If the Republicans will
 trust their culty at all
 cause to him laughter and
 the Democrats to me II
 begging them for God s
 sake to stave this thing
 frankly that unless they approacli
 this contro versy in a
 spirit of honorable conciliation they
 off untll the 4th of
 March so that he may
 get have won tbcir last
 victory in the non slavehold
 out of tho way of
 the shower before it comes

 theStates northwest Laughter That is
 the position which I believe
 of the Ohio river They
 did not win the presi
 Mr Buchanan occupies to day
 dential contest on any such
 propositions as some Now sir
 I want 1 0 say
 a word farther Some ot
 them have announced on this
 floor and they gentlemen have
 undertaken to magnify the posi
 tion which so humble an
 individual as myself know it
 At all events my honorable
 friend from Mis occupies here
 and have said to me
 verbally and sissippi ought neither
 to be deaf nor blind
 on this I in writing
 from some of the adjoining
 States that occasion and for
 him as well as for
 myself I I something much
 depended upon thecourse that I
 and some others not quite
 so humble as myself desirc
 to express earnest gratitude to
 thc honor take in this
 matter But sir I have
 almost de able Senator from
 Connecticut Mr DIXON for the
 generous manly and noble speech
 just deliv spaired of doing
 anythinz because when I get
 ered It was exactlyüe right
 speech made at up and
 say I am for peace
 and fear war they the
 right time and I must
 say came from the swear
 that I threaten war and
 that i do not want
 accept it as an omen
 of purer and f peace
 Laughter That is just the
 way the right quarter public
 press misrepresents and I have
 nothing to of better counsels
 For myself I will not
 quar rel with any gentleman
 in regard to his particular
 say remedy or proposition I
 am ready to examine all
 of them and give them
 all a respectful delib eration
 l hcre is nothing absolutely
 nothing I which an honorable
 man would ask of me
 or of my constituents that
 be cannot receive and es
 pecially sir if he should
 QSk it in words of
 kind ness Let us have
 done with mere altercations Is
 it not au utter disgracc
 that thc first mcn of
 thc Republic should come hither
 at the seat of Fed
 deral Government representing the sovereignty
 of their proud States at
 home yvhen the fabric of
 our common liberty is tottering
 to destruction and instead of
 stretching forth their arms to
 stay such ruin should fold
 them inanely helplessly and hopclcssly
 as did the Roman Senators
 at a time of barbaric
 invasion Mr HALE Mr President
 I rise to correct a
 misapprehension of the Senator from
 Ohio in a staternent which
 Ire has made of some
 remarks that I madc here
 a few days ago I
 do not know that I
 over spoke in my life
 when was so per sistently
 and so obstinately misrepresented I
 do not refer now to
 the Senator frorn Ohio be
 cause I do not think
 a Senator here would do
 it butl speak ofa few
 craven cowardly infamous wretches that
 in the providence of God
 havc föund themselves editors of
 some of our northern papers
 and secm to think it
 is incumberot on them to
 utter an apology about once
 a week that God ever
 sent such tniscrable wretches into
 the world It is from
 their hands that this persistent
 misre presentation comes understood the
 honorable Senator from Ohio to
 say that had declared that
 I wanted to wait to
 see if Mr Buchanan would
 not send a Federal army
 down to coerce South Carolina
 Ml PUGH 1 say to
 the Senator frankly that I
 did so understand his remarks
 not that he used those
 words but that was the
 amount of what he said
 as I thought I shall
 be very happy if the
 Senator did not mean that
 Mr HALE Well sir if
 so intelligent aman as the
 Senator from Ohio misunderstood me
 in that respect I ought
 to abate a little of
 those ad jectives that I
 have heapcd on those editorial
 wretches Laughter Mr PUGH thin
 you had better leave the
 adjectives out Mr HALE I
 have read that speech over
 and over acrain I have
 received various letters in relation
 to it and I said
 in it just exactly what
 the Senator from Mississippi Mr
 DAVIs said I to day
 nothing more nothing loss and
 1 repeat it wre ought
 to look this matlcr fairly
 in thc face I said
 further that in nay humble
 judgmcnt the course of events
 would lead to war and
 when the Senator from Mississippi
 Mr BR0WN asked mc if
 meant to threaten war I
 repeated over and over fpain
 that I meant no such
 thirp but believed that the
 course of events was tending
 in that direction I said
 it and believed it and
 I bclievc it now deprecate
 it as much as any
 mah on this floor can
 I would make as much
 honorable concession as any man
 can but I should scorn
 myself and the gallant people
 that sent me here would
 scorn me if I could
 stand up on this floor
 to menace war I will
 go further we will settle
 the question before the sun
 goes I will say to
 the Senator from Ohio that
 I not down without the
 least trouble in the world
 only never said bat I
 never had such a thought
 There was one thing which
 the honorable Sen ator from
 Mississippi Mr Davis said while
 he was up that I
 did not exactly catch and
 nothing but my reluctance to
 break in upon a gentleman
 while he is speaking prevented
 me from asking him at
 that time if I understood
 him correctly He said that
 be appealed to this side
 to this party x vho
 had committed the act which
 had driven us to this
 position As I did not
 get the floor of the
 Senate I went over and
 asked the Senator from Mississippi
 privately if I understood him
 because although the Senator from
 Georgia the other day y
 represented that there is a
 state of armed neutrality here
 that nobody here ever goes
 to the other side and
 that nobody there ever comes
 here I will say that
 whcncveu I have had occasion
 to go over on that
 side even though it were
 to address the Senator from
 Georgia himself I have always
 met kind courteous and gentlemanly
 treatment Mr IVERSON It is
 all on the surface only
 skin deep Mr HALE well
 then sir 1 have done
 you morc credit than you
 deserve Laughter Thus encouraged I
 went over and asked the
 Senator from Mississippi candidly and
 it seems l mis understood
 him He did not speak
 of any par ticular act
 but of a series of
 acts Now sir declare befbre
 God and the country that
 there is no one thing
 that I more desire in
 this world than to sec
 that bill of indictment fairly
 hon cstly and intelligently made
 out What is it that
 my Sate has dot e
 I represent but one Sidley
 I am unfortunate A great
 n lany gentlemen I ep
 resent whole squads of States
 Laughter _t 1 only represent
 one and she is one
 of the smallest in the
 Union I should be glad
 to see the bdl of
 indictment fairly and squarely and
 and constitutionally made out I
 would ask gen tlemen to
 put their finger on the
 place and name the time
 and thc occasion when the
 State which I have the
 honor in part to represent
 hcpe has done anything inconsistent
 with her constitutional dignity and
 her constitutional duty inconsistent with
 that fraternal feeling which should
 govern the representatives of the
 States of this Confed eracy
 And sir I can tell
 the honorable Senat or fronu
 Georgia that when I speak
 of this fraternak feeling it
 is a little more than
 skin deep with me have
 gloried in the Union and
 in the country and the
 whole of it and I
 believe sir that if evil
 days are before us they
 are the just judgments of
 a righteous God for the
 iniquities of a people who
 have been blind to His
 mercies and reckless in the
 use of the great privi
 leges that He has be
 stowed upon thcm But I
 beg now and once for
 all to assure t he
 honorable Senator from Ohio and
 evm y other Senator and
 everybody else x vho pays
 the least regard to what
 falls from so humble a
 source as myself that I
 have never said anything that
 evcn sophistry could torttue into
 a metytce of war come
 here sir to perform my
 duty under the Constitution and
 I am willincr to meet
 any and everybody and say
 that if there can bc
 pointed out anything in which
 the State that represent has
 come short of her whole
 constitutional duty in letter and
 in spirit she will do
 what she never did in
 the face of an enemy
 and that is take a
 Then I cannot have any
 difficulty with him It I
 i as that Mr Buchanan
 would send an army down
 backward step She has no
 pride of opinion that is
 the power behind Iliun I
 um talking about to South
 Carolina I will tell you
 sir what I i will
 influence her beyond her constitutional
 duty Mr PUGH My honorable
 friend from Mis believe to
 be his position and I
 am sorry to be She
 is ready to perform that
 and all that and to
 sissippihasno Republicans to conqucrathomc provoked
 to say it believe that
 instead of stand there It
 is thus th at sho
 expects the Union That duty
 remains to me and to
 inore than a sending an
 army down to South Carolina
 Mr will be prcserved and
 go down to posterity such
 I tell him and I
 now tell them Buchanan is
 on his knees before them
 to day as we have
 hoped that it would be
 and as l have million
 like 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 35 hoped for sir l
 have hoped that when the
 angel of Revelations stood at
 last with one foot upon
 ther earth and the other
 upon the sea and by
 Him that liveth iörever and
 ever that time 9hould bc
 no longer this great Rcpublic
 w ould be e the
 last tlaat would be wound
 up l hat has been
 my hope and my desire
 I have labored for it
 and am willing to labor
 for it but I am
 not will ing that my
 humble efforts should be perverted
 and misrepresented I do not
 apply that term to the
 honorable Senator but I assure
 him that after we adjourn
 or upon sorne Friday or
 Saturday when we adjourn over
 and he has answered all
 his letters and done all
 the rest of the works
 of necessity and mercy that
 lie before him if he
 will take up my poor
 speech and read it he
 will find that he has
 done me and the speech
 great injus tice and I
 know he will feel repentant
 when he sees it because
 it was poor enough at
 the best laughter take it
 as it was and let
 the eye of friend ship
 scan it and pronounce upon
 it and it was not
 much but when it comes
 to be perverted and misrepresented
 and made the thing that
 it was not I know
 the Senator will be sorry
 for the injustice he has
 Mr PUGH I certainly must
 apologize to the Senator from
 New Hampshire I did understand
 his speech as I said
 but I am very happy
 to be under the necessity
 of apologizing he has left
 so much more pleasant impressions
 on my mind by this
 speech than he did by
 tho other Mr MASON Mr
 President 1 wish to say
 but a very few words
 Mr DAVIS If the Senator
 from Virginia wilk allow me
 I will answer tbc question
 of the Sen ator from
 New Hampshire before he proceeds
 or afterwards as he pleases
 Mr MASON I have but
 a very few words i
 to say I am not
 going to make a speech
 The resolution as it stan
 ls is t o refer
 certain parts of the President
 s messsage to a cornmiltee
 of the Senate nothing more
 The concluding para graph giving
 authority to the committee to
 report by bill or otherwise
 seems to me surplusagc because
 every committee of the Senate
 has that authority without its
 being specially given is therefore
 simply a resolution to refer
 certain portions of the President
 s message to a commit
 teo of the Senate Now
 sir am not at liberty
 to vote against it and
 1 trouble the Senate with
 a very few rcmarks only
 lest my vote in favor
 of it should be misconstrued
 elsewhere There is a possibility
 that a vote in the
 affirmative may in some parts
 of the country in the
 popular judg ment ascribe to
 the Senator so voting an
 idea that there is to
 be found in Congress any
 remedy for the present condition
 of the country I fear
 it would mislead the public
 mind that it would in
 duce them to hope or
 to expect that it was
 within the reach of 10
 islation here in some way
 to save tho country from
 the dissolution that is immi
 nently pending I shall vote
 for the resolution but without
 an idea that it is
 possible for any thing that
 Congress can do to reach
 the dangers with which we
 are threatened Sir in my
 own State 1 know that
 the people arc not looking
 to Congress for any legislation
 competent even to mitigate or
 palliate far less to prevent
 those dangers My State and
 a great many others of
 the slaveholding States of this
 Confederacy are going into convention
 with a view to take
 up the subject for themselves
 and os separate sovereign communities
 to determine what is best
 for their safety I know
 that the I public mind
 in the State of Virginia
 is in no sense in
 no manner directed to Congress
 with any idea that it
 is competent to them to
 afford relief The States are
 taking the subject into their
 own hands I should regret
 extremely if the of this
 resolution should lead the citizens
 of the other States the
 non slavcholding States to look
 to Congress for any hope
 of an I adjustment of
 these differences It would mis
 I should certainly hope that
 those lead them States North
 and East and West would
 do as we arc doing
 in the South resolve themselves
 Into their separate political communities
 and there determinc whether anything
 and what can be done
 to save this Union If
 they look to us with
 any such hope they arc
 misled in my judgment I
 should regrctcxtremcly therefore if an
 aff rm alive vote on
 my part which will be
 given for mentary form than
 from any other reason should
 lead them in any quarter
 to expect that it is
 com petent to us that
 we have the power to
 avert the perils that are
 impending I should expect much
 from the northern and eastern
 States if they were to
 go into State convention look
 at the evil as it
 exists and apply a remedy
 if it be within their
 power What is the evil
 Gentlemen havc well said it
 is not the failure to
 execute this fugitive slave law
 it is not the passage
 of these liberty bills as
 they are called in various
 of thc States it is
 a social war so far
 not a war of arms
 a war of sentiment of
 opinion a var by one
 form of society against another
 form of society I pos
 sibly may have a misinformed
 judgment but I rely upon
 it until corrected and my
 judgment is satisfied that for
 some reason the population in
 the States havino no staves
 feeling their great numerical majority
 and having nursed this senti
 ment this mere opinion about
 social forms exist ing elsewhere
 have in some manner unfortu
 nate y brought themselves to
 a deternlination to extinguish it
 I do not mean by
 any immediate blow by any
 present law but it is
 their purpose having obtained possession
 of the Federal power to
 use that power in every
 form _ to bring that
 social condition to a close
 I look upon it then
 sir as a war of
 sentiment and opinion by one
 form of society against another
 fbrm of society How that
 will end I wili not
 undertake to predict but if
 there be a remedy for
 it it is not here
 it must beat home in
 their own State councils and
 should regret extqme y if
 any vote I am to
 give herc should misleail public
 judgiucnt so fur as to
 lead them to suppose that
 they are to look here
 for saféty If the people
 would go into convention in
 all those States as wo
 are driven into convention take
 up the sub ject probe
 it analyze it look back
 to history and see what
 it is they would l
 ave it in their power
 to apply a remedy The
 remedy rests in their hands
 not in Congress in the
 State councils of the several
 States in the political society
 of the several States and
 it we induce them by
 any act of ours here
 to look to Congress for
 safety we shall mislead them
 I fear too sir that
 in what fell from the
 hon orablc Senator from New
 York wc at c admon
 ished of the sort of
 legislation thåt is looked to
 on tl at side as
 a for impen ling dangers
 The honorable Senator says that
 it is the duty of
 the Executive head of the
 Confederacy to exe cutc the
 laws that it is the
 duty of Cohgress if he
 has not sufficient power now
 under the law to Tive
 it to him that he
 knows of nothing that can
 resist the lax vs unless
 it orioinates in insurrection or
 rebellion which is to be
 put down That is the
 sort of legislation that is
 thc sort of remedy to
 which that honorable Senator looks
 That means Mr President that
 in the relation which subsists
 between the States of tho
 Union and the Federal power
 State cxistencc is not to
 bc recoc nized and that
 if a Statc abandons the
 Union separates from it sevcrs
 all political connection With it
 that fact is not to
 be rccoo nized by or
 known to the Federal Government
 A State in the fall
 plenitude of her sovereignty entirely
 rc sumed by her fundamental
 law absolves her citi zens
 from the allegiance they formcrly
 held to the Government which
 they abandoned That is not
 to be known but the
 law is to march straight
 forward like tho car of
 Tuggernaut crushing all who may
 oppose it That i undcr
 stand to be the doctrine
 of the Senator from New
 York his construction Federal power
 Well sir if it bc
 truc am not one of
 those who will lend my
 aid or my votc to
 any legislation con templating suca
 a state of things They
 may call it what they
 please they may call it
 puttin y down rcsistance to
 thc laws or insurrection or
 rebellion or treason in a
 citizen but at last it
 is undisguised war by one
 political war open power acrainst
 another political power That is
 It and the honorable Senator
 seeking to evade I use
 the term in no offensive
 sense but the hon orable
 Senator seeking to characterize it
 in some terms that belong
 to civil jurisdiction calls it
 in surrcction or rebellion The
 meeting of one po lilical
 pox ver with anot hm
 political power in hos tility
 in arms is war and
 can come to nothing I
 did not mean as I
 said sir to address the
 the resolution more from what
 is due to parlia Senatc
 on this subject The day
 may arise when we shall
 be obliged to address the
 Senate on this subject not
 theorizing not as arguments to
 prospective ills but to meet
 events that occur facts that
 exist and are practically before
 us when it will devolve
 on the American Sena e
 to determine whether in the
 cXecutiöri of the Fed eral
 laws against a State that
 has separated itßblf from the
 Confederacy the Federal jUrisdiöCion i
 treats it as a merc
 insurrection of whether it is
 to be treated as war
 fcar that that day may
 come and come speedily but
 suf ficient unto the day
 is the evil thereof sire
 only that the vote which
 I shall give foi the
 proposition to refer a part
 of the Presidént s mcs
 sacye to a committee of
 the Senatc may not mis
 lead anybody so far as
 my vote goes into an
 idea that the people can
 look to the Senate or
 to the House for relief
 in the present emergency They
 must look at home to
 their State convcn tions and
 nowhere else Mr BIGLER Ido
 not rise Mr President for
 the purpose of taking a
 general vieW of the present
 unhappy condition of the country
 No one could do that
 at this time without more
 de liberato consideration than I
 have had the oppor tunity
 o giving the subject Sir
 it seems to me no
 Senator can close his eyes
 to the dangers which surround
 our common country At this
 very moment the great heart
 of the Republic throbs deeply
 and the whole system shows
 evi dence of sickness and
 decay Sir I approach this
 question with the utmost diffdeuce
 I Mr HALE With the
 consent of the Sena tor
 from Pennsylvania I move that
 the Senate adjöurn Mr DAVIS
 Before that motion is put
 I v zill answer the
 question which the Senator from
 New Hampshire put to me
 if he desires it Mr
 HALE Oh no Mr DAVIS
 If the Senator does not
 desire an answer will not
 give it Mr BIGLER Before
 the motion is put I
 de sire to say a
 word I fear that the
 motion of the Senator from
 Newr Hampshire to which I
 yielded may lead to a
 misunderstanding that I intend to
 makc a full elaborate speech
 on this question I do
 not My intention only to
 thank the Sen ator from
 Connecticut for the manly position
 which he has taken and
 to answer to sOme ex
 tent the views of the
 Senator from Virginia The VICE
 PRESIDENT Will the Senator pause
 The confusion in the Chamber
 is so great that the
 Senator on the floor cannot
 be heard and the Chair
 considers it his duty to
 cali the atten tion of
 the Senate in an emphatic
 manner to it Mr BIGLER
 1 yield to the mötion

 SERVICE ON SPECIAL COMMITTEE The
 SPEAKER stated that the question
 before the House was on
 séconding the demand for the
 previous question on the request
 of Mr HAWKINS 36 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 10 to
 be excused from serving on
 the special com mitteé of
 one from each State to
 which was referred that portion
 of thb President s message
 relatihg to secession movements Mr
 VALLANDIGHAM 1 ask the gentleman
 from Florida to withdraw his
 demand for the previous question
 to enable me to assign
 my reasons for voting to
 excuse him Mr HAWKINS I
 will of course withdraw it
 With great pleasure to accommodate
 the gentle man from Ohio
 It was my intention when
 I camo into the House
 this morning to withdraw it
 mySelf Without any request of
 that kind so that I
 myself might be enabled to
 make some frw remarks foi
 the purpose of better defining
 my position before the country
 Mr VALLANDIGHAM Iprefer ofcourse to
 hear the i easous of
 the gentleman from Florida more
 at length and when he
 concludes I shall ask to
 submit somc on my own
 part Mr McCLERNAND 1 was
 entitled to the floor and
 do not recoffnizc any understanding
 which shall forcclose my chance
 The SPEAKER The Chair understands
 the gentleman from Florida to
 withdraw his demand tor the
 previous question and that he
 wishes now to be hoard
 He is entitled to the
 floor Mr HAVVKINS Mr Speaker
 finding that my views and
 motives Or asking to be
 excused ftöm serving upon the
 committee of thirty three have
 not only been misunderstood but
 misrepre sented I will endeavor
 in a few rernarks to
 define my position somewhat more
 specifically than I have already
 done and place myself in
 the true attitude in which
 I stand in relation to
 the ques tion pending before
 the House In this whole
 matter sir I have been
 guided by my own ideas
 as to what was to
 the occasion nor did I
 hold counsel with a single
 person as to the course
 I should adopt sohuion of
 the question was so silih
 lc the con clusions to
 be arrived at so easiEy
 attained I deemed advice superfluous
 and I act ed upon
 the dictates of n y
 ow i exclusi j ndglnent
 It is true sir after
 had marked out In y
 linc of conduct and after
 I I la d acted
 upon the matter I did
 ask the opinions of ynany
 southern mem bcrs and with
 one or two exceptions they
 inost cordially agrccd with the
 cou rsc had taken t
 course sir at this time
 I have no idea of
 nuaking för mal or set
 speech such a one how
 ever i anticipate delivering before
 i leave this I I
 dl sctting forth the causes
 which have impelled to the
 course she has already pursued
 my State and will pursue
 within the next thirty days
 In the first place sir
 it I consented to serve
 upon this committee I would
 be lacing myself in false
 position Every one w 10
 consents to serve upon that
 committee in my opinion though
 hc may not be bound
 by its ultimate ac t
 ion certainly commits himself to
 the projit ot its formation
 as a rncans of compromisino
 and settling the disputes now
 between the North South the
 removal of o uovances and
 an adjustrnent of all qucstions
 now acritntino the country Now
 sir by virtue of the
 powers intrusted mc by the
 people of my State I
 might act upon Sl ch
 a committee in circumstances dill
 ercnt from those now cXisti1
 g but my Slate sir
 has already taken tho initiative
 and her Legislature has ordered
 an election for the purpose
 ot choosing mernbers to a
 convention to be convened ou
 the Bd day of January
 1861 Florida is then to
 act in her soverei n
 capacity as a member of
 this Confed eracy a peer
 of thirty two other sovereignties
 She will then take such
 steps and pursue such measures
 as may bc compatible with
 her dignity her safety and
 her honor in populatiofi a
 population re It is true
 sir tarded in growth by
 unt oWard circumstances she is
 numerically weak but yet sir
 she is not the less
 sovereign not tho less cntitled
 to all the rights powers
 and immunities of her sister
 States Switzerland among the nations
 of Europe so far as
 her riffhts are concerned and
 as a sovereio n Pov
 yer is entitled to t
 he same political considera tion
 as France and Portugal the
 Same as Russia and I
 niicl t add in this
 Confederacy of Slates rida fin
 the same reasons is the
 peer and For a long
 period of time equal of
 New York Repul iic of
 San Marino existed as an
 Power with all the attributes
 of full and sovereitrnty I
 make these remarks sir because
 the compar ative sparsity of
 population of my State and
 her weakness as it is
 termed have bcen sneered at
 as if power alonc is
 to command respect and oppression
 was to be the destiny
 of that people who do
 not possess the requisite physical
 power by itself to redress
 a wrono or resent an
 insult Florida sir weak as
 she is powerless as she
 rnay appear could not be
 coerced to remain in the
 Union if she chose to
 go out Such an attempt
 would be resisted by a
 force if necessary of ten
 times the number of your
 standing Army rushing to the
 rescue from every southern State
 But sir to return As
 I have before remarked Florida
 has determined to settle for
 herself and in her own
 way the time the mode
 and manner of redress She
 will beyond doubt take into
 consideration the action of this
 very comnuittec as well as
 all other matters connected with
 her at titude as now
 presen ted or any other
 which in thc future she
 may assume It must bc
 admitted sir that the Representa
 tives in this body are
 but the agents of the
 States from which they are
 respectively sent not that thcy
 arc members solely constituted for
 those States but in accordance
 with thc doctrine of Mr
 Burke they are to legislate
 for and extend a fost
 erin y care over the
 interests of the entire Union
 i The Representative is the
 agent the Statc is the
 principal When the Stutc acts
 or assumes to act the
 acrcncy is virtually at an
 end and dis solved this
 were not so the principal
 and the a yent would
 bc coequals and possess concomi
 tant powers and the latter
 perchance might in fringe upon
 the rights and authority of
 the former It is said
 if members decline to serve
 upon this committee why be
 members at all right have
 they to make this comrnittee
 an exception to the ordinary
 rules of leffislation I have
 an say further because I
 swercd already in part havo
 no power of attorney upon
 this subject I have recei
 ved no instructions proper The
 subject before the House is
 not one of ordinary legislation
 but of most extraordinary character
 unlooked for not anticipated when
 I was elected a member
 of this H 0 u
 sc But sir while I
 have received no positive in
 struction confess I fecl myself
 virtually instruct It matters but
 little as to the medium
 or channel by which ideas
 thoughts or wishes may satisfied
 from all the indi be
 conveyed cations in n y
 Ståle by the unanimity which
 has characterized its acts the
 settled and stern re solve
 from the Executive to the
 humblest citizen to seek redress
 through some other agency than
 that of compromise that wore
 I to servo upon this
 committee such assent would elicit
 the most emphatic and general
 denunciation But sir I n
 rust not bc understood as
 shrinking from responsibility behind the
 barrier of implied instructions The
 action already taken and that
 which is incvitubly to follow
 chimes with my own views
 and finds a cordial cchoil
 ff response in every feeling
 and sentiment of my heart
 So Mr Speaker you must
 sec that by accept ing
 a position upon this committee
 I would com promise myself
 compromise my constituents by consenting
 to serve upon it as
 one of its constit uent
 parts Undcr such circuuns tanc
 cs I would c crtamly
 deem it illiberal and unjust
 in the House to persist
 in my serving thereby using
 its inhe rcnt power of
 quasi c ocrcion to produce
 such a I ask sir
 if there is any lucrnbcr
 of this result body who
 would bo willing to do
 aught in the I louse
 contrary to the direct or
 implied instruc tions of his
 constituents This is my case
 It is true my instructions
 are not in totidean terbis
 l ut I have shown
 they are implied and with
 a right minded man there
 exists no difference I know
 sir 1 might unite in
 a minority report or brilP
 in one myself but I
 do not wish through my
 agency to throw the least
 obstaclc in the way of
 the committee My second ground
 of objection to serving upon
 this committee is that I
 believe its action will elicit
 no favorable results and effect
 nothing 1 ha ve no
 confidcncc in cono ressional legislation
 as a means of restorin
 permanent peace and harmony to
 the country Has it ever
 done so Havo these compromises
 ever brought with them II
 any great healing remedies for
 the wounds in flicted upon
 the Constitution and the country
 So fat from it they
 themselves have originated the bitterest
 quarrels producin crixninulion and recrimination
 each party accusingr the other
 of perfidy and breach of
 faith The process now attempted
 by wa y of pan
 acea for the ills surrounding
 us though I say it
 with the greatest respect for
 thc motives of its excogitators
 I regard as the veriest
 empiricism a cure to be
 effected by nostrums herbs emolli
 It will not do sir
 ents homeopathic doses is a
 case of surgery It requires
 the scalpel of a Mott
 or a Carnochan The patient
 may be re lieved for
 a time but a relapse
 is certain to follow and
 a relapse is always more
 dangerous than the original attack
 As to the composition of
 this committee with the greatest
 possible deference to yourself Mr
 Speaker I must say in
 all candor I regard it
 as unfortunate and ill advised
 I am satisfied sii if
 left to the dictates of
 your judgment and the hon
 est impulses of your heart
 a different råle would have
 been played a different formation
 have been the result Now
 sir I do not wish
 to be invid I have
 not the ious or personal
 in my remarks slightest personal
 animosity against any member of
 this body and whatever I
 utter is to be taken
 in a politicäl sense and
 in the light offair criticism
 I wish to be parliamentary
 sir so much so that
 I may even rne ct
 with ihe approbation of my
 friend from Virginia Yes sir
 i wish to bc like
 the madman in the play
 who he would not tie
 his cravat without a warrant
 from Justice Overdo Upon this
 committee Mr Speåker I do
 not see the name of
 any Democratfi orn the powerful
 I believe the party in
 and mighty Northwest that region
 numbers some several hundreds of
 thousands of voters they had
 a right to be heard
 in this matter for though
 only Democrats com mon charity
 would suggest that they felt
 some little interest in this
 question in the integrity ind
 preservation of the Union if
 preserved it can be I
 would have been glad to
 have seen my friends from
 Ohio Messrs V ALLANDIGHAM and
 Cox and my friends from
 Illinois Messrs LOGAN and l
 åCCLßRNAND noble and true spirits
 who have al ways stood
 by the South and fough
 t her battles I would
 have been glad to have
 seen some of their names
 upon this committee I suppose
 this committee was intended to
 have beeli a representatite committee
 one reflectinø the policy the
 rights the interests the opinions
 of the people of the
 various States of the Union
 If this was not the
 case the great end and
 aim of the Its materials
 committee would not be attained
 are singularly incongruous and heteroøeneous
 for we see all shades
 phases and complexions of political
 sentiment from the strongest Republican
 to the extreme Democrat from
 thc most savory Unionist to
 the rankest Secessionist Ali this
 however was very proper and
 necessarily arose from the wish
 to obtain a comrnittee composed
 of all these ingredients and
 if these could agree and
 did agree the panacea would
 be successful Now sir I
 cannotthink thåt the gentleman from
 Maryland is a fair exponent
 of the opinions of the
 people of that State I
 believe sir that the Legislature
 of Maryland passed some resolutions
 rather denunciatory of the gentleman
 and re gret to say
 it for voting for you
 Mr Speaker and by that
 vote constituting you the presiding
 officer of this body This
 noay have been very unjust
 in the people of Maryland
 but they seemed to think
 that the vote for Speaker
 was the test of southern
 fealty and that all who
 voted for you were either
 Republicans out and out or
 at least Republicans in sympathy
 and affliation and con sequentiycnemicsof
 one great interest of the
 State slavery Ifthe criterion or
 test before alluded to is
 correct the appointment was not
 appropriate for one must possess
 superhuman virtue to repre sent
 honestly and faithfully a great
 and com manding interest ofa
 State when at heart he
 may be averse to that
 interest I may do the
 gentle man wrong if so
 I am to be corrected
 but till then I must
 be guided by the resolutions
 of a sovercign State passed
 I believe with only one
 dissentincr voice Mr rise to
 correct one of the statements
 just made by the gentleman
 from Florida Mr HAWKINS 1
 cannot yield the floor Mr
 BRIGGS The gentleman has misrepre
 sented lne and all I
 desire to do is to
 correct him and sot myself
 right He misrepresents the vote
 which I gave for you
 Mr Speakef 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 37 Mr HAWKINS 1
 must call the gentleman t
 the blood ofmy friends shed
 in the streets of Harper
 s Ferry to order I
 decline to yield Mr BRIGGS
 I only wish to say
 that the gentleman is wrong
 in his statement so far
 as I am concerned My
 vote was not given for
 you Mr Speaker upon the
 ground stated that is as
 exhibiting my opposition to the
 interest and rights of any
 section of this Union ft
 vas I hold a national
 and conservative vote Mr HAWKINS
 The gentleman is only in
 the incipient stage of comprehension
 I was al luding not
 to members from the free
 but to mem bers from
 the southern slavc States The
 gen tleman from New York
 is not a southern man
 Mr BRIGGS The gentleman referred
 to those who voted for
 our present Speaker Mr HAWKINS
 No sir Mr BRIGGS Then
 I am mistaken Mr HAWKINS
 1 have nodoubt that if
 the gentleman were not Alexander
 he would be the other
 man Diogencs Laughter Mr Speaker
 there were aSTEWART a HUGHES
 a KUNKEL a HARRIs anda
 WEBSTER from whom a selection
 could have been made neither
 of whom comes here with
 the marked and emphatic disap
 probation of the State of
 Maryland She is a noble
 State sir always patriotic always
 ready to do her devoir
 in behalf of our country
 In the war of the
 Revolution the troops of the
 Mary land line performed prodigies
 of valor and in the
 campaign in the South by
 them were battles saved and
 victories won At the hard
 fou yht battle of the
 Cowpens nothing saved the day
 but a charge with the
 bayonet by these troops of
 Marylan l led by the
 gallant Howard while they fought
 most nobly and covered themselves
 with glory at Eutaw King
 s Mountain and Guil ford
 Court House Maryland was entitled
 sir to a representaticc tnan
 There are other appointees upon
 this commit tee subject to
 criticism I have only selected
 one of the inost glaring
 of the cases If asked
 what is all this to
 me inasmuch as I declinc
 to serve upon the committee
 I answer Iwant the country
 to know that it cannot
 docs not represent the true
 sentiment of some of the
 States and that a great
 moral effect is sought to
 be produced by some thing
 that savors of a constructive
 fraud So far as the
 extreme South is concerned I
 tell them this committee is
 the Grecian horse introduced ii
 to Troy Tl he object
 is to gain time delay
 and de moralize the South
 by holding forth to its
 people that there is a
 great pacificator at work certain
 to bring about a political
 millennium Again Mr Speaker i
 regret that this proposi tion
 for this committee did not
 emanate fropn the North This
 would have indicated a rcturnincr
 sense ofjustice in that quarter
 that there was a sincere
 desire to make due concessions
 and offer a proper security
 for the future No sir
 it came frorn a son
 of Virginia a gentleman for
 whom I entertain a profound
 respect blended with no little
 1 recret thac his 1110desly
 prevenled adrniration him from serving
 upon this committee with all
 my heart But sir was
 it appropriate that the South
 after havincr endured every insult
 wrong and eon Lurnely her
 citizens excited to frenzy by
 the long continued assaults upon
 her institutions and States driven
 into revolution yes sir I
 reiterate s vas it appropriate
 after all this that the
 olive branch should be tendered
 to the North by one
 of Virginia s mozt gifted
 sons It was the part
 of the South to I
 lave st ood aloof and
 assumed an attitude of self
 defense and stern defiance await
 ingforan overturcfrom the North I
 do fuli justice to the
 motives of the mover of
 this committee Beyond all doubt
 they were replete with patriot
 ism But I regret deeply
 regret that a Repre sentative
 of Virginia representing the district
 intd which John Brown made
 his bloody foray and shed
 Virginia blood should have been
 the first to move in
 this matter Ircmember tast win
 ter MI Speaker the pleasure
 and delight vvyith which I
 listened to the remarks of
 the gentleman from Virginia the
 mover of these resolutions But
 sir fearing that this admiration
 will not bc appreciated properly
 I would ask my friend
 upon tho left Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE to read the ex
 tracts which I will point
 out Mr JOHN COCHRANE read
 the extracts as follows Now
 sir was presentat that horrible
 Harper s Ferry raid I
 was a wituess to that
 abominable outrage I saw and
 if therc is a Inan
 who has a right to
 speak to that sub ject
 it is myself and yet
 I have fbrbornc to speak
 on the subject I have
 remained silent för various reasons
 not the least of which
 is that the distinguished Senator
 before me Mr Masopi is
 engaged in the investigation of
 the facts covinectcd with the
 whole affair and will present
 them fully and fairly at
 the proper time before the
 country and leave it to
 judge of theni I here
 is another reason which must
 confess has also influenced me
 in this matter I and
 f have been painfullv conscious
 of it whenever my mind
 has reverted to that dark
 day that whcn the heart
 most the tongue refuses to
 pcriörm its wonted task And
 sir when I have heard
 gentlemen on the other side
 of tbe tloor stand up
 and derisively refer to that
 in famous outrage I have
 been hardly able to retain
 my seat and ref rain
 fi om the expression of
 iny indignation in terms which
 might not have sounded parliamentary
 My mind sir has again
 and again during t his
 discussion gone back to that
 dark October evening when stood
 by the side of a
 friend and laid my hand
 upon his brow where the
 death damp was gathering while
 the blood was gushing from
 his noble heart and have
 been often disposed to say
 in apol ogy for iny
 i orbearance Oh pardon me
 thou bleeding piece of earth
 l hat am rncck and
 gentle with these butchers P
 For tell you sir tfiat
 in my opinion tbc leaders
 of the Abolition which is
 seeking to control the organiza
 uec and to obtain possession
 ot the Govern tion of
 this ment are as uch
 the murderers of my friends
 at Harper s Ferry as
 were John Brown and his
 dCluded föllo wcrs and I
 think that the committee engaged
 in the investiga tion in
 my State and the invcstigatiou
 on the part of the
 Senate will prove that the
 agitation ofthe slavery question by
 the great leaders of thc
 Republican party has been the
 iå ect cause of the
 Ilarper s Ferry invasion The
 election which returned these gentlemen
 here took place a montl
 befOre the John Brown raid
 ple ofthe North believe know
 they must know they can
 not fåil to see what
 is the inevitable tendency of
 this sla very agitation They
 have becn told by you
 the politicians you the leaders
 and haue ailowed ourselves to
 be de ludcd by the
 syren song suntr in our
 cars that you do not
 intend to interlOre with slavcry
 within the States Person ally
 I believe you do not
 Personally there is not a
 leader arnong you all not
 even Fred Douglass vr ho
 can be fOund with courarre
 enough to come into States
 and interture witli slavery there
 But froin year to year
 you have beaten the drum
 of abolit ion isn From
 your pulpit and press and
 forum in season and out
 of season you have preached
 to the risinry aeneration that
 slavery is a curse and
 that anti slavery sentiment has
 stimulated others less careful of
 their personal safOty to co
 nc us with a hostile
 intent to steal our slaves
 and incite then to insurrection
 Mr HAWKINS Mr Speaker men
 of the beauty of the
 eloquence of the gentle man
 from Virginia My friend from
 New York Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 read those passarres which 1
 marked with proper cmphasis and
 hc did it well as
 he does cvcrything but sir
 his delivery was not equal
 to that of t11C gont
 ernan from Vir ginia the
 thereby losinrr tnueh of their
 powcr by the loss of
 the eloquehce of the tleman
 who pronounced them l here
 two Athenians One of them
 read to the other an
 oration of Demosthenes EIIC Athenian
 to whom the oration was
 read was perfectlv enraptured and
 expressed his dcliullt and ad
 liliration when the reader of
 the oration retnarked A y
 sir but you should have
 heard Dmnosthcnes himself dc liver
 it Now sir in this
 there is no covert satire
 none intended but since I
 have been a member of
 this body I have heard
 no gentleman whom I have
 admired Inorc than I did
 my friend from Virginia the
 last when he delivered his
 speech in relation to John
 Brown Iwiil now read sir
 a few liner myself wc
 now discover that Ive must
 depend upon our own right
 ann to protect our State
 fi om further outrage so
 long as thcre re nains
 a Republican organization in Congress
 and the country Why will
 you persist zne n of
 the North in maintaining that
 organizaüon WV hat good do
 you ex poet to effect
 by it Yoti fonned it
 so you have said för
 the sole purpose of making
 Kansas a free State You
 have Kansas as a free
 State iOr sir when she
 comes into this If there
 be any other pur Union
 she will coÆue as I
 vee pose that you expect
 to accomplish by it it
 must be to trans iQr
 your irrepressible conflict from the
 Territories to the States In
 other words sir he calls
 upon the North to do
 away with their organization he
 calls upon the Republican party
 to disband Mr Speaker the
 idea of thc Republican party
 disbanding and breaking up is
 too ridiculous What sir break
 up after the great and
 siszual victory achieved over all
 of us Break up get
 none of the spoils the
 honors and the most coveted
 of ail the power Those
 who believe that thc Republican
 party will screams of the
 coronach in the highlands of
 Scout land But sir the
 Republiåån party Will h t
 yield they haye rio ideä
 of yiéldiijb I see men
 there on my right who
 have fib moréidea of gori
 cession than I have of
 doing tin y aetkiihich håve
 solemnly made up my mind
 not to t lOd Look
 at I them Is there
 any trepidation on thbsé fåces
 Oh the other side of
 the Hall Is there any
 qüäi l ihg Is there
 any cowering Why sip tliéY
 sit there amidst all these
 events Which are speed ily
 following each other and shaking
 the Country to its fouhdatiohs
 as composed tis the Roman
 Senators upon the invasion of
 Rome by the Gtidlé They
 have made up their minds
 They yield They yield up
 the doctrines for which they
 have been fighting for thirty
 years Why SIX it is
 an absurdity You might just
 as well ask us upon
 the Democratic side of the
 House to Yield up all
 our own doctrines and principles
 You might just as well
 ask us southern men to
 yield up the institu tion
 of slaver y disrniss our
 negroes and throw them upon
 the world The Republi can
 party is made of stcrncr
 stuff The idea bruited about
 in the newspapers that the
 Repub lican party is scared
 and that there is trepi
 daqign among them is ridiculous
 This soutliérn ex citement may
 have touched the commercial men
 of the North but go
 to the northern country and
 mix with the masses and
 you will find that If
 any of these gentlemen should
 give wav to the South
 and concede to them equality
 in ihe Territories and the
 repeal of these liberty bills
 what would bc the plain
 and stern response of the
 yeomanry of the North plain
 commori sense straightfor ward men
 with simple but strong ideas
 They would say No gentlemen
 we have fought this battle
 with you we have fought
 this battle for you by
 our votes you wish to
 leave the guns vvc will
 hold you to the guns
 and we will fight together
 L hat sir is the
 truth and if i could
 call those gentlemen opposite upon
 the stand they would agree
 with me and make a
 responSe in the affirmative Do
 not then let uS talk
 any inore about the North
 yielding It is true sir
 we may obtain some trivial
 con ccssions clothed in vague
 generalities but as to obtaining
 equality in the rrcrritorics as
 to our property as to
 the repeal of these liberty
 bills as they are called
 as to the stopping of
 tl iis agitation of the
 slavery question tell you sir
 it is too absurd to
 suppose any such thing and
 is a proposition not to
 be entertained for a single
 I say therefore that those
 gentlemen moment from the South
 who anticipate concession based on
 justice and our rights are
 laborino under a most singular
 delusion Why is it that
 at this moment when the
 whole country is agitated the
 Pcesident elect has kept a
 most ominous silence Why in
 the language of Mr Curran
 this facti tions dumbness Would
 it not have been as
 well for the President elect
 to have waived any little
 oflicial etiquette and written a
 few lines to afford some
 views of his policy The
 only man that has spoken
 or attempted to speak for
 him is Senator TRUMBULL Of
 Illinois He made a speech
 foreshadowing the policy of the
 President elect What does Mr
 TRUMBULL say He says that
 thé President clect will among
 other things carry out the
 fugitive slave law But he
 says and I wish every
 southern man to recollect it
 that his interpretation of the
 Constitution wilt I be on
 the side of freedonl Of
 course he as the Executivc
 nrm will override the judiciary
 by not regarding thie Dred
 Scott decision What is meant
 by the interpretation of the
 Constitution in favor of freedom
 It rncans of course oppo
 sition to slavery Here then
 is a man elected to
 the high office of the
 Republican party of the North
 who goes into power opposed
 10 one of the great
 leading interests of the South
 Now I wish to speak
 a few plain words here
 It is necessary that somebody
 should do so I may
 be called a Cataline a
 Robcspierre a Danton a Marat
 but am willing to encounter
 all those I epithets and
 i avail myself of the
 occasion to say a few
 words of warning to the
 North the North that Mississippi
 Alabama Floridq be broken up
 in the words of Rasselas
 to ening with credu ity
 to the whispers of fancy
 It is true Mr Speaker
 that we hear no re
 I Louisiana and Texas are
 certain to ibllow within I
 the ensuing six months Texas
 owing to her ioicings over
 this victory Everything is quiet
 It is appropriate that it
 should be so Shouts of
 peculiar position is now hampered
 as to her ac tion
 Unfortunately for Texas the hero
 of San joy now sir
 would sound rather like the
 strains and notes from the
 harp of Nero or tho
 discordant Jacinto is its Governor
 an involuntary hero a 38
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 10
 man forced into the battle
 against his own views by
 the gallantry of his troops
 who could not be reStrained
 and who pressed forward and
 gained the day He was
 as much the hero of
 San Ja cinto as Marshel
 Ney was the hero of
 Yorktown When Sir Walter Raleigh
 was writing a history he
 saw so many different versions
 ofa very pla_in transaction he
 witnessed that he thrust his
 his tory aside in despair
 and came to the conclusion
 that there was no truth
 in history I do not
 pre tend to Say that

 I would be unwilling to
 say so of any man

 Here the hammerföll Mr VALLANDIGHAM
 Compelled by rules of the
 House to vote upon the
 question of excusing the gentleman
 from Florida from serv incr
 upon this committee I desire
 in a few words to
 submit my own reasons for
 the vote which i propose
 to Oivc With many of
 the reasons assigned by t
 hc gentleman from Florida l
 as a Representative from one
 of the free States of
 this Union have nothing to
 do but there arc consid
 erations which impel me as
 such Representative to vote for
 thc motion to excuse It
 is idle sir to attempt
 to coerce any gcn tleman
 to serve upon this committee
 who assicsns such reasons éis
 tho gentleman from Florida has
 given and in justice to
 him and to his State
 but above all to the
 very puréose of the committee
 itself I cannot so vote
 You may decline to cx
 cuse him you cannot compel
 him to discharge with good
 will or alacrity tho duties
 you impose upon him and
 what kind of conciliation and
 compromise is that which begins
 by forcing a man to
 serve upon a committee raised
 for thc very purpose of
 peace What prospect in God
 s nmne l speak it
 reverently is there of adjust
 ment when you are oblicrcd
 to resort to cmnpul Sion
 to make up your committee
 on comprotnise and adjustment pass
 by without comment the consideration
 so earnestly pressed by the
 gentleman from Flor ida tl
 låt this proposition with far
 pnorc propriety and effect have
 come from the Repub licai
 l party in this House
 that party that has just
 triumphed in the elccti01i which
 is thc cul minüting point
 of all out controversies and
 of ali the dangers which
 surround us and that with
 great honor to himself and
 great and soothing good it
 may have been to t
 hc whole country full of
 excitement and alarm the gentleman
 now chairman of this committee
 Mr CORWIN dis tinguished his
 age his experience his elo
 quence and his moderation not
 to speak of his position
 as the leader so he
 asserts of that party rnight
 have assumed upon himself the
 responsibility of the iniliative in
 that great work of reconciliation
 and reconstruction which alone can
 save us now instead of
 allowino it to bc devolved
 upon Representativc of that par
 ticular spot in Vir Finia
 selected by Abolition znadncss and
 wickctncss as the weakest point
 of attack along the en
 tire slaveholding borders of this
 Confederacy I pass by also
 the cumbrous construction of this
 committee with the single remark
 that a I council of
 war never fights and a
 committee of thirty three will
 never agree upon anyth ino
 upon anything certainly not so
 weak so difused so diluted
 as t o be utterly
 inadequate to the solution of
 the grea est and gravest
 and most difficult qucs tion
 ever presented in modern history
 I will not so much
 as st vcycst sir thc
 possibility that the labors of
 this connnittcc will all end
 in nothing and in worse
 than nothing nor approvmg carncstly
 of the motive for raising
 the committee will i remark
 cvcn as the gentleman from
 Florida has done upon the
 peculiar composition of this com
 mittee in having men appointed
 upon it who rep resent
 nobody not even themselves or
 who are peculiarly odious or
 distasteful to the sections from
 which they corne and fitted
 therefore far more to embarrass
 and defeat than to ad
 vancc Lhc avowed purpose for
 which the committee was or
 dered Of course sir I
 mean no disrespect person ally
 to theSpeaker but in assigning
 my reasons for j refusing
 to coerce a gentleman to
 serve upon this I committee
 I have the right and
 mean to exercise it of
 just criticisrn upon its composition
 and of suggestion as to
 the probable result of its
 labors solutcly preclude me from
 voting to compel any mau
 to act upon your committee
 The gen but he has
 tleman from Florida has alluded
 to it not stated it
 quite strong enough There is
 not one single Representative of
 the Democratic party upon this
 committee not froin the Northwest
 alone but froin the sixteen
 free States of this Union
 east of Rocky Mountains The
 Pacific is indeed it was
 Hobson s represented No thanks
 sir choice There is no
 Republican member from California bcrc
 although Mr Lincoln through the
 infinite subdivision of his opponents
 has been enabled to secure
 the electoral vote of that
 State The excellent and intelligent
 gentleman from Or egon Mr
 STOUT is indeed upon it
 because he is fortunate in
 having no colleague in this
 House though to speak the
 truth remembering the rep resentation
 of Oregon in certain recent
 political conventions I should not
 have been surprised had that
 gentleman been supplanted by Horace
 Grec ley or possibly by
 thc member from Massachu setts
 Mr THAYER although that mber
 is I suspect a little
 too strongly tinctur perhaps with
 the doctrine of squatter so
 reignty to suit tbc times
 Laughter But I repeat sir
 t here is notupon your
 commit tee one solitary Representative
 east of the Rocky Mountains
 of that mighty host numbering
 one million six hundred thousand
 men which for so many
 vears has stood as a
 vast breakwater against the winds
 and waves of sectiogalism and
 upon whose constituent clemcnts at
 least this country must still
 so much depend in the
 great events which are thronging
 thick upon us for all
 hope of preservation now or
 of rcstoration hereafter Sir is
 any nian here insane enough
 to imao incfor a moment
 that this great northern and
 western Democracy constituting an essential
 part and by far thc
 most numerous part of that
 great Demo cratic party which
 for half a century molded
 the policy and controlled the
 destinies of this Repu blic
 that party which gave to
 the country some of the
 brightest jewels of which she
 boasts that party which placed
 upon your statute books every
 im portant Incasure of enduring
 legislation frorn the beginning of
 the Government to this day
 that such n sect i01
 1 of such a party
 is to be thqs ut
 terly ignored insulted and thrust
 asidc as of no value
 I tell you you mistake
 the character of the men
 you have to deal with
 W c arc minority indeed
 to day at the ballot
 box and we bow quietly
 now to the popular will
 thus cx pressed We are
 defeated but not conquered and
 he is as a fool
 in the wisdom of this
 world who thinks that in
 the midst of the stirrinø
 and revo lutionary times which
 are upon us these sixteen
 hundred thousand men born free
 and now tho equals of
 their brethren men whose every
 pulse th robs with the
 spirit of liberty will tamely
 sub mit to be degraded
 to inferiority and reduced to
 political servitude Never never while
 there is but onc man
 left to strike a blow
 at the oppressor Sir we
 love this Union and more
 than that we obey the
 Constitution We are here a
 gallant little band of less
 than thirty men but represent
 ino more than a million
 and a half of ft
 ceuncn We are hcre to
 maintain thc Constitution which makes
 the Union and to exact
 and to yield that equality
 of rights which makes tbc
 Constitution W c are ready
 here to do all worth
 maintainino and to suffer all
 in the causc of our
 thank God yet cormnon country
 and by no vote or
 specch I or act of
 ours here or cl sewhere
 shall anything be done to
 defile 01 i npail or
 to ovcr hrow this the
 grandest tern plc of human
 liberty c ver erected i
 in any age But we
 demand to worship at the
 very foot of the altar
 and not as servants or
 ln feriors in the outer
 courts of tho edifice And
 i sir if the great
 work of the preservation or
 of i the restoration of
 this Government is to go
 on successfullv let mc warn
 gentlemen that it is to
 this very arnoy of conservative
 mcn that you are to
 look at last for its
 consummation If tho gen tlema
 n from Obio Mr CORWIN
 the chairman of this committee
 would do anything effectively to
 correct public sentiment in our
 common State it is to
 the two hundred and ten
 thousand Inen not of his
 own party together with such
 others of that party as
 he Ilia y be able
 to carry over with hirn
 that he is to trust
 for the vindication of such
 measures if an v conciliation
 and adjustment which his committee
 may propose and this I
 louse i and the Senate
 may adopt So too it
 will be in But there
 is one consideration which will
 ab every free State of
 this Union And yet that
 pow erful minority reckoned by
 millions and includ ingua country
 extending from the Atlantic to
 the Rocky Mountains made up
 of men by whose right
 hands this Government is to
 be defended and maintained or
 restored are as voiceless upon
 this committee as the sands
 upon the sea shore Can
 any good result from a
 committee so consti tuted Ought
 any man to be compelled
 to serve upon such a
 committee speak now as a
 western man and I thank
 the gentleman from Florida heartily
 for the kindly sentiments towards
 that great West to which
 he has given utterance Most
 cordially I recipro cate them
 one and all Sir we
 of the Northwest have a
 deeper interest in the preservation
 of this Government in its
 present form than any other
 section of the Union Hemmed
 in isolated cut off from
 the sea board upon every
 side a thou sand miles
 and more from the mouth
 of the Mis sissippi tho

 at every cost with nothing
 else but our other great

 and their outlet too through
 a foreicyn country what is

 we have fifteen hundred miles
 of southern fron tier and

 bounding us upon the east
 Ohio is tho isthmus that
 con nects the South with
 the British Possessions and the

 Rocky Mountains separate us from

 are we to do when
 you shall have broken up
 and destroyed this Government We
 arc seven States now with
 fourteen Senators and fifty one
 Representatives and a population of
 ninc millions We have an
 empire equal in area to
 the third of all Europe
 and we do not mcan
 to be a dependency or
 province either of the East
 or of the South nor
 yet an inferior or second

 and if we cannot secure
 a mantime boundary upon other
 terms we will cleave our

 nation of warriors we may
 be a tribe of shepherds
 never l speak it out
 sir now and here yet
 without apprehension of any just
 cause of complaint or quarrel
 at any time with either
 section upon the question And
 yet nearly one half of
 the people of that vast
 empire which very soon is
 to perform so important a
 part in the affairs of
 this continent are utterly ignored
 and excluded from this com
 mittee IVIore than six hundred
 thousand voters represented here by
 sixteen members upon this floor
 are silenced and disfranchised in
 its arrancre ment What do
 you propose to do without
 their votes at home and
 our votes herc Or are
 we both to accept blindly
 whatsocver your cornmittce may choose
 graciously to report and be
 thankful for it Sir wc
 have one State with a
 Democratic majority upon this floor
 and she at least had
 a right to be represented
 upon your pommittee 1 find
 no fault personally with the
 gentleman from that State now
 on the committee MI KELLOGG
 but the Democracy of the
 Northwest had a right to
 be heard through the State
 of Illinois Such is your
 committee and I cannot and
 I will not vote to
 compel any man to serve
 upon it The time is

 deep seated and of long
 standing What ever is to

 at once and it Inust
 be done thoroughly Every remedy
 must go right straight home
 to the seat of the

 In the name then of
 the Democracy of SIX teen
 of the free States of

 the arranmement of this committee
 My motives may be misinterpreted
 now Be it so Time
 in a littlc while will
 vindicatc them Mr McCLERNAND It
 is not my purpose at
 this time Mr Speaker to
 go into the question of
 either the personal or sectional
 propriety of the authorship of
 this committee further than to
 say that I heartily approve
 of the projegt of such
 a 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 39 committee and am thankful
 to the honorable gen leman
 from Virginia Mr BOTELER for
 movinc Itho had not done
 so i would have in
 favor of it aonc it
 only with this difference that
 I would have specified the
 matters of difference between the
 North and the South and
 instructed the com mittec to
 inquire into them and report
 by bill or by proposing
 an amendment of the Federal
 Con stitution for their upon
 fair and hon Indeed I
 proposed an amend orable principles
 ment to the resolution offered
 by the gentleman It is
 in the followilp words to
 that effect Resolved I hatso
 Inuch of the President s
 annual mes sage as relates
 to matters of grievance bctwecn
 the slave holding and non
 slaveholding States and the proposal
 by Congress of mnendments t
 the Constitüt ion of the
 Ünitcd States for the ratificatißn
 of the several States and
 ot the question of State
 secession from the Fcderal Union
 bc reitrred to a select
 conunittee to be appo nted
 by tliC Speaken and that
 such coininittco be instructed to
 inquire into and report by
 bill or by proposing an
 amcndment or amendments to the
 Constitution of the United States
 or otherwise upon such subject
 and particularly whether any further
 legislation or a nendmcut to
 the Constitution ig necessary to
 give prompt certain and full
 cffcct to the fast clause
 of the second section of
 the föurtli article of the
 Constitution concerning the return of
 fugitives from service and labor
 The temper of the House
 did not seem to bc
 favorable to the adoption of
 this amendment and hcncc it
 was exciuded by a motion
 for thc provi it which
 I was quiescent as I
 ous question agtccd with the
 gent eman from Virginia in
 the general purpose of his
 resolution With regard to the
 personality of the comrnit tee
 I have nothing to say
 in censure or in criti
 I am persuaded that cism
 On the contrary every member
 of che committee will act
 in a spirit of patriotism
 and for the best interests
 of the country The crisis
 demands it and the corn
 miltee cannot fall short of
 its dcmands without incurrino an
 onerous responsibility to history and
 to posterity They arc charged
 with the solemn and transcendent
 duty of providi0ff for the
 ptos crvation of tho Government
 itself and according as they
 may perform that duty they
 will be applauded or condemned
 Of the chairman of the
 committcc thc honor able qcntlcman
 from Ohio Mr Conw1N it
 will be enough to say
 that he is a statesman
 of great experience and public
 reputation and that in iustice
 to his own fame as
 well as to the country
 he will do his best
 to preserve both from injury
 Differing from him as I
 do upon almost every question
 of internal policy and particularly
 upon the slavery question I
 am frank to say this
 of him O the distinguished
 gentleman from Vir ginia Mr
 MILLSON I may say that
 hc is as disinterested as
 he is firm and as
 patriotic as ho I have
 the wise I have no
 fears of hiln utmost confidence
 in his moderation and integrity
 a confidence that is thc
 growth of fifteen years expericnce
 and observation Like Aristides he
 is a moral hero capable
 of watching by the flickering
 torches of night upon the
 battle field the priceless spoil
 wrung from a vanquished foe
 untempted and unawed When the
 question of secession comes up
 in a pi actical form
 I will be prepared to
 takc my po sition upon
 it in the view of
 the House and of tho
 nation and having taken it
 will endeavor to maintain it
 to the utmost of my
 limited influence and by all
 the legitimate means in my
 power Until then i will
 forbear to enter into it
 preferring rather to obey the
 dictate of the scriptural proverb
 which dictates t hat 4
 sumcient unto the day is
 the I will only say
 now that no more evil
 thereof fearful question could c
 vage the attention of this
 body It discloses to my
 vision a boundless sea of
 horrors Peaceable secession in my
 judgment is a fatal a
 deadly illusion T hc Government
 in itself may be weak
 comparatively weak but it is
 strong in the moral sentiment
 and patriotic feel ing of
 the country In this respect
 it is or at least
 ough t to be the
 strongestGovernmentin the world for it
 is t he most beneficent
 one in the world Bound
 together as one people by
 a common lan guage a
 common religion common rivers mount
 ains and lakes civil war
 alone in my opinion can
 sunder us into broken fragments
 a tremen dous civil war
 such a war as would
 choke our rivers with carnacre
 and discolor our inland seas
 with human blood such a
 vy tu as never before
 fattened the earth with human
 slaughter It would not be
 awar in whiéh Greek met
 Greek but Anglo Saxon Anglo
 Saxon father son and brother
 brother I their whole vote
 is one million five hundred
 and If I am asked
 why so I retort the
 question how can it be
 otherwise How are the questions
 of public debt public archives
 public lands and other public
 property and above the ques
 tions of boundary to be
 settled Will it be re
 plied that while we arc
 muti_tally unwilling now to yield
 anything we will be Inutually
 willing afterawhile to concede everything
 That while we mutually refuse
 to concede anything now fpr
 tho sake of national unity
 we Will be mutually ready
 to concede cvcrything by and
 by for thc sake of
 national duality Who believes this
 What too would be the
 fate of the youthhll I
 but giant Northwest in thc
 event ofa separation of the
 slaveholding from the non slaveholding
 States Cut off from the
 main Mississippi and the Gulf
 of Mexico on one hand
 or from the cast ern
 Atlantic ports on the other
 she would grad ually sink
 into a pastoral State and
 to a standard of national
 inferiority This the hardy and
 ad vcnturous millions of the
 Northwest would be unwilling to
 consent to This they would
 not do Rather would they
 to the last man perish
 upon the battle field No
 power on earth could restrain
 them from freely and unconditionally
 communi cating with the Gulf
 and the great mart of
 New York Any attempt to
 prevefit them from doing so
 would be as vain as
 the attempt to stay thc
 rushing waters of the great
 father of rivers by a
 fisherman s net or to
 restrain the irresistible ex pansion
 of steam by an egg
 shell Of themselves rather would
 they say No pent up
 Utica contracts onr powers For
 the whole boundless continent is
 ours rhcgentleman from Florida Mr
 HAWKINS has alluded to the
 fact that the northwestern nay
 the whole northern Democracy are
 excluded from any representation on
 the committec of thirty three
 and has urged that as
 one reason why he should
 be excused from serving on
 the commit I appreciate the
 gentleman s motives in al
 tcc luding to this act
 of injustice and sincerely thank
 Ilin i for his generous
 and manly condemnation of it
 yet the very reason hc
 urges for asking to be
 excused is the very one
 why I will vote against
 It is important that some
 Dcmo excusing him crats should
 be upon the committee and
 if north ern ones cannot
 be at least let southern
 ones be This is my
 view of the matter and
 if in carry ing it
 out I should seem to
 act ungraciously I hope the
 gentleman from Florida will pardon
 me For Ine now 1101
 to notice thc slight thrown
 upon 111 y constituents in
 the orQyanizut ion of this
 committee would be to show
 myself less jealous of their
 rights and honor than the
 gentleman from i would be
 Florida has showrn himself to
 be recreant to duty if
 I did not do so
 Indeed if he had not
 brought the matter to the
 notice of the House and
 the country I would have
 done it The committee of
 thirty three as an extrao
 dinary measure x vas called
 for in thc languaoe of
 the resolution raising it by
 the perilous con sixty four
 thousand six hundred and fifty
 showing that the vote of
 the northern Democracy alone is
 greater than that which clected
 éither Pierce or Buchanan and
 is larger than that ever
 before polled in any presidential
 election And how is it
 with the other political torgani
 zations in the country Let
 facts speak for them selves
 With a popular vote according
 to die same returns of
 five hundred and eighty thoti
 sand two hundred and forty
 nine in the same election
 the Union party is represented
 by thrée i of its
 members on the committee With
 a popu lar vote of
 six hundred and seventy five
 thou sand seven hundred and
 eighty two the Breckin ridge
 party is represented by six
 members while the Republican party
 comparatively with but few more
 Votes aggregately than the national
 Democracy and no votes in
 most of the slave holdinø
 States and only twenty six
 thousand five hundred and eight
 votes in all of them
 is represented by fourteen members
 The gentle man from Tennessee
 Mr MAYNARD corrects me by
 saying there are sixteen If
 so then the Republican party
 with only one million eight
 hundred and fbrty six thousand
 two hundred and three votes
 is represented by sixteen mem
 bers whilc all the votes
 opposed to him in the
 late election amounting to two
 million eight hun dred and
 twenty thousand six hundred and
 eighty one are only reprcsentcd
 by eleven member s How
 unjust such constitution of an
 important committee There is no
 parallcl or precedent for it
 in parliamentary history so far
 as f know I can
 only account for such unfairness
 such injus tice by attributing
 it to tho malignity of
 disap pointed personal ambition or
 to a facile surren der
 of official manhood to party
 dictation or to the implacable
 resentmentof the Republican party to
 their uncompromising political opponents in
 the Democratic ranks of the
 North In this way only
 can account for it If
 it be answered that California
 and Oregon are renrcsentcd on
 lic committcc by Democrats then
 answer in the language of
 friend from Ohio Mr VALLANDIGIIAM
 who has anticipated mc in
 much that I intended to
 say no thanks to the
 Chair for that Those States
 are only repre sented by
 Dcmocrats on this floor and
 there was no other alternative
 thau to appoint a D
 emocrat If therc had been
 they too from each of
 t hem no doubt would
 have been i nored In
 view of the unhappy condition
 of the coun try of
 thc dangers which now threaten
 its very existence I had
 supposed that a powerful and
 victorious party would have raised
 itself to the level of
 tho occasion and forgetting thc
 low am bition of demarrogues
 and thc mean ends of
 party acted as became Americans
 in a spirit of patriot
 ism and for the good
 of the country But in
 this I find myself lamentably
 mistaken I still find that
 thc Republican party is incapable
 of learning dition of the
 country and was designed no
 II anything that its only
 spring of action is party
 doubt by the mover of
 it to combine the influ
 hate and the hope of
 offcial spoils This flagrant act
 of wholesalc proscription is enco
 of every political organization in
 the coun try in favor
 of a satisfactory accommodation of
 no doubt but the inauguration
 of a system of the
 angrv questions n ow agitating
 and distracting the public mind
 Assuming this to be so
 I am more than surprised
 that the northern Democracy arc
 wholly unrepresented on it W
 h v have they been
 thus disfranchised Is it because
 there ace no Democrats here
 from the North to represent
 them Not so there are
 some twenty five or thirty
 Democrats here from the North
 any of whom exclusive of
 myself is worthy of a
 place on the committee and
 capable of asgistincr its counsels
 to a wise determination As
 for myself i I neither
 desired nor expected to be
 placed on the committee What
 then is the cause of
 this offensivc dis crimination Is
 it because in the course
 ofevents the northeL n Democracy
 have become insignifi It cant
 in numbers and influence I
 deny it sir is true
 they were defeated in the
 late presidential I election but
 they are not conquered Dema
 gogism fraud and corruption have
 overcome them for the time
 but only for the time
 What I ever may be
 the issue of our present
 national troubles they will soon
 reffttin an ascendency Although defeated
 in the latc electi0Yl they
 polled according to official and
 unofficial returns one million three
 hund rod and forty three
 thousand i proscription of which
 tho northern Democracy are to
 be made the especial victims
 And whatis our offense in
 the eyes of Republicanism that
 we have stood unfalteringly by
 the Consti tution and the
 rights of property as guarantie
 d by it This is
 the head and front of
 our offend ing and for
 this the accumulated wrath of
 eight years disappointment is now
 about to be launched upon
 our devoted heads by a
 vindictive ahd merciless party Yet
 wc ure told that our
 friends of the South whose
 battles we have been fight
 ing are now about to
 desert usin the hour of
 Our extremity by withdrawing from
 the Union will not bclicve
 it until I am forced
 to do so I will
 not believe this of the
 gallant and generous I will
 not believe it of Illinois
 men of the South neighbors
 Kentucky and Missouri Neither wili
 I believe itof old Virginia
 nor of Maryland nor of
 Tennessee the home of the
 immortaÄ Jackson nor of any
 of the southern States If
 they are wronged let them
 seek redress in the Union
 first by all lawful methods
 and next if necessary by
 other means but still as
 members of the Con federacy
 Let them do this and
 we will still I stand
 by them in the right
 as of yore Aban doning
 us however to our fate
 what must be one hundred
 and eighty four votes and
 including i I our revulsion
 of feeling towards the South
 I will not undertake to
 say only so far as
 to predict I the vote
 of the national Democracy in
 the South 40 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 10 that it
 would consolidate the two sections
 sev eraåly against each other
 in fierce and unrelent ing
 strife Then _let us hasten
 while it is not yet
 too late to averbso lamentable
 axesult and to Savo the
 Union if possible by mutual
 conciliation and concession Let us
 adjust all the jarring differences
 of the sections forever eithG
 by law or if necessary
 by an amendment of thex
 Constitution upon just and equitable
 principles Let us do this
 and provo that we are
 still capable of self government
 In my humble opinion this
 Government what ever may be
 its faults is worth more
 to the cause of human
 progress than all the property
 and ail the lives ofrthe
 people now within its jurisdiction
 In myjudgmcn t it would
 be better for the human
 race that both people and
 proporty had been in stantly
 destroyed by the hand of
 Omnipotent power and it continue
 to move in the fulfillment
 of its glorious mission than
 for it to be destroycd
 and we and our property
 continue to be In excluding
 a million and a half
 of northern Democrats from any
 representation on the cotil mittee
 the Republican party have proclaimcd
 entire responsibility so far ns
 the North is con cerrwd
 for the action or non
 action of the com mittcc
 If disunion and civil war
 should follow as the consequence
 of their persistent and doff
 matica l adherence to their
 anti slavery proviso and to
 their opposition to thc principles
 or details of the fugitive
 slave law the consequences will
 be on their heads not
 on ours Mr SICKLES Mr
 Speaker 1 will not be
 guilty of the presumption of
 supposing that any thing that
 I can _say by way
 of appeal to the gen
 tleman from Florida will change
 his deliberate determination or that
 anythino I can address personally
 to tho House will influence
 the vote tfpon this question
 but I have believed sir
 as my distinguished collcaoue Mr
 TOHN COCK RÆNEbthought the other
 åay tl lat the gentleman
 from 4 lorida and the
 members at least upon this
 side of the House would
 listen to an appeal in
 the nzune of the city
 of New York and it
 is sir as a Representative
 of that city in the
 hope of giving expression to
 something or the dccp and
 universal solicitude which pervades the
 heart of that metropolis in
 this great crisis that I
 would venture for a moment
 to claim the attention of
 the House Sir the Constitution
 under which we live was
 in auguratcd in that city
 from the lips of Washington
 One of the carliest votes
 she gave was for Thomas
 Jefferson and the vote of
 that city decided thc election
 of Mr Jcfl e rson
 and therein the föund ation
 of the Democratic party She
 sustaihed throughout the administration of
 Madison When treason lifted its
 head in other quarters no
 voice but Ohe voice of
 patriotism and loyalty was al
 losvcd to pass her borders
 She sustained the admin istration
 of Jackson th rough all
 its struggles throughout all the
 grave controversies which then imperiled
 the Union of these States
 She has never given a
 vote that has looked to
 one section in disparagement of
 another Every instinct every thought
 cvcry purpose of the City
 of New York is as
 her record pro ves national
 patriotic It is in tbc
 naune t American of such
 a people with such a
 record that I would venture
 to appeal to men on
 all sides of this Chamber
 for that moderation that devotion
 to duty yea even the
 self sacrifice qvhich are necessary
 in this crisis Mr Speaker
 one of the great dangers
 of the day is that
 the country has not understood
 and does not understand the
 extent of the peril in
 which it is placed Illusions
 have usurped tl iC place
 of reason in the popular
 mind These il lusions beguile
 us for the moment only
 to plunge us into graver
 situations Does any man on
 this floor suppose that it
 in the month of October
 the masses of the North
 have realized what they now
 see to be the sad
 truth we would stand now
 where we are on the
 verge of dissolu tion No
 man who knows the American
 people has the crcdufity to
 believe that The country has
 been fatally deceived and some
 of thesc illusions possess us
 even now One of thcm
 is sition yet at last
 the strong arm of power
 will interpose and stay the
 Work I for One Mr
 Speaker have never for a
 moment entertained such a thought
 It is not the belief
 or opinion of the people
 whom I represent and I
 must say to you in
 all solemnity that while thc
 city of New York will
 cling to tho Union to
 the last while she will
 look on the last hour
 of its ex istence as
 we would upon the setting
 sun if we were never
 to see it more yet
 when the call for force
 comes let it come whence
 it may no man will
 ever pass the boundaries of
 the city of New fork
 for the purpose of waginm
 war against any State of
 this Union which through its
 consti tuted authorities and sustained
 by the voice of its
 people solemnly declares that its
 rights its inter ests and
 its honor demand that it
 should seek safety in a
 separate existence I mean by
 that sir not to class
 myself among those who do
 not love the Union for
 it has no more loyal
 citizens than those of tho
 city of New York for
 whom I under take to
 speak to day I simply
 mean to discharge my duty
 in endeavoring to contribute something
 towards dispelling the hallucination that
 exists in many places yes
 sir in distinguished places that
 the Union is to be
 preserved by armies Sir the
 Union can be madc perpetual
 by justice but it cannot
 be maintained an instant by
 forcc If that truth had
 been graven deep in the
 hearts of the people North
 East and West and led
 to the conscientious recognition of
 constitutional obligations all would have
 been well and until these
 truths are recoghized throughout the
 land we cannot have peace
 I look upon secession as
 the last dread alter native
 of a free State whcn
 it has to choose between
 liberty and injustice In our
 Federal system the recognized right
 of secession is a conservative
 safeguard is the highest constitutional
 and moral guarantee against injustice
 and therefore if it had
 been always and universally acknowl
 edged as a rightful remedy
 it would have contrib uted
 more than all else to
 perpetuate the Union I by
 compelling the observance of all
 their obliga tions on the
 part of ail the States
 The oppo site dogma which
 is so extensively believed at
 ihe North that no matter
 what wrongs a State rnay
 have to endure it may
 and ou ht to be
 com pellcd by force tö
 remain in the nion even
 as a conquered dependency IS
 a most dangerous error in
 our system of government and
 has con tributed largely to
 tile existing anarchy Another illusion
 Mr Speaker is that the
 re sponsibility of dealing with
 this crisis and thc power
 to deal with it is
 in thc South I do
 not so understand it They
 have their share of re
 sponsibility Deep and heavy it
 is I am sure and
 nonc are more sensible of
 it than they who carry
 thc burden I have no
 doubt they will act in
 full view of all their
 just responsibilities But sir the
 southern Representatives on this floor
 cannot if they would no
 r natter What personal sacrifices
 they may deem it their
 duty to make arrest the
 Inovement which has already enlisted
 the support of the great
 masses of the southern people
 certainly the greater part of
 the popula tion of several
 Important States and sufficient to
 precipitate the most dreadful events
 upon us i I bclicve
 tne people of the city
 of Né w York believe
 that the responsibility of dealing
 with the existino state of
 things and the power to
 deal with it effectively rest
 alone on the Repub lican
 leaders on those who have
 just achieved through the recent
 election power in the Federal
 Government on those who control
 by over whelming majorities the
 Legislatures of Ilorther_n States There
 the responsibility rests The coun
 try will place it there
 Europe and America will place
 it there history will place
 it there What ever the
 consequence may be in the
 judgment of history and in
 the estimation of posterity they
 will bc held responsible I
 think the country will regard
 the absolute silence which they
 have thus far preserved as
 at least contemptuous if not
 reckless of the dearest interests
 of the nation But that
 is a question for them
 to consider When the pioneer
 sees the billows of flame
 rolling over the burning prairie
 hc does not waste slave
 already hears across the border
 the whis poring emissary of
 insurrection who has been suffered
 unrebuked to proclaim his infamous
 plots aloud in the streets
 and churches of the North
 now when the family and
 fireside appeal for protection is
 this a time to ask
 the representatives of southern States
 to abandon their measures of
 self defense and resume the
 weary task of per suading
 the demagogues and the fanatics
 of ot her States to
 undo the irreparable wrong which
 has been committed No no
 Let the representa tives of
 the agcressive States at the
 other end of the Capitol
 and here speak to their
 people Let the Legislatures of
 the northern States be con
 vened and let them act
 Let the sealed lips of
 the Medusa head at Springfield
 be opened and send back
 to their caverns the mad
 winds which are driving our
 good ship of State to
 destruction Again I say those
 who are responsible in this
 crisis must not be allowed
 to hide themselves nor to
 shrink from their duty We
 must keep stead ily in
 our eyes those wit h
 whom the power rests to
 rescue the country from its
 peril and therefore I do
 not concur in some of
 the criticisms which have been
 made upon the organization of
 this com mittee by the
 Speaker i would have been
 pleased to see the honofable
 gcntleman from Ohio who last
 addressed the House Mr VALLANDIGHAM
 upon the committcc I would
 be pleased to see the
 distinguished gentleman fro l Illinois
 Mr MCCLERNAND likewise upon the
 committee My constituents would have
 been glad to be assured
 of their knowledge their assiduity
 their patriot ism in the
 councils of that committee but
 these gentlemen unf ortunately are
 not in a position to
 speak for the Legislatures of
 Obio and Illinois and I
 think it was the part
 of wisdom I think it
 was eminently proper and just
 in the Speaker to place
 upon that committee leading members
 of the dominant party of
 this House and of the
 country and especially was it
 right to place upon that
 com mittee from every State
 men identified with the party
 that controls the legislation of
 such State So far as
 this has been done by
 the Speaker I am prepared
 to commend his action in
 the discharge of his diflicult
 and delicate duty It is
 suggested to me as a
 cheering sign that none of
 the gentlemcn on the Republican
 side of thc chamber have
 asked to be excused from
 ser vice on this committee
 it is regarded as an
 evi dence that they are
 willing to meet the issue
 that they are prepared to
 deal with the questions of
 the day one way or
 the other that they are
 prepared to confer with their
 people at home and see
 if there be such assurance
 of concession as will be
 just to the South and
 will enable us to go
 on Lo gether as one
 people or whether on the
 other hand it is impossible
 to preserve peace between the
 sections that ther is no
 hope left for the Con
 federacy that the party controlling
 the legislation of the northern
 States is willing to take
 the re sponsibili ty before
 God and the country of
 break ing up the Confederacy
 rather than tolerate sla very
 within the Union I arn
 glad therefore that these gentlemen
 have been placed upon this
 com mittee If were to
 allow myself to make any
 criticism upon the composition of
 the committee it would be
 the expression of a regret
 that gentle men even more
 prominent more ultra if you
 will more closely identified with
 the real life and strength
 of Ibe Republican party were
 not placed upon it I
 would like to see in
 this House and in the
 Senate committees composed largely of
 men who are authorized to
 speak for the Repub lican
 party of men who are
 intimate in the coun sels
 of the President elect of
 men whose voice is potential
 in the Legislatures of their
 respective States and then if
 they are willing to bring
 be fore this Congress a
 report recommending meas ures which
 gentlemen from the South can
 accept and go horne to
 their constituents and ask them
 to accept there is some
 prospect at least some possibility
 of from this crisis with
 dig nit y with success
 and with honor Othcrwisc there
 is none The sad question
 that we would have alone
 to consider then would be
 how to terminate this work
 which was so gloriously begun
 and which has been thus
 far so success that this
 Union can be preserved by
 force men the precious moments
 in a hopeless struggle fully
 conducted believe that although wc
 may be at thc moment
 I against the intangible foe
 but he hastens to his
 Mr Speaker I hear a
 great deal said of propo
 menaced by disunion and although
 incipient cabin and gathering around
 hill his family sitions to
 amend the Constitution I trust
 that movements toward it may
 be attemptcd without Icads them
 to a place of security
 So the South there may
 be some reason to expect
 justice and interference and may
 be _ perbaps brought to
 when the cry of extermination
 acrainst their in conciliation through
 that channel But sir for
 the very verge of consummation
 without oppo stitutions has reached
 their frontiers when the one
 I have a deep distrust
 of the capacity of this
 1860 generation and especially of
 any of the men of
 the Republican party from whom
 the denuncia tions of the
 present Constitution have Come to
 make a Constitution that shall
 succeed where the genius the
 wisdom and the patriotism of
 Wash ington and Madison and
 Hamilton faited Nay more sir
 what is the rbal cause
 of our present trouble It
 is a disregard of the
 obliga tions of our Constitution
 Obey this Constitu tion that
 we have follow it cherish
 it cleave to it as
 an article of faith and
 you will have peace If
 that had been done always
 this crisis never would have
 come upon us But if
 there be not enough of
 conscience among the people to
 obey the Constitution made sacred
 by the inspi ration of
 our fathers where will you
 look for the sanctions that
 wikl preserve inviolate a Constitu
 tion manufactured by Giddings and
 SEWARD and SUMNER Sir I
 despair of seeking in the
 North any public conscience that
 would have more rev ereue
 for the x vork of
 this generation than for the
 work of the men of
 the heroic age of the
 Re Again I say that
 one of the great evils
 of the times is the
 obdurate refusal to recvnize the
 bind inm force of constitutional
 provisions The peo ple have
 been taught this by reckless
 leaders now m power in
 most of the States and
 soon to claim the power
 of the Federal Government and
 I re peat t l
 H1t it is upon thorn
 that thc responsibility rests in
 this emergency They have striven
 in speeches and essays elaborately
 prepared by the midnight lamp
 to alienate the North and
 the South These insidious appeals
 arc often written or revised
 by those who believe that
 private opin ion is superior
 to constitutional obligations the hiryher
 law put forth here and
 sent from this Cap itol
 in untold millions to undermine
 the founda tions of fraternal
 good faith Thus sir by
 teach ing untrutti to the
 people they have been made
 to believe that their consciences
 were not bound by the
 Constitution or the law of
 the land In the nan
 e of Heaven how idle
 it is to talks in
 the face CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 41
 present state of affairs has
 bccn the desire for power
 on the part of a
 new party and the belief
 that they could most successfully
 obtain it by an appeal
 to thc prejudices of the
 North against sla It is
 power very It is power
 that they want that they
 have secured It is power
 that they wish to keep
 Patriotism will sway many of
 Mr Lincoln s supporters but
 the thirst for power will
 control more Now sir to
 illustrate what think with refcrcnce
 to tlie controlling motives which
 are producing this state of
 ihings be lieve that if
 Mr Lincoln would cause It
 to be madc to all
 the applicants for offce under
 Ilis Administration that he will
 not entertain he application of
 any man who is in
 favor of the so called
 personal libcrty bills or opposed
 to the faithful execution of
 the fugitive slave law if
 he will do that plainly
 and in good faith through
 his representative men you will
 not hear the word slavery
 for the next four years
 from the Republican party North
 East or West In this
 remark I protest that I
 mean only an illustration of
 what I believe to be
 the real power of the
 leaders in this anti slavery
 crusade and of their ability
 to control those who direct
 the legislation and the organization
 of the Republican party The
 rank and file many of
 them have public indignation from
 bfeakingi1i t9tUmultand revolution Regiment after
 regimenti artillery infantry and cavalry
 have beenarrayed to over awe
 the fierce passions which tyrannical
 legislation aroused among the multitude
 Of Otu cibizens But the
 reverence of the peopiO for
 constitu tional obligations yet remained
 and they have submitted year
 after year When that restraint
 shall no longer exist when
 the obligation Of t höse
 constitutional provisions which forbid the
 divi Sion of ti State
 without its own consent Shall
 be suspended then I tell
 you that imperial city will
 throw off the odious government
 to which She now yields
 a reluctant allegiance she will
 repel i the hateful cabal
 at Albany which has so
 long abused its powerover her
 and vith her own Aag
 sustained by the couraoe and
 devotion of heu own gallant
 sons she will as a
 free e ily open wide
 her gates to the civilization
 and commerce of the world
 Mr Speaker I have not
 presumed that any words which
 I could address to the
 House would influence its action
 and I did not intend
 to oc cupy so much
 of the time of the
 House But I thought it
 right to make known what
 believe to be the convictions
 of my constituents I thought
 it right and becoming that
 some further expres other and
 more disinterested motives than the
 I Sion of the sentiment
 of the city of New
 York not pursuit of office
 but the men v zho
 will seek office only upon
 the dangers but upon the
 illusions of in the Republican
 party are the men who
 control its movements everywhere its
 public expressions It is only
 necessary to and its public
 action make them understand that
 they must go to work
 and rescue the country from
 tho peril to w hich
 it has been brought by
 some of their own leaders
 so that they may have
 a Treasury and a Blue
 Book left from which thercare
 offces to distribute and patronage
 to bestow and then sir
 you will escape the perils
 of dissolution by the very
 means through which the evil
 has been brought upon us
 and not until then NOW
 sir as to the attitude
 of the city of New
 York She will cling to
 this Union while there isa
 hope left for its presérvation
 andshc will hold all men
 toa just accountability for whatever
 woe shall tion when none
 of those who foldow the
 leaders I refer to care
 whether it is obeyed or
 not What I betide the
 Confederacy but when there is
 no a mockery it would
 be to go before the
 Legisla ture of a State
 which has a personal liberty
 bill upon its statute books
 and ask them foran amend
 ment to the Constitution When
 men will keep such laws
 in force after they have
 taken a solemn oath before
 high Heaven to support the
 Consti tution could you believe
 any pledge they can make
 Would you allow them to
 deface by in amendments the
 symmetry of a Con stitution
 which they have boastfully and
 defiantly violated Such men are
 well fitted to destroy a
 nation they cannot save it
 they will not give it
 peace No sir tho work
 must oegin deeper than that
 The same teachers who have
 led the minds of the
 people to this unbelief the
 same leaders who have enticed
 the pcople up to the
 work of demolishing the existing
 Constitution must again revive in
 their hearts the conscience that
 will préerve and obey a
 Constitution The Democratic party can
 sentatives and Senators cannot do
 thi for wb have in
 every canvass from every hustings
 from every newspaper and through
 every legitimate channel warned the
 people ayainst the conse quences
 of the course which they
 have been pur suing There
 is no need therefore for
 expres si ons or guarantees
 or concessions from that quarter
 but the country will look
 acain and again and will
 never cease to look to
 the leaders of the dominant
 party in this country for
 the measures for the teachings
 for the appeals which will
 prevent the demon of anarchy
 from making havoc in our
 land Mr Speaker why may
 not the President elect speak
 to the nation and especially
 to his sup porters in
 the aggressive States He is
 secure There is no now
 as was suggested some time
 ago that he might lose
 his oflice by open ing
 his lips The electoral colleges
 have qnet and their votes
 cannot be recalled Sir I
 hope that it is not
 beneath the dignity of the
 occasion or the gravity of
 the subject for me to
 sugffest an illustration of my
 view in respect of the
 iriflu ence which could be
 exercised by words of con
 among the chief causes which
 have produced the longer a
 Union proud as she is
 and has been always of
 her position as its metropolis
 ready to bury everything like
 sectional prejudice ready always to
 contribute in all things to
 maintain its honor and preserve
 its integrity at home and
 abroad yet sir when this
 Union is no more she
 will never consent to re
 nain an appendage and a
 slave ofa Puritan province Shc
 will assert her own independence
 North will then see and
 feel that secession although it
 rnay begin at the South
 will not end at the
 South Sir there is no
 sympat hy now between the
 city and the State of
 New York not the least
 nor has there been for
 years The city of New
 York is now a subju
 gated dependency of a fanatical
 and puritanical State government that
 never thinks of the city
 except to send its tax
 gatherers amonff us Or to
 impose upon us hatcfui officials
 alien to our in teresls
 and sympathies to eat up
 tbc substance of the people
 by their legalized extortions Such
 are thc relations which liave
 existed for years between the
 city of New York and
 the State ever since the
 pres6n t dominant party in
 thatState has been in power
 That party has a standingarmy
 of police men in our
 city which we have to
 pay for its Le I
 gislature has forced upon us
 taxation to the amount of
 millions to maintann a State
 government which never approaches us
 except to oppress us Be
 tween such communities there can
 bc no sympa thy no
 feeling of fraternity no loyalty
 in the city to the
 State and nothing has prevented
 the city of New York
 from asserting her right to
 govern herself except that provision
 of the Federat Con slitution
 which prohibits a State from
 being di vided withoutits own
 consent If we had not
 been thus restrained by the
 Constitution and every word of
 it is sacred to us
 we would long ago in
 the day should be made
 I shall be very reluctant
 to give a vote that
 will constrain the gentleman from
 Florida against his better judgment
 to serve upon this committee
 I shall regret in any
 form to compel agentlcman to
 occupy a position when he
 states it to be his
 sin cere belief that he
 cannot render any good service
 there and yet should deplore
 to see any State unrepresented
 upon that committee The hopes
 and the fears of those
 whose solicitude is now occupied
 with the condition of this
 country will go to the
 council chambcrs of that committee
 The rights the interests and
 the opinions of every State

 Whilc I cannot of course
 permit myself to criticise the
 judgment which the gentleman from
 Florida places upon his own
 duty yet J cannot bring
 myself to believe that _it
 ßÆonsistent with the obligations resting
 upon every State or that
 it is consistent with the
 duties we yet ovc to
 each other that any State
 should through its Repre sentativc
 refuse to contribute at least
 his time his attention hi

 connection with the Representatives of
 associate States to devise sonle
 mode by which we can
 be extricated from our present
 danger Sir as a single
 star cannot be displaced from
 the constellation above us without
 destroying the equilibrium of the

 without a fearful disregard of
 duty displace one star from
 that committee 10 which perhaps
 tho very des tinies of
 the Union arc committed Fully

 NOTE BILL Mr SHERMAN Mr
 Speaker it is not my
 purpose to in this debate
 but it is neces sary
 to pass to day a
 Treasury note bill in order
 to relieve the pressing necessities
 of the Govern 1 hope
 therefore that without objection ment
 we may put upon its
 passarc a bill for that
 pur pose which am instructed
 to report from the Committee
 of Ways and Means Mr
 CRMVFORD The gentleman from Ohio
 accordance with the desire of
 three fourths of our pcople
 have sought in independence the
 only I will remember that
 I desire to offer amendments
 escape from the oppression which
 has been put offering those
 amendments I have no objection
 to its boing considered at
 any time that suits the
 upon us What I say
 to you now is no
 new thought in the city
 cf New York It has
 bccn the cherished chairman of
 tho Committee of Ways and
 Means theme of otu citizens
 for years past Our city
 Mr SHERMAN I have no
 objection to a had upon
 the amendments I shdll as
 has been brought to the
 very verge of anarchy vote
 being and civil war by
 the oppressions and insults of
 a matter of course vote
 against them Mr CRAWFORD so
 1 understand the State government
 armed men havebeen mar shaled
 in the streets night and
 day to prevent the I
 Mr SHERMAN I ask unanimous
 consent 42 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 December 10 to bill and
 that it be considered at
 this time There being ho
 objection a bill to authorize
 tho issue of Treasury notes
 and for other purposes was
 read a first and second
 time by its title The
 bill was then read in
 ectenso It author izes the
 issue under the usual regulations
 and up to 1863 of
 Treasury notes for such sums
 as the exigencies of the
 public service may require not
 at any time to exceed
 the amount of 10 000
 000 and of denominations not
 less than 100 Mr SHERMAN
 Mr Speaker the House will
 perceive that the bill now
 before us is a mere
 temporary expedient to provide fop
 the pressing demands upon the
 Treasury Most of the mem
 bers re aware that the
 Government has not Keen able
 to pay for the last
 week or two our own
 Salaries and many other demands
 at New York and other
 places The revenues have fallen
 short during the iast week
 amounting I believe to but
 250 000 Most of the
 revenues are now paid in
 r reasury notes This bill
 authorizes the issue of 10
 000 000 of Treasury notes
 for temporary purposes It docs
 not increase the public debi
 It only provides a mode
 of paying outstanding Treasury notes
 The amount of Treasury notcs
 now outstanding is indeed in
 oxcess ofthe amount authorized by
 this bill so that the
 bill provides for no increasc
 of the public debt might
 here rcst what I have
 to say about this bill
 but it is proper for
 me to add that it
 will be necessary the House
 very st on and promptly
 to consider some other measures
 of relief On the 1st
 of July last there was
 in thc Treasury 3 629
 206 a balance entirclytoosmall to
 carry on the ordinary operations
 of the rrreasury Durino the
 first quarter of tho fiscal
 year thc expenditures exceeded the
 reccipts some two hundred thousand
 dollars and thero are now
 unpaid appropriations to the amount
 of ten or fifteen millions
 The receipts during the cu
 rrentquarten will prob ably fall
 short several millions of the
 necessary expenditures and if I
 ve arc to judge froin
 the temper of the limes
 thc distress in hc country
 and the politicai difficulties that
 surround us it is probable
 that during the remaining three
 quarters of this fiscal year
 there wilt be a dcficicncy
 of from ten to fiftee
 n million dollars This is
 not the fault of this
 House but it is the
 fault of our revcnuc laws
 For the last three years
 we have been living uporr
 the credit of the Government
 I have a pa per
 before me showing that since
 the 1st of July 1857
 we have been going in
 debt to the extent of
 nearly fifty million dollars In
 the fiscal year June 1858
 the dcficicncy or cxcess of
 payments over revcnuc amounted to
 27 162 188 In the
 next fiscal year it amounted
 to 15 902 932 l
 uring the last fiscal year
 if amounted to the sum
 of 6 725 000 and
 according to the statement alrcady
 made during the present fiscal
 year tl hC deficiency has
 been hot less than from
 fifteen to twenty million dollars
 I have prepared a state
 ment which shows at a
 glance the changed condi tion
 of state of our finances
 in three ycars On the
 1st day of July 1857
 the ent lre dcbt of
 Governrncnt after thc balance then
 in the Treasury was 63
 as follows Publié debt 90
 Balance in l reasury 27
 63 On thc 1st day
 or July 1858 order to
 preserve the credit of the
 Government States that this or
 any other loan bill should
 pass Unded debt was l

 in Treasury On the Ist
 day of July fuudcd debt

 day of July 1860 funded

 It is manifest therefore 00
 3 629 206 00 oo
 ought to make some change
 in the revenuc laws or
 to decrease the expenditures W
 c must cither by a
 bold stroke reduce tho expenditures
 to fifteen or twenty million
 dollars or contract new loans
 or raise new revenues The
 bill now pending in the
 Senate I need not inform
 the members of the House
 authorizes a loan of some
 20 000 000 and in
 addition to that pro vides
 for increasing the revenue If
 that bill should pass and
 if the present disturbed political
 condition of the country be
 healed up then the annual
 revenue xvould amply cover our
 expendi tures upon thc basis
 of existing laws and salaries
 but with the present diflieulties
 and with our prcsent revenue
 laws it is manifest that
 this bill will not bc
 the last loan bill or
 the last Treasury note bill
 that the Committee of Ways
 and Means will have to
 report to the House The
 provisions of the bill are
 similar to the provisions of
 the act of 1857 It
 simply authorizes a temporary loan
 and provides that that part
 of the loan authorized by
 the act of 22d June
 last not already contracted for
 shall be applied to the
 redemption of out standing Treasury
 notes This is all the
 state ment that I desire
 to make Mr CRAWFORD 1
 have two amendments which I
 desire to present to this
 bill and I want a
 votc of the House on
 each of them separately The
 first amendment I propose to
 have inserted in the third
 section of tho bill and
 in these words And thc
 public lands of these United
 States arc specifi cally plcdged
 to such paytnent and redem
 ption It is herc by
 mado the duty of thc
 Secretary of tbc Ilreasury to
 set apart and apply all
 rnoneys which may be received
 into the Treasury from the
 sales of public lands from
 the 1st day of January
 1861 to such payunent and
 redcrnption until all thc notes
 issued under the present authority
 shall bc entirely paid off
 according to the obligation expressed
 therein I desirc to say
 in support of this amendment
 that I havo bccn at
 all tinws in favor of
 this dis position of thc
 public lands I think it
 is right and proper that
 tho public lands should be
 sot apart for the paymcnt
 of the public debt of
 the country and that they
 should bc used for that
 purpose alone I will say
 to the House in addi
 tion that thcrc are reasons
 now operatincy on in y
 mind lvhich make it the
 more important that we who
 are of the opinion that
 there can be no per
 manent peace between the North
 and South should the more
 rigidly ask of our friends
 of the North who intend
 to do us justice that
 they shall set apart and
 specificallyåppropriatc the money aris ing
 from the sales of public
 lands to meet the public
 debt We do not desire
 in any settlement or negotiation
 that may follow the events
 now pressing upon us to
 be called upon by the
 re maining States to bring
 forward from our States that
 may retire from the Confederacy
 any quota of thc public
 debt so long as the
 agent of the ori ginal
 States shall retain all the
 assets in its hands which
 we hold ought to be
 appropriated for that It is
 for these reasons that I
 desire a purpose vote on
 this amcndmcnt as well as
 for the rea son that
 I bclieve it is the
 proper disposition to makc of
 thc proceeds of Lhc sales
 of the public cven if
 there was no such contingency
 as that to which I
 have alluded Mr PHELPS I
 would suggest to the gentle
 man from Georgia that he
 will accornplish his purpose by
 the first portion of his
 amendment specifically pledging the proceeds
 arising from the sales of
 public lands for the redemption
 of the Treasury notes authorized
 to be issued by this
 act That would accdmplish his
 object without hav ing this
 other matter of detail presented
 which might cause some trouble
 in the appropriation of money
 The money is needed at
 present Mr CRAWFORD 1 cannot
 agree to the proposition of
 the gentlernan from Missouri IS
 that I should strike off
 from the amendment which I
 have proposed all except the
 words specifically pledging the public
 lands to the pay mcnt
 of the debt I propose
 not only to pledge specifically
 the public lands to the
 payment of this debt but
 also to appropriate all the
 money that may bc received
 after the 1st of January
 next from the sales of
 public lands to the payrnent
 of these Treasury notes I
 therefore desire that the vote
 of the House shall be
 first had on the entire
 amendment and if it should
 be defeated then the gentlernan
 from Missouri can offer so
 much of it as he
 has indicated his desire to
 support 1 that the House
 in do not think it
 just to the people of
 the southern and that the
 public lands should be given
 away for purposes of internal
 improvement or to the people
 of the free States for
 homesteads while they are the
 assets of a common Government
 and ought to be appropriated
 to the payment of such
 pubhc debt as may be
 due from these United States
 More particularly is this so
 when it is to be
 expected that in all probability
 the public debt would be
 a subject matter of ne
 gotiation between the retiring States
 and the others Mr McCLERNAND
 1 ask the gentleman i
 from Georgia on what principle
 of public justice and fair
 dealing ho asks that a
 discrirrnnation should be made in
 favor of the debt now
 about to be contracted Mr
 CRAWFORD If the gentleman will
 go back to some of
 the old loan bills passed
 by Con gress hc wihl
 find that the public lands
 havc been specifically pledged for
 the paymentof that debt And
 I say to thc gentleman
 that independent of any action
 which ihe southern States may
 take it is nothing but
 right and proper that in
 the peculiar embarrassment undcr which
 the Treas ury now labors
 we should provide a sufficient
 security so that the notes
 should not be sold be
 low par I believe they
 would be all taken by
 the creditors of the Government
 at par but I think
 that with this additional security
 the notes will pass from
 hand to hand at par
 which would be important So
 much for that amendment I
 do not care to multiply
 remarks on that branch of
 the sub ject But I
 will state now that in
 the fifteen th scction of
 the bill I desire this
 amendment That so much of
 thc act entitled An act
 authorizing a loan and providing
 for the redemption of Treasury
 notes approved June 22 1860
 as empowers the President to
 bor row a sum exceeding
 10 000 000 is hereby
 repealed it being intended that
 the arnount of Treasury notes
 author ized by the present
 act shall take the place
 of said loan beyond the
 sum of already contracted for
 The object of the amcndment
 is this last Junc Congress
 authorized a loan of 20
 000 000 will be remembered
 by the House that on
 the passacrc of that bill
 I desired to have Treasury
 notcs issued instead of having
 a loan contracted The House
 did not agree with me
 on that point and was
 not favorable to thc issuing
 of Treasury I notes The
 consequence was that I was
 forced to take the loan
 bill which passed on the
 22d of June just as
 it had been offered by
 my colleague on the Committee
 of Ways and Means the
 gentleman from Maryland L Mr
 DAVIs If we llåd passed
 then a T 1 easury
 note bill I have been
 informed by the Department that
 the Government could have got
 along without the slightcst cmbarrassment
 but that the loan bill
 did not afford them the
 sarne opportunity of relieving the
 Government of its embarrassments And
 therefore it is that the
 necessity arises now for the
 passage of a Treasury note
 bill or else sacri fice
 10 000 000 of the
 loan bill of the last
 ses sion When I say
 sacrifice I mean that it
 could not bc sold or
 negotiated except at a discount
 much greater than the offccrs
 of the Government would bc
 willing to pay But lam
 informed by the offcers at
 the Treas ury Department that
 with these of Treasury notes
 they will not need for
 thc present the ten or
 eleven million dollars of the
 loan of the last session
 which is still subject to
 the disposal of the Secretary
 of the Treasury and wklich
 he would be authorized at
 any time to negotiate whenever
 it could be done on
 reasonable terms which as I
 have said cannot be done
 at present I therefore propose
 inasmuch as this is to
 be a substitute for the
 remainder of the loan author
 ized in the last session
 that the remainder of that
 loan shall not bc negotiated
 Mr HOUSTON I have no
 particular objection to the bill
 as reported by the Committee
 of Ways and Means I
 have certainly not had an
 oppor tunity of examining it
 as I would like to
 do before voting upon it
 but as at present advised
 I shall vote the bill
 I dc not regard the
 amendment proposed bv the gentleman
 from Georgia as very essential
 in any of its aspects
 I will not hosvever on
 this occa sion attempt to
 discuss the grave questions of
 finance which naturally grow out
 of tbe measure before the
 House wish simply to remark
 to the gentleman from Georgia
 that so far as his
 amendment pledging the public lands
 for the re 43 1860
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE demption of
 these Treasury notes is concerned
 I regard it as entirely
 unimportant Whether the pledge is
 made by the terms of
 the bill or not the
 redemption of such Treasury notes
 as shall be issued will
 rest upon the faith of
 the Government Whenever the Government
 of the United States proposes
 to make a loan in
 any shape of course Its
 täith as well as its
 property of cvcry descrip tion
 stands pledged for the redemption
 of that loan and in
 this case for the Government
 spe cifically to pledge the
 public lands on any other
 description of public property in
 my view adds If under
 any circumstances growing out of
 the existing state of things
 there should bc the result
 of a disruption of the
 Government and a division of
 the States of the Union
 if some of the States
 shall separate from the Government
 as it now exists and
 a negotiation should occur rc
 sulting in a portion of
 the public debt devolving upon
 the seceding States as a
 matter of course all thc
 public lands or assets of
 the Government will be divided
 equally with the debt and
 it is therefore a matter
 of littlc consequence whether we
 pledge the public lands or
 not If the disrup tion
 takes place these things must
 necessarily If in the set
 conform in the act of
 settlernent tlement with the States
 seceding justicc rcquircs sumed by
 them the same principles of
 justice and equity will require
 as well the distribution to
 them of a like portion
 of the property of the
 Gov ernment Hence I regard
 the proposition of the gentleman
 from Georgia as unimportant in
 either aspect in which hc
 has presented it whether as
 these Treasury notes to those
 who may be called upon
 to receive them or in
 view of the threat ened
 disruption of the Union Mr
 CRAWFORD I desire to say
 with the consent of the
 gentleman from Alabama that he
 has taken into consideration in
 his remarks only the first
 portion of my amendment T
 hc second portion of my
 amendment touching the public lands
 requires that all the money
 rcceived into the rl reasury
 after the 1st January 1861
 from the sales of the
 public lands shall be set
 apart for such a provision
 would be well enough but
 in the event of its
 runnin over I do not
 see any object to be
 accomplished by it In that
 view of the case possibly
 the latter part of this
 provision might give greater confidence
 and cause these securities to
 pass without dis count Mr
 Speaker the main purpose for
 which I rose to address
 the House in a few
 remarks on this bill was
 to reply to the suggestion
 of the chairman of the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 Mr SHERMAN and not with
 any view to go into
 a general discussion of our
 revenue and finances I presume
 sir that none of us
 desire to do any I
 understood the chair such thing
 at this time man of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means to state that the
 troubles in the financial operations
 of the Government which now
 secm to impend over us
 grew out of the defects
 in the existing revenue law
 1 may be mistaken because
 I know how difficult it
 is to be heard across
 the Hali Mr SHERMAN The
 gentleman from Ala bama misapprehends
 what I said I said
 that aside from all political
 troubles all political dis tractions
 the revenue now raiscd was
 not sum cicnt to meet
 the expenditurcs of the Government
 that for the last three
 years x ve have been
 con stantly running into debt
 at a time too when
 nobody thought of secession or
 any question of the kind
 and that therefore it was
 necessary either to reduce the
 expenditures or to increase the
 duties on ilnport s in
 order to raise a larger
 revenue That is what I
 said Mr HOUSTON Any change
 of the revenue laws at
 this time sir would not
 only bc futilc as a
 rcmcdy for existi1V pecuniary difficulties
 but it would cvcn be
 ari act of rashness The
 rev enue law under which
 we are now collectincr our
 revenue has existed only for
 three years Shortly after it
 was enacted and became the
 law of the land we
 had a financial crisis which
 reduced the importations from foreicrn
 countries and conse quenlly argety
 curtailed the amount of the
 rev enuc of the Government
 That could not have been
 caused by the change of
 thc law from that which
 existed prior to thc law
 o 1857 for Khe It
 wasa gentleman from Ohio s
 he has since explained himself
 Being an advocate of the
 general prin ciples of the
 laws of 1846 and 185
 7 I was unwill ing
 to sit quietly by and
 permit a remark which I
 undefstood him to have made
 to pass without saying as
 much as I have done
 latter reduced the duties upon
 imports tleman only replied to
 that portion which pledegd relief
 from thc restrictions upon importation
 to the public lands to
 the final redemption or pay
 the extent of that reduction
 and there naturally I desire
 that the fund out of

 it is to be paid

 already referred to cure their

 I do not think there

 growing out of the crisis
 of 1857 which arose my
 friend from Illinois refers and
 I believe there from causes

 emerging from that control while
 sir is a part of

 unpaid while our commerce was

 how much for I have
 not exani depression active and

 my vote may be con

 I friends of the law
 of 1857 could have wished

 of giving grcatcr con at
 that moment we are surrounded
 by poliiical divisions and distractions

 I regard it as I
 and so again diminish the
 revenue of the Govern ment
 While the existincr condition of

 In any event the question
 whether such a pro not

 enacted by Con vision would
 be wise or not depends
 very rnucai grcss 1 do
 not however intend to provoke
 a discus Mr GROW I
 have but a word to
 say inxef ercnce to the
 amendment proposed by thegcntle man
 from Georgia Mr CRAWFORD Before
 saying it sir I wish
 to give tx brief answer
 to remark which fell from
 the gentleman from Ala bama
 Mr I IOUsTON With your
 present scale tures of the
 Government as they have been
 for two or three years
 you must have an im
 portation in one year of
 about four hundred and sixty
 or four hundred and seventy
 million dollars worth of imported
 goods when sir the largest
 importation ever made in one
 year was only 360 000
 000 If then your scale
 stands as it docs now
 you must import into the
 country in order to raise
 sixty five or seventy million
 dollars something about one hundred
 million dollars worth of goods
 more than was imported into
 the country in the most
 prosperous year which upon its
 face would be a suffcient
 argu ment that your present
 revenue system will not meet
 the wants of the country
 under any state of the
 case Yes sir the expenditures
 of the Gov ernment cannot
 be defrayed with the present
 scale of duties unless you
 can increase the importa were
 in the most prosperous year
 and when you do that
 you will bankrupt the country
 in paying for those imported
 goods But to return to
 the amendment of the gentle
 man from Georgia Mr CRAWFORD
 which pro poses to pledge
 the public lands to place
 this as a mortgage upon
 the public lands of the
 country I am opposed to
 looking to the public lands
 as a source of revenue
 I agree With General Jackson
 the country to cease to
 look to thorn as a
 source of revenue I am
 opposcd to it because I
 can see no reason and
 no justice in imposino upon
 the pipneers who settle your
 wildernesses greater hardships than are
 incident to their lot You
 now qompel them under the
 existing land policy of the
 Go vernment cither to the
 specula tor or to the
 Gov ernmen t to pay
 out of their hard earnings
 without tem you have already
 abstracted 1 600 000 000
 fl onl the men who
 people your wildernesses and you
 have not given them an
 iota of equivalent for it
 The day they took the
 lands they were not worth
 any rnore than in the
 hour when they were created
 by God Almighty By the
 land policy of the Government
 sir and by the legislation
 undcr it you have abstracted
 the large amount I have
 stated from their hard earnings
 while you have sent them
 forth to expel the savace
 and lhe wild beast and
 to build up great empires
 in the ization along it
 untrodden paths I agree with
 General Jackson in saying that
 it is time that the
 Govermnent should cease to look
 to the public lands as
 a means of raising revenue
 Thereföre I am opposed to
 any such system as I
 prefer to would put a
 mortgaoe upon them leave them
 within tm discretionary power of
 Congress so that such disposition
 Inay be made and the
 glory of the nation General
 Jackson in his annual messacre
 in 1832 meets the very
 point raised by t hc
 gentleman from Georgia that these
 lands should be set apart
 as a fund and that
 there was an obligation imposed
 upon the Gov sition should
 be made of them which
 is now pro posed If
 there were any lands yet
 to be disposed of which
 were ceded by thc original
 States then it might bc
 worth while to consider that
 point but as very few
 of these lands are left
 even if the upon the
 time other debts arc falling
 due If there I did
 nob understand the I be
 a debt falling due and
 pressing for payment Sion of
 this subject argument were good
 it could not control Con
 gress in its action upon
 lands which were never ceded
 by any of the States
 of the Union And then
 I quote General Jackson even
 if the gentle man s
 position was a good one
 to relievc the gen tlcman
 for I trust he will
 not yet repudiate the authority
 of his wisdom and of
 his counsel to his country
 Speaking upon this very point
 in his message he says
 As the lands Inay now
 be considered as relieved t
 rotn this pledge the object
 fi r which tircy were
 ceded havin r 44 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 10 been
 accomplished it is in the
 discretion of Congress to them
 in such a Way as
 best to conduce to the
 and general interest ofthe American
 peo It cannot be doubted
 that the speedy settlementofthese lands
 constitute the true interests of
 the Republic The wealth and
 strength Of a country are
 its population and the best
 part of that population are
 the cultivators of the soil
 Independent farmers are everywhere the
 basis of society and true
 friends of iberty It seemS
 to me to_ be our
 true policy that the public
 innds shall cease as soon
 as praecicable td be a
 source of revenue and that
 tliey be sold to settlers
 in limited par eels at
 a pricg barely sumcient to
 reimburse to the United States
 the expense of the prescnt
 system and the cost aris
 ing under Our_ Indian compact
 That istthe basis of the
 homestead policy that you shall
 cease to exact from the

 I only quote General Jackson
 to day to show that
 we stand by the old
 hero of the Hermitage whose
 patriotism was no less than
 was the genial warmth of
 his humanity for his country
 and his racc In another
 part of his message he
 says To put an cnd

 should not thc Governmcnt cease

 taken this large amount from

 Mr CRAWFORD I have only
 a word to say in
 reply to the gentlen mn
 frot n Penn ylvama understood
 hinl to say that it
 required Inore than h 11
 nd red iilion dollars at
 the present rate of duties
 to raise sufficient rcvenuo to
 carry on thc Govern n
 cn t 1 had supposed
 fron l what I had
 heard so frequent ly fall
 froin gentlerncn upon that side
 of the floor that when
 they should takc upon themselves
 the administration of the Gov
 they would rcquirc nothing like
 the ernment amount which has
 been required during the Dem
 ocratic Administration Mr GROW 1
 stated was that under thc
 present scale of duties if
 you raisc sixty or nevenly
 rnillion or thereabouts svhich you
 must do if you pay
 the current expenses a good
 deal less than they are
 now and providc for a
 dcbt already incurred you must
 have an importa tion under
 L nc present tariff of
 not less than 450 000
 000 of ilnportcd goods Mr
 CRAWFORD the gentle rnan perfectly
 I knew his position I
 only de sire to say
 in reply to that portion
 of his remarks that I
 have no idea bis party
 will administer the Government for
 less than a hundred million
 if the whole Governrnent is
 administcred But he asks if
 there is any greater injustice
 than to deny to the
 pioneers who go out and
 settle this western country a
 title to the soil upon
 which they can settle I
 think I can seea m
 eater injus tice in taking
 this public land and givino
 it away while its proceeds
 should be used as a
 connnon fund for the purpose
 of carrying on the Govern
 ment and paying its expenses
 General Jackson question has been
 called and sustained I raise
 and his message have been
 brought before the this question
 of order the gcntlcmari from
 Mis House and country by
 thc gentleman from Penn sourimow
 proposes an amcndnaent he proposes
 sylvania I believe on more
 than four occasions to amend
 rny amendmcj t by out
 half of preceding the present
 time and I will say
 that the it that is
 the legitimate effect of his
 motion circumstances under which General
 Jackson made Mr PHELPS Under
 the rules as modified these
 remarks were widely different from
 the cir at the last
 session of Congress I believe
 any cumstances which now surround
 us It would be member
 is entitled to call for
 a division of the much
 more unjust to us that
 the public lands question after
 the previous question has been
 sus should be given away
 and that the tariff of
 duties tained should be raised
 to the very highest possible
 The SPEAKER The rule will
 be read amount and levied
 upon those of us who
 believe The Clerk read the
 rule as follows we pay
 the most of those duties
 To give away 46 Any
 member rnay call for the
 division of a question the
 assets by which the Govcrnmcnt
 is to be sup betorc

 ordered which shaii be divided

 substance so ported to gzve

 and then raise the tariff
 of duties lion shall rennin
 iOr thc decision of the
 House upon us for the
 purpose of carrying on your
 Gov Mr GROW But how
 is this amendment di crnment
 seems to me to be
 an act of greater injus
 visible That is the question
 tice than to refuse a
 more gift to those persons
 who Mr PHELPS 1 for
 a division of the may
 desire to go and settle
 upon the public lands question
 after the main question is
 ordered at the West without
 the paymcnt of money and
 I am entitled to it

 Then vote ay add one

 Good faith to its creditors

 Tbc result of the vote
 having bccn announced word redemption
 w herc it first occurs
 as above recorded the question
 recurred 01 vree Mr CRAWFORD
 It is too late the
 previous i ing to the
 second branch of the amendment
 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE Mr
 HOUSTON presume the second branch
 of t he amendment falls
 with the first Mr MOORE
 of Kentucky move that the
 House do now adjourn Cries
 of No Mr SHERMAN I
 trust the House will not
 adjourn until this bill is
 passed SPEAKER Does the gentleman
 from Kentucky insist on his
 motion Mr MOORE of Kentucky
 No sir I with draw
 it The question was then
 taken on the second branch
 of the amendment and it
 was disagreed to The question
 then recurred on the followinc
 amendment proposed by Mr CRAWFORD
 Strike out the fifteenth section
 of the bill which is
 as follows Sec 15 and
 be it further enacted That
 all moneys hereafter contracted for
 under the authority of an
 act en titled An act
 authorizing a loan and providing
 for the redemption of Treasury
 notes approved June 22 1860
 shall be used in redemption
 of Treasury notes now out
 standing and those to bc
 issued under this act and
 to re place in the
 Treasury any atnount in said
 notes which shall have been
 paid and received for public
 dues and for no other
 purpose And insert in lien
 thereof the followin SEC 15
 vand be it further enacted
 That so much of the
 act entitled An act authorizing
 a loan and providint för
 the redemption of lireasurv notes
 approved Juno 22 1860 as
 cniposvers the President to borrow
 a suen oxceed ing 10
 000 000 is bcreby repealed
 it being intended that the
 annount of rrreasury notes authorized
 hy the preset t act
 shall take the place of
 the said loan beyond thc
 sum already contracted Or Mr
 SHERMAN 1 think that amendment
 would very seriously embarrass the
 negotiation of these Treasury notes
 The present loan law authorizes
 a loan of 21 000
 000 tren million of that
 amount has been contracted for
 Eleven By the pro million
 is yet to bc contracted
 for visions of this bill
 Treasury notes are substituted for
 one or two years for
 the balance of the loan
 but the loan is reserved
 to be necrotiated at a
 future time and to pay
 off the Treasury notes The
 amendment of the gentleman from
 Georgia repeals the balance of
 the loan bill and will
 very materially affect the value
 of the Treasury notes There
 would then bc no provision
 for the pay ment of
 the Tr easury notes cxccpt
 the ordinary revenues of the
 Government which wc all know
 to be wholly insufficient Mr
 CRAWFORD 1 desire to say
 in reply to what has
 fallen from the chairrna n
 of the Corn miltee of
 Ways and Means that my
 amendment simply repeals so much
 of the act of the
 22d of June last as
 authorizes a loan of 10
 000 000 That is all
 that it does and I
 beg gentlenu n to remember
 that this Treasury note bill
 will not expire by its
 own limitation until the 1st
 of Jan uary 1863 and
 it is certainly reasonable to
 sup pose that the Government
 will bc prepared to make
 arrangements to meet these Treasury
 notes before that timo arrives
 Mr SHERMAN With the permission
 of the genbleman will say
 that by the prpvisions of
 thc loan bill the President
 of the United States is
 authorized at any time to
 Contract for the bal ance
 of that loan whenever in
 his opinion the I take
 it the gentle public service
 requires it man from Georgia
 does not desire to keep
 out the Treasury notes as
 a kind of currency It
 would be better to allow
 the Treasury Department to recieve
 the Treasury notes and substitute
 a loan Mr CRAWFORD By
 no manner of means do
 I desire to do that
 thing but I cannot see
 why the act of last
 session authorizing a loan of
 20 000 000 shall now
 by this bill be made
 to stand over to the
 1st of January 1863 in
 order that we mhy provide
 to day for the payment
 of the 10 000 000
 of Treasury notes to be
 issued because if they circulate
 as money there will be
 no necessity for their payment
 The Treasury Department tell us
 that they can get on
 with 10 000 000 of
 Treasury notes and t hey
 are per feetly willing that
 we shall repeal so much
 of the act of last
 session as au thorizes the
 issue of a loan of
 10 000 000 by the
 Government Wherefore then the necessity
 of giving them in Treasury
 notes and a loan of
 swer that question I know
 that a loan could not
 be negotiated as well by
 the Government as Treas ury
 notes which will answer the
 purpose We can pass tl
 lcm at par but if
 we attempt to nego tiate
 a loan tile loss will
 be heavy and the Treas
 ury Department say they can
 get along with 10 000
 000 of Treasury notes will
 not detain the House longer
 as I know gentlemen arc
 anxious to adjourn I ask
 for a vote on my
 proposition T hc question was
 taken and the amendment was
 disagreed to The bill was
 then ordered to be engrossed
 and read a third time
 and beino encn ossed it
 was accordingly read the third
 time Mr SHERMAN moved the
 previous question on the passage
 of the bill The previous
 question was seconded and the
 main question ordered Mr BARKSDALE
 demanded the yeas and nays
 on the passage of the
 bill The yeas and nays
 were not ordered The bill
 was passed Mr SHERMAN moved
 to reconsider the vote by
 which the bill was passed
 and also moved to lay
 the motion to reconsider upon
 the tablö The latter motion
 was agreed to Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois I offer the
 follow ing resolution Resoteed by
 the House of Representatives That
 we prop erly estin at
 e the immensc value of
 our national Union to that
 we cherish our collective and
 individual happiness a cordial habitual
 and immovable attachment to it
 that we will speak of
 it as of the palladium
 of our political safety and
 prosperity that we will wat
 eh its preservation witli jealous
 anxiety that we will discountenancc
 what ever nmy suagest even
 a suspicion that it can
 in any event be abandoned
 and indignautly frown upon tm
 first dawn ing of every
 attempt to alienate any portion
 of our country from the
 rest or cnfecble thc sacred
 ties which now link toaether
 the various parts that we
 regard it as a main
 pillar in the edifice of
 our real independence the support
 of tranquillity at home o
 ur peace abroad our safety
 our prosperity and that very
 liberty which vve so highly
 prize that we have scen
 nothing ill tbc past nor
 do we see any present
 either in the election of
 Abraham thing in the Lincoln
 to the Presidency of the
 United States or from any
 other existing cause to justif
 y its dissolution that We
 regard its perpetuity as or
 unore value than the temporary
 that whatever evils or triumph
 of any party or any
 man abuses exist under it
 ought to be corrected within
 the Union in a peaceful
 and constitutional way that wc
 be licve it has sutlicient
 power to redrcss every wrong
 and enforce every right growing
 out of its organization or
 per taining to its proper
 functions and that it is
 a patriotic duty to stand
 by it as our hope
 in pe e and our
 iefi2nsein vvar Mr BURCH 1

 d Illinois Do 1 understand
 that my resolution will be
 considered the first thing to
 morrow morning if the House
 should adjourn now Mr BURNETT
 That will depend on whether
 the resolution is in order
 or not Mr MORRIS of
 Illinois Then 1 will have
 the floor in the morning
 if the House adjourn now
 Mr COX I object to
 such an understanding Mr MORRIS
 Illinois Then raise the point
 of order that the gentleman
 from California Mr BURCHI has
 no right to move an
 adjourn ment while I am
 occupying the floor I believe
 I was recoc nized by
 Mr BURCH If so I
 surely had the right to
 make the Chair the motion
 had the floor and Mr
 MORRIS of Illinois did not
 yield to the gentleman from
 California to I now if
 there be any move an

 fen ed ADMISSION OF KANSAS
 Mr COLLAMER Mr President 1
 wish to call up the
 House bill of the last
 session for the admission of
 Kansas l vith a view
 of making it the order
 of the day for some
 futurc day I dc sire
 to have it made the
 special order for Tuesday next
 Mr GREEN 1 object to
 taking it up now and
 I will give a reason
 it There are certain laws
 not yet received from that
 Territory which I think have
 an important bearino on tho
 bill and we expect them
 every day I sent to
 the State Department for them
 last week Mr COLLAMER Territorial
 laws Mr GREEN Territorial laws
 I therefore object to making
 any special order of it
 now The VICE PRESIDENT It
 is already a special order
 on the Calendar Mr GREEN
 It can remain as it
 is Mr COLLAMER I vfr
 President we are aware that
 our list of special orders
 madc from time to time
 covers a large number of
 bills some If we wait
 of which will never be
 reached at an for it
 to come up on the
 list of special orders we
 k therefore ask that it
 Inay MI ait a long
 while be taken up with
 a view of fixing a
 day för its Mr N
 IAYNARD I would ask the
 gentleman the action of the
 House prior to the consideration
 consideration if proposals have not
 already been issued for ne
 of the gentleman s resolution
 That question is do not
 know Mr President what the
 gen I tleman alludes to
 as beineimportaut If he think
 s II iiiformation to which
 he alludes is important gotiatine
 thc balance of the loan
 of on excusing the gentleman
 from Florida from ser Mr
 CRAWFORD I do not know
 whether vice on a committee
 I cannot an Mr A
 DRAIN I believe I I
 rad the floor by that
 is enough for me and
 tliat might constitute proposals have
 beelbissued or not 46 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 11 a
 reason for postponing the consideration
 of the bill to some
 other day but I can
 see no reason I why
 we should not take iL
 up and fix a day
 If when that day arrives
 the gentleman has any reason
 for postponemen it can be
 postponed of course but I
 wish to put itin the
 progress of pro ceedings When
 the time shall come which
 we fix as the day
 for it if the gentleman
 states that he is in
 expectation of important information we
 may postponc it but that
 is no reason why it
 should not be taken up
 and some measure of pro
 céeding n ow initiated in
 relation to it Mr GREEN
 I can only say that
 I have a reasonable expectation
 of that kind and I
 do not name it for
 the mere purpose of delay
 Mr COLLAMER If the gentleman
 beard me he would know
 I did not intimate that
 he had such a purpose
 If he considers it important
 it is enough for me
 but the tinie or using
 it for delay would be
 when we come to consider
 the bill when it comes
 up There is no reason
 why we should not take
 it up and intitiate proceedings
 on it Mr GREEN It
 is a very strong reason
 why I do not know
 what moment It we should
 not will arrive I am
 waiting for it every day
 and until the day does
 arrive and the information comes
 I am not prepared to
 act upon the subject Now
 if we take up the
 bill and make it a
 special order when that order
 comes up the ill formation
 may not be here or
 it may Let us therefore
 wau and when the information
 comes will no tify the
 Senator the very moment it
 docs come and I will
 neet the issue perhaps x
 vithout a sin gle objection
 That however I do not
 know but it may bc
 without a single objection but
 I say it is proper
 if we neod that information
 not to make the bill
 a special order until we
 get it I therefore object
 to it and hope it
 will not bc takcn up
 and not bc made a
 special order The motion was
 agreed to there being on
 a division ayes 23 noes

 Mr PUGH bill passed both
 Housesat the last session and

 too latc to be examined
 It has been considered in
 the Committee on the Judiciary
 of the Senate ar d
 as there is therefore no
 necessity for its reference I

 that it should be referred

 will consent to its being

 OF SENATE Mr BRAGG I
 understand that some doubt exists
 whetl ler the Chaplain clccled
 by this body at the
 last session was elected fbr
 the Congress or for the
 session alone With view of
 remov ing all doubts on
 the subject I offer the
 follow ing resolution Resolved That
 the Chaplain elected by the
 Senate on the 15th day
 of December 1859 to ofliciate
 on the part of the
 Senate at the last session
 he continued during the present
 session of Congress The resolution
 was considered by unanimous consent
 and agreed to PACIFIC RAILROAD

 be recollected that at the
 close of thc last session
 I offered an order which
 was referred to the Committee
 on Printing and a favorable
 report was made on it
 for printincr the eleventh volume
 of the Pacific railroad report
 Objection was interposed to the
 consideration of that resolution on
 that day being the last
 day of the session and
 il was laid over I
 ask that it be now
 taken up and considered The
 VICE PRESIDENT The Chair will
 say to the Senator from
 New Hampshire that the resolution
 to which he refers is
 not on the Cal cndar
 of the last session There
 is however a resolution introduced
 by the Senator at this
 ses Mr HALE Thore is
 a lni stake then owinrr
 to the confusion on tbc
 last day of the session
 A resolution was presented and
 objection was Inade to its
 consideration I think by the
 Senator from North Carolina Mr
 BRAGG Mr HUNTER 1 think

 no to v aste on
 printino Mr HALE Well let

 read Mr GREEN l do
 not desire any action on

 It will on the table
 for the present if there
 be no objection Mr HALE
 I hope the subject on

 business but as it is
 the only business on the
 table if it bc the

 discussion That bill is not
 going to provide revenue I
 think we shall havo other
 things to engross us without

 seems to me there can
 bc nothing more appropriate than
 this just now when we

 Senator from Kentucky Mr POWELL
 The Secretary read the resolution
 as j of the Senator
 from Kentucky to refer so
 much of the President s
 Inossao e as refers to
 this sub stands as follows
 ject to a select committee
 is a movcrnent in the
 Resoived That so much of
 the Presidcnt s messaee as
 riffht direction I thank the
 Senator it and relates to
 the present agitated and distracted
 condit ion of the country
 and the grievances between the
 slaveholding I shall cheerfully vote
 for its adoption the non
 staveholding States be referred to
 a special i was somewhat
 surprised at the view taken
 cOmmittee of thirt ecn mcnrbers
 and that said cotntuittee be
 instructed to inquire into the
 present condition 01 the Of
 that proposition by the distincruished
 Senator ceuntry and report by
 bill or otherwise Mr BIGLER
 1 took the floor Mr
 dent yesterday afternoon for the
 purpose Of making a very
 few remarks on the present
 un happy condition of the
 country I intended then only
 to say what was necessary
 to indicate my own position
 on the great question which
 is agl tating the people
 of this country That is
 my only purposc this morning
 I shall reserve for some
 subsequent occasion when perhaps this
 whole subject will be more
 fully before us the discussion
 of the main question which
 it neces sariiy presents Sir
 it was too truly remarked
 by the Senator from Mississippi
 Mr IDA vrs yesterday that
 we have fallen on evil
 times It is too sadly
 appa rent that this great
 Republic of ours is in
 immi nent danger of dissolution
 whole political social and commercial
 system is seriously dis turbed
 and shows unmistakable evidences of
 depression and distress Commerce trade
 and finances are disturbed The
 banks have ceased to redeem
 t heir notes in specie
 and tho Treasury of the
 United States is unable to
 meet the current demands upon
 it Indeed sir a general
 gloom seems to have spread
 over the entire country Why
 is all this Have the
 great elements of prosperity procrress
 and general thrift in the
 country become suddenly exhausted No
 sir those were never more
 abundant than now What is
 it then Why sir disguise
 it as you may this
 sad picture is the result
 of a political panic I
 almost shrink from enunciating the
 precise cause obvious as I
 think it is to every
 Senator and to every intelligent
 man in the land IXhe
 startling cause is that men
 are beginning to doubt the
 integrity and future existence of
 this Union State after State
 has taken steps on the
 subject of withdrawing from this
 Confederacy We hear of Législatures
 being assembled conventions of the
 people being ordered all to
 consider the grave question whether
 our relations are to continue
 or It is not singular
 then that we have scon
 110 t manifestations of deep
 concern and distress in the
 land Sir this is a
 startling picture but it seems
 to me it is the
 part of pætriotism and duty
 to look it fairly in
 the face My own impressions
 first were that the less
 that was said here the
 better I have changed that
 impression I æbelieve that the
 times require that the public
 men the selected men of
 the nation here should come
 up io t Ilis great
 question Let the people understand
 what view is taken of
 it here For one 1
 am prepared to separate myself
 as far as possible from
 past prejudices and party allegiance
 and consider the condition of
 the country in a spirit
 of devotion to its interest
 I most heartily commend the
 no ble position of the
 Senator from Connecticut Mr DrxoN
 Without understanding the desires of
 the men of his own
 party as he has told
 us regardless of his connection
 with them of his party
 prejudices for I believe he
 is a friend of the
 PresiÖent elect he has come
 boldly forward and taken his
 position for the Constitution for
 the Union as made by
 the Constitution for the equality
 of the States and for
 justice among the citizens of
 the States Sir extcnd to
 him the hand of fellowship
 and I meet him in
 the same spirit and under
 the same circurn stanccs for
 have no idea how my
 views will be received on
 this side of the Chamber
 In the spirit of the
 Senator from Illinois on this
 side Mr DOUGLAS go with
 rnen of any party and
 men of every party who
 will devote themselves to the
 great ing danger Mr President
 for weal 0k for woe
 I am a Union am
 for the Union as n
 adc by our fathers man
 I am fop the constitutional
 Union as it is and
 the spirit of the remark
 of the Senator from Cali
 fornia yesterday I expect to
 be of and the from
 Virginia Mr Mnsox mhat honorable
 f Senator said he would
 vote for the resolution as
 a mere matter of parliamentary
 courtesy because the message should
 be referred to a committee
 I Ie said that nmch
 lest his vote might be
 misun i dcrstood by his
 cornstituents that they should be
 under the impression that he
 had concluded that a remedy
 for the present difficulties which
 beset the country could be
 instituted while in his judg
 ment Congress could do nothing
 on that subject That honorable
 Senator must know that in
 some way or other any
 adjustment that may be made
 on this subject must to
 some extent ber connected with
 Congress Congress must necessarily be
 con nectcd with it unless
 it bé the question of
 seces sion which belongs to
 the States only If it
 be possible to agree upon
 an adjustment in the shape
 ofa law then Congress and
 the Executive will per form
 the whole work if the
 cotnmittee should find that it
 required an amendment to the
 Constiuttion then Congress must either
 adopt that amendment and submit
 it for the approval of
 the States or else when
 two thirds of the States
 petition Con gress provision must
 bc Inade for a convenlion
 of the States so that
 in any event congressional action
 will be necessary That is
 a reason why there should
 be no hesitation whatever con
 sidcring the question here and
 inquiring calmly soberly and earnestly
 of each other what can
 bc done to rescue the
 country Sir I have a
 word or two to say
 specially to my friends on
 this side of the Chamber
 I mean those from the
 far off South those with
 whom I have so long
 and cordially coöperated here for
 whose rights I zealously contended
 long before met them on
 this floor whose cause has
 been our cause in thc
 Nonh and whose cause to
 some ex tent in the
 latc contest for President fifteen
 hun dred thousand 1 K
 l thcrn mcn embraced It
 scarcely becomes me to undertake
 to judge of their case
 I confess I an I
 perhaps incapable of appre ciating
 their precisc position and feelings
 knowledge as they are aware
 the justice of some of
 their complaints I acknowledge that
 there has been kept up
 a var of aggression upon
 their feelings well calculated to
 alienate them from the people
 of the North that in
 sornc instances their clear constitu
 tionul rights have been vexatiously
 embarrassed and at times defeated
 and furtl icr more that
 the party about to assume
 the reins of Government in
 the late contest avowed doctrines
 which in in y judgment
 are inconsistent with the equality
 of tlie States for so
 I reéard the doc trine
 of the exclusion of the
 owner of a slave from
 the common Territories unless he
 Icavcs his prop erty behind
 him But Mr Presidcnt is
 disso lution a remedy Is
 that the best and wisest
 of all he alternatives left
 Has the time come to
 I said be ernbrace that
 remedy I think not fore
 that it was not fbr
 mc to speak of what
 con cerncd them and their
 interests but I say no
 move fatal step clan be
 taken for the interests of
 the great State which I
 represent here and as I
 verily l believe forcvcry other
 State in this Confederacy it
 may be said it vas
 said yes I know sir
 terdav by the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr war and even
 death are to be pre
 ftrred to dishonor and that
 a State remainin y in
 this Union less than an
 equal denied of its con
 stilutional rights is solne measure
 dishonored but my friend from
 Mississippi and those who act
 with him should view this
 question in more hopeful light
 After all Mr Lincoln is
 in a rninorily of nearly
 nine hundred thousand votes and
 in his election work of
 rescuing the country from thc
 impend the people of the
 United States have not passed
 judgment against the claims of
 the South to equal Whcthqr
 it be a right or
 whethery when a State witbdraws
 it is revolutiön the consequence
 tothe seceding ate and to
 tho remaining States will be
 essentially the same and the
 pemedy if remedy there be
 will be the same But
 Bhe point I wish to
 make is this even if
 ib be aright is it
 just to the other States
 to resort to that remedy
 until redress has been sought
 and denied Xit the very
 fountain of political power and
 authority and through the precise
 channels in which this Confed
 eracy was formed I think
 not Such precipitate action is
 not just to their friends
 Let the southern Slates ask
 the people ofthis Confederacy sepa
 rate and aside from ordinary
 political considerations to consider and
 adjust this question Le_t them
 ask redress for their grievances
 at the bands of those
 who have the power to
 grant it and in the
 form prescribed in the compact
 under which we live If
 redress be denied if two
 thirds of the States refuse
 to call a conventions or
 calling convention if three fourths
 of the States decline to
 approve such amendments to the
 Constitution as they deem essential
 to the protection of Eheirvights
 and to the maintenance of
 their equality in the Union
 then the time will have
 arrived for consid ering this
 question of dissolution But until
 all other means have been
 exhausced it should not cannot
 be seriously entertained Mr President
 I arn one of those
 who believe that the reined
 y for the present distracted
 condi tion of the country
 after all must sooner or
 iater come froin the people
 if it is to come
 at all and be I
 do not say that amendments
 should permanent not be submitted
 here I am by no
 means in tending to indicate
 that the effort should not
 be made Lbut I do
 say that I have little
 hope that measures of adjustment
 can pass Congress that will
 meet this Case It is
 hardly to be expected II
 rat the politicians or partisans
 of the country brought into
 position in the midst of
 party ug gles committed to
 one Sidc or other of
 the contro verted points are
 prepared for this delicate work
 It must go into otl
 ler hands Let the people
 select representatives on this single
 subject alone and to remedy
 the defects which experience has
 shown and if needs be
 give new guarantees to the
 ag grieved States l hen
 sir you will have a
 single ness of purpose and
 our southern friends Wii ascertain
 the real sentiment of the
 northern people in reference to
 their rights and position in
 the Union and while I
 coniZss that all the evidence
 seems to be on the
 other side I have a
 belief that in such a
 test Lho conservative element of
 the North would prevail tl
 iat the South would be
 met in a spirit of
 justice fraternity and even generosity
 But it may be asked
 as it has been already
 what is to become of
 the country in the mean
 time MT hat measures shall
 be adopted to arrest thc
 progress of dissolution I confess
 Mr Pres ident I mn
 not prepared to answer that
 question That is morc cspecially
 for our friends from those
 States vhich are moving for
 secession If they know no
 means of a qresting the
 progress of sep aration then
 sir we truly in a
 hopeless con dition But I
 am hot so despondent 1
 have still hope that if
 there were such indications from
 tl C North of a
 disposition to deal kindly on
 the subject to hear their
 southern brethren fairly and if
 possible favorabty their fully and
 answer demands there would be
 a feeling of reaction in
 the South that men would
 rise above the mad ness
 of the hour and stay
 the fatal step at least
 for a brief season and
 another effort would be made
 to save the Government and
 to satisfy the southern States
 that they can maintain their
 rights within the Union Sir
 am not of those who
 view this disease lightly am
 sensible that it is deep
 seated and to some extent
 malignant but not incurable is
 not in y purpose to
 talk of distincüve proposi tions
 now but do say that
 thc best possible remedy that
 could be applied to silence
 forever the war of crimination
 in the North would be
 to separate 1iis question of
 slavery as far as pos
 sible from the popular elections
 in the non slave holdinT
 States Tl here are a
 class of men we ali
 know in the North who
 are zealous and sincere enemies
 of slavery and so long
 as they can dis I
 i cover the slightest opportunity
 of interfering to ity and
 justice Mr President i want
 to call the attention of
 perform what they call a
 duty they will keep up
 those Senators and of their
 friends at home to a
 these assaults and an unjust
 war upon the feelings I
 do not carc to in
 of the c tizens of
 the southern States Separate particular
 point in this case quiE
 e into the question of
 the Fight of secession them
 entirely so tbae they can
 have no connec 48 tion
 withit can in no way
 influence the question of where
 slavery shall be or where
 it shall go or Whether
 it shall be carried into
 our new Term ritories or
 even from the question of
 the admis Sion of a
 State whether it be free
 or slave How can that
 be done Sir do not
 wish to be understood as
 presenting any view to which
 I shall adhere with tenacity
 I throw out genei al
 views for what they are
 worth I am so con
 vinced of the Wisdom and
 the true policy of main
 tainingjthis Confederacy entire that I
 will resort to any honorable
 expedient any reasonable meas ure
 to save it I think
 the people of the North
 would go very much further
 than their represent atives on
 the Republican Sidc believe in
 order to aecomplish this desirable
 end If needs be sir
 let the territory be divided
 from ocean to ocean north
 of which slavery shall not
 go south of which it
 shall not bc disturbed Let
 us have a deep gulf
 or a high wall between
 the North and South on
 this subject If that will
 not allay the demon of
 discord then instead of the
 present provision that Congress may
 adrnit States into tho Union
 which alone will induce a
 certain class of people to
 be anxious to elect antislavery
 mon in order that they
 may keep out a slave
 I say let the Constitution
 describe a State State fix
 its population and other elements
 and pro vide for its
 admission by a proclamation of
 the President upon the establishment
 of thc facts Then sir
 the North would be separated
 from this question the North
 and the South on this
 disturbing element would be entirely
 free of each other while
 all the other relations would
 remain and this grcat Governmcnt
 go on performing its functions
 We Should retain its power
 its prow ess its dignity
 and its influence in the
 world Perhaps less radical changes
 may do If so all
 the better The President of
 the United States with pa
 triatic desire to settle this
 question has sugcrested what he
 supposed would bc sufficient for
 the ex Lmust say and
 I say it with regret
 that I do not think
 his rt medics will tlie
 case I think deeper and
 wider than the reined y
 first place the points presented
 by hin i embracc the
 controverted points over which parties
 have struggled for years thc
 very source over which the
 bitter struggle for ascendency was
 made in the late presidential
 contest And I can see
 no reason to anticipate their
 adoption by the dom inant
 party the North Nor do
 I think they would reach
 the seat of the disease
 if they were adopted for
 my belief is this war
 of crimination and recrimination is
 the scut of this disease
 and if you want permanent
 peace you nnust strike at
 the sent of the disease
 you must separate tho non
 slavcholding States from the question
 of sla very in order
 that the question may have
 no rest ingeplacc in the
 northcrn mind Honorable Senators yesterday
 said the hearts of men
 must bc charlo ed FL
 he hearts of men ought
 to bc changed trust in
 God s ntune that nuany
 of the tn will be
 changed but that is no
 work for politicians or Senators
 t will bc idlc to
 hope for escape in that
 way You must separate the
 acritating cause if you expect
 those men who are bitterly
 anti sla very to drop
 the I arn o thosc
 who think they ought to
 have done so long üE0
 No man has given that
 freling less countenance tlian myself
 have never been in aplitical
 struggle in my IiiZ that
 thc rights of the South
 were not a leading issue
 and never fullcn that I
 did not fall by the
 weight I of a southern
 issue But Mr President I
 do not know that I
 can usefully pursue this subject
 further I desirc to say
 however in reference to my
 own State not withstanding its
 vote for the Republican candi
 date at the late election
 that it is a conservative
 and a just State that
 our southern friends can rely
 Witli confidence upon the future
 action of that State If
 they ask redress in the
 form in which I have
 indicated or any other on
 which the people can act
 separate from other considerations I
 have not doubt that they
 would give all the guaran
 tees which any reasonable southern
 man would d e n
 and It may be said
 that in a minority as
 I am I am not
 warranted thus to speak för
 I should not be regarded
 as authority but sir every
 man of inte hgence in
 my State knows that other
 potent influences than the merc
 distinctive principles of the Republican
 party wcighed irrthelate election CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 11 There were
 a complication of influences against
 us and among them the
 most potent next to this
 slavery acritation was the question
 of the tariff The operatives
 in the manufacturincy cs tablishments
 and the mines away down
 in the earth had felt
 and believed that the policy
 of the Democratic party was
 prejudicial to their inter ests
 and at the late election
 though they were naturally with
 the Democratic party they voted
 I doubt not that that
 vote in a body against
 us was forty thousand in
 the State No man is
 war ranted therefore in assuming
 that the State of Pennsylvania
 will adhere to the distinctive
 doc trines of the Republican
 party 1 do not believe
 a distinctive issue on the
 irrepressible conflict as usually interpreted
 in that State would get
 ono hundred thousand votes No
 war of aggres Sion is
 intended by the people of
 that State She will respond
 promptly to any demand for
 consid eration and for redress
 madc in the proper spirit
 by her sister States and
 I doubt not she will
 avoid even the appearance of
 wrong by discard ino certain
 of her statutes which though
 in the main a dead
 letter have been made the
 subject of complaint But Mr
 Prcsident I should bo glad
 indeed if Senators on the
 other side those who speak
 for tl C dominant party
 would indicate what their presel
 t views are I think
 sir in the irnminent peril
 that surrounds us they ought
 to do at least this
 It isno ordinary occasion It
 is nota time when men
 may stand upon a mere
 partisan vic tory What is
 a party victory if the
 country is 10 be torn
 by violence by riot and
 mobs in your commercial cities
 on questions of employment and
 bread What is a party
 triumpl l worth if the
 Government should not endure Sir
 it is worse than n
 delusion I know Mr President
 the grave responsibili ties that
 attach to what 1 say
 I may be laughed at
 for much that I have
 uttered Bo it so 1
 would not have uttered it
 if I did not feel
 that the times rcquirc that
 every man regard loss of
 con scqumnc es pe rform
 his part 1 shall only
 rtl eat therefore that in
 the reraainin r part of
 111 y brief official career
 here whatever it nay be
 pos Sible ftn Ine to
 do to adjust these unhappy
 dii er enees I shall
 do I not entirely despondent
 I cannot rny In ind
 to realize oscparation of these
 States Inuch less calmly io
 contemplate the consequences which m
 vould ft lhow Sir Ict
 us as one man address
 ourselves to this subject Why
 should our friends from the
 far South desire to separate
 from those in the North
 who have so long stood
 by them Why gentlc men
 more men in thc States
 of New York and Pennsylvania
 alone espouscd your cause in
 the late contest than can
 be found in all tbc
 States that tre talking of
 separating from the Ullion A
 mil lion and a Ilialf
 of voters have in a
 large measure identified themselves with
 you in the issue against
 the black Republican party and
 it is my impres Sion
 that if this for rn
 of government remains and the
 sanno issues arc to be
 made four years hence the
 Republican party with its sectional
 flag will be driven to
 the wall as completely as
 any party ever was driven
 in this country I am
 no prophet nor the son
 of a prophet but I
 pre dict that it is
 the last victory the Republican
 party will ever gain Let
 us remain together then let
 us contend for your rights
 within the Constitu tion and
 the Union and in a
 short time you who are
 nowr desponding and complaining and
 threat ening disruption will be
 the triumphant party you and
 your friends north will control
 the Gov ernment once more
 and long ere that I
 solernnly believe if the effort
 be madc in the right
 direction the people of this
 country will give all the
 guar antees that the South
 upon full reflection will demand
 Mr IVERSON Mr President like
 the Sen ator from Mississippi
 Mr BROWN who ad dressed
 the Senate yesterday 1 aln
 not willing to vote for
 the resolution offered by the
 Senator from Kentucky and I
 desire briefly in justification of
 my vote to set myself
 right before my constitu cnts
 and I shall therefore give
 to the Senate and the
 country the reasons which influence
 my action The purpose of
 this proposition is to submit
 all the diffcultics which now
 exist in the public mind
 to a committee of thirteen
 I do 110t ex actly
 understand tl H object that
 is either in tended or
 expected to be attained by
 the raising of this committee
 It has not been explained
 by the hon orable Senator
 who moved it nor by
 any per son who has
 addressed the Senate in advocacy
 of the resolution I do
 not understand whether congressional legislation
 is to be invoked to
 lieve us from the impending
 danger and difficulty which threaten
 the Republic or whether consti
 tutional amendments are to be
 proposed to the States by
 the two Houses of Congress
 not advised what is expected
 from this commit tee but
 sir whatever may be the
 object and it can certainly
 come but in one of
 two forms either in the
 shape of congressional legislation or
 in thc shape of amendments
 to the Constitu tion in
 whatever form it may come
 whatever design or object may
 be contemplated by the mover
 of the proposition and its
 friends I have no confidence
 whatever in the accomplishment of
 any good result from it
 Now sir let us look
 at this question from a
 reasonable and common sense stand
 point designed to frame concressional
 legislation to re move the
 objections which the sou thern
 Sta tes have to in
 the Union Is it designed
 to in troduce corvrcssional legislation
 for the purpose of protecting
 the rights and equality of
 the south ern States more
 than they are now protected
 by the present Constitution and
 the present laws If so
 what is the congressional legislation
 proposed So far as the
 fugitive slave law is concerned
 and the rights of the
 southern people to the recapture
 and reclamation of their fugitive
 slaves and the obstructions and
 difficulties insurmountable dif ficulties which
 arc presented to the execution
 of that law by the
 vitiated public sentiment of the
 northern States what Inore can
 Congress do than Congress have
 already done we have a
 fugitive slave law of which
 the South does not complain
 It is one suåciently guarded
 and sufliciently strin gent to
 accomplish all the objects for
 which it w as designed
 if there was a proper
 public senti ment prevailing in
 the northern States No better
 fugitive slave law could be
 devised by this Con rrcss
 or any other It has
 every provision which b the
 South has ever asked or
 den landed It clothes thc
 judiciarv and Executive of this
 Government v ilh ample powers
 to execute the law as
 much at any rate as
 could be put into the
 hands of those two departments
 of the Government We do
 not complain that any Executivc
 heretofore has ever been derelict
 in the discharge of his
 duty in the execution of
 this law Mr Fillmore was
 the President when the law
 was passed and it received
 his sanction and am ready
 to say here in In
 y place in the Senate
 that so far as he
 was concerned I believe he
 carried it oat in good
 faith So did General Pierce
 so has the present Execu
 tive done So far as
 they have had it in
 their power to execute this
 law i has been done
 faith fully I believe by
 every Executive But sir how
 has it performed its duty
 How has it accomplished its
 object We know well that
 no slave has ever been
 reclaimed under it from the
 northern States except under circum
 stances of the greatest difficulty
 and danger to the owner
 and sometimes even attended with
 the loss of lifih This
 is not owing to a
 defect in the law but
 to the fact to which
 no sensible and im partial
 man can shut his eyes
 that the irre pressible conflict
 idea the vitiated public senti
 ment of the northern States
 is so strong against slavery
 that no law Congress could
 enact would ever be executed
 while that public sentiment lasts
 We all re me mber
 the case of Gorsuch in
 Penn sylvania in the conservative
 State of Pennsyl vania represented
 so worthily by my distin
 guished friend on my left
 Mr even rcccntly in the
 other conservative State New Jersey
 which did to some extent
 reclaim itself from the imputation
 of being an abolition State
 in the late election even
 there the law has not
 been executed buta recent occurrence
 ex hibits its total inadequacy
 to perform its office And
 so in every other of
 the free States true that
 now and then a fugitive
 slave is re claimed in
 the northern States but it
 has to be done at
 the point of the bayonet
 and at an ex pense
 of ten times the value
 of the slave to the
 owner and tl ke Government
 W bv is it Not
 because the law is defective
 but as I said be
 cause public sentiment is defective
 Nor sir do I charge
 the failure of the execu
 tion of this law upon
 the personal liberty bills of
 I which so much complaint
 bas been made No THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS
 OF CONGRESS PUBLISHED BY JOI
 IN C RIVES WASHINGTON D
 C THIRTY SIXTH CONGRESS 2D
 SESSION sir they have never
 operated to prevent the exe
 cütionof the fugitive slavc law
 As I said the other
 day it has been mob
 and mob law will always
 exist and svill always produce
 these re sults as long
 as the Union and slavery
 last to gethet Whenever a
 fugitive slave from any of
 the southern States is accidently
 discovered in one of the
 free States and the owner
 goes in pursu ance of
 the laws and the Constitution
 to reclaim him what follows
 If he obtains the arrest
 of his slave before he
 gets to a court of
 justice or even after the
 judgment of the court remands
 him into the possession of
 his owner there is a
 mob of free negroes and
 of whites who are only
 one degree removed from their
 colored brethren in brutality and
 ignorance they assemble and wrest
 the slave from the possession
 of his 0 vner and
 the conservative masses of the
 northem States the gentle those
 who are in favor of
 justice and who believe that
 the owner is entitled under
 the Constitution and law to
 reclaim his fugitivc slaves do
 what They stand by with
 folded arms and look upon
 these mobs and laugh to
 scorn the southern people who
 complain the Senator from New
 Hampshire Mr HALE the other
 day said that he believed
 the southern people were entitled
 to the reclamation of their
 fugitive slaves and yet how
 often has he st ood
 by and seen these mobs
 execute their purpose and how
 often has he attempted to
 control or to correct this
 vitiated public sentiment Sir he
 has stim ulated it and
 so have all the other
 Republican party members who have
 power and influence over public
 sentiment at the North These
 are the facts in relation
 to thc public sentiment on
 this fugitive slave law What
 more is it expected of
 Congress to do on this
 subject Docs thc honor able
 Senator from Kentucky by his
 resolution propose to amend the
 fugitive slave law It has
 been suggested by gentlemen that
 a rem edy may be
 found in the alteration of
 the Consti tution or in
 some act of C0Ylgress by
 which the States the free
 States who secrete and refuse
 to bring back our slaves
 shall be made liable in
 damages for the value of
 the slaves Has that ever
 entered into the heads of
 sensible men lu the first
 place what woultsuch a law
 be worth You cannot sue
 a State a State in
 its sovereign capacity cannot be
 brought into court and if
 a thousand slaves were seized
 by Magsachusetts and refused to
 be surrendered how could you
 sue the State of Massachusetts
 and malæ her liable for
 the value of the slaves
 That would be im practicable
 and impossible Besides you would
 have to sue in a
 court of Massachusetts and the
 jury who were to decide
 upon the rights of the
 slaveholders would bc a jury
 of Abolitionists and the defendants
 who wcrc to bc mulct
 in dam ages would be
 tho party the court the
 jury and the judge to
 decide the claim of the
 owner All such propositions as
 that are a mere mockery
 and no sensible man can
 for a moment suppose that
 such a remedy as that
 could ever be enforced or
 would be worth a dollar
 or a cent to the
 south ern people Then sir
 is it proposed by conmrcssional
 legis lation to appease the
 southern States by the adop
 tion of the doctrine of
 congressional protection to slavery in
 the Territoriesofthe United States Is
 that the object of the
 remedy which this resolution is
 intended to find out and
 adopt Sir I want to
 know who expects that such
 a remedy as that will
 ever be accorded by this
 Congress or any other We
 know that the Republican party
 so far as they are
 concerned are a unit against
 any such provision It was
 the great shibboleth on which
 they fought the recent battle
 and won it It is
 the great principle which stands
 at the very basis of
 their political organization that slavery
 shall never advance one inch
 beyond its present boundaries and
 shall never plant a footpnnt
 in any Territory of the
 United States they yield iO
 congres sional protection No sif
 Put It as you please
 either in the form of
 a law or an amendment
 to the Constitution it must
 necessarily meet with the objection
 of every Republican overy one
 of the onc million eight
 hundred and fifty thousand 4
 THURSDAY DECEMBER 13 1860 who
 have recently cast their votes
 on this very principle for
 Lincoln and Hamlin And how
 many of the northern Democracy
 will be brought to its
 support We know well that
 so far as a portion
 of the northern Democracy arc
 concerned they are as hostile
 to this principle as the
 Repub licans themselves In this
 Chamber tho north ern Douglas
 non interference squatter sovereign ty
 party is represented by the
 distinguished Sen ator from Illinois
 himself and his friend and
 ally from Ohio Mr PUGH
 Would they vote for it
 W c havc all heard
 on a previous occasion the
 distinguished Senator from Ohio say
 that he would let his
 right arm rot from its
 socket before he would give
 congressional protection to slavery in
 the Territories Now sir what
 are we to expect so
 far as that is concerned
 from congressional legis lation How
 futile would be the attempt
 to get congressional protection to
 slave property by law And
 sir I tell Senators here
 to day that the southern
 people will never be satisfied
 with any thing short of
 concn essional protection to slavery
 in the Territories We know
 our rights under the Constitution
 W c stand as cquål
 States ill this Confederacy and
 we are entitled to an
 equal participation in the common
 property W c know well
 that I ve can never
 enjoy equal possession of the
 Territories without protection to our
 property We know well where
 the Wilmot proviso and non
 intervention and squatter sovereignty will
 lead They will lead to
 the total and eternal ex
 clusion of the soutliern people
 from every Terri tory of
 the United States either now
 or hcreafter to be obtained
 Sir we svrill ncvcr submit
 to any such interdiction as
 that W c ali entitled
 to the protection of our
 property and wc intend to
 have It in the Union
 if ve can get it
 and out of thc Union
 if we cannot Sir I
 understand the object and the
 ultimate end and aim of
 all this prohibitory legislation eitlier
 in the form of tbc
 Wilmot proviso or in the
 shape of non intervention and
 popular sover eignty The result
 of both is to exclude
 the South from entrance into
 the Territories with her slave
 property and thus to circumscribe
 the area of slavery to
 hem it in on all
 sides and by the opcrations
 of the Federal Government on
 tho border States to compel
 them as a matter of
 pol icy and interest to
 get rid of their slaves
 and to precipitate them upon
 the extrerne sou thern States
 It will be but few
 years from this time before
 the border slave States in
 the Union will become free
 States Let this Government pass
 into the hands of the
 Republican party as It is
 about to do them be
 seated in power as they
 are about to he let
 them get possession of the
 two Houses of Congress as
 they will get possession of
 them in loss than two
 years from this time Ict
 them brintr all the power
 and patronage of this Gov
 ernment to bear on the
 border Sates let it be
 understood as it will be
 understood that the Government is
 divorced from slavery and that
 it will be left entirely
 to the people of the
 States themselves with no sympathy
 and aid from the Federal
 Government to maintain the institution
 in hours of difficulty and
 danger Ict the post office
 and the mails be put
 into the hands of the
 Republican party disseminating their scditious
 tracts through every holc and
 corner of thc south ern
 States let all the power
 and patronage of the Federal
 Government be brought to l
 ear on the slave States
 encourao ino incendiarism John Brown
 raids murderings poisonings and re
 volts and what will be
 the condition of the bor
 der States Sir such will
 be their condition that slavery
 will become a burden to
 them instead of a blessing
 and to get rid of
 it such of their slaves
 as the underground railroad does
 not take off to the
 North and to Canada will
 be sent down to the
 cotton States to bc sold
 and Maryland and Virginia and
 Kentucky and Missouri will in
 a few years add to
 tho power and arrogance of
 the free States of this
 Confederacy Such sir will be
 the inevitable result in my
 opinion of the continuance of
 this Union and the slaves
 thus carried off f rom
 the border States and sold
 to the South will be
 confined in a few NEW
 SERIES NO 4 I years
 to some eight or ten
 of the Atlantic and Gulf
 States Well now look at
 the process WO have now
 in the southern States four
 and a half million slaves
 They increase according to the
 census tables at the rate
 of about thirty two per
 cent every ten years If
 you precipitate all this slave
 population into the eight or
 ten States to which I
 have referred in ten years
 from this time we shall
 have nearly six million slaves
 in twenty years eight or
 nine million in thirty years
 twelve or fifteen million Sir
 in less than twenty years
 from the present time by
 this inevitable process the slave
 population of the southern States
 will be largely predominant over
 the whites and then wili
 come universal emancipation by the
 action of the Federal Government
 or such scenes of murder
 between the two races a
 s have never been seen
 or heard of in the
 world S history Such in
 my opinion is the inevitable
 resült of these causes and
 this is the policy of
 the free States of the
 sagacious men who lead this
 mov ment ofanti slavery They
 understand as well I and
 other men at the South
 do how these things are
 to work out and they
 are shaping their course so
 as to bring about these
 very results and in that
 very form and loncy before
 this event occurs the free
 States iVill be swelled up
 to a majority that will
 be irresistible the border States
 will have become free the
 Territories west of our present
 frontier will have been manufactured
 into free States under tbc
 hot bed process of northern
 and foreign abolition immigration and
 in a fex v years
 we shall have free State
 after free State admitted into
 the Union and the SouEh
 lying at the very feet
 of the northern people Sir
 the border slave States of
 this Union com plain of
 the cotton States for the
 movement which IS now in
 progress They say that we
 have no right to take
 them out of the Union
 againSt their I want to
 know what right they have
 to keep us in the
 Union against our will If
 we want to go out
 let us go If they
 want to stay let them
 stay They are sovereign and
 inde pendent States and have
 a right to decide these
 questions for themselves For one
 I shall not complain when
 where or how they go
 I am satisfied however that
 they will go when the
 time comes for them to
 decide But sir they complain
 of us that we make
 so much noise and confusion
 on the subject of fugitive
 slaves when we are not
 affected by the vitiated public
 senti ment of the northern
 States They say that we
 do not lose fugitive slaves
 but they suffer the burden
 We heard that yesterday know
 that we do not suffer
 in this respect it is
 not the want of good
 faith in the northern people
 so far as the reclamation
 of fugitive slavcs concerned that
 is causing the soulhern States
 around the Gulf Mexico and
 the southern Atlantic coast to
 move in this great revolution
 now progressirig Sir we look
 infinitely beyond this petty loss
 of a féw nwroes We
 knom v what is coming
 in this Union It is
 universal emancipation and the turning
 loose upon society in the
 southern States of the mass
 of corruption which will be
 made by eman cipation We
 intend to avoid it if
 we can These border States
 can get along without slavery
 Their soil and climate are
 appropriate to white labor they
 can live and flourish without
 African slavery but the cotton
 States cannot We are obliged
 to have African slavery to
 cultivate our cotton our rice
 and our sugar fields African
 slavery is essential not only
 to our prosperity but to
 our existence as a people
 With this con viction it
 is not surprisino or singular
 that we looking at the
 storm which is brewing in
 the North and coming to
 overwhelm us are for seek
 ing safcty while we can
 and cutting loose from all
 this clement which is to
 operate on us and bring
 these terrible evils to pass
 and setting up for ourselves
 an independent sovereignty upon which
 none of these causes can
 produce any effect And now
 Mr President again recurring to
 that question I tell Senators
 that the southern States now
 moving for secession will never
 be satisfied with any concession
 made by the North that
 does not fully recognize not
 on y the exist 50

 ence of slavery in its
 present form but the right
 of the southern people to
 emigrate to the common Territories
 with their slave property and
 their right to congressional protection
 while thc rri toi ial
 existence lasts The recent battle
 in the South wmas töught
 upon that very issue The
 friends of Mr Breckinridge put
 him upon the very gfound
 of congressional protection to slave
 properiy in the Territories and
 it was upon that ground
 that he carried the cotton
 States I know that there
 was a small party that
 were opposed to thu principle
 They followed the lead of
 the distinguished Senator from Illinois
 who was their candidate for
 the Presidency but how small
 I had almost said how
 contemptible the ele ment in
 the southern States Vho advocated
 his views Look at the
 popular vote that will tell
 the tale Those wlio supported
 the third candi date Mr
 Bell were for congressional protection
 too because in my State
 as in others his lead
 ers and friends urged upon
 the people his support upon
 thO very ground that he
 was an avowed ad vocatc
 of protection to slave property
 in the Ter ritories And
 now sir it is a
 fact X vekl known to
 those who understand the case
 that a large portion of
 the friends of Mr Bell
 are the most ardent leaders
 in and supporters of this
 move ment of secession and
 ib is because they have
 lost all hope of getting
 protection under the Con stitution
 and in the Union Gentlemen
 need not mistake the popular
 sentiment of the southern States
 I do not speak for
 the borderslave States I spéak
 for the cotton States They
 need not mistake the sentiment
 which wo entertain in favor
 of congressional protection and no
 con gressional legislation or amendrnentof
 the Con stitution that falls
 short of it will ever
 be or ought cver to
 be accepted by the South
 Now what prospect have we
 of getting that None here
 I am satisfied none anywhere
 Therefore whence the necessity or
 use of this resolution of
 the Senator from Kentucky None
 that I can see But
 sir suppose the object of
 this resolution be to present
 amendments to the Constitution Fivinrr
 to the southern States additional
 constitutional guarantees I want to
 know of the friends of
 the resolution what particular guarantees
 they are ex pecting to
 get from the northern States
 W hut concessions I do
 not believe that any conces
 sions can be obtained and
 if they werc obtained of
 what value would they be
 grunted by interest and frar
 I do not use the
 terms in an offensive sense
 I speak only politically The
 North if théy yield at
 all yield from an apprehension
 that the South is going
 to dissolve the Union and
 they yield from fear oftkÜconsequences
 Of what value would any
 concessions made under these circum
 stances be to the South
 Nay sir I want to
 know of what value any
 concessions any guarantees or any
 pledges from thc northern States
 will bc to the South
 Nonc as longae this vitiated
 public sentiment of anti slavery
 exists in the hearts and
 minds of the northern people
 And when is that ever
 going to be changed Never
 as long as the It
 is a part not only
 of their literary Union lasts
 education but of their religious
 creed It enters into all
 the ramifications of society It
 pervades the pulpit the halls
 of legislation the popular as
 semblies the school houses all
 teach thedoctrine G irrepressible conflict
 and how many of the
 arguments in favor of slavery
 its morality its so Cial
 and poli tical advantages ever
 reach the north ern eye
 and the northern oar How
 are you going to reform
 this public sentiment in the
 northern States How are you
 ever going to arouse it
 There is but one way
 and that is to let
 the south ern States go
 out of this Union and
 when the northern people see
 that that is a fixed
 fact and come to t
 Ste the consequences of their
 madness and folly then they
 will begin to inquire and
 look into the subject and
 public sentiment inay recoil and
 a sound state of opiniorp
 may possibly arise in the
 northern States then and not
 until then Jut sir suppose
 that constitutional guarantees are presented
 by this committee suppose they
 report and propose amendments to
 thc Consti tution suppose they
 propose everything which the southern
 Statesor the southern people could
 in reason ask or demand
 what reliance can the South
 place upon the fäithful Qbsevyaoce
 of those guarantees by the
 North bcptet guaran tees can
 be roade than the guarantees
 Gf Cop If they were
 carried out in good stitution
 now faith they are all
 that the South would ask
 or expect or demand How
 many of them have been
 violated by the northern people
 Sir look back to the
 history of our country The
 Con stitution was formed as
 a compromise and one of
 its terms was that new
 States might be admitted into
 the Union At thé time
 of the forrnation of the
 Constitution all the States held
 slaves with the exception of
 a single State and it
 certainly was never contemplated that
 the existence of slavery in
 a new State should be
 a valid objection If that
 had been understood to its
 admission the southern States would
 never have entered into this
 bond of Union What was
 the result When the Government
 had been scarcely a quar
 ter of a century in
 operation the northern States refused
 to admit a southern State
 into the Union bccausc her
 constitution tolerated slavery I allude
 to the case of Missouri
 The obstinate opposition of the
 northern States then opposi tion
 to slavery their violation of
 the spirit of the Constilution
 in this respect drove the
 South for the sake of
 peace and harmony and the
 preserva tion of the Union
 to adopt a degrading and
 dis honorinm compromise There was
 thc first vio lation upon
 the part of the North
 of that great spirit of
 colnprmnise in which the Constitution
 had been made Again in
 1844 when Texas applied for
 admis Sion into the Union
 as a slave State who
 opposed it and upon what
 principle was tl le opposition
 made The opposition came from
 the northern States and slavery
 was the ground upon which
 they put their opposition to
 the admission of It was
 admitted however in despite of
 Tcxas this principle which existed
 in the northern niind In
 1848 whe n Territories even
 at that tin xe were
 obtaincd from Mexico with what
 faith did the North observe
 even the Missouri compro mise
 which they had forced upon
 the South In 1848 the
 South proposed to ru the
 Missouri compromise linc to the
 Pacific ocean and apply it
 to all rret ritories which
 the Government then possessed T
 hc North refused it by
 a pos itive vote in
 the of Representatives hy a
 they refused to carry u
 nan i n o rlh
 ern v o te out
 that compromise in good faith
 and in the it was
 Inade There was a pal
 spirit in which pli rhted
 faith pable of their Then
 sir look at the tariff
 compromise of 833 When this
 Union was convulsed 10 its
 very cen tcr to save
 it the Sont h yieldod
 its objection to tho protective
 principle and agreed to the
 com promise of that day
 yet in 1842 before it
 had expanded itself the very
 first time that the North
 obtained possession of t hese
 Halls they repudi ated that
 cmnpromise and enacted a protective
 tariff Now sir the compromises
 of 1850 sanc tioned as
 they have been by the
 action of Con gress and
 of the Supreme Court arc
 to be set aside and
 annulled by thc overpowerinry voice
 and power of the abolition
 sentiment of the North Sir
 WIIRt compronlise has the North
 cvcr ob served in good
 faith that was opposed to
 their interests 01 their prejudices
 Nonc that the his tory
 oft hecountry hus ever recorded
 I ask then how can
 the South rely upon any
 guarantees which the North may
 makc to us in the
 Consti tution especially under the
 circu mstances which now exist
 when those guarantees wili be
 wrung from them bv duress
 For one I have no
 con fidcnce whatavcr in the
 plighted faith Punicafldes of our
 northern brethren and I arn
 not willing and I believe
 my constituents are not for
 one willing to accept any
 compromise of this ques tion
 no matter how plausible it
 noay be upon paper because
 we know well that it
 will be noth more than
 a paper guarantee that is
 not worth the snap ofa
 man s finger Sir I
 can look upon this proposition
 as well as the one
 which has emanated from the
 House of Representatives as nothing
 else than a delu Mon
 and a snare intended to
 operate upon tho public sentiment
 of the seceding States to
 case them off to put
 arguments in the mouths of
 the subruission party iii those
 States to urge upon the
 people a little more delay
 a little more folding of
 the arnos a little more
 procrastination to enable them to
 say put it off let
 us What these great propositions
 of the Senator from Kentucky
 and others will work out
 let us see if we
 cannot cret concessions from the
 northern States try every thi
 ng in the Union as
 my friend from Penn sylytmi4
 has suggested Sir we have
 tried the Union for twenty
 five years since this agitation
 commenced and what has it
 produced We have been remonstrating
 we have been threatening but
 instead of producing a revulsion
 of public sentiment how has
 it operated Twenty five years
 ago they had but seven
 thousand men to support tknir
 candidate for the Presidency Now
 they have carried one of
 the most ultra and I
 had almost said one of
 the most infamous of men
 not in person but in
 politics one of the most
 ultra men ay two of
 them into the Presidency and
 Vice Presidency of the United
 States by over whelming majorities
 in every free State From
 seven thousand they have run
 up in twenty five years
 to one million eight hundred
 and fifty thou sand That
 has been the result of
 our preaching and our prayers
 and our expostulations and our
 beseechings of our northern brethren
 to do us jus tice
 and of our threats to
 dissolve if they did not
 And sir they have accomplished
 all this in the face
 ofa party in possession of
 the Federal Gov ernment and
 of its power and patronage
 to the contrary They have
 accomplished all these things without
 the patronage and power of
 the Federal Government Now when
 they have that power and
 that patronage with the whole
 ma chinery of the Federal
 Government in their hands what
 are we to expect but
 a rapid consummation of the
 dire and terrible results which
 I have feebly depicted Sir
 believing that these propositions whatever
 may bc the intention of
 the parties who urge them
 can result in nothing but
 delay and pro crastination I
 shall not give the resolution
 my I believe the question
 is sanction or support as
 I remarked the other day
 no settled und power this
 side of heaven can avert
 the result South Carolina is
 already determined as I believe
 cverybody admits and nobody doubts
 the gal Jantry and determination
 of that small State She
 has determined to risk all
 upon this die and I
 can tell Senators that there
 are other States whose fate
 is no less certain than
 Carolina Even those west of
 the Mississippi are moving and
 although a distinguished gentlcman from
 Texas has come here recently
 as I understand and has
 said that there is no
 secession element in Texas and
 that all rrexas is for
 the Union I apprehend that
 the wish is father to
 the thought but I leave
 the question as to thc
 soundness of that people to
 the distinguished Senators from the
 State who un derstand their
 public sentiment better than I
 do But sir that this
 I_TiWn is to be dissolved
 is a fixed fact and
 no tinkerings with the Constitu
 tion no tinkerings of committees
 of thirty three or thirteen
 in these Houses can avert
 that conse quence Sir before
 I close I desire to
 say a few words by
 way of suggestion to the
 States of Virginia and Maryland
 and especially to the District
 of Columbia I hear here
 every day not only as
 pass the streets but I
 see in the public press
 and m discussions curses loud
 and deep poured out upon
 the devoted heads of the
 southern States who are moving
 in this great question of
 seces sion T hc people
 of the District of Columbia
 have turned all their wrath
 from the true cause of
 these diffculties the Abolitionists of
 the North and are venting
 their spleen and spite against
 us because we are vindicating
 our deliverance and liberty They
 expect that the dissolution of
 this Union is going to
 destroy the capital and that
 their property is to be
 valueless That may be or
 it may not be It
 will depend very much on
 their own conduct in my
 opinion That the five States
 to which I have referred
 will go out of this
 Union before the 4th of
 March and form a confed
 eracy of their own in
 my opinion admits of no
 earthly doubt and that the
 other slave States Inust in
 the rapid process of time
 go out also and join
 us in our cQnfederate action
 L have little less doubt
 I will not undertake to
 discuss the reasons for this
 opinion I express it merely
 Well sir if Virginia and
 Maryland desire to have any
 iQfluence or part in the
 formation of our Tovernment a
 government to which they must
 finally owe their allegiance they
 had better fob low our
 example and go out of
 tho Union quickly and send
 their delegates to join us
 in forming a constitution and
 frame of government for our
 pro It may be that
 a gov tection and our
 support ernment will be formed
 and a constitution enacted and
 put in 0 eration before
 they have had time to
 take part in it and
 that when they go out
 of this 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 51 Union at the
 tail end of which they
 must livc or Glow our
 example and join our confederacy
 they may find elements in
 that constitution and I union
 that may strike at some
 of their peculiar I I
 understand one of the motives
 which influence the tardy action
 of these two States They
 are a little afraid of
 the opening of the African
 slave trade and the cheapening
 of ncgroes Now sir while
 I state here that I
 am opposed to the open
 ing of the African slave
 trade because our ne groes
 will increase fast enough God
 knows for our interest and
 protection and security and while
 believe that the great masses
 of the south ern people
 are opposed to it yet
 I will not stand security
 that if the cotton States
 alone form a confederacy they
 will not open the African
 slave trade and then what
 will become of the great
 monopoly of the negro market
 which Virginia and Maryland and
 North Carolina now possess I
 only throw out thcse suggestions
 I give no advice My
 maxim through life has been
 never to give advice unless
 I am asked for it
 and never to ask advice
 without taking it So sir
 I do not intend to
 arrogate to myself the province
 or the privilege of giving
 advice to those great States
 But sir so far as
 the I istrict of Columbia
 is concerned I want to
 say to the people here
 in all kindness that if
 Maryland secedes from the Union
 and joins us as she
 ought to do in my
 humble conception and a southern
 confederacy bo formed of ail
 the slave States I sce
 no reason why Washington city
 should not be continued i
 the capital of the southern
 confederacy Laugh ter and applause
 in the gallerics Here are
 the buildings ready to our
 hands l he facilities of
 traveling railroads and telegraphs have
 anni hilated time and distance
 as it were and our
 extreme southern Senators and Representatives
 would as soon come to
 Washington to legislate for our
 republic as they would even
 to the central State of
 Georgia FOI one sir I
 would be ill favor of
 continuing Washington as the seat
 of our government Laughter in
 the galleries Some people laugh
 I do not know why
 at that sug gestion It
 isa very important one to
 those people who own brick
 and mortar in this city
 for sir goaded as we
 may be by the taunts
 of these peo ple here
 and obstructed as we may
 be by the tardy action
 of Virginia and Maryland in
 this great movement we may
 form out republic and establish
 our seat of government so
 permanently that it can never
 be retnoved and then these
 marble palaces now teeming with
 life and luxury the habitations
 of beauty and elegance instead
 of echoing with the songs
 of mirth and melody will
 become the habitations of the
 bats and the owls But
 to go back to thc
 original proposition this is a
 mere diversion I tell you
 MI Presi dent that the
 question is settled in relation
 to this great rnovement which
 is now in cer tain
 of the southern States I
 know the clTorts that are
 now bcing made to stay
 the hand of the sotthern
 people and to cool down
 the patriotism which is within
 the southern heart but it
 will be ineffectual sir When
 the arbitrary monarchical Government of
 Louis Phillippe in 1848 had
 aroused the people of Paris
 to a sense of their
 danger and to rebellion and
 the barri cades of Paris
 were raised and the masses
 of that great city wet
 é upheavinff in their majesty
 against the arbitrary power of
 the monarchy Louis P billippe
 saw his danger and attetnpted
 to avert it by changing
 his ministry He turned out
 M Guizot and nominated M
 Thiers as his princi pal
 adviser That he supposed would
 quiet the dissensions which he
 saw around 111m but sir
 thc words too late too
 late went all through the
 streets of Paris The next
 day when devices to stay
 thc storm which now racycs
 in the southern States to
 prevent that people from marching
 on to the deliverance and
 liberty upon which they are
 resolved but sir the words
 too late that ring here
 to day will be reiterated
 from mountain to valley in
 alf the South and are
 now sounding the death knell
 of the Federal Union Mr
 PUGH Mr President i am
 greatly en couraged to hope
 well for the country and
 the continuance of the Wnion
 by the extraordili ary speech
 we have just heard for
 if these be the facts
 and the arguments with yhich
 disunion jus tifies itself we
 may well hope that reasons
 so feeble wili impart feebleness
 to the cause itself Applause
 in the galleries I shall
 not follow the Senator from
 Georgia in the long and
 dreary tale of past controversies
 controversies in re gard to
 territorial policy in regard to
 the admis Sion of States
 in regard to tariffacts but
 I shall come to the
 present assertions of fact wherein
 it seems to me the
 Senator has passed beyond the
 ordinary limits Why sir he
 said that he heard me
 declare in this Senate that
 my right arm should fall
 from its shoulder blade before
 I would ever vote for
 the protection of slave property
 in the Territories When did
 the Senator ever hear me
 say it Mr IVERSON Last
 winter in the early part
 of the session or words
 to that effect Mr PUGH
 Why sir the journals of
 this Senate show that I
 voted for the resolutions of
 the Senator from Mississippi Mr
 Davis side by side with
 the Senator from Georgia he
 Sen ator may not have
 heard me say it but
 I tell him now that
 when the people of any
 State or any organized Territory
 or any organizcd commu nity
 do not desire to have
 the institution of sla very
 my right arm shall fall
 from its shoulder blade before
 I will force it upon
 them Mr IVERSON If the
 Senator will allow me perhaps
 I have madc a mistakc
 as to the time He
 uttered that sentiment during the
 great debate I l think
 on the 2 3d of
 February of last year which
 took place between the Senator
 from Illi nois Mr DOUGLAS
 the Senator from Missis sippi
 Mr DAVIs and others while
 I was in the chair
 The Senator remembers the time
 and he will find that
 he said it I Mr
 PUGH well sir all that
 1 said at that time
 is recorded I told hc
 Senator then as have told
 him now that I ncver
 would by Fed eral authority
 compel any State or any
 l erri tory to accept
 the institution of slavery against
 I her will On the
 other hand if there be
 any State or any Territory
 or any cornmunity that desires
 that institution my right arm
 shall fall from its shoulder
 blade before I would vote
 for an act to prevent
 them from having it I
 tell the Senator that the
 very resolution which he and
 agtun others offered herc in
 this Senate declaring what should
 be the power and authority
 of the Fedcrpl Government in
 regard to property in the
 Terri tories received my vote
 and it stands there on
 the Journal of the Senate
 More than that if I
 have a definite recollection the
 fourth resolution the third I
 think it was which declared
 that all forms of property
 known to the laws of
 the several States stood upon
 an equal footing in the
 Tl erritories and everywhere else
 so far as Fed eral
 jurisdiction is concerned I think
 that was the purport of
 it also rcceivcd my vote
 Now sir I am coming
 to the other errors of
 fact in which the Senator
 indulged As I said I
 do not wonder that the
 good people of Georgia are
 misled when a Senator who
 has sat hére for five
 years in this Chamber seems
 to be so utterly at
 fault in speaking of transactions
 occurring every day in one
 half the country The Senator
 told us that the fugitive
 slave law was executed by
 force of arms in the
 northern States How many Thcn
 we are told that there
 are mobs flow many There
 never was but one mob
 in the State which have
 the honor to represent and
 that was in the northern
 portion of it and those
 very men were indicted and
 fined and in iprjs oned
 and when they were brought
 before five Re publican judges
 claiming that their impi isOpmet
 t wras illegal those ju
 dges remanded them to PFisoh
 But the Senator says that
 while We ha ve dis
 orderly persons who are in
 erfering with the recapture of
 the slave the great bod
 of the com munity stand
 quietly by or look on
 with derision Why sir any
 community may have a mob
 any community may have its
 laws violated suddenly and without
 notice but tell the Senator
 that so far as the
 northwestern States are concerned there
 never has been an occasion
 when the great body of
 the community stood by and
 allowed any such outrage as
 that never Instead of givinc
 real grievances to stand upon
 it is by his invention
 of history it is by
 this assertion of things as
 facts which are not facts
 it is by de claring
 as th Senator from Georgia
 has done that the people
 of the northern States have
 set on foot some policy
 in regard to the institution
 of slavery in the southern
 States that all this vast
 cloud of passion and misrepresentation
 is raised in both extremes
 of the country Now sir
 I do not believe that
 ninety nine huh dredths of
 the men who voted for
 Mr Lincoln thought anything about
 the subject of slavery in
 the States or had any
 policy on the subject They
 were opposed to the introduction
 of slavery into the Territories
 They were in favor of
 a general division of the
 ofiices and the plunder Many
 of them wanted protection to
 iron and I do not
 know what all but most
 of them were animated by
 a thorough hatred of the
 Democratic party But as for
 any policy in their minds
 bear mg upon the institutions
 of the southern States believe
 this day if the question
 were put in any shape
 that even in New England
 though I can not speak
 for her iri every State
 of the North there is
 a large Inajority of the
 people who are opposed to
 ail y interference whatever Now
 sir passing by these allesred
 outrages passing by all thiglong
 story ofthings twice told twice
 narrated the Senator seems to
 glory in the suggestion that
 this Union is now to
 be severed and that all
 that remains is whether the
 good peo ple of the
 District of Columbia will have
 their he found the streets
 barricaded hc abdicated the I
 times has it ever been
 executed by force of arms
 throne in favor of his
 grandson and made an Mr
 IVERSON Many times effort through
 his friends to obtain the
 rc rency Mr PUGH Never
 in the State that 1
 have oc his daughter t
 he mother of the Count
 of Paris the honor in
 part to represent When that
 was done in the hope
 that he might Mr IVERSON
 Was it not in the
 case of quell the insurrection
 then raisin around hiln Burns
 the same words too låte
 ran through all the i
 Mr PUGH That is one
 The Senator said massesofParis rincringoutin
 sepulchral tones like it was
 only executed by force of
 arms Wbv the trump of
 tho archangel sutnmoning the dead
 i sir I live on
 the borders of slaveholding and
 non to judæmcnt So now
 sir you may tinker the
 slaveholding States and tell him
 it is execut ed Constitution
 if you please you nmy
 propose i every day or
 nearly every day It is
 so com concessions you may
 suggest additional legisla mon an
 occurrence that it does not
 even collect a tion you
 may present additional constitutional I
 mob of six men to
 look at it It is
 in constant securities you may
 attempt by all these ingenious
 operation effects administered by the
 northern fr southern I branch
 of the concern Mr IVERSON
 Will the Senator allow me
 to interrupt him and read
 his language on the occasion
 to which 1 referred Mr
 PUGH Certainly Mr IVERSON Here
 is what the Senator uttered
 on the 23d of February
 1859 Mr P0Gi1 Mr President
 Iam 10th to go into
 this dis cussion and I
 think it was all unnecessary
 but when I entered the
 Chamber this morning the Senator
 from Mis sissippi Mr BROWN
 was engaged in some very
 impas sionate demand on certain
 Senators from the northern States
 and when desired to Know
 the nature of this de
 mand not having been present
 in the early part of
 his speech I was referred
 to Other Senators who heard
 it bilt I understood the
 Senator to demand from the
 representa tives of the northern
 States on this floor whether
 they would agree to the
 passage of an act of
 Congress to protect slaves in
 the Territories taken there by
 the consent of their masters
 againSt the local legislation 1
 answer the Sena tor unhcsitatingly
 never while I live never
 Mr PUGH That is what
 1 said Now why did
 not the Senator read the
 whole of it when he
 quoted it before I say
 I never made the asser
 t on which the Senator
 charged me with this morning
 The assertion which I did
 acknowledge to is here But
 r understood the Senator to
 demand from the rep resentatives
 ot the nmtlrern States on
 this floor whether they would
 agree to the passage of
 an act of Congress to
 protect slaves in the I
 erritories taken there by the
 consent of their nnasters against
 the local legislation That was
 the whole point of the
 question Mr IVERSON That is
 just what we of the
 South demand that no local
 legislation shåll in terfere with
 our rights Mr PUGH If
 the Senator had said 1
 made that declaration should not
 have interrupted him but when
 hc omits the material part
 of it and stands here
 to have his declarations go
 forth to his constituents as
 expressing the temper of northern
 Senators i do think that
 I have a right to
 complain of them No man
 can be eXpected upon the
 sadden spur of a question
 to make every qualification The
 Senator knows he cannot 52
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 11
 have forgatten perhaps that is
 more than I ought to
 say I do not mean
 it in any offensive sense
 he can hardly have forgotten
 that controversy It engaged every
 member of _the Senate Lt
 was suddenly sprung upon us
 None of us looked upon
 the question whcthcr slave property
 should or should not go
 intor the Territories but it
 was in regard to the
 power of CongresS to interfere
 in the local affairs Of
 the Territory slavery among them
 But I tell him again
 when he informs his constituents
 that the northern people are
 not wil ling to give
 the protection of this Government
 to the full extent of
 its constitutional authority equally to
 property in slaves with all
 other prop erty let him
 apply to my honorable friend
 from Mississippi who introduced those
 famous caucus resolutions and he
 will find whether I did
 not vote for every one
 of them except onc which
 un dértook to interpret Ilie
 powers of the Territorial Legislatures
 I believe I did vote
 against that resolution but with
 the information I afterwards received
 from the mover of it
 I might have voted I
 have felt that it was
 due to rhyself and my
 constituents that I should contradict
 the Sena tor s assertions
 of fact contradict the assertion
 that the fugitive slave law
 is habitually trampled under foot
 contradict the asscrtion that slaves
 cannot bc rccovercd by the
 ordinary instrumen tality of the
 law in the northern States
 They can and they are
 The cases of exception such
 as thé case Of Bums
 the cases in which the
 law is disi egarded are
 fex v and trivial Why
 sir how many slaves have
 ever been lost Mr IVERSON
 1 will respond to the
 Sena top That would be
 impossiblc for me or any
 body else to ascertain I
 apprehend but I will state
 a fact More than fifteen
 perhaps twenty years aoo I
 saw an elaborate report made
 ou t by a special
 committee raised by the Legislature
 of the State of Virginia
 upon that very question to
 ascertain what were the losses
 of the State of Virginia
 in fugitive slaves and even
 at that tirnc when ne
 groes were selling at not
 morc than half tl le
 pres ent value the report
 estimated the annual loss to
 be 100 000 Mr PUGH
 I will venture to say
 that she has never lost
 100 000 in negroes since
 she has becn in the
 Union nor all of them
 together Your fugitive slave law
 is not twenty five years
 old When you called for
 new one you got it
 The Senator said that the
 North resisted the admission of
 certain slaveholding States What one
 did she ever keep out
 of the Union Was not
 Missouri admitted Was not Texas
 ad milted W herc did
 the votes come from by
 which they were admitted No
 sir there are causes of
 trouble legitimate causes which it
 i our duty both from
 the Nofth and the South
 to look upon with an
 anxious desire to removo them
 but these invented causes of
 complaint this standing upon mere
 questions of made history not
 to be found seems to
 me with due respcct to
 thc Senator from Georgia unworthy
 of him I think the
 Senator in a his anxiety
 for the new crusade of
 southern deliverance has allowed his
 passion to get the better
 of his judgment Mr DOUGLAS
 Mr President 1 do not
 pose to enter into this
 discussion any further thall to
 make a remark in response
 to the charge of the
 Senator from Gcorgia that the
 fugitive slave law is not
 enforced in the northern States
 That like many other laws
 is not enforced in all
 cases 1 suppose there never
 was a law upon the
 statute book of Congress or
 of any State or I
 erritory of this Union that
 was not sometimcs allowed to
 be violated with impunity or
 not enforced with as much
 fidelity as we would wish
 I suppose the fugitive slave
 law is not the only
 one in this country that
 is notÆ11ways enforced I presurne
 it is enforced with quite
 as much fidelity as that
 in regard to the African
 slave trade or the laws
 on many other subjects But
 sir I confess it is
 not enfoFced as faithfully as
 I wish it was not
 as faithfully as it ought
 to be Millile I make
 this declaration ail compelled to
 say that I think that
 nine tenths of the complaints
 upon that subject are unfounded
 When any sectional strife and
 sectional excitement occurs there seems
 æo be a proneness on
 the part of the newspaper
 press of both sections to
 collect together every fact that
 will inflamc tho passions and
 prejudices of its own section
 agains the other and in
 that way a partial and
 unfaiy r epq tuc ts
 is given which makes each
 section act under a misappre
 hension of the other In
 regard to the fugitive slave
 law so far as Illinois
 is concerned f am prepared
 to say that in my
 opinion in nineteen cases out
 of every twenty where a
 fugwve slave enters Illinois he
 is arrested and returned without
 any judicial pro cess whatsoever
 Those portions of the State
 that border on Missouri and
 Kentucky live in htmony with
 their neighbors on the other
 side and the fugitive slave
 is retårned as regularly as
 a horse or any other
 property that is stolen So
 in nineteen cases out of
 twenty the fugitive is returned
 The newspapers do not notice
 the fact Even the records
 of your court have no
 minute of In other cases
 where there is an arrest
 as a it matter of
 course they rcturn him if
 he turns out to bc
 a fugitive and there is
 no excitement upon the subject
 But perhaps in the twentieth
 case the fugitive gets into
 that portion of the country
 where public sentiment is more
 excited and once in awhile
 a rescue is made Then
 the newspapers are filled with
 the horrors of that rescue
 One case of rescue is
 paraded in the newspaper press
 of the whole country and
 although it IS an excep
 tional case it is represented
 as evidence of the general
 rule 1 recollect ohe instancc
 of that kind occurring in
 my own State and that
 instance I have noticed in
 more than twenty newspapers in
 the last two months paraded
 in the southern country as
 an evidence of the infidelity
 of our people in the
 en forccment of the law
 The newspapers tell us that
 last May perhaps a fugitive
 was arrested by his master
 in the town of Ottawa
 and rescued by some Abolitionists
 There the tale stops and
 then corncs the co nment
 how can people live together
 where such outrages are perpetrated
 The tale so far as
 it is told I bclicve
 to be true but it
 is not all told If
 they had wished to deal
 fairly they would have recorded
 the further fact that the
 next day the United States
 marshal made his appearance at
 tbc town of Ottowe and
 ar rested the rescuers took
 them to Chicago before the
 United States commissioner had them
 com mitted to trial and
 in default of bail remanded
 them to prison and kept
 them in prison until the
 1st of October and then
 brought them out for trial
 and after indictment before a
 grand jury and a fair
 trial before a petit jury
 thcy wcrc called up and
 sentenced by a Republican judge
 of the United States court
 to the penalties of thölaw
 and remanded again to prison
 to be kept there until
 they paid the fines and
 costs I hat is the
 balance of the case If
 that had been told I
 sup pose the sting would
 have been taken out of
 the whole charge und it
 could not have been used
 as fuel for this sectional
 excitement Sir those cases have
 occurred frequently in our northwestern
 country It is seldom that
 a rescue is madc wherc
 the penalties are not enforced
 upon the rescuers and then
 civil suits are brought to
 get pay fbr thc slaves
 and the damages and the
 damages are not generally limited
 to the value but smart
 money by way of exemplary
 punish ment is usually enforccd
 I think therefore there is
 very little ground for complaint
 so far as the section
 of country in which I
 live is concerned on this
 subject of fugitive slaves and
 yet I know that the
 southern people are induced to
 believe a slave is never
 rcturncd that if they once
 get into a northern State
 they are gone forever ünd
 they are made to believe
 so simply because the cases
 of actual return are never
 published and only the exceptional
 case of rescue comes to
 the knowl edge of the
 country I wish we could
 have a list of e
 all thc fugitives and of
 the number returned and of
 the number that have been
 rescued and I venture the
 assertion that southern gentlemen would
 bc utterly arnazed at the
 fidelity with which that law
 has been executed I believe
 if they could have a
 record of all thc cases
 and a truc statement of
 the fact they would be
 ashamed to up that subject
 as one of the cau
 ses of conen plaißt which
 justify the dissolution oftbis Union
 I have no apology to
 make for the personal lib
 erty bills I believe they
 were made in violation o
 the spirit and Inost of
 thern in violation of the
 letter of the Constitution I
 believe they never should havc
 been upon the statute book
 think they out cht to
 be repealed at once I
 think our northern people ought
 to repeal them as a
 duty to tl emselves and
 not upon the demand of
 the southern people We should
 put ourselves in the right
 and the first step should
 be to take them from
 the statute book iör they
 are calculated to defent the
 faithful performance of a constitutional
 obligation The State that I
 have the honor to represent
 has never passed any such
 law Our legislation has been
 friendly to the performance of
 every constitutional obligation I wish
 there was no cause of
 complaint in other States But
 yet while we hear the
 personal liberty bills pre sented
 as the cause of disunion
 we are told and so
 far as I know the
 Statement is true thatin no
 one case have those bills
 been the cause of de
 priving the master from recapturing
 his slave Those bills generally
 exist in those parts of
 the country where fugitives never
 go It so happens that
 there is the greatest excite
 ment upon this question just
 in proportion as you recede
 from the line between the
 free and the slave States
 Those of us that live
 upon the bor er and
 have commercial intercourse and social
 rela tions across the line
 can live in peacewith each
 other There never was a
 time when my friend from
 Missouri and myself could not
 have settled this question by
 referring it to two justices
 of the peace selected on
 either side of the river
 and let them choose a
 third and agree by the
 award Those who live next
 to each other are friendly
 to each othci If you
 go Norths up into Vermont
 where they scarcely ever see
 a slave and would not
 know how he looked they
 are disturbed by the wrongs
 of the poor slave just
 in proportion as they are
 ignorant of the South When
 you get down South into
 Georgia and Alabama where they
 never lose any slaves they
 are disturbed by the outrages
 and losses under the non
 fülfillment of the fugitive law
 just in proportion as they
 have no interest in it
 and dd not know what
 they are talking about Laughter
 and apphuse in the galleries
 Now sir The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Mr FITZPAT RICK in the
 chair The Senator will suspend
 his remarks for moment to
 allow the Chair to admonish
 the galleries It becomes the
 duty of the Chair to
 say to the galleries that
 it is his im perative
 duty to maintain order A
 renewal of the disorder in
 the galleries will impose upon
 him a very unpleasant duty
 that is the enforcement of
 the rules of the Senate
 which requires him to clear
 them Mr DOUGLAS Now sir
 as between nois and Kentucky
 we should have no diffculty
 in settling this question Between
 Kentucky and Ohio and Indiana
 I have no doubt they
 would settle it upon terms
 satisfactory to them So be
 tween Maryland and Pennsylvania In
 fact if the border States
 the border free States and
 the border slaveholding States who
 know the evils of which
 they complain and the appropriate
 remedy for those evils should
 be pernnitted to decide this
 question I assure you the
 Union would last for If
 this Union is to be
 severed fit will be ever
 because the two extremes who
 are so far from each
 other that they do not
 understand the evils of the
 question are each acting under
 a misap prehension towards the
 other and hence are doing
 Injustice to each other Sir
 as I said x vhen
 I urose am not going
 into the discussion of the
 merits of any of these
 ques tions My ob ect
 in rising was to sustain
 my friend from 01110 in
 the declaration so far as
 our northwrestern country is concerned
 that the fugi tive slave
 law is executed with as
 much fidelity as most laws
 upon the statute books of
 the Union and in those
 cases where there has been
 violence used so that the
 slaves have been rescued after
 the arrest usually there have
 been prosecutions and penalties enforced
 and in addition suits brought
 and the value of the
 slaves and damages recov eyed
 in every case so far
 as I know I will
 be willing to leave the
 question to Judge McLean and
 abidc his decision whether during
 the whole pe riod he
 lias been upon the bench
 in the Northwest he ever
 knew a jury in any
 northwestern State to refuse to
 find a verdict where the
 facts would permit a verdict
 to be found Judge McLean
 Republican as he is has
 executed that fugitive save law
 with entire fidelity so far
 as I know I do
 not think that any man
 who has ever wit nessed
 those trials in our courts
 would impeach either the impartiality
 or the fidelity of any
 one of the United States
 judges or the finding of
 the jury in any one
 case in that part of
 the country in which I
 reside There may be an
 exception If there is I
 am not aware of it
 There may be 1860 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 53 instances where
 fugitive slaves run away and
 are never found There are
 instances where our horscs are
 stolen and carried off and
 we never find them But
 I am speaking of the
 causes of complaint which arise
 from the non execution of
 the law and I say
 that justice has not been
 re fused where a case
 has ever been brought before
 Judge McLean or where an
 attempt has been made to
 bring it before a constitutional
 court I apologize again to
 the Senate for having ex
 tended these remarks My object
 is not to create irritation
 but to soothe the excited
 state of feeling in order
 that we may discuss this
 question in a proper temper
 and upon its merits I
 repeat my purpose is to
 meet this question fairly Letusasccr
 tain precisely the points in
 dispute letuslayaside all sectional feelings
 and party strife and see
 if we cannot agree upon
 a line of policy which
 will secure equal rights equal
 protection and equal iustice to
 every State and to the
 citizens of every State in
 this Union Mr THOMSON 1
 do not rise at this
 to make a speech but
 simply to ask a question
 of the Senator from Georgia
 He referred to a New
 Jersey casc in which the
 fugitive slave law had not
 been executed I am not
 aware of any such case
 and i svill be very
 much obliged to him if
 he will tell me what
 case he refers to Mr
 IVERSON about it Of course
 i rely upon newspaper authority
 The facts v rcre stated
 in the ilewspapers not now
 remember the name it has
 passed out of my memory
 but thc case was this
 the mar shak of your
 State or one of his
 deputies went to a house
 to arrest a fugitive slave
 upon the aflidavit of his
 owner or the agent of
 the owner The fugitive was
 confined in the house and
 refused to surrendcr himsclfup The
 marshal summoned a posse of
 some eight or ten perhaps
 fifteen or twenty The fugitive
 asked that the arrest might
 be deferred until morning and
 that he might be allowed
 to stay in the house
 until morning T hc marshal
 granted it and in the
 mean time a mob came
 and drove the marshal and
 his posse off Mr THOMSON
 That is your newspaper account
 I have never heard of
 it Mr TEN EYCK 1
 db not mean sir at
 this time to enter into
 this discussion bccausc I be
 lieve if there are friends
 of the Union upon this
 floor they had better cease
 their wrangling and endeavor to
 do something to save that
 Union I simply rise however
 for the purpose of stating
 the facts of the case
 to which allusion has been
 m4de where it was charged
 that New Jersey had offered
 resistance to the fugitive slave
 lavv upon a recent occasion
 I was certain that the
 honorable Senator who made that
 declaration was icrnorant of the
 facts or he never would
 have made it Sir that
 casc occurred within the last
 three It occurred within the
 county where I weeks live
 t happened within two miles
 of the county town where
 I reside and profess to
 be familiar It happened two
 or three days with the
 facts before I left home
 for the purpose of rcsumino
 my seat upon this floor
 The simple facts are these
 ten white men and one
 black man the Inost of
 tho white men coming from
 the city of Philadelphia headcd
 by a Inan by the
 name of Albcrti who has
 figured largely in transactions of
 this kind before camc to
 the house of a negro
 man in four carriages at
 ten o clock at night
 whcthcr possessed of warrants or
 not I know not for
 they never showed them They
 asked for admission of the
 owner of that house who
 was alleged to be a
 fugitive slave a man by
 the name of Pct ry
 Simmons Tho inmates of that
 house were Simmons his wife
 and child Thev asked for
 admi siorv aud upon boing
 refused claimed that they came
 there to arrest him upon
 a warrant fora larceny He
 rcfuscd to open the door
 They burst the door in
 Ele retreated to the head
 of the stairway held a
 gnn in his ha_nds and
 his wife seized an ax
 The marshal to whom allu
 Sion has been made offered
 to ascend the stairs and
 arrest him He declared that
 he would take life if
 necessary to protect himself and
 this worthy marshal with his
 posse of nine men and
 onc negro left the house
 and stood about thc door
 of that house until daylightin
 the morning without proccedinæ further
 to execute thcir war rant
 with no other man beincr
 present about those premises At
 daylight the son ofa farmer
 with whom I am well
 acquainted hearing thc uproar started
 to this house the man
 being engacred as a workman
 upon his farm to ascertain
 what the difiiculty was He
 is a highly respectable man
 and his account is that
 as he approached this marshal
 with his posse they told
 him to stop for if
 hc came any nearer it
 would be at the risk
 of his life He then
 said he would sce what
 the occasion of the uproar
 was and left the ground
 and immediately this posse with
 their marshal scrambled to their
 carriages whipped up their horses
 and madc their escape from
 the county and took refuge
 in the city Of Philadel
 phia This is what the
 Senator from Gcorgia calls a
 refusal on the part of
 conservative Now Jersey to execute
 the fugitive slave law This
 too oc curred within two
 miles from a court house
 which upon the last occasion
 of the arrest of three
 fugi tive slaves did by
 the voice of a jury
 of the in dependent farmers
 of the county of Burlington
 return those three fugitive slaves
 to the constitu ents of
 the Senator from Maryland without
 a single voice being raised
 on the part of any
 one to gainsay their action
 or their right Thesc mat
 ters are misrepresented and as
 the honorable Scnator from Illinois
 said the South do not
 un derstand the truc feeling
 of the North upon this
 subject They seem to me
 to greedily catch at every
 newspaper story no matter how
 false it may be or
 how colored it may bd
 for the pur pose of
 inflamiw acyøravating and exciting the
 public mind of the South
 against the true hearted men
 of the North With these
 remarks sir I leave the
 subject Mr GREEN Mr President
 1 live upon the western
 bank of the Mississippi and
 every naorn ing I look
 at the soil of two
 States and when I go
 to the top of my
 house I look at the
 soil of three I mean
 Missouri and Illinois Having lived
 there for more than twenty
 years I have a good
 deal of experience and while
 I do not in tend
 to make a speech to
 excite any passions I think
 it right in a love
 meeting to state one s
 experience The people of Illinois
 so far as I have
 had in tercourse with them
 if you bring a palpable
 case beforc them arrest the
 negro and bring him into
 court will generally enforce the
 fugitive slave law but in
 nine cases out of tcn
 fou cannot thus I prosecuted
 a case which bring him
 into court was decided in
 the supreme court of Illinois
 before Judge Douglas I was
 the prosecuting lawyer and he
 the judge upon the l
 cnch whcn the jury found
 the defendant guilty and I
 believe some of that same
 feeling prevails to this day
 But how many of those
 cases come into court Not
 ono in twenty A gentleman
 residing in he saw nine
 neo roes I Ifinois told
 me this fall brought there
 and put into a railroad
 car arid locked up and
 sent forward to Chicago without
 it being In the power
 of anybody to rescue them
 secure them or otherwise Once
 in a while you catch
 one but the nine go
 I remember reading of one
 who was healed of lcprosy
 and he gave thanks to
 God but the question was
 where were the nine None
 returned thanks save onc and
 I do not say so
 it is with the fugitive
 slaves this to the prejudice
 of the law abiding good
 people of Illinois They will
 carry out the law in
 a stroncr case if you
 bring it before their eyes
 but they will not see
 it unlcss you force them
 to do so and thcv
 will shut their eyes if
 they can I mean many
 or them T hc people
 of Blooming ton do it
 and tho manacrcrs of the
 railroad there do it and
 my constituents suffer in consequence
 of their doing it I
 want something more effective I
 know that I if you
 will pick out forty men
 of Illinois and forty mcn
 of Missouri they will ali
 say We will stand by
 the law and the Constitution
 in the practical admin They
 will all say it istration
 of affairs in the actual
 occurrences that take place is
 this thing so If not
 what is the remedy Divide
 Well if there is no
 other Now I know that
 the fugitive slave law is
 not executed no I will
 not say that I am
 using improper language but I
 will say this that nine
 out of ten of the
 fugitive slaves are not returned
 I know that some horses
 are lost but they ore
 not lost under the same
 influences or the same circumstances
 It is not a vitiated
 corrupt and base hypocritical sentiment
 that leadS men to steål
 horses it is pecuniary gain
 only It is nat so
 with the negro When he
 is stolen and secreted and
 run off there is something
 behind something more than the
 hope of pecuniary reward II
 know they get the reward
 for the man that put
 thosc nine negroes at Bloomington
 into the car and locked
 them up told and showed
 the letter of acknowl edgment
 that he got fifty dollars
 a head for do ing
 it Who paid him Black
 Republicans of Chicago Now I
 am telling truths that I
 can proveän a court of
 justice and ahese are only
 mere exam pies to illustrate
 the enormity of the injury
 that we suffer every day
 The good men of Illinois
 are as good as the
 good men anywhere the good
 men of Ohio are as
 good as the good men
 any where and so I
 can say of all the
 northern States but there are
 bad men there are corrupt
 men and there are men
 who think they are conscientious
 and yet are influenced by
 a fanaticism that drives them
 headlong régardless ofcohsequences to the
 injury of our population and
 the destruction of our property
 How can we stop that
 There arc but two ways
 to do it One way
 is for a reaction of
 tbut public sentiment by honest
 and fair and manly appeals
 the other is by physical
 power to pre I am
 for the physical power I
 want a vent strong Government
 I want a Government strong
 enough to discharge its functions
 and if it is not
 I would spit upon the
 Government OA Govern ment that
 promises and guaranties and enacts
 and cannot execute and enforce
 is such a Gov ernment
 as I do not want
 and it ought to be
 the most pitiable contemptible object
 on the face of God
 s earth and the man
 who would advocate it I
 should think Ought to skulk
 behind the bush and hide
 himself fs the Government worthy
 of being respected Yes Are
 its guarantees to be carried
 out Yes How One man
 says by pub lic sentiment
 Well that is a glorious
 mode it suits my approbation
 precisely it meets my feel
 ings but if you do
 not get that consent and
 that common approbation how then
 Thereis nothing but physical power
 to do it Do you
 say that that will drive
 us into disunion Let it
 do it Do you say
 that it will drive us
 into despotism into a centralization
 of the Government Let it
 come I I had rather
 this moment have a centralized
 Gov crnment a despotism with
 Louis Napoleon and the Prince
 of Wales over me this
 hour than have anarchy and
 confusion and nolaw and no
 respect for my rights That
 is my determination and I
 intend to act upon it
 It may look to some
 as if were advocating monarchy
 Be it so In the
 language of Thomas Jefferson I
 would rzuher have one good
 monarch than four hundred bad
 ones for if despotism has
 to come if anarchy and
 confusion arc to prevail if
 truth is to be abolished
 and constitutional guarantees set at
 naught give me vicor and
 energy and power Nox v
 I know that the fugitive
 slave law is enforced in
 proper cases generally but nine
 cases out of ten evade
 the law and never come
 before the law and therefore
 it x vill not do
 for my friends from Ohio
 and Illinois with their good
 intentions and with the truthfulness
 which I know distinguishes them
 to say the law is
 main taincd W fiile they
 are telling the truth in
 that they lose sight of
 the other point that nine
 cases out of ten do
 not come to the knowledge
 of the law and no
 cognizance is taken of them
 There is no evasion we
 may say but it is
 all secret private Our property
 is stolen but if you
 will put on the border
 a police armed and equipped
 strong enough to enforce the
 law from the North remedy
 I say divide but I
 think there is another to
 the South from the East
 to the West and to
 to make use of At
 any rate let us attempt
 it protect the North from
 wrongs from the South That
 is to arm the Federal
 Governrucnt with and to protect
 the South from wrongs from
 the power cnougb to protect
 and enforce YVherevcr North to
 protect one section against invasion
 the functions of the Federal
 Government arc from another you
 will be but accomplishing a
 vested wherever its power extends
 there givc it duty imposed
 upon you by the Federal
 Constitu I will tion which
 no man yet has ever
 opened his mouth adequate physical
 force to carry it out
 If you call it a
 military despotism do to have
 accomplished in the Congress of
 the do that so I
 would rather have military despotism
 I United States I Sir
 this thing must be done
 or I make no than
 anarchy and confusion 54 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 11 threat
 I speak of consequences like
 the Senator Captain Pitman the
 constable marched into the from
 New Hampshire division is as
 certain as court room holding
 a physician by the collar
 with that God lives And
 why Bccause th ere is
 such one hand and a
 negro man with the other
 and a divcrsity the extreme
 North that said If your
 honor please I caught this
 Dr controls the North and
 the extreme South that controls
 the South that there must
 be time to reflect and
 correct these two ext remes
 or ve How arc we
 to get that time to
 correct divide thiS public sentiment
 in the two cxtrcmcs both
 of which we conderhn Only
 by planting a strong policc
 upon the border It is
 the last hope it is
 the only hope within the
 limits of the Constitu tion
 I intend to stand by
 the Constitution as long as
 it is worthy of being
 preserved and as a friend
 tö it I shall insist
 upon its being carried out
 Mr President it does no
 good for Senators to statc
 individual cases I can state
 hundreds of individual cases Because
 of in y proximity to
 the bQfdcr and rny connection
 with the partics I know
 morc of it than most
 Senators do I have soon
 more of it mingled with
 more of it know morc
 of it The law in
 Illinois is aenct aily en
 forced in cases to which
 public attcntion is called but
 nine cases out of ten
 elude and evade the law
 arid 1 suppose it is
 so with Kentucky with Ma
 and with other States I
 want to correct all that
 and I have only made
 this statcmcnt for the purpose
 of showing that while Senators
 can with propriety with hbnor
 with manliness and with statesmanship
 show that the law is
 enforced when the cases are
 brought into court yet they
 lose sight of this other
 fact that nine cases out
 of ten never come into
 court nor is any cognizance
 ever takpn of them by
 the public Mr DOUGLAS Mr
 Presidcnt one in explanation My
 friend from Missouri who now
 sits behind me General CLARK
 of the Elouse of Representatives
 resides in that putt of
 his State nearest to that
 portion of Illinois where the
 law would be the least
 likely to be executed and
 yct he can bear the
 stron crest possible testimony that
 any man can from his
 personal knowledge of tl e
 execution of the law in
 Illinois but let us talc
 the Senator s facts as
 ho states them I Ie
 tells us that in all
 instances where the attention of
 the courts is brought to
 the subject a properc ase
 is rnade out the law
 is faithfully exccutcd that Lhat
 is thc genertll rule Well
 sir is not that all
 that any Inan can ask
 When you talk about the
 non cxe cution of laws
 do you speak of cases
 that nre never brought to
 the attention ot the courts
 f my horse is stolen
 and goes to Missouri and
 is harborcd by the neighbor
 of the Senator can I
 complain of him or of
 his courts unless I go
 and identify the horse and
 call the attention of the
 authorities to the fact that
 hc is stolen It is
 a new doctrine that we
 are guilty of non fi
 llfillment of the law when
 we admiDist crit fairly and
 justly in every case brought
 to our notice The corn
 plaint of the Senator is
 that while we administer the
 law fairly and impartially in
 thosc cases w herc au
 arrest is made and the
 attent ibn of the author
 ities is drawn to the
 subject in nine eases out
 of ten they ID not
 call the atu ntion of
 our authori ties to fact
 Whose fhtllt is that Mr
 GREEN Will the Senator allow
 mc to explain Mr DOUGLAS
 Yes sir GREEN I will
 simply explain whose fault it
 is Mr DOUGLAS very well
 Mr GREEN It is of
 who tivnte that kind of
 sentiment which enables thern to
 secrete our property and to
 prevent anybody catching hold of
 the fhc t that it
 is harbored If the pcoplc
 of Missouri wore to inculcato
 a senti ment encouraging the
 stealing of his horse I
 would hold myself responsible for
 it Mr DOUGLAS Mr President
 1 was speak ing only
 of the non exccutiou of
 the law in those cases
 where it is proper for
 tl 1C authorities to take
 coganzane e The Senator alluded
 to a single case occurring
 as he said when I
 was on the bench and
 he was the attorney That
 was a case too where
 he did not call the
 attention of our authorities tp
 the facts it was a
 case where our own citizens
 took the initiative I remember
 it very well IMP GREEN
 on a reward offered by
 my friend General Durkee 1Mr
 DOUGLAS There may have been
 a re ward offered but
 the man did not get
 it or ask for it
 Onc morning just after 1
 had opened court Eels running
 off a fugitive Slavo this
 mornitp contrary to thc statute
 of Illinois and have brought
 him and the slave into
 court to know IVhat I
 shall do with them I
 said Captain Pitman you will
 hand the slave and the
 Doctor over to the sheriff
 and go to the grand
 jury and state the facts
 In a short time the
 grand jury came in with
 a bill of indictment against
 Dr Eels for harboring secreting
 and attempting to run off
 a fugitive slave contrary to
 the statute of Illinois not
 contrary to the laws of
 the United States When the
 jury were called and the
 facts were all proved the
 counsel for the defense moved
 an instruction to the jury
 that they must acquit be
 cause the Suprerne Court of
 the United States had decided
 in the case of Prigg
 against Pennsylva nia which had
 just been published and which
 they presented to the court
 that the power and the
 duty of surrendering fugitivc slaves
 was ex clusively in the
 Federal Government and not in
 the Stato governments and that
 thc right of legis lating
 upon that subject was exclusivély
 in Con gress not in
 thc State Legislature and therefore
 that the law of Illinois
 making it a criminal offcnsc
 was unconstitutional and void decided
 that the law of Illinois
 was not upon the same
 sub jcct that the object
 of the law of Illinois
 was not to return fugitive
 slaves but to preserve lhe
 peace and quiet our own
 State that it was a
 mere police regulation of our
 own and that il asmuch
 us the Constitution had guarantied
 the right of a master
 to pursue and recapture his
 slave if thc citizens were
 permitted to interfere with that
 right it would lead to
 a breach of the peace
 which it was tho duty
 of our own Legislature to
 makc criminal and that hence
 our law being a police
 regulation intended to preserve tbc
 peacc of our own people
 was constitutional notwithstanding the fact
 that it aided in the
 execution of laws oc the
 United States which was an
 additional argument in its favor
 ithc jury found Dr Eels
 guilty and I sentenced him
 pretty severely ac cordit g
 to my recollection he got
 nearly the full cxtcnt of
 the law He appcaled to
 the supreme court Of the
 Stiue and the supreme court
 of Illi nois ufli rrned
 the decision He appealcd then
 to the Supreme Court of
 tbc United States but I
 believe he died before the
 casc was decided Mr GREEN
 The judement affirmed but ho
 died beföre it Wits affirmed
 Mr DOUGLAS Yes Now sn
 the case thc Senator cites
 is a case where the
 people of Illinois through their
 own officers interfered and arrested
 a fugitive without tl C
 master knowina w herc hc
 was VThat being thc fact
 and it beincy the o
 enera adli issiot that in
 all those cascs where they
 do call the attention of
 our authorities to the su
 we perfi l lü our
 duties faithfully and irn partially
 I think there is very
 little cause of com I
 really wish that this catalogue
 of griev ances could all
 be no ade out with
 specifications and let us take
 each case in turn and
 I repeat iC it could
 bc done thosc who honestly
 believe that they have tyrievous
 causes of complaint will be
 utterly to know with what
 fidelity this lavv has been
 executed and how little real
 cause of complaint they have
 arisino from that source Mr
 DAVIS the Illinois allow me
 to ask a question as
 hc is about to sit
 down He refers to an
 old case at a t
 inu when possibly the feeling
 tnay have been better than
 it is now The newspapers
 have rc cently given us
 an account of a case
 in the town of bis
 own residence I sce that
 an indictment has been found
 against certain Persons there for
 rescuing a f ugitive slave
 Does that also contain I
 a history of the faithful
 execution of the law Mr
 DOUGLAS well sir 1 stated
 when first rose a casc
 in that very town Mr
 DAVIS Chicago to Mr DOUGLAS
 Yes I stated that in
 a case where a rescue
 took place in Ottowa in
 the Chi cago district the
 next day or very soon
 the marshal went down arrested
 the rescuers and i took
 them t o Chicago and
 they were committed to and
 kept in the Chicago jail
 for about five months until
 the trial rl hey were
 then tried and convicted by
 a jury sitting in the
 city of Chicago and they
 were sentenced by a court
 held in the i city
 of Chic aoo to prison
 and werc sent to prison
 i again until they paid
 1 000 fino onch and
 the costs of the suit
 As that took place not
 very long ago no longer
 ago than last October not
 two months ago have a
 right to suppose that the
 law will now be executed
 with about the same Inasmuch
 as another fidélity as it
 was then rescue has occurred
 I luke it for granted
 thac there wili be another
 indictment another trial another conviction
 and I tåkc it for
 granted fur thermöre that civil
 suits are already pending and
 that the value of the
 negroes in each case together
 with the damages will be
 recovered and the property of
 the rescuers will be sold
 on exe cation to pay
 the judgments and the master
 will find out in the
 end that he madd an
 admirable good sale of his
 negro Laughter It is truc
 that it does pot l
 cturn the fugitives In some
 cases it is a matter
 of hardship that it does
 not return them There Vila
 y bc cases where you
 would not give up your
 negro for any price 1
 though I do think that
 if I owned a servant
 that did not like me
 well enough to stay with
 me ran away I would
 rather get the value of
 hilli and damages for his
 running away than get the
 rdnaway negro back But I
 do not think that this
 case arisino in Chicacro a
 place as stron Yåy anti
 slavcry as any place on
 the continent shows such a
 non fulfillment of the law
 as would be good cause
 for breaking up the Government
 Mr FITCH Mr President were
 it the disclaimers and doubtless
 truthful ones by the Senator
 from Ohio and the Senator
 from Illi nois of the
 correctness of the charge of
 the Senn tor from Georgia
 of the non fulfillment of
 the fu gitive slave law
 in their States 1 should
 deem it worth while to
 r nake one for my
 own State but onc of
 those States being on the
 east and the other on
 the west of us urithout
 any such dis claimer it
 might perhaps be inferred that
 Indiana is not true to
 its constitutional obligation Such is
 not the case Its citizens
 have always fulfilled and in
 full so far as I
 know all their constitu tional
 obligat ons They intend doing
 so under all phases of
 political parties and they desire
 the citizens of other States
 to do the same If
 we have failed in the
 performance of our obligations relative
 to thc rendition of fugitive
 slaves or of any other
 constitutional obligation to thc South
 the citizens of Kentucky our
 border State would certainly know
 it Its representatives here can
 bring the charge It is
 sumcient for me to say
 that for the whole twenty
 five or thirty years of
 my residence within the State
 of Indiana blü one case
 of the rescue of an
 arrested fugitive has corno to
 my knowledge If any other
 attempt ever has been made
 I have known nothing of
 it and the parties implicated
 in that one case were
 so severely punished that no
 repetition of the ex periment
 has been since tried and
 probably it never will be
 tried A word as to
 the question of the Senator
 from Mississippi to the Senator
 from Illinois althotag l the
 occurrence referred to was not
 in my Staie I perceive
 the Senator from Illinois confounds
 two cases Very probably the
 late presidential election has been
 a blank his life The
 Ottawa case was a year
 ago last October I think
 MI DOUGLAS I am not
 mistaken I think and for
 this reason I happened to
 be in Chicago the day
 one of the rescuers vas
 sentenced and read the sentencc
 of the court and his
 speech in reply and I
 had time to do it
 notwithstanding the presidential election was
 then pending Laughter I do
 not confound the two cases
 l he one I was
 talking about where the trial
 and sentence took place at
 Chicago was the Ottawa case
 and the Senator from Mississippi
 then called my attention to
 the fact that there had
 been a res cue in
 Chicago since and I argued
 that inasmuch as the proceedings
 which I mentioned had taken
 place in Chicago not more
 than two months ago the
 fair presumption was that the
 law would be enforced in
 this case also Mr FITCH
 The rescue in Ottawa was
 more than a year since
 The Senator no doubt is
 correct about the time of
 the trial when that occurred
 I do not know But
 I was about to call
 attention to the result of
 a recent case which the
 Senator from Mississippi mentioned It
 seems that the marshal of
 the northern district of Illinois
 was assailed in the street
 and a negro whom he
 had arrested as a fugitive
 was taken from his custody
 The assault was quite unexpected
 but the very ncxt day
 if I mistake not a
 Repul lican 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 55 jury certainly a
 jury consisting of a majority
 of Republicans and among the
 rest if am not mistaken
 the candidate elected for Lieu
 tenant Governor of Illinois indicted
 all the par ties and
 they are now under bonds
 for their appearance at court
 to stand their trial for
 the rescue Mr POWELL As
 reference has been made to
 the action of our neighbors
 over the border by the
 Senator from Indiana it affords
 me very great pleasure to
 state that our neighbors immediately
 adjoining Kentucky Indiana and Illinois
 have usually acted with fidelity
 to us in this matter
 But while that is the
 truth I regret to say
 that we are suffering daily
 loss by the very active
 operations of the underground railroad
 I regret that I cannot
 say so much for the
 State of Ohio represented by
 my distinguished friend from that
 State who has just spoken
 Mr PUGH We have just
 ground of complaint against the
 State of Ohio Her present
 Governor Mr Den nison has
 refused to deliver up a
 fugitive from justice who stands
 indicted for the stealing of
 slaves in the courts of
 Kentucky on demand being made
 by the Governor of Kentucky
 in accordance with the Constitution
 and laws of the United
 States The present Executive of
 that State in my judgtnent
 trampled the laws and the
 Constitution of the country under
 his feet when he refused
 that demand There was also
 a case that occurred some
 time arro where the late
 Governor of Illinois in my
 judgment failed to discharge his
 duty as the Ex ccutive
 of one of the States
 of this Union The tuc
 t s in that case
 as I understand them are
 about these a negro was
 run off from the center
 of Ken tucky from the
 very town of my colleague
 I believe That neo ro
 was indicted for stealing Hc
 wcnt to Canada He afterwards
 went to Illi nois He
 was indicted and sentenced to
 impris onment in that State
 for an offense committed there
 and confined in their penitentiary
 The owner found it out
 He went over there and
 had an interview with the
 late Governor of Illinois This
 negro stood indicted in Kentucky
 and as J understand the
 facts the owner procured a
 demand from the Governor of
 Kentucky for his delivery The
 parties in a communication which
 I saw published in the
 newspapers stated that they had
 an interview with the Governor
 and he Issued the requisition
 but in the mean time
 he gave notice to the
 keeper of the penitentiary that
 the negro man was released
 and the Aboli tionists by
 the underground railway took him
 again to Canada and when
 the partiés reached the penitentiary
 with the requisition they did
 not get the negro l
 hese I think are grave
 offenses in violation of he
 constitutional rights of our people
 hope sir that the present
 Governor of Ohio does not
 truly represent the feeling of
 the people of I do
 further know that Ken that
 great State tucky sustains an
 annual loss of more than
 one hundred thousand dollars of
 her slave property by means
 of the negro thieves who
 take them and I run
 them off by the underground
 railway regret that i can
 only partially confirm the state
 ment of the Senators who
 represent those States which border
 on Kentucky so far as
 the good feeling of their
 constituents is concerned and I
 thought it their faith in
 executing the laws was due
 as my State had been
 appealed to that I should
 make this statement about the
 statement of the case though
 I am not now prepared
 to give all the facts
 precisely Mr POWELL The Seiator
 from Ohio is evidently mistaken
 as to thc facts This
 party stood indicted in the
 courts of Kentucky for slave
 stealing The indictment showed that
 t he offense was committed
 there and that the party
 was there and the refusal
 to deliver him up was
 upon the ground that negro
 stealing was not an offense
 under the common law I
 think the Governor of his
 State not only put the
 Constitution and the laws of
 the Union under his feet
 but acted in disregard of
 his oath of omce Mr
 WADE I do not pretend
 to know pre cisely the
 circumstances of the case but
 I remem bcr having read
 the opinion of the attorney
 genr era of Ohio and
 I know it was predicated
 on the fact that the
 party had never been in
 Kentucky and I supposed that
 appeared on the face of
 the I do not know
 much about it proceedings however
 Mr POWELL 1 would say
 to the ble Senator if
 he does not know much
 about it he should investigate
 the facts before he attempts
 to enlighten the Senate Why
 sir a distinguished citizen of
 his own State in an
 address he deliv ered to
 thc people a little while
 ago I mean Hon Thomas
 Ewing condemned this action of
 the Governor and I was
 glad to see one of
 the most distinguished men of
 his State reflect properly on
 the action of the Executive
 of that State Mr PUGH
 I want to ask the
 Senator from 1 do not
 justify Governor Kentucky a question
 Dennison s proceeding It was
 wrong but it has gone
 upon the idea adopted by
 too many Gov eruors that
 they are never bound to
 surrender a fugitive from justice
 unless where thc offense charged
 is an offense by the
 law of their own State
 and I wish to ask
 the Senator from Ken tuck
 y if heis notaware of
 the fact that a Governor
 of Kentucky himself made that
 decision in refer ence to
 a case from Indiana That
 was the case ofa man
 indicted in the State of
 Indiana for kid napping When
 the Governor of Indiana de
 mandcd him of Ke ntucky
 she did not give him
 up Now I say both
 decisions are wrong but if
 we must have crimination let
 us have it on all
 sides Mr POWELL You ask
 me if the Governor of
 Kentucky has not refused Mr
 PUGH I ask the Senator
 if that decision was not
 made by the Governor of
 Kentucky in answer to u
 demand from the Governor of
 Indi Mr POWELL In answer
 to that 1 will say
 to the Senator that if
 any such decision was ever
 made by the Governor of
 Kentucky it is unknown to
 me It was certainly not
 the ruling practice in the
 offcc when I had the
 honor of being Governor of
 that State Mr PUGH I
 saw it in the Louisville
 Jour nal That is m
 v authority Mr POWELL 1
 will say my distinguished friend
 now that was fully aware
 before he gave utterance to
 it that he did not
 approve of the con duct
 of his Governor for personally
 he has said to me
 that his Governor was wron
 f Mr DAVIS Mr President
 we seem to have entered
 on exactly that field which
 I had hoped bc avoided
 one of crimination and re
 had desired if it were
 possible crimination that we should
 consider this subject as a
 grave one involving great public
 interests and that if Mr
 WADE I know buta little
 about the case II there
 was any prospect of such
 an adjustment as we the
 injured party ought to accept
 we should alluded to by
 the Senator from Kentucky but
 I believe the difficulty in
 the way of the Governor
 of Ohio surrendering the person
 claimed on the application of
 the Governor of Kentucky was
 this if I recollect aright
 the attorney general of Ohio
 investigated the case and I
 believe I once read his
 opinion and it appeared that
 thc indict ment did not
 show that the party claimed
 was ever in the State
 of Kentucky and I believe
 it was a conceded fact
 that he never was there
 and therefore conld not have
 been guilty of the offense
 T hc fact was that
 they charged him with some
 complicity ill Ohio some connivance
 in getting slaves away but
 as I understand the matter
 the fact appearing on the
 face of the proceeding that
 he had never been in
 the State of Kentucky and
 as therefore the indictmenlitselfsbowed thal
 no such offense could possibly
 have been comnut ted there
 by him it was l
 éid that our Governor I
 believe that is had no
 right to surrender him be
 made aware of it Ithe
 men who live along the
 border have been complaining from
 year to year that their
 property is stolen and no
 man has ever disputed it
 And it seems like the
 grossest fiction that ever was
 attempted to say now that
 propcrty is safe when property
 has actually dis appeared from
 the border when it is
 wel known that in parts
 of Maryland you scarcely find
 the remnant of the property
 which once culüvated the land
 when the border has been
 driven back in western Virginia
 and along the frontier of
 Ken tucky when the same
 state of things exists in
 Missouri too as represented by
 my friend on do not
 think gentle ray right Mr
 GREEN men arc inecting this
 question in a spirit likely
 ever to bring good result
 M hen they attempt to
 plead that here and there
 thc law has been exe
 cuted when it is every
 welk known that combi nati0i
 s exist to prevent the
 law being applied that rescues
 are made from time to
 time suåcient to show what
 the public feeling in those
 commu nitieS is But we
 are told sir that there
 are extreme opinions that the
 extremes at the North and
 the extremes at the South
 are both wrong and that
 opinion must be corrected in
 both quarters Does the extreme
 South assail the rightsof anybody
 Does the extreme South attempt
 to nullify the constitutional rights
 of any citizen of the
 United States Does the extreme
 South pretend to sit in
 judgment upon the institutions of
 other com munities If not
 what have we to reform
 or to correct What matters
 it how we are of
 the domestic affairs of other
 people provided we leave them
 to manage their own affairs
 the theory upon which our
 Government was founded and the
 only one on which it
 can be perpetuated If it
 were useful if it were
 pleasant if It were in
 any sense profitable my own
 attention has been suffciently drawn
 to these outrages on the
 law to enable me to
 make out here a Iohg
 list of speci fications The
 newspapers have brought us from
 tlme to time the declarations
 of men who are seeking
 popular favor by dec larations
 most hos tile to the
 constitutional rights of the South
 in relation to their property
 in slaves The very Governor
 who has been drawn into
 this contro versy has been
 represented as proclaiming that not
 onc fugitive should be delivered
 from his State until the
 whole military power of that
 State had been exhausted in
 protecting him Mr WADE He
 has denied that over and
 over affain Mr DAVIS Then
 I hope he is not
 guilty The charge I havc
 seen repeated so often that
 r I am glad to
 know now that took it
 to be true there is
 doubt as to its truth
 I had myself Mr President
 a desire I might almost
 say a hope that Senators
 representing constituencies holding opinions which
 had led certain of the
 States to look to their
 condition as one which necessarily
 impelled them to seek their
 safety out of the Union
 would here inform us if
 we were mistaken It is
 not by pleading _to special
 cases and asking for specifications
 it is not by crimin
 ation and recrimination that the
 sense of the peo ple
 is likely to be changed
 or the action of the
 States now to judge in
 the last resort is to
 be modified in hny degree
 or that their re spect
 for the manner in which
 the subject is here treated
 is to be heightened All
 that can serve usefül purpose
 at the t ime is
 to bring forth evi dence
 If the fact exists of
 that kind of feeling toward
 us the absence of which
 we consider the greatest grievance
 under which we labor not
 wish now to parade the
 laws which have been enacted
 to violate not only ouc
 constitu tional rights but those
 obligat ions of comity ex
 isting between friendly States There
 is no use in it
 The occasion for such argument
 has passed by We have
 to deal with events which
 are now transpiring and about
 to be consummated and angry
 discussion here and the arraignment
 of men for the evil
 they have done will serve
 but little good here or
 elsewhere The purpose to do
 good hereafter is the only
 hope for any change of
 policy in thosc States that
 are now looking to their
 sovereign powers for their own
 defense Mr MASON Mr President
 I confess that I listened
 with amazement to what fell
 from the honorable Senator from
 Illinois upon the subiect of
 the difficulty most generally the
 impossibility of recovering fugitive slaves
 when they get into If
 that Senator had confined his
 the free States remarks to
 his own State f should
 not have felt myself called
 upon to say a word
 It is so re mote
 from my State that what
 may happen there I know
 but through the newspapers and
 they may be and very
 probably are exaggerated Mr DOUGLAS
 My statements of fåct I
 believe were all confined to
 my own State though the
 general opinions I expressed were
 not Mr MASON That may
 be but with regard to
 those in the southern States
 who complain of the refusal
 in good faith to execute
 that part of the Constitution
 which requires slaves to be
 sur rendered I understood the
 Senator to express a general
 opinion that we were ignorant
 on the subject Mr DOUGLAS
 No sir I said Virginia
 and Pennsylvania and Maryland the
 border free States and the
 border slave States did understand
 the question very well but
 that those living in 56
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 11
 the extreme South in the
 cotton States on the one
 hand which lost very few
 slaves and those living in
 the extreme northern States on
 the other hand Who arc
 so much excited on the
 question and to whose States
 fugitives hardly ever escape know
 very little about it and
 that their excite ment is
 just in proportion to their
 distance from the dividing lin
 and their ignorance of the
 sub Mr MASON Well sir
 the sdbstance of the remarks
 of the Senator was that
 in truth there was hardly
 a grievance in it either
 in the border States or
 elsewhere I hardly felt myself
 called upon to advert to
 statements of that kind before
 my constituents who know the
 fact I think the Senator
 said that he did not
 suppose there had been thevalüe
 of 100 000 in slaves
 lost in twenty years Mr
 DOUGLAS 1 said nothing of
 the kind and did not
 allude to that subject Mr
 MASON I bcg the Senator
 s pardon then J ascribed
 to him vhat fell from
 somebody else The Senator from
 Ohio I believe it was
 who said it Well then
 the Senators are mis informed
 In the repOrt made to
 the Legislature some few years
 ago on the occasion of
 some flagrant case I think
 it was estimated that our
 loss was equal to 100
 000 a year Mr PUGH
 It seems to me that
 the Senator from Virginia as
 well as the Senator from
 Ken tucky is not keeping
 to the issue The allega
 tion of the Senator from
 Georgia was not With regard
 to the escape of this
 property I know that it
 escapes but his allegation was
 that these States nullified the
 fugitive slave act and I
 said that neither Virginia nor
 all the southern States put
 together have ever lost 100
 000 of property by violations
 of that law The law
 may not be sufficient Property
 may escape II do not
 know what escapes that way
 but let us have the
 prop osition Mr MASON Mr
 President when 1 camc here
 at this session I thought
 the argument was exhausted W
 c know what our m
 icvances arc we have felt
 them year after year and
 know that they are unredressed
 Still gcntlclncn tell me that
 it is not because they
 do not enforce the fugi
 tive slave law they will
 enforce it if we bring
 it into their courts they
 say Viat may be but
 we feel humiliated that we
 live in a common Govern
 ment as members ofa common
 Government that we have a
 covenant for our rights and
 that cov enant is habitually
 disregarded and we are not
 answered when we are told
 that if we will get
 the casc into court the
 grievance shall be redressed Sir
 we know that when a
 slave escapes from the borders
 of Virginia and gets into
 the State of Pennsylvania and
 the owner or thc agent
 of the owner pursues him
 he does it at the
 poril of his and at
 the peril of his liberty
 and that under the laws
 of thilt State I know
 it We had in the
 county adjoining the onc where
 I live within a very
 years a very respectable and
 respons ibic gentleman there in
 the county of Hamp shire
 who lost two or three
 slaves He pursued them with
 member of his family nephew
 into the State of Pennsylvania
 and they were not only
 rescued from then hands when
 they were seized but the
 nephew being prcscnt and the
 owner not he was Incarcerated
 put in jail and put
 under bonds to take his
 trial as a it lon
 I knew the men I
 knew it was the property
 of the men Their lives
 were imperiled by a mob
 and this young man went
 back and stood his trial
 upon an indictment as a
 felon and the expenses were
 borne by the State of
 Virginia We have a covenant
 and a Constitution that this
 all shall not bc we
 are members of com mon
 Government over which that Constitution
 extends and I say sir
 we are humiliated and dishonored
 in our own eyes that
 we remain mem bers of
 a common Government when the
 cove nant is not only
 not regarded but when our
 PCO plc are imperiled if
 they go to enforce it
 I am not answered when
 I am told that in
 this casc or in that
 case or the other case
 before such a ji_idge as
 doubtless the honorable Senator from
 Illinois was while he was
 a judge in his own
 State thc law has been
 fairly and honorably adminis tcred
 Sir the offense is that
 in tho non slaveholding States
 they do not see that
 that covenant is exe cuted
 It is their duty to
 us as their confederates in
 acommon Government that they shall
 see that it is executed
 and I am not answered
 when I am told that
 the Supreme Court has decided
 that the burden of executing
 the Constitution is upon the
 Federal Government and not upon
 the Stategov crnments They have
 iven it that construction but
 is it not the duty
 of the State governments if
 they intend to live in
 peace and in harmony with
 their neighbors or if they
 intend to preserve this Constitution
 is it not the duty
 of the States to take
 care that their peoplc shall
 observe the law and by
 State legislation by those very
 police enactments to which the
 honorable Senator refers to preserve
 not the peace alone but
 the honor of their people
 They came under this Government
 and if they expect us
 to livc with them we
 have a right to exact
 that they shall see that
 the cove nant is faithfully
 carried into execution That is
 the grievance The loss of
 property continuing for years is
 felt and our people feel
 and ought to feel that
 they are degraded when their
 property is lost and they
 have no govern ment at
 home or in the Federal
 power which will protect them
 or return it 1 know
 of one gentle man my
 neighbor a comparatively young man
 who has already lost 10
 000 worth of that prop
 crty I know of another
 who is my neighbor who
 lost 10 000 of it
 by one escape and they
 live under a government in
 the State of Virginia that
 is incapable of protecting them
 and why Be cause she
 is under engagements to the
 Federal Government which she regards
 and the Federal engagements to
 her are disregarded that is
 the grievance I thought the
 argument was ended and yet
 gentlemen rise now and say
 really that is no grievance
 at all and if you
 are going to di vide
 the Union on that let
 us have up each indi
 vidual case and we can
 show you that you are
 mistaken that you are suffering
 no grievance I really did
 not feel called upon to
 respond to ib until it
 was suggested by the honorable
 Senator from Illinois in his
 reference to the bordcr States
 T hc loss of property
 is felt the loss of
 honor is felt still more
 I say my people are
 degraded and humiliated when they
 are conscious that they tolemte
 a Govern Inent which is
 incapable of pro tecting thern
 refuses to protect them and
 they yet remain in that
 Government That is their Oondition
 I did not intend to
 go into it for I
 really sup posed the argument
 was cxhausted We are to
 deal now with facts and
 among them is this one
 in regard to fugitive slaves
 It is only one have
 never yet brought my judgment
 to the con viction that
 we in Virginia should break
 up this Union or counsel
 others to break up this
 Union for that reason alone
 not because the fugitive slave
 law has not been administered
 it may be administered when
 the Federal power can be
 brought to bear upon it
 That as I said is
 not the grievance it is
 that we are livino under
 a common Government with those
 who do not keep faith
 in that particular have not
 brought my judgment to believe
 that we should break up
 the Government on that account
 alone It is only one
 of the list 1 would
 refer to another of these
 Federal relations in regard to
 slaves the case of Lemmon
 and his slaves in New
 York As well as I
 recollect it he was a
 gentleman from Vir ginia who
 v as goino to Texas
 taking with him his slaves
 to settle there He could
 not sail directly for Texas
 from any port in Virginia
 and he went to New
 York simply to embark and
 for no other purpose His
 property was ta ken from
 him and set free he
 was despoiled of it by
 the laws of New York
 I do not deny the
 right of New York to
 pass such laws as she
 deems proper I do not
 complain that New York passes
 such laws us she thinks
 proper but I say we
 are humiliated if we live
 under a common Govern mcnt
 with a State that treats
 her confederates in that manner
 Why sir in Michigan they
 havc a law which makes
 ita felony if a gentleman
 pass ing near goes into
 the State with his slave
 and clåims him as his
 slave while he is there
 and that is a common
 Government a Governmen t of
 equals a fraternal Government It
 may very well happen that
 one ignorant of the laws
 of Michigan who is passing
 through Canada may go into
 Michigan merely in transitu through
 that State but he will
 be pounced upon as a
 violator of its laws and
 subjected to a felon s
 doom Michigan has a right
 to pass such laws as
 she pleases but I say
 we arc humiliated if we
 romain under a common Government
 with those who ad minister
 the Government with us upon
 such a policy That is
 the grievance and that it
 was which led me to
 say j in some remarks
 I made yesterday that if
 we are to continge under
 this Federal Gov ernment in
 any form if the Government
 is not to be broken
 to pieces and irretrievably ruptured
 if any remedy can be
 found for the grievances of
 which we complain in the
 South it is not to
 be found in the Halls
 Of Congress it is beyond
 the reach of their Icoislatiön
 it must be found in
 the conventions of tfiie people
 in the States They must
 act as States and determine
 for themselves whether they will
 remain in the Confederacy in
 sisting upon their present line
 of policy or whether they
 will allow that Confederacy to
 be broken The people must
 determine I confeSs I have
 been disappointed seeing what we
 see is taking place at
 the South now that there
 are n0 move ments of
 any kind in the free
 States to go into convention
 får more to call their
 Legisratures I am free to
 say that I have an
 earnest desire to remain in
 the Confederation I believe such
 is the feeling of my
 State and certainly it is
 my own butl know knowing
 the spirit of my people
 that they are conscious that
 the time has come now
 for a settlement and a
 final settlement that that settlement
 cannot be had in Congress
 it is to be had
 by the States and that
 nothing can either continue the
 present I klion or enable
 us to recon struct it
 unless we can get substantial
 unequiv ocal evidence from the
 non slaveholding States that they
 will permit us enable us
 to live with them under
 a common Government by legislatinrr
 at home in aid of
 the Federal Government where it
 may be necessary in such
 manner as to carry the
 covenants of the Constitution into
 effect There the remedy must
 come from Mr DOUGLAS 1
 trust 1 shall be pardoned
 for another word The Senator
 from Virginia makes it a
 point of complaint novi that
 we as he uses thc
 term meaning of course Virginia
 and her sister slaveholding States
 are humiliated in living in
 a Union with other States
 where good faith is not
 kept This is a serious
 charge Mr MASON Thc Senator
 has not exactly stated my
 position I say the people
 of Virginia must feel humiliated
 1 certainly do in living
 in a Government under a
 covenant which the other parties
 to it do not keep
 and which While we remain
 under a common Government we
 have it not in our
 power to make them kcep
 and there fore the people
 of Virginia are under a
 Govern ment incapable of protecting
 them in their rights of
 property That is it Mr
 DOUGLAS I accept the explanation
 with pleasure Then the complaint
 is that we do not
 keep the covenant provided for
 in the Con stitution That
 covenant is that fugitive slaves
 shall be surrendered We acknowledge
 the cov cnant and I
 understand that our pledge is
 that we will keep it
 in the mode contemplated by
 the Constitution What was that
 mode First that Congress should
 supply the requisite legislation necessary
 to carry that obligation into
 effect Congress did in 1793
 pass a bill that was
 sup posed to be sufficient
 In 1850 a supplementary law
 was passed Why Because the
 Supreme Court of the United
 States had decided that so
 much of the act of
 1793 as made it the
 duty of justices of the
 peace and other State offcers
 to execute the Constitution of
 the United States was not
 binding That decision rendered it
 neces stu y for us
 to pass a new law
 to remedy that evil by
 which United States offcers should
 be substi tutcd for those
 of the States in obedience
 to the decision or the
 Supreme Court of the United
 States Inasmuch as we of
 the free States did not
 perhaps understand the subject as
 well as the slaveholding States
 we agreed by common con
 sent that the slavcholdinff States
 should make thcir own law
 and finding no man in
 America so well qualified to
 prepare a good law exactly
 adapted to the faithful exccution
 of this obligation as the
 Senator from Virginia to him
 was assigned the duty and
 honor of preparing the law
 We passed his law into
 effect The law now which
 It is complained does not
 work well is the one
 which he write We took
 it I believe as he
 prepared it and we are
 now told that we are
 guilty of bad faith because
 his law is not exe
 cutcd Whose fault is it
 that it is not executed
 The Supreme Court hag decided
 that it is the duty
 of the Federal Government to
 executc the 1860 law He
 does not complain that the
 Federal Ad ministration has not
 done its duty undcr the
 law He makes no such
 complaint of Mi Buchanan or
 of Mr Pierce or of
 Mr Fillmore and those arc
 the only Presidents we have
 had since his If they
 have performed their law took
 effect duty in good faith
 under the law and yet
 the obligations of the Constitution
 are not fulfilled there must
 be a defect in the
 law If the law which
 lie gave us and which
 at the time he sup
 posed was suffcient to perform
 the constitutional obligation has proved
 to bc insuffcient I shoul
 l suppose that he would
 see the propriety of bring
 ing forward an amendment to
 his own law in stead
 of referring the matter to
 a convention of the people
 of Virginia If that law
 is not suf ficient to
 perform the constitutional obligation it
 is his duty and mine
 to make it suffcient I
 am ready to day to
 voü3 for any supplementary law
 that may be necessary and
 proper to carry out in
 good faith that obligation of
 the Constitution If the Senator
 will indicate it will prepare
 it and bring it into
 the Senate I doubt not
 that it will be passed
 before the 4th of March
 and become the law of
 the land Then sir why
 is it that the non
 execution of a law or
 a defect in an act
 of Congress cannot be remedied
 in Congress but must be
 referred to a convention of
 the States And what sort
 of a convention of the
 States is proposed Nota con
 vention of all the States
 but it is proposed that
 the southern States shall go
 into convention by themselves and
 the northern States by them
 selves and when they get
 into separate conven tions the
 same misapprehensions that have blinded
 the judgment of Senators here
 will blind the judg ment
 of the conventions and each
 convention will criminate against the
 other section and have nobody
 there to expose the error
 The Senator thinks it a
 misfortune that we have got
 upon these am delighted that
 we have some spe details
 cifications so that we can
 discuss details All I ask
 is that the specification of
 grievances shall be made out
 Give us each charge and
 each specifi cation If there
 is any one that can
 be substanti ated I will
 vote for the necessary legislation
 and the necessary power in
 the Executive to remove it
 and every one that is
 not true should be aban
 doned I hold that there
 grievance growing out of a
 non fulfiilment of constitutional obliga
 tions which cannot be remedied
 under the Con stitution and
 within the Union and I
 hold that every constitutional obligation
 imposed by that instrument must
 be executed by the Federal
 Gov If legislation is necessary
 Congress is ernment the proper
 tribunal to furnish that legislation
 and not conventions of the
 separate States These suggestions of
 conventionS by separate States it
 is easy to understand It
 is departing from the Constitution
 of our country The Constitution
 docs not prescribe that as
 a mode of fulfilling con
 stitutional obligations The Constitution has
 pointed out a mode by
 N vhich constitutional obli gations
 shall be fulfillcd When lcgislation
 is necessary let us enact
 it Let him who says
 there is not the requisite
 legislation point out the defect
 and brinT In the bill
 that will afford the requisite
 legislation Then if the Executive
 does not fulfill his duty
 by executing the laws faith
 fully let us have him
 impeached The Consti t ution
 has prescribed the mode of
 doing it has pointed out
 the tribunal to impeach him
 and the tribunal to try
 him So long as there
 is no complaint that Lhc
 Executive has not done his
 duty it follows either that
 thc laws have been faithfully
 cxccuted or that there is
 a defect in them If
 there isa defect in the
 law it is the fault
 of the Senator from Virginia
 and myself that such defect
 exists and as he framed
 the law he of all
 men on earth is under
 the highest moral obliga tion
 to revise his own work
 and give us a good
 law and not brcak up
 the Government because he framed
 a bad law and refuses
 to correct the error Mr
 WIGFALL obtained the floor Mr
 MASON t Mr President one
 word Mr WIGFALL 1 have
 but a few words to
 sa myself Ir DOUGLAS I
 think it right that the
 Sen ator from Virginia should
 be heard in response to
 me CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 57 never
 heard of any defect in
 it and yet the Sen
 ator says that if we
 do not recover our slaves
 it must be by reason
 of a defect in the
 law and that we are
 at fault because we do
 not supply the de fcct
 Mr DOUGLAS Either a defect
 in the law er a
 defect in the administration of
 the law If you do
 not recover your property in
 a case whcrc you bring
 it before the courts that
 is the fault in the
 administration of the law but
 if you do not bring
 it before the courts it
 is your fault not ours
 Mr MASON If the honorable
 Senator ex pects to Qperate
 in the slightest degree on
 public sentiment in the South
 by meeting their allega tions
 of grievances under the Union
 by that mode of argument
 I say to him with
 all respect he will not
 only not do it but
 he will actually in flame
 it What I want to
 present is this unless wc
 have evidences from the people
 in the convcn tions of
 the States to show us
 to the contrary by adequate
 and undoubted security in some
 form we are becoming satisfied
 that we cannot with honor
 remain undera common Government That
 is all Mr WIGFALL Mr
 President Mr COLLAMER Will the
 gentleman in dulge me for
 a moment to make a
 suggestion to the Senator from
 Virginia That Senator is aware
 I presume that in the
 Prigg case the Supreme Court
 decided that it was the
 exclusive power and duty of
 Congress to legislate under that
 clause of the Constitution Is
 he not aware that it
 was further decided in that
 case that all State legisla
 tion in aid of the
 return of fugitive slaves was
 un constitutional and void Is
 he not aware that that
 is the decision which blocks
 up any aid by State
 legislation in favor of returning
 fugitives Mr WIGFALL Mr President
 the Senator from Illinois says
 that he is gratified that
 we are going into details
 discussing minor points one of
 which was incidentally alluded to
 by the Sen ator from
 Georgia for in the catalogue
 of griev ances he mentioned
 incidentally this matter of It
 is the non cxecution of
 the fugitive slave bill a
 matter that concerns very few
 States and those that are
 concerned about It seem perfrctly
 con tent That does not
 go to the gist Mr
 FOOT Will the Senator let
 us adjourn Mr WIGFALL No
 1 will have something to
 say before I can acrce
 to ad I bcg the
 Senator s pardon if 1
 answered journ him brusquely I
 did not so mean The
 Senator from Illinois says that
 he is glad x ve
 are going into details and
 making specifica tions and he
 pledges himself here before the
 country and as a Senator
 that if we will make
 out our list of grievances
 and state the specifica tions
 he by lhs vote will
 remove them Now sir I
 accept the pledge and 1
 will state a griev It
 IS that the inhabitants of
 a Territory ancc gathered from
 every quarter of the world
 from the Five Points of
 New York and the purlieus
 of London under homestead bills
 havc squüted upon domain that
 belongs to these States that
 they in their arrogance and
 impudence counte Danced by men
 whose opinions havc in other
 days weighed with the people
 of the United States and
 in open violation of the
 organic law if such a
 term can be applied to
 a mere parchment writing that
 passes the Federal Legislature in
 open vio lation of the
 law of Congress that orgamzed
 the I Teyritory havc attempted
 to decide what is prop
 criy and what is not
 and to confiscate it Now
 I ask the Senator from
 Illinois whether he will vote
 to repeal their unconstitutional illegal
 legis lation and whether he
 will vote in order to
 re store peace to the
 country for enforcing the laws
 and protecting the rights of
 the people of the South
 in their property within the
 Territories That is one of
 the grievance s under which
 we It is are excited
 under which we are suffering
 one of the points that
 has excited the public mind
 as much as any other
 and the country in which
 I live infinitely more than
 the fugitive slave bill It
 is this or all other
 bills upon that question oral
 Constitution Three times in that
 compact are they recognized as
 property First there is a
 provision that before the year
 1808 the slave trade should
 not be interrupted Then iL
 was recognized as a legitimate
 matter of commerce The slave
 trade could not by Congress
 bp inter fered with for
 twenty fears It was the
 only branch of trade that
 could not be interfered with
 Tbis was a clear distinct
 recognition of tho ciple that
 man has the right to
 own property in man yes
 sir and to traffc in
 the souls andv bodies of
 mm I That is in
 the Constitution Another recognition of
 slaves as property is in
 the further provision that when
 they escape they shall be
 delivered up on claim of
 their owners The third is
 the provision as to taxation
 and rep rese ntation We
 say then that slaves are
 prop erty by the law
 of the land by our
 own Statc constitutions and State
 laws that slaves are recognized
 in the Federal Constitution as
 prop erty We say that
 within our own limits ve
 will protect that species of
 property Within the limits of
 the States Whcrc it is
 mot property we ask no
 protection We say that in
 all Fed eral territory in
 this District of Columbia on
 board our merchant vessels when
 three miles from shore wherever
 the Federal flag floats or
 the Federal laws extcnd or
 the Federal courts have jurisdiction
 thc rc we at e
 entitled to pro tection unless
 this Government is unlike any
 other Government that ever was
 instituted by man and is
 not pledged to protect the
 property of citizens that is
 within and under its jurrsdic
 tion These being our views
 we demand that in the
 District of Columbia in the
 forts in the navy yards
 in the dock yards on
 board of our merchant vessels
 when three miles from land
 and in the Territories that
 species of property shall be
 protected by Federal legislation Will
 the Senator give us that
 protection Mr DOUGLAS 1 will
 answer the question of the
 Senator I think he is
 utterly mistaken in supposing that
 that is the cause of
 complaint think he is utterly
 mistaken in supposing the Union
 is to be dissolved because
 of the violation of southern
 rights in that matter Mr
 WIGFALL Though 1 took my
 seat 1 gave way simply
 that the Senator might answer
 If he is going to
 answcr It enough my question
 if not I propose to
 go on Mr DOUGLAS I
 propose to answer by showing
 that that is not a
 cause of grievance and I
 prove it by the Journal
 of this body because a
 maiority of this Senate the
 Senator included voied under oath
 this very year that that
 is not the cause Mr
 WIGFALL Show it Mr DOUGLAS
 1 think 1 am not
 mistaken as to the Senator
 s vote When the resolutions
 of the Senator from Mississippi
 Mr DAv1s werc up and
 an amendment was offered by
 the other Senator from Mississippi
 Mr BROWN declaring that there
 wras now a necessity for
 le gistation to protcct slave
 property in the Territo ries
 the Senate voted it down
 They voted that there was
 no such cause existing that
 no such outrage had occuyred
 as to create a necessity
 for legislation by this Government
 and consequently they would not
 enact it Mr WIGFALL Will
 the Senator turn to the
 record because I do not
 care about being tried without
 it Mr DOUGLAS The record
 is here I make the
 statement Mr WIGFALL 1 deny
 it Mr DOUGLAS When those
 resolutions were brought up the
 Senator from Mississippi Mr BROWN
 moved to amend by saying
 that a cause now existed
 and he brought in also
 a bill to protect slave
 property in the Territories and
 the Senate voted it down
 on the ground that the
 necessity does not now exist
 although they thought t he
 t ime miffht come when
 it would Mr WIGFALL D
 No sir I deny it
 flatly and unqualifiedly Mr DOUGLAS
 I will not sir at
 this late hour go into
 the record because it would
 take attempt of the inhabitants
 of a Territory to as
 sume powers which are denied
 in this day and I
 some time to hunt it
 up and present it but
 I am I ready to
 hunt it up But the
 statement that this generation the
 people of sovereign States I
 Union is to be dissolved
 because of an apprehen Now
 put it to the Senator
 from likinöis wish no dodging
 Our proposition is that slaves
 Sion that wc will not
 do what no one of
 these are property We say
 that they are property by
 i gentlemen has brought in
 a bill to do is
 a very Mr MASON The
 from Illinokpoints and am unaware
 of any defect in it
 1 have that they are
 recognized as property by the
 Fed II that we have
 not passed laws to protect
 slavery 58 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 December 11 in the Territories
 why does not some one
 of you bringina bill toxprotect
 slavery in the Territories It
 will not do for you
 to say you will destroy
 the Union for fear we
 will riot do that which
 no man of you will
 bring forward a law io
 do Nor 7ill it do
 for you to assume that
 such a bill would not
 be passed until you make
 the effort I am ready
 to meet that question whenever
 you bririg up the bill
 Point out your grievance write
 your bill to fit the
 grievance and after you have
 pre pared your bill I
 will discuss its provisions with
 you you come to its
 passage then I will show
 you my Vote on the
 bill itself and 1 want
 you to record yours at
 the same time It will
 be time enough for you
 to assign that as a
 cause for breaking up the
 Union when you have made
 an effort and have failed
 in getting the law passed
 Mr WIGFALL Mr President the
 Senator from Illinois instead of
 answering my question with what
 be considered Yankee shrewd ness
 propoun s another and instead
 of speaking to my indictment
 hc prcfcrs onc against me
 Now sir stand upon the
 record and defy him to
 produce it here When the
 Senator from Mis sissippi Mr
 DAvrs introduced resolutions set ting
 forth the doctrines which I
 have stated af firming the
 right to protect property the
 other Senator from Mississippi Mr
 BROWN intro duced another resolution
 the precise words of which
 I do not now recollect
 but it declared that an
 emergency had now arisen requiring
 legisla tion Mr DAVIS c
 Experience having shown that the
 Constitution and common law do
 not afford us snmcient protection
 That was the language Mr
 WIGFALL Be may when that
 question came up I volcd
 for Mr Davis s reso
 lution which contained a clear
 distinct declara tion we were
 bound to protect slave property
 wherever protection was necessary and
 I did not vote for
 Mr BROWN S resolution for
 the rea sons which were
 then Tiven that as to
 the fact whether u prohibitory
 law had passed in Kansas
 or not I was not
 advised nor as to whether
 such a law would bc
 there enforced and I was
 not ad vised whether the
 courts would then immediately bring
 a case up and for
 divers other reasons I chose
 not to vote for it
 It was in addition to
 that changing the issue Mr
 DAVIS If my friend from
 Texas will allow me i
 think I can assist his
 memory The resolution which was
 voted upon and negatived was
 one which declared that cxperience
 had shown thnt the Constitution
 and common law did not
 afford sufficient protection to property
 in slavcs in the Territories
 The bill which was to
 annul tbc legislation of Kansas
 was referred to a com
 mittec and was reported back
 by that committee and you
 never voted updn it at
 all because it never was
 brought to a vote I
 herc was no vote upon
 the direct question Mr WIGFALL
 1 have sir confused Mr
 DOUGLAS 1 should like to
 have the Senator from Mississippi
 Mr BROWN state what arnendment
 was Iwas sick at the
 time and absent from the
 Senate have stated it from
 recollection of it as it
 was in the newspapers but
 if I find that I
 have done the Senator from
 Texas injustice on a matter
 of fact I should like
 an op portunity to correct
 it but I would like
 the Sen ator fi orn
 Mississippi who moved thc amend
 rncnt to state w bat
 it was Mr WIGFALL Do
 you mean Mr BR0wN s
 amend to Mr Davxs s
 resolution DOUGLAS Yes sir Mr
 WIGFALL it It was that
 tbc cmero encv had already
 arisen Mr BROWN 1 suppose
 with the indul gencc of
 Senators call state precisciy what
 wore the facts My colleague
 introduced resolutions onc of which
 was to this effect I
 may not quote the languaoe
 precisely that whenever experi cnce
 shall show that thc executive
 and judicial branches of the
 Government have not sufficient powers
 to Rive adequate protection to
 slave prop cyt y in
 the Terrilones then it will
 become neces sary and proper
 for the Congress to interpose
 and give that protection That
 was the fifth resolu tion
 in the series I from
 circumstances which I do not
 detail as have been interpolated
 into this discussion believing the
 emergency had al ready arisen
 moved as an amendment a
 resolu ti01 i declaring that
 experience having alrcady shown that
 the Constitution and the common
 law do not afford suffcient
 protection it has become the
 duty of Congress to interpose
 and afford that protection That
 was the substance of those
 resolutions And now in reference
 to the bill which I
 introduced a bill to annul
 the laws of Kansas abolishing
 slavery in that Territory and
 denouncing penalties against the master
 who claimed the right of
 property in a slave I
 pre sented it upon a
 certified copy of an act
 of the Territorial Legislature of
 Kansas showing that they had
 passed laws not only abolishing
 slavery in that Territory but
 denouncing the penalty If my
 memory serves me of 200
 fine a fine at all
 events and imprisonment I referred
 that bill to the Committee
 on Territories of which my
 friend from Missouri Mr GREEN
 is chairman At the same
 session we had a bill
 from the House of Representatives
 repealing the laws of New
 Mexico protecting slavery My bill
 ac cording to my recollection
 was held by the com
 mittee one hundred and ten
 days or about that time
 In the samc month and
 within ten days of each
 other the Senator from Missouri
 reported back both bills He
 reported against the bill of
 the House of Representatives and
 reported in favor of discharging
 the committee from the fur
 ther consideration of my bill
 As I understood the report
 on my bill it was
 this that the propo sition
 was not worthy of consideration
 I know the committee did
 not say so but when
 a Senate or House committee
 have propositions I vhich they
 think not worthy of consideration
 they ask to be discharged
 from them They are not
 regarded as worthy of being
 reported for or against That
 is the way I view
 it There was no vote
 upon the bill in the
 Senate as my colleague says
 I rose in my place
 on the report of the
 Senator from Missouri being made
 and if thc record is
 cor rcctly kept it will
 show it and objected to
 the consideration of the report
 then The report on the
 House bill was considered and
 the Senate arrreed to it
 Mr GREEN No Mr BROWN
 1 think so My friend
 will find when hc looks
 to the record that he
 is mis taken Mr GREEN
 The report on the I
 louse bill was not considered
 and it is now depending
 on thc Calendar Mr BROWN
 The Senator will find himself
 mistaken Mr GREEN 1 know
 1 am not Mr BROWN
 1 will consult the record
 Mr WIGFALL That is not
 the question Mr BROWN I
 am answering the question put
 to me by the Senator
 from Illinois Mr WIGFALL That
 an out side issue Mr
 DOUGLAS If the Senator from
 Texas will allow me I
 will now present the record
 I have here the Journal
 His statement is that because
 we do not pass acts
 of Congress to protect slave
 property in the Territories that
 fact is onc of the
 causes for dissolving or breaking
 up the Union Mr WIGFALL
 No sir I said that
 one of the causes and
 one that has created more
 excite ment and dissatisfaction thun
 any other is that this
 Government will not hereafter and
 when it is necessary interpose
 to protect slaves as prop
 erty in tho Territories and
 I asked the Senator if
 he would abandon his squat
 t or soverciønty no tions
 and agree to protect slaves
 as all othå property Mr
 DOUGLAS My this that no
 such necessity yet exists and
 that the Senator so voted
 and the Senate so voted
 at the last session and
 I could not imaoine that
 he was ff0inø to break
 up tl le Government on
 account of evils that do
 not exist and nay never
 arise He denies that he
 ever voted that there is
 no such necessitv existing have
 the record Mr TVVIGFALL well
 now read it Mr DOUGLAS
 The of Mississippi or rather
 onc of his series of
 res olutions was this That
 the cxistinz condition of the
 Territories of the United States
 does require the intervention of
 Conzress för the pfotection of
 property in slaves Mr DOUGLAS
 Perhaps 1 have got the
 wronr resolution Mr DAVIS Oh
 very wrong Mr DOUGLAS Never
 mind 1 do notcare whether
 it is Mr DAvrs s
 or Mr CLINGMAN S Mr
 DAVIS But that is very
 different from what Mr Davrs
 proposed Mr DOUGLAS Yes if
 it turns out that vay
 On motion by Mr BROWN
 to amend the same by
 strik ing out the word
 not so that it would
 read United States does require
 the intervention of Congress for
 the protection of property in
 slaves Mr WIGFALL 1 voted
 against that Mr DOUGLAS on
 the vote being taken the
 Senate refused to strike out
 the word not the Senator
 from Texas included Mr WIGFALL
 Yes Mr DOUGLAS so to
 leave the resolution to stand
 that it did not require
 it ins tead of that
 it did Now I should
 like to sce whether the
 same amendment was not offered
 to the reso lution of
 the Senator from Mississippi Mr
 DAVIs Mr A VIS I
 wanted to say to the
 Senator that it was Mr
 CLINGMAN S amendment to my
 resolution and that now he
 perceives the very great importance
 of his not making the
 mistake because that was not
 one ot the series and
 was not a resolution adopted
 Mr DOUGLAS As J said
 if you will give me
 an opportunity if you will
 givc mc until to morrow
 morning I will examine the
 record Mr DAVIS Of course
 Mr WIGFALL not the slightest
 0b jection Mr DOUGLAS 1
 still understand the sen ator
 from Mississippi L Mr BROWN
 to have moved an affirmative
 proposition that interven tion was
 necessary and that the Senate
 voted it down At any
 rate if intervention was neces
 sary and Scnators would not
 bring in a bill for
 it that only shows that
 those gentlemen were all recreant
 to the cause of the
 South in not bringing it
 in and when they never
 have brought in the bill
 certainly they arc not going
 to dissolvc the Union because
 1 was not in favor
 of it Mr WIGFALL Oh
 ve do not intend to
 dissolve it at all Laughter
 Mr IVERSON Allow me to
 go over that matter to
 place myself ri ht Mr
 WIGFALL You voted with rest
 of us on that matter
 Mr IVERSON No Mr WIGFALL
 You voted against us Mr
 IVERSON Yes sir Mr WIGFALL
 Then you voted right and
 you need not explain Laughter
 The Senator from North Carolina
 Mr CLINGMAN intro duced a
 resolution That the existing condition
 of the Ten itories of
 the United States does noi
 requirc the intervention of Congress
 Or thc protection of propert
 y in slaves Mr BROWN
 moved to strike out not
 and declare That the existing
 condition of the Territories of
 the United States docs require
 tho intervention of Congress for
 the protection of property in
 slaves I voted against bot
 h and Senators here will
 rec ollect well those who
 were ill the Cham ber
 that I gave as a
 reason that the Senator froin
 Missis sippi Mr DAVIS had
 introduced a resolution setting förth
 a principle the duty of
 the Govern rnent to afford
 protection to slave propc l
 tv that I was willing
 to vote for that principle
 that the other Senator Crot
 n Mississippi M r BROi4
 N and the Senator from
 North Carolina Mr Ch 1NG
 MAN were coupling it with
 a i tct and that
 I v ras opposed to
 mixing questions of law and
 of fact at that time
 I said it was a
 matter upon vliich I was
 not advised and I recollect
 very well say in jestingly
 that 1 supposed it would
 be very well to have
 the question of fact referred
 to the Covodc committee and
 get a report on it
 at the next session of
 Congress I voted against the
 resolution declaring that the emergency
 already existed 1 voted against
 the resolution dcclarinz that it
 did not exist not choosc
 to be diverted from the
 direct path of duty wllicll
 lay before me and that
 was to have Mr DAVIS
 Oh no No such resolution
 a declaration of a great
 principle I beg pardon IVIr
 WIGFALL is Mr CLINGMAN S
 of the Senator from Illinois
 for usincr the phrase olution
 not Mr Dhus s that
 you arc readin I great
 principle I did not mean
 It disrespect 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 59 fully but I
 did regard that as a
 great principle and under those
 circumstances voted agamst both resolutions
 that have been referred to
 Mr DAVIS With the permission
 of the Sen ator I
 will move that the Senate
 do now adjourn in order
 that i e may continue
 his remarks Mr WIGI ALL
 The Senate seems to be
 thin and Senators seem to
 be fatigued I have no
 objection to the Senate adjourning
 now and making the few
 remarks I intend to make
 in the morning I thereforc
 yield to the motion The
 motion wras agreed to and
 the Senate adjourned HOUSE OF

 Mr LEACH of North Carolina
 said hc came into the
 House yesterday suffering from indis
 position that during the discussion
 on theamcnd ment to the
 Treasury note bill introduced by
 the gentleman from Georg_ia Mr
 CRAWFORD he becarne too unwell
 to remain longer and that
 had he been present he
 should have voted in the

 of said amendment REPORT FROM
 POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT The SPEAKER
 laid before the House a
 com munication from the Postmaster
 General trans mitting the information
 called for by resolution of
 the House of Representatives showing
 the distances by the usual
 mail routes from the post

 also laid before the House
 the testimony in the Newr
 York contested election case as
 to t he seat of
 MI SICKLES which was referred
 to the Committee of Elections
 and or dered to be
 printed SERVICE ON SPECIAL COMMITTEE
 The SPEAKER declared the business
 in order to be the
 motion of Mr HAWKINS to
 be excused from service on
 the special committee of one
 from each State to which
 was referred that portion of
 thc President s messarre relatinc
 to seceskion move nu nts
 Mr COBB It is not
 my purpose Mr Speaker to
 occupy the time of the
 House by any extended Iam
 satisfied that the remarks on
 this subject eyes of the
 whole country are now directed
 to the when I ask
 the previous question under these
 considerations will stop this debate
 organize the special committee and
 submit the question to their
 consideration so that they may
 if they can present somethinff
 to cause harmony among the
 people of the country The
 papers this morn ing reflect
 a gleam of light from
 Boston which may perhaps have
 a tendency to quiet the
 pub lic mind Let the
 people of the northern States
 rneet in convention and let
 them whenever elec tions are
 pending give demonstration to the
 country that there is now
 a sense of justice and
 that the questions which agitated
 the country will be taken
 hold of by the people
 them selves I hope that
 the committee vill be allowed
 to engrage in the duties
 assigned to them and en
 deavor to present something to
 the consideration ofthol louseand thecountry
 It is possible thatthe committee
 may be able to do
 something to har monize the
 country I know that my
 State will not remain in
 this Confederacy longer than the
 15th of January unless something
 be done My prayer is
 that somethirrmay be done by
 which that State may remain
 in this Union upon consti
 tutional and equal principles I
 am not a seces sionist
 I desire peace But sir
 I desire that ny State
 Inay be awarded her rights
 under the Con stitution If
 that can be done may
 God help us to rernain
 in the Union so long
 as the sun shines but
 if not then my prayers
 will not be sent forth
 for tho perpetuity of this
 happy Government I call the
 previous question Mr DAVIS of
 Mississippi I hope the gen
 tleman from Alabama will withdraw
 that demand desire to detain
 the House for for the
 present four or five minutes
 only Mr COBB I will
 withdraw the demand hoping tlaat
 the gentleman will renew it
 when he shall have concluded
 N lr DAVIS of Mississippi
 Mr Speaker the members from
 Florida MI HAWKINS and frorn
 South Carolina Mr BOYCE have
 each requested this Housc to
 relieve them from servinæ on
 Ibis cotnmittce and havc given
 their reasons therefor It may
 not be improper to give
 some explanation of my determined
 course of action I accept
 the appointment and shall meet
 with the committee For this
 1171ay be blamed here I
 rnay be censured at home
 still since my judgment dictates
 this course as proper and
 my conscience approves I defy
 the world s opinion stand
 here f o day not
 the Representative of my own
 preferences but the interest of
 fourteen thousand voters in my
 district Their interests and their
 wishes shall be the rule
 of iny action while I
 hold a seat upon this
 floor I must be alfowed
 to express my regret that
 proceedings of this House watching
 what this the resolution creating
 this committc e carne from
 rests upon public opinion Then
 if it lives at all
 it must live in the
 affection of the people and
 as that has been entirely
 extinguished at least so far
 as the Republican party is
 concerned I have no hope
 of maintaining it by compromises
 or the use of the
 sword Any pollCy then of
 the now dominant Republican party
 which destroys all affection for
 the Union in the hearts
 of the people of the
 slave States must and has
 already destroyed the only cord
 that can bind the Union
 In my judgment the subject
 matter referred to this committee
 does not properly belong to
 this House and should not
 have originated here The alarminT
 controversy which now so gen
 erally disturbs the popular mind
 of this great nation grows
 out of principles and systems
 ad vanced by the dominant
 party of the free States
 of this Union which in
 the estimation of the slave
 States are subversivc of the
 constitutional compact betWeen tho States
 and directly at war With
 their safety and material interests
 ft has thus become a
 direct issue between the States
 and can only bc adjusted
 and arranged by them We
 cannot do anything in a
 controversy like this to bind
 the States and it is
 fruitless to try it The
 Senators are the representatives of
 the States and if any
 action is had by Congress
 upon this subject it should
 have originated with them and
 not with us I can
 but regard this committcc asa
 tub thrown out to the
 whale to amuse only until
 the 4th of March next
 and thus arrest the present
 noble and manly movements of
 Jhe southern States to provide
 by that day for their
 security and safety out of
 the Union With these views
 I take my place on
 the com mittee for the
 purpose of preventing it being
 made a means of deception
 by which the public mind
 is to bb misled and
 misguided yet intend ing honestly
 and patriotically to entertain any
 fair proposition for adjustment of
 pending evils which thc Republican
 members may submit In obedienc
 e to my promise I
 now renew the demand for
 the previous question Mr SMITH
 of Virginia I hope the
 gentle man will not call
 for the previous question until
 we shall havc heard from
 some gentleman upon the other
 side of the House I
 particularly desire to hear from
 some gentleman from the other
 side upon this question Cries
 of Question from the Republican
 side The previous question was
 seconded and the rnain question
 ordered to be put The
 SPEAKER stated the question to
 be upon excusing the gentleman
 from Florida from serV incr

 were ordered The question was

 I am anxious myself to

 report of that committee hoping
 although I must confoss such
 hopes are fain t that
 some good rnay result fron

 to make known rny of

 which now pervades the whole

 duty ad monishes me to
 withhold the expression of those
 views and to ask that
 the previous question be sustained
 in order that we may
 have a votc on excusing
 the gentleman from Florida as
 we will a southern rnenlber

 they are making to secure
 their equality and their rights
 out of the Union since
 they are unable to obtain

 judgment a proper respect for
 the dig nity of the

 on thc committee from the
 southern States should withdraw and
 leave the Republican members to

 service upon the committee and
 when they ask it respect
 fully und state that it
 is the conclusion of their
 judgnw nt after mature rcflecüön
 that they can not in
 justice to themselves and to
 the States which they represent
 serve upon the committee I
 say it loot seem to
 me most extraordinary and most
 remarkable that this House will
 not excuse gentlemen under such
 circumstances Now sir i voted
 the gentleman from Florida IVfr
 GROW I rise to a
 question of order I understand
 that the yeas and nays
 have becn ordered and lhc
 call of the roll commcnccd
 The SPEAKER The the roll
 had not comrnenced Mr BURNETT
 1 say that voted to
 raise this committee but I
 must confess that while I
 desire every movement to be
 made by this House that
 possibly can be looking to
 thc restoration of quiet and
 peace to the country I
 had but very little confidence
 in the proposition when it
 was originally made and if
 I had consulted my own
 judgment in reference to the
 vote I then gave I
 should llave voted against the
 proposition of the gentleman from
 Virginia Mr BOTELER for this
 reason alone that I was
 satisfied then as I was
 after Nle announcement of the
 committee that we did not
 get any committee appointed by
 the Speaker of this House
 under that resolution com posed
 of representative men of the
 various States of this Confederacy
 I was satisfied of itthen
 and the sequel has only
 convinced me that I was
 righ t I do not
 desire to go back into
 this discussion or to refer
 to the various material of
 which this committee is composed
 I simply rise for the
 pürpose of expressing the hope
 that we would not be
 rcquircd to go through a
 call of the yeas and
 nays again upon the proposition
 of the gen tleman from
 South Carolina It is unnecessary
 for me to enter into
 the reasons that operate upon
 my mind It is well
 known to this House that
 the action of the members
 of the House from the
 State of South Carolina will
 in a very short time
 determine in this House that
 their presence will be continued
 here but a very few
 days Why then call the
 yeas and nays and undertake
 to force gentlemen to serve
 when they announce that they
 will not do it It
 sccms to mc passing strange
 Is it a part of
 the coercion that to be
 Is it the mode and
 manner by which we used
 expect to restore peace and
 good will in the coun
 try Shall we undertake to
 compel gentlemen to serve upon
 this comrnittee when they kindly
 courteously and respectfully request to
 be ex cuscd from that
 service Shall we undertake by
 virtue of the rules of
 this House to control their
 action and compel them to
 serve upon the com mi
 ec For one I ncvcr
 intend to pursue any such
 course Mr WASHBURNE of Illinois
 I demand the revious question
 dr SMITH of Virginia 1
 am one on this side
 of the House wrho voted
 against excusing the gentleman from
 Florida I hope therefore that
 the gentleman from Illinois will
 withdraw his call for the
 previous question until I can
 be heard Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois I withdraw the call
 for the previous question if
 the gentle man will renew
 It at the close of
 his remarks Mr SMITH of
 Virginia 1 will Now Mr
 Speaker I am one of
 those on this Sidc of
 the House who voted against
 excusing the gentleman from Florida
 Mr HAWKINS and who will
 vote against excusing the gentleman
 from South Carolina Mr BOYCE
 from service on this committee
 of thirty three It is
 right thcrcfore aftcr the lecture
 we have received frorn the
 member frorn Kentucky Mr BURNETT
 that I at least should
 have an opportunity of vin
 dicating that vote am one
 of those who look with
 uneasiness upon the present I
 think that it is big
 with the fate of the
 Republic I am one of
 those sir who think that
 discussion of these questions is
 not likely to do any
 good but I do conftss
 to my great surprise and
 mortification that the discussion which
 has already taken place has
 been refused to bc participated
 in by the other Sidc
 of the House Having said
 thus much I will add
 that I am indeed anxious
 Mr CURTIS If the will
 yield to me I will
 say onc vord Mr SMITH
 of Virginia I must decline
 to yield Mr CURTIS I
 dcsirc to make a reply
 to the last remark of
 the gentleman from Virginia and
 no tnorc Cries from the
 Dernocratic side of the House
 of Hcar him Mr SMITH
 of Virginia very well then
 1 yield the floor to
 the gentleman from Iowa Mr
 CURTIS The gentleman from Virginia
 has stated that this Sidc
 of the Housc has refused
 to eneracre in the discussion
 of these questions I want
 to say for one on
 this side of the House
 that at the proper time
 which will be at no
 re motc day I am
 ready to discuss all of
 the ques tions that now
 agitate the country W c
 do not refuse to enter
 into the discussion I am
 one of the committee of
 thirty thrcc and I prefer
 that that committee should have
 a fair hearing through its
 chairman before we undertake to
 discuss the propriety of its
 action We have not refused
 sir to discuss any of
 these questions 1 for one
 have not and I will
 not refuse to discuss them
 Mr SMITH of Virginia 1
 spoke of the dis cussion
 that has already taken place
 a discussion which is now
 closed r did expect that
 the op portunity which was
 presented of exhibiting the different
 views of the members upon
 this floor would have been
 embraced by all sides of
 the House and especially by
 the other side to influ
 ence and act upon the
 committee which has been created
 by a vote of the
 House It was in fact
 a sort of counseling togcther
 and I did expect sir
 that the members of this
 House would have come together
 in a spirit of conciliation
 and harmony and have intermingled
 feelings and opinions for the
 purpose of indicating at least
 some anxiety to bring us
 out of the present desperate
 condition of public affairs I
 say sir that the gentlemen
 on the other side of
 the House have refused to
 participate in the discussion just
 closed Sir I did not
 choose to mingle in the
 discussion myself because there was
 avdesire to terminate it it
 being considered that we had
 said enough on this side
 of the House Mr Speaker
 having said thus much on
 that subject which I desire
 to bring to the attention
 of the country I will
 now proceed to address my
 self to the immediate subiect
 in reference to which I
 have taken the floor objected
 to excusing the gentleman from
 Florida Mr HAWKINS because I
 was anxious to see the
 movement which was initiated by
 ordering this committee go on
 in the true spirit in
 which it was begun I
 was anxious to see every
 State participate in this effort
 at ad justment and I
 could not excuse the gentleman
 from Florida because being the
 only Represent ative from that
 State if he were excused
 that State would then be
 unrepresented on that com mittee
 I will vote I do
 not hesitate to say that
 I will vote for cxcusing
 gentlemen who are dif ferently
 situated There are gentlemen upon
 this committee who ought not
 to have been placed there
 by the Speaker of this
 House and if they ask
 to be excused I will
 vote to excuse them because
 by so doing their State
 will not neces sarily be
 unrepresented But Mr Speaker I
 shall vote against excusing the
 gentleman from South Carolina Mr
 BOYCE from service on this
 committee of thirty three And
 why Because any substitution for
 himself from that State would
 be obnoxious to thc samc
 objection which the gentleman from
 South Caro lina Mr Boycn
 applies to himself If the
 event which has been alluded
 to shall transpire that will
 of course terminate his action
 with the com mittee and
 render it unnecessary to scek
 to ap point any other
 member from the State of
 Sout h Carolina because of
 its utter impossibility The objection
 is as I have intimated
 not individual but it goes
 to the entire delegation from
 the State of South Carolina
 Everybody knows sir that my
 vote against excusing the gentleman
 from South Carolina will be
 given not from any want
 of respect for him or
 any of his delegation I
 do want Mr Speaker it
 is my most anxious desire
 that it should be seen
 in this House on all
 sides of it that we
 are willing to come up
 in a proper spirit to
 the gravity of the occasion
 and see every State represented
 properly in the con struction
 of a committee which is
 designed to bring healing upon
 its wings I wish ifpossible
 of this country put forth
 by a committee upon which
 every State is represented I
 Want to see what a
 committee representing all of the
 States will offer as a
 measure of adjustment of existing
 troubles I advert to these
 things Mr Speaker because I
 think that it is right
 that they should be under
 stood It is remarkable permit
 me to say to the
 gcntleman from Kentucky Mr BURNETT
 that as a general proposition
 where a member asks to
 be excused from scrvice upon
 any committee and if granted
 it would not cripple the
 action of the committee the
 re uest ought not to
 be refused Mr BURNET Will
 the gentleman permit mc to
 ask him a question Mr
 SMITH of Virginia Certainly Mr
 BURNETT know that the gentleman
 from Virginia is an old
 member of the House that
 he has been long here
 and done good service and
 I desire him to state
 whether he knows of a
 single instance in the history
 of Congress whcre a member
 been compelled by a solemn
 vote of the House to
 serve upon a committee after
 he has announced that he
 could not do so and
 in respectful terms asked to
 be excused from that service
 Mr SMITH of Virginia That
 was done sir during the
 last session of Congress in
 the case I believe of
 the gentleman from Alabama Mr
 HOUSTON who asked to be
 excused from further service upon
 the Committee on the Judi
 czar y Mr BURNETT The
 gentleman from Ala bama wi
 thdt ew his application before
 it was acted on by
 thc House 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 61 Mr SMITH of
 Virginia There are many othct
 cases which have occurred Mr
 BURNETT I would be glad
 if the gen tleman would
 name one Mr BURCH If
 the from Virginia will permit
 me i will put a
 question to the gen tleman
 from Kentucky Mr SMITH of
 Virginia 1 yield for that
 purpose Mr BURCH 1 put
 it to tho gentleman from
 Kentucky whether there was ever
 before a crisis like that
 which is now upon the
 country Mr BURNETT There never
 was sir and I will
 go as far as any
 man to adjust the existing
 difliculties But I say further
 to the gentleman from California
 and the House that this
 country is not to be
 saved by mere eulogies upon
 the Union The day for
 that is gone by We
 must have action and that
 speedily if we have a
 sin cere desire for the
 preservation of the present Government
 of the United States I
 voted for the resolution raising
 this committee of thirty three
 and I hope that good
 may come of it would
 vote to have any gentleman
 serve upon it if I
 knew that doing so would
 produ ce any beneficial result
 but sir when gentlemen tell
 me that they will not
 serve I for one am
 not disposed to use force
 and require them to serve
 Mr SMITH of Virginia Nobody
 proposes to use force Nobody
 expects to visit gentlemen with
 punishment other than the moral
 one of public opinion when
 they refuse to discharge the
 duties required of them as
 members of this House Mr
 HAWKINS 1 ask the gentleman
 from Virginia to tell me
 who will bell the cat
 Mr SMITH of Virginia 14
 answer to the gentleman I
 will say that I am
 dealing with a great question
 aud not speaking in relation
 to the petty business of
 belling any cat The gentle
 man on such an occasion
 I am sure will not
 undertake it himself If gentlemen
 are resolved not to perform
 their duties under the action
 of this House let them
 refuse to do it privately
 and not get up here
 and ask to be excused
 with the private resolve that
 they will not perform the
 dunes from which they ask
 to be excused But apart
 from all that I seriously
 desire that gentlemen no matter
 how they may feel no
 matter how they may think
 will look to the spirit
 of our institutions and consider
 the condition of the Republic
 Gentlemen have resolved not to
 do a thing to day
 and yet we know have
 under taken to do it
 to morrow We are all
 prone to change our opinions
 and our resolutions and a
 gentleman may under excitement to
 day re peat refuse to
 serve upon a committee and
 yet to morrow he may
 think better of it and
 go upon the committee and
 perforrn his duties I am
 one of those who do
 not look to the wishes
 of mem bers I would
 have excused the gentleman from
 Florida most cheerfully according to
 his desire if he had
 had a colleague But I
 am unwillinø that Florida shall
 be unrepresented in the com
 mittee however badly that committee
 has been constituted I v
 ish every State to be
 there rep resented and I
 wish the members to meet
 in a feel ing of
 fraternity Mr BURNETT I wish
 to ask the gentleman from
 Virginia another question He says
 he would willingly have voted
 to excuse the gentle Inan
 from Florida if that gentleman
 had had colleague but that
 he desires that Florida shall
 be represented Now after the
 House has refused to excuse
 the gentleman from Florida he
 says he shall not serve
 and will the gentleman from
 Vir ginia tell me how
 Florida will be represented Mr
 SMITH of Virginia If the
 gentleman had listened to me
 he would not have asked
 that question I have said
 distinctly that gentlemen change their
 opinions and purposes and where
 the Union is at stake
 as the gentleman has said
 would not ask any it
 is it is well to
 change gentleman to give up
 the right of self government
 or the right of self
 protection but I yet do
 think that it is due
 to the gravity of this
 question that all the House
 should essay to adjust existing
 dif ficulties and march to
 the performance of our duties
 with the solemn gravity pertaining
 to the importance of the
 subject I hat is all
 I desire and if nothing
 results from this committee and
 I am free to say
 that I do not believe
 any good will result frorn
 it and that such result
 wili be mainly attributable to
 the manner in which you
 Mrs Speaker have constructed that
 committee I say in the
 name of God it is
 a resultfor which I desire
 in no sense to be
 responsible Having said thus much
 have performed my duty I
 am as sincerely devoted to
 this Union as any other
 man but I tun bound
 heart and soul to any
 action which thc old proud
 Com monwealth which I in
 part represent and thc section
 of which she is a
 part shall take I now
 call the previous question Mr
 COX I ask tho gentleman
 from Virginia to withdraw the
 previous question a moment Mr
 SMITH of Virgima I withdraw
 it Mr WASHBURNÉ of 1
 understood that the gentleman from
 Virginia called the pre vious
 question upon a promise made
 to myself Mr SMITH of
 Virginia The gentleman is correct
 and I can only withdraw
 the previous question with his
 consent Mr COX Do I
 understand the gentleman from Illinois
 to insist upon the previous
 question Mr WASHBURNE Illinois I
 do Mr COX I desire
 to make a few remarks
 Mr SMITH of Virginia I
 cannot withdraw the previous question
 except with the permission of
 the gentleman from Iliinois And
 I wish it un derstood
 that I demanded the previous
 question only because such is
 my commitment to the gen
 tleman from Illinois The previous
 question was seconded and the
 main question ordered to be
 put Mr SHERMAN Thc yeas
 and nays have been ordered
 upon this question but I
 hope the demand for them
 will be withdrawn by unani
 mous consent Mr SMITH of
 Virginia Let us have the

 was takcn and it was

 So Mr BOYCE I vas
 not excused During the vote
 Mr BOCOCK said I was
 not present when the vote
 w is taken upon excusing
 the gentleman from Florida Mr
 H A wKINs Hadl been
 present should have voted to
 grant his request as I
 shall vote now to excuse
 the gentleman from South Carolina
 Mr BOTELER Havino myselfbeen excused
 from service upon the special
 committee I deem it due
 to myself and to gentlemen
 upon this floor who make
 a similar request to extend
 the same courtesy to them
 On that account and on
 that alone while I deeply
 regret that the gentleman should
 deem it his duty to
 ask to be excused I
 vote ay Mr DAVIS of
 Mississippi For the reasons I
 gave a while ago I
 shall not vote Mr NOELL
 Had the gentleman from South
 Carolina asked to be excused
 on the ground of personal
 inconvenience I should have no
 objec tion to excusing him
 But do not recognize the
 right of any member to
 relieve himself from the performance
 of the duties assigned to
 him by the House on
 the ground that they are
 distasteful to him He has
 another remedy aud that is
 to re I vote no
 sign his lace Mr S
 BEWART of Pennsylvania stated that
 his colleague Mr MOREHEAD was
 absent from the House on
 account of sickness The result
 of the vote was announced
 as above recorded Mr MORRILL
 1 desire to ask the
 House to excuse me from
 serving upon the select commit
 tee of thirty three not
 from any indisposition to serve
 upon the committee but because
 I have other duties which
 fully employ my time and
 in order to give the
 Speaker an opportunity to ap
 point one of my colleagues
 I would also say that
 so many of the members
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Means arc appointed upon
 the select committee that when
 the two committees meet at
 the same time the Committee
 of Ways and Means will
 be left without a quorum
 I hope therefore there will
 be no objection to my
 request from any part of
 the House Mr SMITH of
 Virginia In the remarks 1
 made while upon the floor
 a short time since I
 made reference to my friend
 from Florida Mr H A
 wKINs and he thinks some
 of my remarks insinuated matters
 to his prejudice can only
 say that I had no
 such intent and if my
 language was capable of such
 construction I was not apprised
 of it at tho time
 and certainly did not intend
 any such construction He is
 the last man upon this
 floor whose feelings I would
 wound by any sort of
 language that would implicate his
 uprightness and his conduct as
 a gentleman in public or
 rivate life Mr HRWKINS It
 is needless to say that
 the remarks of the gentleman
 from Virginia are perfectly satisfactory
 I did think the gentleman
 cast a reflection upon me
 when he remarked that it
 had been with me a
 foregone conclusion not to serve
 upon the select committee and
 then that I went through
 the empty formality of asking
 to be cxcused My course
 was to make an earnest
 and honest appeal to the
 House in the first in
 stance and then if that
 failed to avail myself of
 my sovereign right to take
 the matter into my own
 hands the same position I
 believe the gentle man from
 Virginia occupies now in the
 great ques tion which agitates
 the country Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 1 do think the House
 is disposed to be fatigued
 by any more re marks
 pertinent to the application of
 the gentle man from Vermont
 to be excused from serving
 upon the committee But it
 is proper for some of
 those who voted against the
 application of gen tlcmcn upon
 this side of the House
 to be excused to state
 that they who have the
 greatest instru mentality in composing
 the difficulties which threaten this
 country should of all men
 least ask to be excused
 from the work of coöperation
 in an attempt to save
 the Union I hope there
 fore that the vote will
 be unanimous against the application
 of the gentleman from Vermont
 He asks to be excused
 not because of his want
 of efficiency in the labor
 which is proposed to him
 and his associates but because
 of the serious and grave
 matters which occupy his attention
 Sir there can be no
 more serious or important matter
 than that which is presented
 to his attention by the
 House and the country And
 sir I may say before
 taking my seat and in
 conclusion that I am surprised
 nay I am pained and
 grieved that gentlemen upon that
 side of the House now
 at this juncture of affairs
 ask of this House be
 fore the eye of the
 country to be excused from
 the great labors it is
 proposed they shall under take
 Mr MORRIS 0f111inois Speaker concluded
 to vote to excuse every
 member of the select committee
 who may ask to be
 excused Heretofore I have voted
 against excusing but inasmuch as
 when we refuse to excuse
 them and they tell us
 they will not serve and
 nobody pro poses to do
 anything I see nothing but
 I had almost said disgrace
 to ourselves nothing but contempt
 of our authority to force
 them to remain upon the
 committee and we let the
 matte pass by I do
 not know but it is
 policy in the present state
 of affairs to let the
 matter pass by And viewing
 it in that licht 1
 shall do nothing to I
 have personal respect create any
 feeling here I for all
 those gentleman and high personal
 respect 62 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 December 11 for the gentleman
 from Florida Mr HAM KINs
 and would do nothing to
 harm his feelings by an
 attempt to force him to
 act contrary to hisconvid tiohSof
 duty Viewing the subject in
 that ligl t I shall
 vote hereafter to excuse every
 mcmber of that committee vv
 ho shall desire to be
 excused from service upon that
 committee Mr STANTON I can
 see no reason in the
 ground alleged why the gentle
 man from Vermont should not
 be excused For myself I
 have voted to excuse all
 the gentlemen who have made
 the request upon the principle
 that it is ah act
 of ordinary courtesy to bc
 extended to any gentleman assigned
 to a service unpleasant to
 hims and which he desires
 to avoid It is upon
 that ground and no other
 that I voted to excuse
 the gentleman from Florida Mr
 HAWKINS and the gentleman from
 South Carolina Mr BOYCE The
 gentleman from Vermont has two
 colleagues one of whom he
 desires shall be substituted in
 his place upon the committee
 not because of any indisposition
 upon his part to aid
 in accomplish ing the object
 for which the commit teewas
 sought to be raised but
 merely with a view to
 the substi tution of one
 of his colleagues If there
 is any reason why the
 change should not be made
 It passes my comprehension Again
 he assigns as anQther reason
 that in the present embarrassed
 condition of the Treas ury
 a leading committee of the
 House the finan dial oi
 gan of ihat Treasury requires
 a large share of his
 attention and for that reason
 he cannot devote his time
 to the labors of this
 special com mittee Gentlemen upon
 the other side of tho
 House have indicåted u desire
 that we should proceed and
 discuss the questions which agitate
 the coun try and they
 have exhibited some surprise that
 such a course was declined
 I trust gcntlemen will givc
 us the privilegc of determining
 when the proper timc arri
 ves for that discussion In
 my ludgment premature discussion can
 do no good I hcre
 is thousand times more injury
 done by prcmnture and uncalled
 for discussion not rele vanl
 to any question pending l
 efore t be House than
 good My own course would
 be without any discussion to
 let this cmnmittcc take the
 subjects referred to them sce
 what they can make of
 them and present the result
 of then delibera tions When
 we have that before us
 gentlemen may rest assured there
 will be no mdisposi tion
 to engage in the discussion
 of the measures proposed I
 do not propose to do
 it now I think it
 would be improper I think
 that things have been said
 in this discussion that will
 do ho good One of
 my colleagues Mr VALLANDIG HAM
 has talked about a Ivestcrn
 confederacy and all that which
 I do not desire to
 enter into tind ccrtainlv shall
 not Mr SMITH of Virginia
 1 ask the gentle man
 if a pleusant kind and
 conciliatory dispo sition on all
 sides of the House would
 not have had a finc
 effect upon the committee and
 upon the country but when
 one side says nothing it
 produces ill feeling of course
 because it shows a stolid
 determination on their part to
 avail them selves of the
 power they have Mr STANTON
 Mr Speaker 1 would like
 to inquire of the gentleman
 from Virginia whether past experience
 of discussions upon the slavery
 question in this House warrants
 him in believinff that a
 discussion of it now for
 no practical ob ject can
 long contil ue a kind
 conciliatory and good natured discussion
 My own judgment is that
 il will not that it
 will result in useless in
 jurious and prejudicial crimination and
 recrim ination and because I
 think it will so result
 I therefore do not desiro
 to precipitate any discus Bion
 before it is called for
 on some measure dc manding
 the action of thc House
 Mr SMITH of Virginia 1
 say to the gen tleman
 from Ohio zand I say
 it with perfect con fidence
 that if that side of
 the House had met the
 movement from this side in
 that spirit of kind ness
 on which alone rest the
 hopes of tho coun try
 it would have had a
 pleasant and agreeable cflöct on
 ait sides The asperity that
 has been disclosed here has
 grown out of the fact
 that no disposition has been
 evinced on the other Sidc
 of the Housc to do
 anything to allav the existing
 ex I do say and
 I repéat it that had
 a citcment liberal kind generous
 disposition been disclosed by the
 majority of this House it
 would have car ried healing
 on its wino s not
 only upon the action o
 the committee but upon the
 I louse itself and I
 the country at large Mr
 STANTON Mr Speaker 1 confess
 1 am at a loss
 to know what has been
 said or done upon this
 side of the House to
 warrant the imputation of an
 exhibition of want of conciliation
 or kind ness When the
 resolution was offered by the
 gentleman s colleague Mr BOTELER
 it received the affrmative votes
 of a large majority of
 the members upon this side
 of the House Mine was
 not of the number for
 confess that I had very
 little hope of any successful
 result and I thought an
 unsuccessful attempt would perhaps do
 more harm than good I
 confess too further that do
 not myself see what them
 is in the existing condition
 of things that can be
 remedied by legis lation We
 have elected a President a
 thing that has been done
 every four years sincc the
 organization of the Government I
 do not see in that
 anything that can bc cured
 by legislation If there is
 any amendment to the Constitution
 to bc proposcd I desire
 to sec it and shall
 be very glad to consider
 it and act upon it
 for that cer tainly is
 the only effectual mode of
 accornplishing anything Mr MORRILL Ido
 not desire to consume the
 time of the House 1
 stated distinctly when I first
 rose that it was not
 from any indisposi tion to
 act on the committee that
 I asked to bc excused
 but because I thought it
 would be more convenient to
 the House and to myself
 I move the previous question
 Mr HOUS TON I hope
 my colleague on the committee
 of thirty three will not
 press his mo tion until
 a report can be madc
 from that com mittee or
 a request can be made
 to the House by thc
 chairman of the committcc l
 suppose I have a right
 to refer to its proceedings
 to this ex tent which
 if madc and acceded to
 by the House will deprive
 the gentleman from Vermont of
 all the reasons which he
 has assigned why he should
 bc excused from service on
 the committee If the honorable
 chairman of the committee will
 make the report or request
 to the I louse which
 I ur2derstand he has been
 to make It will obviate
 all the objections and rneet
 and an swer all the
 reasons that the gentleman from
 Ver mont has presented I
 hope the gentleman from Vertnont
 will allow that request to
 be mad e be fore
 he presses a vote upon
 his proposition to be excused
 yoted to excuse tl le
 gentleman from Florida and the
 gentleman from South Carolina and
 I will vote to excuse
 the gentleman from Ver mont
 or any other gentleman yet
 as the House has seen
 fit to preserve the integrity
 of the com mittee by
 refusing to excuse those gentlemen
 r hopc the gentleman from
 Vermont will allow the integrity
 of the committee to be
 still further pre served by
 withdrawing his request Mr coRWIN
 Mr Speaker hope the tlcmul
 from Vcrmont will withdraw his
 motion for the prescnt that
 may subn it a motion
 which I think will obviate
 the necessity of the request
 which he has made Mr
 MORRILL 1 will withdraw it
 for present CLERK TO SELECT
 COMMITTEE Mr CORWIN 1 offer

 The SPEAKER decided that the
 call camc too Mr SICKLES
 moved to reconsider the vote
 by which the resolution was
 agreed to and also moved
 to lay the motion to

 he latter motion was agreed
 to APPROPRIATION BILLS REPORTED M
 r SHERMAN from the Committee
 of Ways and Means reported
 a bill making appropriations for
 the consular and diplomatic expenses
 of the The bills were
 severally read a first and
 second time rcfcrt ed to
 the Committee of the Whole
 on the state of the
 Union and ordered to be
 printed EXPENSES OF INDIAN DEPARTMENT
 Mr SHERMAN from the Committee
 of Ways and Means reported
 the following resolu tion which
 was read considered and agreed
 to Resolved That the Committee
 on Indian Affairs be in
 structcd LO inquire and report
 whether any of the omces
 of superintendents of Indian afläirs
 Indian agents or inter prcters
 now authorized by law can
 be dispensed with without injury
 to the public service DESTITUTION
 IN KANSAS Mr SHERMAN I
 Inove that the committee be
 discharged from the further consideration
 of tbc memorial of Thaddeus
 Hyatt praying Con gress to
 makc appropriations in land or
 money to relieve the distress
 of the people of Kansas
 and that it be referred
 to the Committee on Territories
 Mr GARNETT Mr SHERMAN I
 call the previous ques ti
 on on my motion Mr
 BOCOCK I move to lay
 the memorial on the table
 Mr GROW I would say
 to the xentleman from Virginia
 that that part of the
 President s message relating to
 the same subject has been
 referred to the Committee on
 Territories This is merely a
 memorial accompanied by papers which
 was referred to the Committee
 of Ways and Means and
 it is now proposed to
 transfer it to the Committee
 on Territories Mr BOCOCK I
 have no particular objection to
 tho change of reference but
 I see it stated in
 the papers that this man
 Hyatt made himself very busy
 In getting up stories about
 destitution and suffering in Kansas
 when no such sufferinm existed
 I see it also stated
 in the Philadelphia Inquirer that
 in one of the places
 where Hyatt represen ted great
 desti tution as prevailing a
 grand ball was recently given
 by the people at two
 dol lars a head I
 therefore do not wish to
 have his memorial treated with
 such respect as to have
 it referred Mr GROW I
 do not know about that
 but tho subject is discussed
 in the President s mes
 sacre and has been referred
 to the Committee on Territories
 This memorial should take the
 same direction The previous question
 x vas seconded and the
 main question ordered and under
 its operation Mr SHERMAN S
 motion was agreed to PERPETUITY
 OF TIIE UNION Mr SHERMAN
 Unless it is the desire
 of the House to progress
 with some other business I
 shall move that the rules
 be suspended and that the
 House i csolve itself into
 the Committee of the Whole
 on the state of the
 Union Mr MORRIS of Illinois
 I believe I am en
 tilled to he floor on
 the resolution which I offered
 in the House ycsterdav evening
 Mr BURNETT i do not
 desire to interfere with the
 gentleman but I desire to
 understand whether his resolution was
 received by the House It
 was objected to at the
 time it was offered and
 I want to know whether
 it is before the House
 now The SPEAKER There was
 some little con fusion at
 the close of yesterday s
 proceedings on the subject of
 the resolution of the gentleman
 from Illinois but the Chair
 is very clear on this
 that the resolution was not
 received Mr BURNETT so 1
 thought The SPEAKER The Chair
 considered it in that light
 and has so informed the
 gentleman from Illinois Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois Then 1 certainly
 will not insist on the
 introduction of my resolu tiotl
 in violation of the courtesy
 of the House nor will
 I take an appeal on
 this occasion from the decision
 of the Speaker I have
 sought to introduce thc resolution
 and to get a vote
 of the I House upon
 it I think it I
 vould contribute some thing to
 our harmony and good feeling
 if we could only take
 that vote But if I
 am not allowed to introduce
 the resolution now 1 shall
 certainly Government for the year
 ending 30th June 1862 claim
 that I am entitled to
 the floor on Monday and
 also a bil_l making appropriations
 for the cur next after
 tho expiration of the morning
 hour rent and contingent expenses
 of the Indian de and
 shalt then move a suspension
 of the rules partment and
 for fulfilling treaty stipulations in
 order to get it properly
 before the House for writh
 various Indian tribes for the
 year ending consideration 1 30th
 Jane 1862 Now all that
 I have to say in
 addition to what 1860 THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 63 I have
 remarked is this that I
 should like to have my
 resolution read for the information
 of members and then if
 the honorable gentleman frotn Kentucky
 will get up and say
 that he is op posed
 to it or if any
 gentleman will say that it
 is a pcsolution which ought
 not to be considered by
 the House I will not
 of course ask for its
 con sideration at this timo
 I merely ask to have
 it read for infornvat_ion Mr
 BURNETT 1 desire to say
 that 1 am not on
 the confessional just now That
 resolu tion has been read
 and has been printed Mr
 MORRIS of Illinois The gentleman
 is entirely mistaken This resolution
 has not yet been read
 in the House Mr BURNETT
 1 ask the gentleman s
 par I supposed it was
 the resolution which he offered
 the other day when the
 proposition for raising the special
 committee was before the House
 I presume he has changed
 or modified it Mr MORRIS
 of Illinois Yes sir I
 ask for its reading now
 so that members may know
 what it is Mr BURNETT
 The resolution is not be
 ore the House and the
 gentleman cannot get it before
 the House in order I
 thought that ques tion had
 been decided by the Chan
 If so all this thing
 is out of order The
 SPEAKER There has bccn no
 decision to the contrary of
 that but the gentleman from
 Illinois asks to have his
 rdsolution read for in formation
 It vv ill be read
 if there be no objec
 tion Mr BURNETT 1 object
 to it PUBLIC STORES CONTRACT
 Mr SHERMAN 1 renew my
 motion to go into the
 Committee of the Whole on
 the state of Mr JOHN
 COCHRANE The reportofthe special committee
 in regard to the contract
 for the labor of the
 public stores in Broad street
 New York was at last
 session postponed to this day
 of the present session and
 is now in order But
 I believe that those interested
 in the report are not
 now prepared to proceed with
 its discussion Under these circumstances
 therefore I movc that it
 be further postponed till this
 day week Mr CURTIS I
 would say to the honorable
 gentleman from New York that
 the Pacific rail road bill
 is a special order for
 that day The SPEAKER The
 Chair would suggest to the
 gentleman from New York that
 he can call up the
 subject at any time on
 his motion to reconsider without
 any postponement Mr JOHN COCHRANE
 very well sir SERVICE ON
 SPECIAL COMMITTEE Mr MORRILL 1
 would like to know what
 has been done with my
 motion to be excused from
 service on the special committee
 to which was referred that
 part of the President s
 message relatinT to secession movements
 I did not with draw
 the motion I merely withdrew
 the call for the previous
 ucstion The SPEA CER The
 motion of the gentle man
 from Vermont was waived in
 order to give the gentleman
 from Ohio Mr CORWIN an
 op portunity to introduce his
 resolution If the gen tleman
 insist on his motion it
 is now in order Mr
 MORRILL I do and ask
 the previous question The previous
 question was seconded and the
 main question ordered and under
 its operation the motion was
 not agreed to PERPETUITY OF
 UNION Mr HINDMAN heretofore con
 sumed much of the time
 of the House in speech
 making or in offering bills
 or resolutions an4 1 ask
 the courtesy now to be
 permitted to respond to the
 invitation extended by the genl
 lernun from Ohio Mr STANTON
 by offering resolutions arnendatory of
 the Constitution of the United
 States with tha view if
 possible of settling the agitation
 of the slavery quest ion
 on a just and fair
 basis and of perpetuating the
 Federal Union I hope that
 gentlemen will meet these propositions
 in a spirit of fairness
 and frankness without rc sorting
 and 1 do not mean
 to impute an y such
 intention to them to legislative
 expedients or of the House
 must understand as fully now
 as he ever can the
 issues involved in this sectional
 con troversy will let my
 proposition be read and then
 I will continue my remarks
 Mr MORRIS of Illinois I
 object to the resolutions bei
 ng received I Offered a
 resolution dcclarhv our devotion to
 the American Union and objection
 was madc to having it
 read Now I object to
 receiving resolutions of this kind
 The SPEAKEä If objection be
 made the resolutions cannot be
 read Mr HINDMAN Let the
 Clerk send them down to
 me arid I will read
 them myself rhe SPEAKER The
 Chair desires to state to
 the gentleman from Arkansas that
 the same objection which applies
 to their being read by
 the Clerk applies also to
 his reading them him Mr
 HINDMAN Can 1 not embody
 them in my remarks I
 having the floor The SPEAKER
 There is nothing before the
 House on which we can
 act otherwise the Chair would
 be very happy to hear
 the gentleman s resolutions Mr
 I IINDMAN 1 should like
 to know from what source
 the objection comes The SPEAKER
 The gpntleman from Illinois objects
 CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC BILL Mr
 SHERMAN 1 move that the
 rules be suspended and that
 the House resolve itself into
 the Committee of the Whole
 on the state of the
 Union also move that the
 consular and diplo matic bill
 be made the special order
 in committee My purpose is
 if the House be so
 disposed to pass the consular
 and diplomatic bill to day
 The question was put on
 the latter motion and it
 was agreed to The question
 recurred on the motion to
 go into committee and it
 was agreed to So the
 rules were suspended and the
 House resolved itself into thc
 Committee of tho Whole on
 the state of the Union
 Mr BINGHAM in the chair
 and proceeded to the consideration
 of the special order being
 a bill making appropriations for
 the expenses of the consular
 and diplomatic service for the
 year ending 30th Junc 1862
 Mr SHERMAN 1 ask that
 the first reading of the
 bill be dispensed with and
 that it may be now
 taken Lip and read by
 sections for amend mcnt Mr
 QU ARLES Before the first
 reading be dispensed with I
 desire to ask whether it
 has becn printed The CHAIRMAN
 The Chair is informed that
 it has not Mr QUARLES
 Then 1 object to its
 consid eration at t his
 time Mr SHERMAN I will
 state to the gentle man
 from Tennessee that the bill
 merely provides for the payment
 of the salaries of the
 consuls and forcign ministers of
 the Government and for such
 diplomatic expenses as are required
 by law It conforms to
 the estimates and all the
 items may therefore be found
 in the annual cstimates which
 have been printed and every
 member fur nished with a
 copy Mr QU ARLES So
 far as the estimates are
 concerned I will state that
 I have not been sup
 plied with a copy nor
 have I scen them I
 have called for them and
 have been informed that they
 are away being printed bound
 Every gentle man knows the
 diffcutty there is in hearing
 the items as they arc
 read from the Clerk s
 desk I move that the
 committee rise It is not
 proper to legislate in this
 manner upon appropriation The question
 being upon the motion that
 the committee rise Mr QUARLES
 called for tellers Tellers were
 not ordered The motion was
 not acn eed to Mr
 SHERMAN 1 now ask that
 the first reading of the
 bill may be dispensed with
 Mr GARNETT object and call
 for the first reading of
 the bill The Clerk then
 cornmenced the reading of thc
 bill Mr BURNETT understand that
 this is parliamentary maneuvering by
 voting upon them the first
 reading of the bill Now
 sir respect directly and squarely
 so thul we luay understand
 fully ask thc chairinan of
 the Comrniltee of Ways and
 Means whether in passing important
 appro precisely what is the
 determination of the north It
 seems to me that every
 member priation bills we ought
 not to have them printed
 crn people and before us
 It is impossible in the
 cönfu sion prevailing in this
 Hall for us to understand
 all the items of the
 hill from the mere reading
 renew the motion that the
 committee rise Mr SHERMAN Ifthe
 gentleman from Ken tucky wilt
 alfow me I will again
 state that the items of
 this bill are taken without
 from the estimates of which
 every member or ought to
 have a printed copy The
 bill say is copied from
 the estimates and depends upon
 laws fixing the salaries of
 our consuls and other diplomatic
 agents It does nqt change
 any Mr BURNETT Theestimates lunderstand
 have been sent off for
 the purpose of being printed
 or bound They are not
 here certainly The little delay
 that will be required to
 enable us to have the
 bill printed and before us
 will makc not one particle
 of difference and I insist
 upon the motion that the
 committee rise Mr WASHBURN of
 Maine 1 hope the gen
 tleman from Kentucky will withdraw
 his motion for a moment
 Mr BURNETT 1 will if
 from Maine wishes to make
 any suggestion Mr WASHBURN of
 Maine apprehend therc can be
 no occasion for the committee
 to rise at this time
 1 understand the chairmara of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means to say that this
 bill includes no I ew
 or independent legislation that it
 simply provides for carrying out
 existing laws and is in
 every respect the same bill
 which was passed at the
 last session Every member therefore
 knows precisely what are all
 the items of the bill
 and is as well prepared
 to act upon it now
 as he would be if
 the bill and estimates had
 been printed and before us
 fora month So that I
 do not see any reason
 whatever for the committee rising
 or for any delay in
 the action of the House
 upon the bill whatever Mr
 GARNETT The gentleman says that
 the biil provides simply for
 carrying out existing laws Now
 I understood the eClerk to
 read a clause making provision
 for the salary of a
 min ister to Persia Is
 there any existing law pro
 viding for a mission to
 Persia SHERMAN The misunder stood
 the reading of the word
 Prussia I presume for Persia
 Mr GARNETT Then that is
 a good illus tration of
 tbc remark of the gentleman
 from Ten ncssee Mr QUARLES
 that it is impossible to
 understand the bill from its
 reading at the Clerk s
 desk _I say to the
 gentleman from Ohio the chairman
 of the Committee of Ways
 and Means that I think
 the bili and estimates should
 be printed and on our
 tables when we undertake to
 act upon an ajpropriation bill
 Even the esti mates are
 not before us Elihey have
 been sent off to the
 binder as I am informed
 want to examine the items
 even if they are only
 for car rying out existing
 laws How can you carry
 out the existing laws for
 instance in reference to the
 Italian States I have not
 seen the bill and do
 not know what is in
 it but I presume it
 contains provisions for the salaries
 of ministers at Rome and
 Na les Mr SHERMkN Not
 for Rome Mr GARNETT very
 well that shows then that
 it does certainly not fully
 carry out existing laws It
 may very possibly happen that
 in the progress of events
 before this bill shan become
 a law there may bc
 no need ofa minister at
 Naples Why then should we
 pass this bill in this
 hasty and inconsiderate manner To
 ask us to act upon
 it while the bill and
 the estimates are in the
 hands of the Printer is
 to ask us to deliver
 over all deliberation upon the
 appropria tion bills into the
 hands of the Commitlee of
 Ways and Means and while
 I have great confi dence
 in the gentlemen composing that
 commit tee I submit that
 this is asking a littke
 too much of the House
 Mr PHELPS I would submit
 to the gentle man from
 Ohio the chairman of the
 Committee of Ways and Means
 whether it will not expedite
 tho business of the House
 to allow the consider ation
 of this bill to go
 over until it has been
 printed Unless some gentleman desires
 to discuss the bill I
 will rnovc that the committee
 rise Mr SHERMAN will simply
 make this suuo estion to
 the House understand thei e
 is some diffculty in getting
 our docurgents printe L understand
 the orders which have heretofore
 64 been made during the
 present sessionto print still remain
 unexecuted and in the hands
 of the Su perin tel
 dent of Public Print ipg
 who says that the Public
 Printcr refuses to execute the
 orders Of the House for
 priming on occount of the
 re dgction of forty per
 cent made at the last
 session o Congress Mr GARNETT
 That then is one of
 the first fruits of our
 Black Republican rule Mr PHELPS
 There a remedy for that
 diffculty If the Public Printer
 refuses to exe cute the
 rders of the House for
 printing under the existing law
 the Superintendent of Public Printing
 is required to have it
 executed elsewhere ME SHERMAN It
 does noc strike me that
 the remark of the gentleman
 from Virginia Mr GARNETT Vas
 quite fair The reduction of
 forty pcr pent made under
 a law of the Iqst
 session changes the contract of
 the Public Printer and as
 a matter of course leaves
 him under no obli gation
 to execute any order of
 the House for printing Whether
 it is in consequence of
 Black Republican rule or white
 Republican rule of black Democratic
 rule or white Democratic rule
 he is not obliged to
 do the printing Mr RELLOGG
 of Illinois I desire to
 say to the gentleman from
 Ohio in reply to the
 sug gestion he has made
 that the Public Printer re
 fuses to perform the duties
 of his offce that I
 am credibly informed he is
 now lying sick that after
 having left his home he
 was not able to reach
 the Capitol and that his
 duties will be performed whenever
 he is able to be
 here He does not re
 fusc to perform them as
 I am credibly informed but
 the reason why the work
 is not going on is
 that have stated Mr HASKIN
 L desire to make a
 statement in referencc to this
 matter The CHAIRMAN The motion
 of the gen tlemnn Norn
 Missouri is not debatable Mr
 I IASK N I desired
 to make a statement from
 the Committee on Printing Mr
 PHELPS If the gentleman wishes
 to make a statement fronh
 a committee I withdraw the
 motion that the committee rise
 Mr HASKIN As referencc has
 been madc to the legislatiÖn
 of the last session 011
 the subjcct of the public
 printing I ask leave in
 justice to the Committee on
 Printing to make a statement
 I state for tho information
 of the House that to
 morrow they propose introducing a
 resolution to remedy the existing
 evils Reference has been particularly
 made to the fact of
 the compensation of the Public
 Printer having been reduced forty
 cent under the law of
 the last session Now sir
 I am authorized to state
 and it comes from MI
 I leart bhe of Public
 Print ing that the public
 printing can be done as
 well as it has been
 done heretofore and by the
 s une parties who have
 done the printing of t11C
 House during the last und
 the prcscnt scssion notwith standing
 thc reduction of forty per
 cent and yet mulce a
 fair profit The fact is
 that the I louse Printer
 cdected at the last session
 has never really to any
 part of his duties Im
 mcdiately subsequent to his election
 hc made a contract sab
 letting this printin y 10
 Larc otnbe the gentlemen who
 have executed thc printing of
 the House during this Congress
 xvliieh contract they bound themselves
 to give the Printer for
 this House twenty per cent
 upon the I hold in
 amount allowed under the old
 rates my hand statement from
 the Superintendent of Public Printing
 by which it will be
 seen that thc amount of
 certificates issued to the Pl
 inter for the House for
 thc printing done and to
 be done ordered at the
 last session is 60 157
 showing that that Printer elected
 by the House or his
 assio nee has received or
 vill reccive for print ing
 with which he has had
 nothing practically to do he
 of 12 031 40 So
 much sir for the Printer
 for this House Let me
 in addition refer to some
 facts which have in relation
 to the Printer for the
 Senate General Bowman who has
 the charge also of a
 certain portion of the printing
 of the House The statement
 I make I have obtained
 from the Super intcndcnt of
 Public Printing The amount paid
 out for the Senate printing
 and that portion of the
 House printing referred to is
 97 629 and he will
 receive enough more to make
 up the total amount to
 140 609 Genera Bowman who
 was elected the Printer for
 the Senate entered into a
 sub contract with Mr Rives
 by which the latter CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 12 was to
 do all the work and
 to pay the former thirty
 three and one third per
 cent of the amount allowed
 under the law for absolutely
 doing D0th ing Astounding as
 it may appear still it
 is not the less true
 that General Bowman for doing
 nothing will this year receive
 the sum of 46 869
 from Mr Rives who has
 executed all the work and
 furnished it to the Senateand
 the House In other words
 General Bowman having been elected
 I Printer for the Senate
 is really only the Printer
 in name receiving however the
 money from the Treasury and
 paying over sixty six and
 thirds per cent to Mr
 Rives retaining the re maining
 thirty three and one third
 per cent him self I
 state these facts for the
 purpose of show ing that
 the action of the House
 and of the Senate in
 passing the joint resolution of
 last session which was approved
 by the President reducing the
 rates of the public printing
 forty per cent was just
 and proper Under that resolution
 there will on the printing
 which will probably be ordered
 during this session amounting to
 about two hun dred thousand
 dollars be a saving to
 the Treasury now entirely depleted
 and bankrupt of 80 000
 I give notice on behalf
 of the Committee on Print
 ing that I will bring
 this matter before the House
 to morrow when I will
 offer such resolutions as the
 exicencies of the occasion demand
 Until then I defer any
 further remark What I have
 said has been called forth
 bvlluSions of other gentlemen Mr
 PHELPS moved that the committee
 do now rise The motion
 was agreed to So the
 committee rose and the Speaker
 having resumed the chair Mr
 BINGHAM reportcd that the Committee
 of the Whole on the
 state of the had the
 Union Union had according to
 order generally under consideration and
 particularly the consular and diplomatic
 appropriation bill and had come
 to no resolution thereon STATE
 OF UNION Mr BRANCH Mr
 Speaker 1 ask leave of
 thc House to present a
 resolution to which think there
 can be no objection Cries
 of Read The Clerk read
 the resolution as follows Resoh
 ed l hat Unmediately after
 the reading of the Jour
 nal to morrow morruing the
 States and I erritories shall
 be called for bills and
 resolutions the bills aud resolutions
 presented under said call to
 be recerred without debate to
 the select committee qt thirty
 three on the President s
 message and no notion to
 reconsidcr tlle order of referenec
 of any 01 such bills
 and resolutions shall thereafter be
 in order There was no
 objection and thc resolution was
 received Mr BRANCH The resolution
 Mr Speaker simply givesan opportunity
 to the members of the
 House to present any resolution
 bill on the sub iect
 matter of thc resolution of
 the gentleman from Virginia Mr
 BOTELER and to have it
 referred to the committee of
 thirty three It is obvious
 that unless this bc donc
 under a special order of
 the House mernbcrs who have
 such propositions to oflk n
 will hardly have an opportunity
 to do so previous to
 tho action of that committee
 Mr STANTON 1 ask the
 gentleman from North Carolina to
 modify his resolution so as
 to provide that bills and
 resolutions in reference to the
 subject matter before the committee
 of thirty three shall be
 referred to that committee and
 that other bills and resolutions
 which may be intro duced
 shall take another reference Mr
 BRANCH The of the resolution
 is precisely that indicated by
 the gentleman from Ohio Everything
 presented to morrow goes to
 that comrnittee If any gentleman
 has anything in his possession
 that does not relate to
 the sub jcct lnattcr referred
 to that committee it will
 of course not be introduced
 on the call to morrow
 because he will not desire
 it to go to that
 gom mittee Mr STANTON So
 I understand and my object
 is to allow on that
 call the introduction of other
 bills and resolutions for reference
 to appro priate standing committees
 Mr BRANCH I call forthepreviousquestion

 question was seconded and the
 main question was ordered to
 be put and under the

 to read the amend ments
 reported by the Committee on

 was in the scvcnth line
 of the first section to
 strike out one hundred and
 insert fiftv Mr HUNTER 1
 will state that that is
 to alter thc denomination of
 the Treasury notes so as
 to make thcm fifty dollars
 There will bc great difiiculty
 in gettiyvg them off at
 par at any ratc We
 think that will contribute to
 it T he amendment was
 agreed to The next amendment
 of the commitlcc was at
 the ond of section two
 to insert And thc pt
 occeds of thc sales the
 public lands shall bc specifically
 plcd ed and set apart
 tn redeexn the said notes
 at par and the Secretary
 of the Treasury is hereby
 au thorized to purchase such
 notes at par with the
 funds thus specifically pledged Cor
 the redenii tion of the
 notes issued under this act
 Mr SIMMONS 1 should like
 to hear some reason assigned
 for that amendment NEW SERIES
 NO 5 pledge and we
 never heretofore have scen the
 day when we were not
 able to raise möhey at
 pleasure upon a general pledge
 But zno f x the
 statc of public credit is
 vcry different T hc Seh
 ate must be aware that
 it is very hard to
 get off even United States
 sccut itics Our five cent
 stocks aro down to ninety
 or ninety two and un
 less We do something to
 give special seciu ity to
 this note which we propose
 now to issue there will
 be no chance of getting
 it off at par I
 believc l do not speak
 from my own opin ion
 but from what I have
 heard from sources that I
 respect that if we reduce
 the denomina tion of the
 notc to fifty dollars and
 if we pledge the proceeds
 of the public lands to
 redcom thiS specific issue we
 shall be able probablj to
 get it off at par
 or something like that abd
 if wé do not do
 that I fear we shall
 be as badly off with
 these notes as wc were
 with thc loan uriiesg we
 determine to do never would
 agree to do to sell
 thc Treasury notes and take
 anything they may bring giving
 the Secretary of the Treasury
 unlimited discretion to sell them
 at anything 1 an I
 not willing to do that
 and if I arn not
 of no other moans of
 raising Inoney except by pledging
 this specific fund and there
 is also an other provision
 to which we shall soon
 come in the shape of
 another amendment to be presented
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 suggest to
 chairman oPthc committee whether it
 is not better to explain
 the bearings of alt thc
 amendments which the com mittee
 propose bcfore we proceed to
 vote on any of them
 They secm to be connected
 together I should like to
 have the matter fully understood
 with reference to the amendments
 that will be proposed and
 for what they are substituted
 in order that we may
 know what are the differences
 between the proposition of the
 Housc and that of the
 Scnatc committee Mr HUNTER It
 will give mc great picas
 Mr HUNTER This is an
 nmendmont which ure to do
 so The bill as it
 came from the House proposes
 to set aside tho proceeds
 of the sa cs of
 I of Representatives proposed to
 issue Treasury the public lands
 for the purpose of redcemino
 these notes There is a
 sul scquent provision that any
 of the public creditors who
 choose to take the notes
 at six per cont may
 do so It witl contribute
 to Inakc the notes pass
 it known that this fund
 is specifically set aside for
 their redemption I he Secretary
 of thc Treasury is authorized
 to purchase them at par
 as far as this sum
 roes at any time This
 will c ontribute as we
 havc good reason to believe
 to the currency of the
 note It is much better
 to have it with this
 provision than without It Mr
 SIMMONS 1 see that this
 section of the bill as
 it is now pledffcs the
 faith of the Govern ment
 to the redemption of these
 notes and I never was
 willing and never will agree
 to give collateral securitv for
 the honor of this Government
 in any If the honor
 of this Government is not
 onue suffcient to enablc it
 to get credit upon six
 per cent notes f shall
 be very much mistaken It
 seems to me that this
 is a singular time to
 sct apart funds for the
 redemption of notes payable a
 year ahead when we have
 not funds enough with all
 the resources we have got
 to pay our debts as
 they become due The proceeds
 of the sales of the
 public land are now liable
 to pay any demand upon
 the Treasury and ought to
 bc kept notes of a
 denomination not less than one
 hundrcd Jt also proposed that
 thesc Treasurv notes should be
 put at a rate of
 interest not ex cecding six
 per cent avid that any
 of the public creditors who
 choose may take thcm at
 six per cent and for
 thic residue that the Government
 I rnay borrow money upon
 these Treasury notes r I
 he meaning of which pro
 at any rate it can
 vision was that the Government
 might sell the i Treasury
 note below par and get
 anything that it could at
 the discretion of thit Secretary
 of the Treasury and the
 President Instead of that the
 Committee on Finance proposc to
 reduce the de I hat
 will to give nomination of
 the note it currency Then
 instead of giving this unlim
 ited discretion to take whatever
 can be had for the
 Treasury note to thc Secretary
 of the Treas amount of
 3 000 000 trying it
 to a limited amount the
 Secretary should advertise to give
 that amount of Treasury notes
 to thc bidder who will
 agree to give par for
 them at the lowest rate
 of interest whatever it may
 be We thus try the
 market and put itout at
 that rate of interest which
 in this way we save
 the will make it a
 par bid discretion which is
 otherwise proposed to be re
 posed in the Secretary of
 the Treasury and the President
 W c ascertain what is
 the lowest rate in the
 Treasury for any demand that
 may be madc of interest
 at which we can get
 par for the Treas from
 day to day and wo
 should not issue notes I
 ury note Bidders are invited
 We put out the payable
 in a year out ofa
 specific fund when we Treasury
 notos to the amount of
 3 000 000 in have
 already sot apart all our
 funds for the pay order
 that we may sec how
 it works and limiting li
 it to an amount that
 we shall want very speedily
 I hope this amendment will
 ment of other debts not
 prevail and be put in
 the Treasury note bill I
 in the Treasury I recollect
 hearing it suggested twenty years
 ago The advantage of this
 is not only saving this
 payment credit is to bc
 given for the amount of
 or more but there never
 was avote in the Senate
 discretion in the Secretary and
 the President but in this
 vvay may put out a
 Treasury note to put such
 a on the statute book
 principal and interest due on
 the note or notes rc
 which will remain out because
 we try the market ceived
 in payment on the day
 when tbc same i Mr
 HUNTER It used to be
 the old doc and we
 give that market rate of
 interesb which trine in Inatters
 of finance when you were
 bor shall have been received
 by the proper offcet The
 Sccretary of the Treasury is
 also directed rowing Inoncy to
 pledge a specific surn to
 redeem will make the note
 go at par We all
 know that I believe in
 the days of Mr Tefferson
 it was a Treasury note
 of that sort at this
 time Would to cause to
 be paid thc principal and
 interest of it these Troasury
 notes at the time when
 according not thought safe to
 borrow money otherwise be of
 immense advantage to the community
 are not legislating in reference
 to commeréd bilt to the
 provisions of the act the
 same should be After the
 credit of the tJnited States
 became in disputable and was
 good everywhere there was II
 we ought to vork our
 financea give to it II
 and he is further authorized
 to purchase the notes at
 par for the amount of
 principal and no necessity for
 anything moi e than a
 general all the incidental benefit
 inay bé afforded e 66
 frotn bhemy and we know
 that a Treasury notc which
 would go bt par would
 be of immense as sistahce
 nt this timc We have
 no safe means I mean
 safe to the Government to
 ascertain what could go out
 at par except this device
 of ascer taining an l
 giving the notc to the
 bidder who will take it
 at the lowest ratc of
 interest Give all a chance
 to the extent ofihese 3
 000 000 and then give
 it out at the lowest
 rate of interest what cvc
 r that may be YVe
 also proposé inasmuch as it
 is eXceedingiy äificult now to
 give credit to any spccics
 of cur rency to set
 aside the proceeds of thc
 public lands so that the
 Secretary of the Treasury rnay
 at any lime to _that
 atnount buy in the notes
 at par Any public creditoruho
 receives them at six per
 cent because he is obliged
 to t akc tbcm at
 that or nöthing will find
 that he has Iosc by
 it but this is to
 give him an opportunity to
 some extent to get the
 money We believe that with
 all these securities we may
 p rhapg get out a
 note which will circulate at
 ar Mr SIMMONS MI President
 I am willing to give
 every facility that will give
 currency to these notes but
 we havc already now son
 e thir teen millions of
 Treasury notes out and thc
 whole revenues of the Government
 are pledcred to their redemption
 Now I ask the Senator
 from Vir giniå if he
 would strengthell public credit if
 he should tnke the funds
 that are pledged for the
 notes that we huve out
 and make them special funds
 for thosc notes that we
 are about to Issue Do
 you mean to promisc according
 to your hopes fs that
 the wav arid pay according
 to your fears to get
 credit There is not a
 dollar of publi c money
 received from the public lands
 that is bot already pledged
 to the redcrnption of rrrcasury
 notes that will come luc
 this year l he wav
 to keep thc public credit
 good is not to doubt
 it our selves Let thc
 country litoow that we have
 doubted confidence ill thc credit
 of this Govern ment We
 have no funds that are
 not pledged to public creditors
 to borrow money upon Let
 notes be sold for what
 they will bring if we
 full price for then But
 cannot gct the hold that
 good faith requires that we
 should teal with all creditors
 alike We håve l orrowed
 twenty or thirty nay Ilenu
 forty million within a year
 or two and pledged this
 very fund for the payment
 that is now propox ed
 to be set apart ill
 order to enable you to
 hire money itt better rates
 on these notes Let us
 not doubt t he credit
 of this Govcrnment ourselves and
 the public will have confidence
 in it Mr HUNTER If
 this were a question of
 bankruptcy and the distribution of
 assets the argument of thc
 Senator from Rhode Island would
 be correct The general fäith
 of the Government is plédged
 for the redcmption of all
 its stocks and not es
 l ut it is to
 be hoped the Government will
 be able to pny all
 its debts nnd we are
 assisting those who hold Governmcnt
 tocks if we can put
 In order to do out
 n security which is at
 par that we propose to
 give a special to those
 notes W c propose to
 set aside specially the lands
 so that the bidders pu
 ocecds of thc may be
 encouraged to take these notes
 at par If l ve
 can get out of Treasury
 notes at par will it
 not help the credit of
 the other Treasury notes and
 all he stocks not only
 of this Government but of
 the State Governments themselves Mr
 CLARK Do I understand the
 chairman of the Comrnittee on
 Finance to say that he
 lieves the notes would not
 go at par unless this
 specific appropriation be madc Does
 he think it necessary to
 make this mortgage Mr HtiNTER
 undertake to define the precise
 limit to which they will
 go or will not go
 I think there wili bc
 great difficulty in gettinff I
 know I increase the chance

 getting then out if I
 set apart this fund I

 It is ble to hear
 Senators on the floor there
 is so much confitsion in
 tho lobbies Mr SIMMONS 1
 say 1 did not to
 call in question at all
 the propriety of the mcmbers
 I bclieve they who recornmcnd
 this measure think it will
 facilitate the parsing of tbcsc
 notes But call thc attention
 of the Senate to this
 fact that Senators who are
 opposed to any urranarc tnent
 of the public lands any
 disposition of thern that Congress
 may sec fil to make
 may choose to tie themselves
 up or tie up the
 majority of Congress by pledging
 thc proceeds of these lands
 to a certain use That
 I suppose t be the
 real motive with some I
 do not say it is
 välh all I do not
 object to the reduction of
 thesc notes to fit y
 dollars although I think that
 is ofa very doubtful expediency
 It sets up this Goverumenl
 ill the issuing ofa currency
 That is what it is
 intended to do to issue
 notes for a currency But
 I shall confine myself now
 to this question about credit
 and the condition in which
 this It will send it

 a controversy bo tween the
 two Houses about thc amendment
 is said we want the
 money to be raised by

 to that but it is
 well known we have it
 here by bills and I
 have a right to speak
 of it large majority of
 House of Representatives have another
 disposition of these lands than
 thc pledging of then in
 this way When you cornc

 Mr HALL 1 would be
 obliged if somebody is on
 the amendment proposed by the
 Committee would sta e precisely
 what will be the practical
 II differci ce between the
 honorary or legal obliga on
 Finance Mr ShMMONS I should
 like to have the i
 tions of the Governrnellt whether
 this tunenchnellt rro my mind
 there is not any is
 adopted or not yeas and
 nays on the amendment Tbc
 faith of the Government and
 all its revenues The reas
 and nays were ordered Mr
 ÅIMMONS 1 very much dislike
 to are pledged to the
 honest redemption of its obli
 gations and I wish somebody
 would state the practical difference
 cither in a legal or
 an hon orary point of
 view whether the amendment is
 adopted or not do wish
 to indicatc by this that
 I shall votc against the
 amendment Mr CAMERON Mr President
 1 to explain to the
 Senator from Rhode Island the
 dif ference between the specific
 appropriation in this i do
 not kl jow what bill
 and an ordinary one the
 difference is between the honorary
 and legal responsibilities of the
 Government ana therefore cannot explain
 that to thc Senator from
 New Hampshire but in answer
 to the Senator from Rhode
 Island this amendment of the
 Conunittee on Finance as I
 understand it proposes that the
 proceeds of the public lands
 shall bc specifically appropriated for
 thc paynnent and redemption of
 It has been customary to
 thcsc Treasu ry notes pledge
 the whole procccds of the
 public lands to the payment
 of special debts The M
 hole pro cccds of the
 sales of public lands that
 comc into the rrreasury are
 appropriated to the redemption of
 these notes T hc practical
 effect will be this noy
 friend from Rhode Isla ld
 has a Treasury note for
 100 for pay now due
 to hinv he goes to
 the TreasUry and the Secretary
 of the Treasury Mr Touccy
 or whoever rnay bc Secretary
 just now Mr Senator wc
 havo no money to day
 says but next week we
 shall have sorne money re
 ceived fron l the proceeds
 of the sales of the
 pub lic lands and next
 Tuesday morning I will pay
 I lc will you your
 note out of that special
 fund then go tbcrc on
 that day and get it
 That is the practical result
 of this thing It has
 been very to appropriatc these
 lands to this purposY and
 I ti ink justly so
 At present we arc strait
 The Senator from Rhode Island
 to whom I generally look
 for in formation on such
 subjects seems to believe we
 can scll our bonds at
 price I do not think
 so I see that in
 the New York mtu kct
 yester day our fives wcre
 selling at ninety two cents
 one thousand United States fives
 duc in 1865 selling ninety
 two cents on the dollar
 Coupon bonds 1871 were selling
 at eighty five cents I
 he loans of tho State
 of Nkisso uri six per
 cents wcrc selling yesterday at
 sixty three cenls Six pcr
 cents ot the Slate of
 Virginia were seliincr ut scvcnly
 tln ce cents Now n0
 man who i In the
 habit of dealing in money
 in the city of New
 York believes that he United
 States sixes are rnuch rnore
 than the sixes Virginia at
 wortli least the Senator from
 Virginia vould think so though
 belicve they command a little
 more Pennsylvania fives are selling
 for about ninety I believe
 they are a littlc better
 than two cents any of
 the others It has been
 customary in all the coun
 tries of the world so
 far as I understand it
 to allow the peo plo
 to come in and takc
 a portion of the loans
 ox I think that finan
 Cial act of the Government
 Louis Napoleon by which he
 cna bled every Frenchman to
 come and takc a proportion
 of the loans of the
 Government did Ilin more credit
 certainly gave him more popularity
 than any financial act of
 his Therefore I should be
 clad to sec these Treasury
 notes isst tcd in any
 sum I supposed when not
 less than twenty dollars the
 bill camc into the Senate
 that it was recom mended
 by thc committec that they
 should be issued for stuns
 of twenty aud fifty dollars
 I hat would enable everybody
 m the country no matter
 how humble to take a
 portion of this loan would
 make it popular and give
 currency to it I remember
 the old doctrine of the
 Democratic party which I never
 believed when I was in
 the party that we ought
 to make no currency Cur
 rency is a mere term
 It may mean anyihing or
 I believe that if the
 Government adds nothing to its
 credit by enabling every person
 to take a portion of
 this loan it does a
 public good and therefore I
 should be willing to issue
 these Treas ury notes now
 in any sum down to
 twenty dol laps But that
 it seems cannot be done
 The public loan due on
 the 1st of January will
 require as I understand about
 two million dollars to pay
 the interest on it No
 man here would be willing
 to see the day go
 by without the interest being
 paid i believe there is
 not a man in Con
 ress who has not enough
 national pride to be unwilling
 to let this debt go
 without the interest being paid
 the day it was promised
 Therefore I will consent to
 pass this bill just as
 it is re i ported
 and enable the Secretary of
 the Treasury 1860 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

 very mucll more it but
 these are mv views li

 than I do Ir SIMMONS
 I hope the Senator from

 credit of this Govern MI
 SEWARD am quitc scont ent
 sir with Pennsylvania does not
 suppose that f want to
 rnent all the amendrnents which
 are proposed by the Object
 to the retting of this
 money I have stated Now
 then what shall be done
 in the alternative Committee on
 Finance atthougli 1 agree wiih
 tho already that approve of
 that part Of thc bill
 that I i prescn ted
 W c may pledge the
 proceeds of the honora ble
 Senatoi from Mainc that it
 would was to give to
 the Secretary the right to
 issue at any rate of
 interest that he could have
 it taken for at par
 That agree to but m
 v objection is this specific
 amendment now under consideration entangiino
 our land system with this
 subject and makino a different
 provision for the redemption of
 these notes from what we
 do for ali other species
 of our debt That is
 my objection Mr BIGLER It
 seems to mc the Senator
 from Rhode Island is manifestly
 mistaken in the import of
 this bill It certainly in
 no way em barrasscs the
 public lands 1t would not
 inter fere Wilh au y
 disposition Congress might make of
 them although it is a
 specific pledge of the proceeds
 of the public lands Whatever
 may come into the Ih
 easury is pledged for the
 redemp tion of these notes
 That is tbc way I
 under stand the bill The
 Senator from Rhode island scems
 10 think it is a
 pledge of the land and
 would embarrass any subsequent action
 of Con in reiörcnce to
 it I supposc I understand
 what he means He thinks
 It would interfere with the
 honoc stead bill I do
 not understand the chairznan of
 1 11c Conunitlcc on Finance
 to take that view of
 the subject Mr HUNTER It
 does not interfere with that
 at all It only pledges
 the proceeds of the lands
 It interferes no more with
 the homestead bill than the
 general pledgc of the public
 credit which already exists public
 lands specifically The sales last
 year have been better to
 reduce the denomination of wore
 about a million and a
 half dollars accord these notes
 to twenty dollars Heretofore l
 have ing to thc returns
 I do not know the
 exact sum resisted the issuit
 lg of Treasury notes of
 the lower If we put
 out this amount of Treasury
 notes and denominations That was
 at a time when the
 the procccds of thc public
 lands so far as market
 was cntircly at ease when
 the banks they go to
 the payment it is security
 Is it any were going
 on in their ordinary operations
 and thing more than has
 been done before by this
 the issuing of those notes
 miTht have interfered Government and
 at n very recent or
 a compara with the prosperous
 business of banking but the
 tivcly recent period too I
 understand not Is issuing of
 notes of so small a
 denomination as there any discredit
 about it Why it is
 precisely fifty dollars or even
 tl venly dollars would I
 what an individual does in
 likc cases Hc raises money
 the money market is hard
 hc wants more and what
 does he do He pledges
 a spe cific portion of
 his property which is productive
 which produces rents which the
 creditor knows I will produce
 rent Is thcrc anything discredit
 able about that Not at
 ail Is there anything of
 bad faith about that Not
 unless a mar who owes
 money can never make mort
 acyes of his property on
 new ioans either personal or
 real It is not coiosidercd
 discreditable or dishonest His properly
 is pledged to be sure
 and his credit is pledged
 I prcstune the samc rule
 applies to the case ofa
 State as of individuals that
 a Inan ora State who
 has borrowed Inoney upon its
 general his general credit Ilia
 y if necessary plcd rc
 a specific portion of its
 or his o enerak estate
 in order to raise inore
 knoney if needful Now 1
 free to say I doubted
 xvhether this was expedient in
 the present ca sc I
 doubted whether it was necessary
 I did not bind myself
 VIr SIMMONS I am not
 saying it would to support
 it I saw the diffcalty
 sucrcrcstca by interfere with it
 but I say it would
 be used as an Mr
 HUNTER Cannot the general pledge
 bc used as an argument
 Mr SIMMONS Not at all
 Mr HUN I ER I
 think it is a very
 fair argument SIMMONS It is
 a pledge of the sources
 of the Treasury now This
 is all I have to
 say do not think we
 ought to make any dislinction
 between thcse notes and any
 others that have been issued
 NIC FESSENDEN Mr President tbcques
 tion as presented to us
 is a choice between two
 alternatives do not pretend to
 bc particularly learned on these
 financial matters and perhaps if
 nuv friend frorn Rhode Island
 and my friend from Pennsylvania
 agreed in their views i
 micrht bc convinced or at
 any rate persuaded to yield
 In y friend from Rhode
 Island It was very pos
 Sible people might raise an
 objection to it with reference
 to this anticipated homestead bill
 and It is easily explained
 however and I have prepared
 an tuncndmcnt which I proposed
 to offer at 0TH period
 that nothing hcrcin con tained
 should be construed to affect
 the right of the Government
 to dispose of its public
 lands to actual settlers as
 it might see fit but
 after all that is matter
 of form I lle thing
 is substantially so i now
 No amendment of that kind
 would change the legal efflwt
 We set aside the proceeds
 of the sales of the
 public lauds to redeeno these
 notes The policy of this
 Government is perfectly well understood
 all the world knows it
 and tl iat i policy
 is to give away a
 certain portion of its public
 lands for the purposc if
 you please of raising the
 value of the rest We
 are not break I ing
 faith then in reference t
 o the matter and if
 my own judgment but when
 doctors disagree this proposition would
 as many think have an
 those of us who are
 not doctors must come to
 effect to increase the facility
 of gettincr money on the
 bcst conclusion we can these
 notes so far it is
 As said before this is
 a choice between two I
 I hen sir thcrc is
 anot hcr matter and that
 is as it originally can
 e from the things The
 bill thc proposition of the
 committee to reducc t he
 I lotise provided substantially that
 the Secretary II deriomination of
 the notes I was in
 favor of of tbc I
 rcasury nligllt sell these Treasury
 notes for what he could
 get for them W c
 know very well that the
 Inoney market is regulated by
 mon eyed men and if
 thev saw a provision in
 a bifl of this kind
 that the Secretary has power
 to put them into the
 market after advertisc nent or
 bc fore and sell them
 for the stun he can
 get for them pledging them
 in point of fact tho
 result will be mn my
 judgment they will not go
 off atrall or it will
 be very difficult except at
 a very great sacri fice
 because the money market would
 be con trolled to that
 purpose and end Therefore to
 my mind the provision was
 objectionable not say that I
 am right but it wras
 not satisfac tory to mc
 It iooked like assuming that
 we vcre in a condition
 t hat we were obliged
 to sell our securities for
 what we could get for
 them to put them in
 the market I do not
 think we are quite reduced
 to that condition nor do
 I choose unless in a
 case of absolute l ccessity
 to put it in the
 power of any otlicer to
 do that especially at the
 present time Then sir we
 had the other alternative Some
 i thing ynust be 101ie
 evidently in the present state
 of the money market to
 cive a fi eling of
 security in those notes that
 we are about to put
 out What shah we do
 We know very well it
 must be reducing it to
 twenty dollars and I am
 yet but still f think
 it Ilia y operate at
 fifty dollars i I YVith
 regard to the third provision
 to put up portion of
 this loan if you call
 it a loan to auc
 i tion at such a
 rate of interest as you
 can sell it for at
 par I did have great
 doubts whether it was necessary
 and if it was not
 necessary I would not do
 it I have those doubts
 stiil The ma joritv however
 overruled mc in that particular
 I and l sce no
 verv ø reat objection to
 it It is un deniable
 that we have money to
 raise at a certain in
 order to preserve the public
 i i period very near
 credit which n ust be
 done at all cvcnts but
 it is doubtful or it
 bc doubtful porbaps that will
 depend upon we can meet
 it and if we allow
 a certain portion enough II
 to rncct it to be
 plac cd before the public
 pre ciscly in that light
 it was bclieved that that
 would save all question on
 that score That was the
 view of the connnittee That
 sum is but 3 000
 000 a small sum and
 the in terest on which
 is not worth talkino about
 But I takc it that
 without reference to ideas merely
 we rnusl as practical deal
 witli a practical subject difitercd
 from the majority of the
 connnittec in some of these
 details I do nowe but
 really as think now be
 a sellsible relief to the
 money market and in aid
 of the banks throughout the
 country who arc unable to
 supply paper in this merc
 temporary emergency In regard to
 the provision pledging the avails
 of the public lands it
 strikes me as cmincntly right
 and proper I do not
 think that the Credit ot
 an individual is any the
 worsc if wllen ho finds
 it necessary to borrow ynoney
 he hypothecates a security which
 he has I take it
 that it rather shows a
 plain frapk honest borrower and
 if he has specific securities
 he succeed in getting money
 cheaper than he would if
 hc withheld them and stood
 upon his general charac er
 But really it amounts 10
 nothing for Congress still reserves
 the entire disposition of the
 public lands accord in r
 to the Consutution although it
 shall give this plodgo of
 the avails which shall be
 rcccived into the r Ih
 easury Congress makes no specific
 pledo e of these avails
 for the rodernption of the
 notes till the avails from
 that source come in and
 now thosc avails with all
 the other resources of the
 country aro already pledged as
 effectually without this provision as
 witli it Nor do I
 see that there is anything
 unusual or peculiar in the
 transaction I know Lhat there
 is no Statc in thc
 Uniop whose credit has generally
 been better than the Stutc
 of New York We have
 never been too proud and
 have never felt ourselves too
 rich to pled rc the
 revenues dcrived from our canals
 our chief sourcc of revenue
 in dependent of taxation for
 loans which werc made to
 be expended in tho prosecution
 of our system of internal
 improvements And we go so
 far as not only to
 pledoc them by law but
 tl ley have been from
 the beginnin Y of our
 system of inter nal improvements
 in the year 1817 until
 this year 1860 perpetually pledged
 to the public credit In
 times of gloom like these
 it has becn a source
 of confidence and strength and
 has enabled us to pay
 our interestand redeem our stocks
 falling due times when all
 the banks of the country
 had suspended specie payments and
 even the Gov ernment of
 the United States had suspended
 specie payments It seems to
 me a very legitimate way
 and really what is new
 to the country what is
 especially important is that this
 Government should be lifted up
 and placed upon a sound
 basis of credit and as
 this is a mere temporary
 measure and a partial one
 I trustthat before long the
 Sen i ate will take
 up the question of the
 revenue which has been submitted
 to them by the House
 of Rep resentatives and wili
 provide for replenishing he Treasury
 in a substantial and permanent
 way Mr SIMMONS Mr President
 since mcnced my present term
 in the Senate we have
 passed two or three loan
 bills and several Treas ury
 note bills We passed a
 Treasury note bill at the
 first month of the session
 of 1857 58 when thcrc
 was greater commercial distress than
 ever knew in the country
 We then made no specific
 pledges and yet we got
 the money we wanted at
 a lcss ratc of interest
 than six per cent and
 at a time too wlicn
 doubt if any stocks on
 II the list were quoted
 as high as they are
 to day I know that
 thcre was Inore distress in
 the money market in 1857
 than there is at this
 time I objection is to
 goinz out of the regular
 beaten il track It looks
 as it we were alarmed
 ourselves In 1857 the for
 tbc credit of the Gove
 rrnucnt r Preasut y iri
 the rnidst of rhe Secretary
 of the greatest pressure that
 ever was known issued a
 proposition to sell sot ne
 eight or ten ruillion dol
 lars of Treasury notes and
 they sold a par and
 I it is a mere
 natter of common sense applied
 to a think bore a
 less ratc of interest than
 fivc per cent manifest to
 everybody who reads the reports
 of common and ordinary t
 hing Lhatifwc simply putout ties
 enough about it 10 justify
 the opposition that Now I
 should like to know wha
 there the state of the
 market 4 268 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE December 12 is to
 apprehend So much difföultj in
 the sate Of I Mr
 WADE L suppose we can
 amend the these notes and
 why we should make Specific
 pledges of pa rticular funds
 for their redemption when we
 have no such Fledges in
 ahyxloan bill now in existence
 It would show to the
 country that we ourselves doubt
 the creditof the Govern ment
 I think it is the
 worst policy in the world
 agrce that the Statc of
 New York may make a
 debt to construct a Canal
 and may pledge the toils
 on the canal s to
 pay the interest thcre is
 no troublc in that but
 am asking the attention of
 the Senator from Virginia to
 the question now liknow he
 is familiar with all these
 b efm e us Ci
 reasufry note and loan bills
 that we have passed did
 not think it nccessary in
 1857 to pledge Qi y
 specific funds and yet the
 notes sold at par at
 three or four per cent
 interest Mr FESSENDEN 1 would
 like to my friend if
 he adverts at all in
 his mind to thc fact
 that a portion of the
 last loan that we authorized
 is not taken at the
 present time Mr SIMMONS All
 has been taken that was
 advertised and I understand that
 this is to be substitute
 the remaining portion of it
 Mr FESSENDEN Not at all
 it is entirely independent of
 it Mr SIMMONS well 1
 read the ment for that
 loan T herc was 10
 000 000 ad vcrtised for
 and it was all talec
 n at u premium MI
 FESSENDEN The money I las
 not been paid Eliough Mr
 ShåMONS Trouble on of Ille
 bidders who got the loan
 failed to pay but i
 say that in 1857 when
 there was greater pres sure
 than there is now we
 miide no such pledge and
 i do not doubt that
 noxv these notes will go
 at par There is a
 difliculty you say in per
 iliuing the Secretary of the
 l reusuvy to have the
 discretion of seliinxr theun below
 p I do not I
 do not believe there see
 a y difficulty in that
 here w 110 would perrn
 it the thith of u
 Senator I v n lent

 1st of January bccac_tse tliey

 put tint in this is
 that we can E ot

 objection to thig proposition is
 that it changes our system

 changes it now for temporary

 I consider an objection to

 I fear that this amendment
 will with tho right of

 with the homestead bill It
 seems to me that it
 may have that effect The

 If he is aøainst the

 for him to vote ao

 what he has suggested he
 will get up a long
 debate on the homestead meas
 ure know what the amendment
 is and I think when
 the Senator offers it he
 will find that it goes
 further than he thinks Ido
 not think myself that this
 interferes with the right of
 Congress to dis pose of

 Mr CAMERON the is taken
 I sucygost that we strike
 out the litnitation of and
 allow the provision to apply
 to whole seam When I
 ngrced to supposed the was

 dollar notes regard to that
 1Mr U J iV1 L
 R i that I thou
 rhf it was better to
 try the amount we obliged
 to have in order to
 sec how it would work
 uncler the hope that if
 this pledge of the public
 lands remained and the notes
 wer b reduced to fifty
 dollars we could work off
 the residue but nåysclt to
 applying this pro have no
 objection vision to the whole
 amount Mr COLLAMER If 1
 this matter aright the House
 sent us a bill fox
 the issuing of I roasury
 notes with authority in the
 Executive to sell all of
 those notes from timo to
 time as occasion should require
 for the purpose of rais
 incr rnoncy at whatever price
 they lüight bring 1 tbc
 amend ment now offercd to
 be to confine the 1
 0Wer of the Executive in
 disposino the market at what
 they may of those notes
 in bring to Mr FESSENDEN
 Mr CAMERON Oh no Mr
 COLLAMER What is it then
 Mr CAMERON If the Senator
 will allow me I will
 state what it is bill
 as sent here by the
 House authorized the Secretary of
 the l rcasury with the
 approval of the President to
 by pothecate these notcs at
 any sum for which he
 could raise money on them
 in other words to borrow
 money and give these notes
 as collateral security and of
 course if the money should
 not be paid at maturity
 the notes would have to
 be sold for what thcy
 would bring The amendment i
 is that the Secretary of
 t 1110 Treasury is to
 adver tise for proposals to
 take the mo cy at
 par at the lowest rate
 of interest at which the
 notes will be taken and
 it confines that advertisement to
 3 000 000 Mr COLLAMER
 At six per cent Mr
 CAMERON At such a rate
 of interest as he can
 get the Inoney for at
 par Mr COLLAMER dislike that
 limitation to 3 000 000
 I have no objection to
 the power bc ine iven
 to the Executive to dispose
 of these notes for such
 money as ilia y be
 wanted but to limit that
 to only I am opposed
 to as at present advised
 f understood the honorable Senator
 from Virginia to suggest that
 that was the sum which
 would bc imrnediatcly needed Now
 sir I understand that that
 is needed in this way
 about that sum will be
 wanted in January for the
 purpose of paying the interest
 on the pub lic debt
 Mr HUNTER under that not
 quite that but about that
 Mr COLLAMER it Now Mr
 President i think there is
 just the same need and
 at the very same time
 for money yond the amount
 required to pay the intcrest
 on the public debt Lau
 January there was an issue
 of I rcasury notes which
 were sold for money I
 think 10 000 000 for
 one year They were made
 receivable for public ducs and
 some of them may come
 in and probably havo come
 in in pay ment of
 duties but the great body
 of these notes asl understand
 the matter remain out now
 They are not yet due
 but they will be due
 just about the time that
 the interest is due on
 the public loans The Treasury
 issued the notes at tiffer
 ent dates because the subscribers
 paid in the money at
 different times and I cannot
 fix the dates precisely but
 I think they were all
 issued in the first part
 of January last tun reminded
 that therc was last session
 pro vision made for a
 loan of 20 000 000
 tln the pur pose of
 redeeming the Treasury notes then
 out Gentlemen understand very well
 that only half that loan
 has been advertised and bid
 for and a part of
 the iuoncy paid and a
 part of it not paid
 but that does notat all
 provide for the case l
 herc are I reasury notes
 which we issacd last January
 that will fall due next
 January i he lher 10
 000 000 con tained in
 the twenty million have never
 bcen ad vertiscd for and
 the loan bill power to
 borrow them remains in the
 har ds of the Secretary
 of the I reasury now
 Bids cavi be advertised for
 if he thinks proper but
 it is prob ably not
 thought advisable to do that
 and it is proposed by
 the issuc of these l
 reasury notes to get Ilioney
 arid we are to try
 to sell them par E
 c cannot sell thetn below
 par accordiner to In y
 VIC cannot sell recollection of
 the proposition loan in the
 state of thc Inoney rna
 rl et tho and it
 is not probably ad visable
 to try that at he
 and hence this provis on
 for present rnoment lh casury
 holes Well then we want
 these rrreasary notes not Tierely
 to i iterest 011 the
 loan fulling duc in January
 but also to pay the
 l rcasut y notes falling
 due in January with the
 interest upon them Mr HUNTER
 1 will say to the
 senator from V cu rnont
 that I much prefer that
 thc ame ruent should prevail
 but we took what we
 thought we could carry We
 arc to have a certain
 amount and I do not
 wish to risk a failure
 of the bill Mr COLLAMER
 Whv are we not obliged
 to provide for the one
 as well as for the
 other IV L HUNTER Because
 it may not be mandcd
 How do we knox v
 that it will bc dc
 manded Mr COLLAMER The public
 faith to the redemption of
 the Treasury notes which fall
 duc in Januarv and certainly
 it needs the sanl _
 provision for thc payment of
 then as for the payment
 of in tercst on the
 loan You might as well
 ask me how do I
 know that the commu nity
 wikl ever look for the
 interest 011 the loan There
 is just as good reason
 to believe they will present
 the Treastu y notes They
 cannot got IntcrcstÖn them without
 presentina them Sup pose I
 hold one of the notes
 payable in January with interest
 am obli rcd to present
 it because cannot get interest
 beyond the day it is
 due without presenting it You
 have not agreed to I
 t is only in pay
 me interest beyond January terest
 for one year contained in
 the note Mr HUNTER we
 pay interest on until it
 is called in Mr COLLAMER
 Certainly until the Bs ued
 presents it Say I have
 a I reasury notu last
 January with interest due upon
 it on the 6th day
 of January next Mr HUNTER
 It bears interest until the
 Sccretary of the Treasury advertises
 for it to come in
 Mr COLLAMER No sir it
 bears just that year and
 a man cannot keep t
 litt in his I know
 it pocket and wait for
 it to be galled in
 for I have had occasion
 to buy some of the
 notes I did not buy
 them for myself I had
 not the 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL
 GLOBE 69 it was for
 a company sonable possibility a
 reasonable chanc that we the
 public lands that portion of
 them which is moncv to
 buy them svith may not
 be able to do it
 except in this Way and
 sold and the proceeds Ot
 whiclf åre bfoUght iotö It
 is understood that the that
 wanted them holder n vast
 present the note or lose
 interest and t i hence
 1 am willing to submit
 to it buÜL am not
 the Treasury Thosé proceedsa16ne arc
 pledged to go further because
 i dislike the prin for
 tlie redemption of these n0tCS
 The hence it bc presented
 as a matter of course
 themselves are not pledged I
 feel moro than But Mr
 h resident desire that tile
 provision ciple and for one
 I am unwiilino to admit
 that for the saic of
 trrcasury notes should extcnd to
 the credit of the Government

 r i ordinary interest about
 this matter bécause l am

 to get money suffciéfit to

 paper for paytnent svhen it
 is duc and to have
 them told that they must

 that position tbc probabflity is
 that we i tliat intcres

 market and thc answer is
 Oh well you can go
 into the market and sell

 Who should suffer that discount

 the Government there fbre dcsife
 that the amendmcnt as h

 from Pennsylvania has proposed should

 Mr FESSENDEN Com mittcc on
 Finance has stated that this
 proposition now made for an
 amendment is satisfactory to him
 aad it would have been
 satisfactory to him had it
 remained applicable to the whQle
 loan fThat induces me to
 state that I am responsible

 the reasons for in thc

 1 W ish to say
 to n v friend from
 Vermont that he rnay not
 ac if vc arc to
 attempt to plish his purpose
 meet on the 1st day
 of January next the amount
 of r i reasury 1i0tcs
 that then becomc payable havc
 a larger amount of issue
 than 10 000 000 at
 present time for this is
 intended to rneet other obligations
 of the Govcn nmcnt decidedly
 inore prt ss ng and
 in which the credit of
 Lhe Gov involved is disposed
 to make an urnend I
 C the Senate to this
 bill of the House by
 we shall increase this amount
 largely enough to cover not
 oniy the present liabilities of
 the Government for cash to
 preserve its credit but also
 to cover the lircasury notcs
 that mav be prcsentcd at
 that time arid redeem those
 that will be for considera
 tion of Congress but I
 takc it nobody wants t
 go above the at thc
 present tiroe tl iis bein
 m a mere temporary expeüicnt
 I wish to stop there
 wc do not itself as
 it does feel disposed to
 increase the amount of the
 House bill and un10ss we
 do we cannot accomplish the
 Mr COLLANIER The Senator will
 indulge me for a moment
 in sayincr that I do
 not suppose the 10 000
 000 of Which I spoke
 as falling duc in January
 are all standing out because
 those notes are recci vable
 for dues and no doubt
 a consider able portion of
 them has been so received
 Mr FESSENDEN 1 tell how
 much may be st4nding out
 at this time I do
 not know Therc may be
 possibly a way of finding
 it out I do not
 know how but suppose the
 chairman of the committee can
 inform me Mr HUNTER There
 morc than ten 1 believe
 million outstandi ng Mr FESSENDEN
 But of that particular issue
 of Treasury notes Mr HUNTER
 if they all sente d
 on tbc 1st of January
 this is not enough Mr
 COLLAMER Part may have come
 in to pay for duties
 Mr FESSENDEN Ido not know
 how much may be outstanding
 I am speaking of the
 amount for which we are
 liable What it may be
 I can not tell Now
 am opposed entirely to putting
 int o the hands of
 the Government unless it is
 absolutciy necessary the power to
 sell these I 10tes I
 do not believe in the
 for what they will bring
 i do not think the
 credit of the Gov idea
 at all ernment has come
 to that bad pass that
 we ought to put that
 power into the hands of
 the Execu tive For myself
 I am opposed under all
 cir cumst a nces to
 having our paper shaved in
 this way for that is
 the amount of it may
 suflör a severe loss aud
 injure the credit of I
 was _a little mortified and
 greatly surpfised to the Governt
 nent very much the destruction
 Of find gentlemen on the
 other side who vere talking
 our paper in consequence of
 the power thus given about
 secession all voting to savo
 the credit of That my
 view of it Whether it
 is sound or count ry
 while some of my friends
 he rc whQ ought I
 have no grounds to be
 for saving this country were
 deserting us not the Senate
 can Mr COLLAMER V That
 is your motion for opposing
 such a proposition other than
 these public grounds that I
 have stated but asa matter
 now of course I unay
 be wrong in all this
 I have as Mr CAMERON
 I have been making an
 ex I ought to have
 confidence in the financial knowl
 planation motion at all But
 if 1 were allowed 1
 would mak i a motion
 to change the denomina edge

 this is not a wise

 COLLAMER tho Chair state Mr
 CAMERON 1 do not that

 The Secretary proposed oriffinally in

 With that issue I believed

 use to pay tne intcrcsb
 due on the pub lic
 debt on the 1st of

 he had made no I

 or any other subterfuge The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair that
 the credit of a goverrnnclil
 is like the credit i
 of an individual W hcn
 money is much in understands
 frorn the Secretary that there
 is no amendment of the
 Senator from Pennsylvania mand individuals
 have to pay a high
 price for it pending but

 The bill is before the

 they would be p erfcctly

 note for twenty dollars in
 payment and still opcn to
 amendment The Chair will ill

 if you make the notes
 fifty stale to the Senate
 that the bill hus not
 been read Is it the
 pleasure of the body to
 dollars that class 01 creditors
 cannot take them through as
 yet have the bill read
 through or to dispense with

 certainly in Then there my
 State a large number of
 people who yearly its reading
 Mr WADE Is it now

 sir lay up tcn or
 fiftccn or twenty dollars a
 year I That class of
 people will be glad to
 get your Mr WADE I
 desire to amend the amend
 twenty dollar note and receive
 the intercst which mcnt which
 has been adopted pledging the

 that will make ita cceds
 of the public lands for
 the t edemption of currency
 In addition to that the
 income from this debt the
 public lands last year was
 That The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Chair will amount will be
 applicable to the redemption of
 I state to the Senator
 that that will not be
 in order these Treasury notes
 and it is a sufficient
 specie until the bill shall
 have been reported to the
 Sen ate ft is now
 in Committce of the Whole
 The basis to pay all
 that bc demanded I look
 at this matter in a
 common sense view l Chair
 hcars no objection to dispensing
 with the reading of the
 bill 1 can see no
 more harm in the Government
 issu small notes than in
 individuals or states or Mr
 FESSENDEN 1 think it had
 better be I banks issuinx
 them What wrong can it
 do I read if anybody
 will attend to it The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Secretary Is
 there any difference in principle
 between issuincr a twenty dollar
 note and a fifty dollar
 note The only difference is
 that practically the onc becomes
 a currency for the rich
 and the other a currency
 f01 the poor No wrono
 is done to anybody but
 great good is done to
 the Government by it I
 think you will save some
 two or three per cent
 in interest on your debt
 if you agree to issue
 8 000 000 of notes
 in twenties and fifties and
 hun dreds and direct the
 Secretary of the Treasury to
 issue at once at such
 a rate of interest as
 he can receive and get
 for the notes taken at
 par That is my view
 of it Now in regard
 to the homestead bill I
 have to say that this
 will not affect it at
 all not voted for that
 bill as steadily as anybody
 else will read the bill
 Mr CLINGMAN I suppose everybody
 has read it who wants
 to know what it is
 It is in print and
 we have heard the amendment
 I hope the reading will
 not be insisted upon Those
 who would not read it
 themselves will hardly listen to
 it Mr FESSENDEN I shall
 make no objec tion The
 PRESIDING OFFICER The Chair hears
 no objection to dispensing with
 the reading of the bill
 The bill was reported to
 the Senate as amended and
 the question was stated to
 be on concurring in the
 amendments made in the Committcc
 of the I svas willin
 l to go just so
 far as was absolutely necessary
 and no further to preservc
 the credit i i Arn
 not as much devoted to
 its principle Have Whole Of
 the Government for we have
 got to provide not c
 very reason to be anxious
 that every man Mr WADE
 I now move my amendment
 It comes in at the
 end ofthe amendment already who
 can should geta home on
 the public domain tain our
 credit at a day so
 near that there is a
 rea This amendment merely pledges
 the income from adopted pledging
 the proceeds of tbc public
 lands THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 12 to the payment and
 redemption of the debt The
 words which I propose to
 add are But nothing herein
 contained shall be held to
 affect the right of Congress
 to dispose of satd lands
 to actual settlers and Nhm
 purposes on such terms and
 conditions as it may deem
 to be advisable Mr President
 it is said that the
 amendment which has been inserted
 without the amendment to it
 which I now propose wouJd
 not affect the power of
 Congress to grant lands under
 the pro visions of the
 homestead bill but I fear
 it v rould have that
 effect for I do not
 see how after pledg ing
 all the public land for
 the redemption of this debt
 we could make donations of
 land for other purposes and
 thus prevent its being applied
 ac cording to the pledge
 of Congress It seems to
 me that this cuts up
 the homestead I would also
 say to those policy by
 the roots who are favorable
 to thc Pacific railroad that
 we may want a grant
 of lands for that object
 and it seems to me
 if we pledge all our
 lands specifi cally for the
 redemption of this debt it
 would not be good faith
 to the creditor to apply
 them or If this pro
 their proceeds to other purposes
 vision made no actual diflt
 rence as to our power
 it would seem to make
 a difference and it would
 seem to me not cxactly
 to be good faith to
 the creditor to hold this
 induccment out to him and
 then to pass away the
 substratum on which he had
 advanced his money by so
 disposing of the lands that
 no proceeds would ever come
 for the I hope therefore
 that redemption of the debt
 all sympathize with the homestead
 policy and all who believe
 we ought to keep thcsc
 lands in such a con
 lition that we nay apply
 them to the construction of
 the Pacific railroad or for
 othcr purposes to which Cono
 rcss may see fit to
 appropriate them will vote to
 rctain out power over them
 Now sir for xnyself I
 utterly opposed to holding onr
 lands or disposing of any
 of tl acm would have
 them all any Iohger for
 rcvcnuc withd ra w n
 for other purposes entirely and
 I havc no that t
 hc credit of this Government
 would suffer cvcn if the
 lari ls were never I
 have no doubt or question
 but that to aid it
 those w ht wish to
 loan nooncy have faith enotlffll
 in the ability of this
 Go vcl l rnel lt
 to redeem all its debts
 without pledging anything but its
 Ill nor for their redeunption
 Mr CLINGI A AN I
 auderstand that the Sen ator
 is averse to our using
 t hc public land to
 pay our debts he that
 it shall he given away
 under the provisions of Lho
 homestead bill It struclc Inc
 as so extraordinary a position
 that w her it was
 ad tnit tcd the Government
 was in straightened circumstances and
 its credit was low any
 gentlexnnn should object to paying
 its debts with its own
 property bccausc hc preferred giv
 ing it n way that
 I begun to cast about
 ill my own mind to
 fill l on what principle
 the Senator from Ohio was
 actil ff rJ he only
 argument or instance or precedent
 that I can find to
 I lis views is the
 declaration of Mark Antony whorl
 h was at the end
 of his career that he
 had triven away I sup
 lost exccW what he had
 b honorable S snator wishes
 to be to pose the
 say if disaster should fall
 upon thie Go vertnnpnt that
 alt any rate it has
 saved what it gave away
 and therefore instead of payino
 our debts with the public
 property hc wishes to distribute
 it to whoever wants it
 the oricrinal HUNTER 1 said
 when amendkncnt was ponding what
 now repeat that I do
 not think its adoption or
 alters ut ail the power
 of Congress in regard 10
 the disposi tion of thc
 public lands that is to
 say although their power is
 inst tbc satne under the
 amend boon without a creneral
 ment as it would have
 pied ye believe that if
 the lands pledged gen era
 iy a kid the IT
 venues arc pledge l and
 bc Government has credit and
 pay its debts it can
 dispose of the public lands
 in any i believe that
 to bc so without way
 it chooses this provision and
 without a general l ledgc
 and even without any F
 icdge but ata time when
 credit is low and it
 is doubtful in regard to
 the payment that is a
 of debts if there be
 any doubt about it good
 argurncnt against making any other
 dispo when a man goes
 in debt that he pledges
 all his effects to pay
 it Therefore I think this
 amend ment of the Senator
 from Ohio ought not to
 bc ad opted because I
 cannot say witliout is amend
 ment that it is nota
 consideration with us to pre
 serve the public property in
 order to apply It to
 thcpublic debt I think things
 have got to that pass
 that we should consider all
 these means of securiag the
 public credit and of strengthening
 it I shall not vote
 for the amendment but the
 adop tion of the amendment
 will not make me vote
 I think it is surplusage
 If I a ainst thc
 bill have an ohiection it
 is that it is denying
 what I think is a
 fair arcyument and would be
 a fair ar gument without
 this amendment not that this
 amendment alters the power of
 the Government to dispose of
 the public lands any more
 than the original obligation Mr
 G WIN The Senator from
 Ohio says that In thal
 he is this is a
 pledge of the public lands
 surely mistaken The provision as
 it has been incorporated in
 the bill does not pledge
 an acre of the public
 lands They are in no
 way pledged It is merely
 to the payment ofthcse notes
 at all provided that the
 proceeds of the sales of
 the pub lic lands shall
 bc applied to the redemption
 of the notes and if
 no lands are sold there
 is no fund pledged for
 the payment of the notes
 and Con gress can make
 any disposition of the public
 lands precisely the same as
 if this provision was not
 in the bill Ifthoseprocceds only
 amountto 100 000 the money
 is to take that direction
 If they amount to 2
 000 000 it is to
 take that direction If it
 amounts to nothing thcre iÅ
 nothing to cret There no
 pledge at all of the
 lands and therefore the Government
 has power to dispose of
 the lands as it may
 see fit without violating any
 faith pledged in this bill
 Mr WADE I do not
 wish to take up time
 on this subject but if
 we say on the face
 of our bill to a
 creditor who is about to
 loan money to the Governrnent
 that tho proceeds of our
 lands shall bc for the
 redemption of his debt t
 do 1K t really sce
 how or why can in
 good faith dispose of those
 lands f or other purposes
 so that no proceeds can
 conoe from them So it
 strikes rne and I should
 not suppose that would be
 fair leafing with thc creditor
 unless it was the fact
 the fact that this Govcrnment
 was able to redeem all
 its dcL ts without any
 pledge of the public Ian
 ls i suppose it would
 weigh very little It the
 mind of the public creditor
 Gut neverthc less i it
 is neccssary in order to
 inducc him to loan money
 to the Government to mak
 this pledge it strikes me
 we should make no other
 disposition of the lands while
 it is outstanding We should
 not diminish the proceeds of
 the pub lic lands that
 are plcdgcd for this purpose
 So it strikes me but
 I shall not consumc umc
 I only ask that the
 yeas and nays may be
 taken upon this amendment Ehe
 yeas and nays were ordered
 and beint taken resulted yeas

 the first amendment made by
 thc Committec bf the Whole
 which was in sec linc
 seven to strikeout one hundred
 tion one aed inscrt fifty
 r i he nrncndtnent was
 concurred in I suppose the
 next question Mr HUNTER is
 on concurrinc r in the
 aåTH ildment which has just
 been amended The PRESIDING OFFICER
 Yes sir i Mr HUNTER
 to have it read as
 amended The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Secretary will read the amendment
 made as in Committee of
 thc W bole as it
 has now been amended The
 Secretary read it as follows
 sition of the public land
 than using them to pay
 At tho end of tbc
 second section insert I believe
 that is a good argument
 i vhether debts t11C procccds
 of the sales ot thc
 public ands shall It is
 a good this amendtnent is
 adopted or not bo specifieally
 pledgé i and set apart
 to redeem the said ar
 rument whether thero is anv
 pledge notes at par but
 nothing herein contained shali be
 held to specified in the
 bill or not because it
 is implied II affect the
 right of Congrcks to dispose
 of said lands to ac
 tual settlers and for other
 purposes on such terms and
 Mr HUNTER 1 must confess
 that as the Senate has
 amended tlie amendment I do
 not like it As it
 was originally it did not
 interfere with tho diSposition of
 the public lands but to
 votc for thc amendment as
 amended implics some assent i
 am to the homestead policy
 as it seems to me
 I am willinø to leave
 it an not willina to
 do that open question The
 amendmcnt as I offered it
 did not piedgc the lands
 but only the proceeds I
 am not disposed to agree
 to the amendment as amended
 Mr G WIN I hope
 the yeas and nays will
 be taken on the amendment
 as amended and I trust
 it will bc stricken out
 We had better take the
 bill as it came from
 the House of Represent It
 will facilitat e legislation atives
 in that respect a great
 deal more and hasten the
 iSsuing of these I would
 rather not amend the Treasury
 notes bill at all in
 this respect and I call
 for the yeas and nays
 on thc question of concurring
 in the amendment as amended
 The yeas and nays were
 ordered Mr FESSENDEN I wish
 simply to say that I
 doubted very much whether it
 was advis able in the
 first place to put in
 this pledge o the public
 lands but I yielded to
 it in committee Now however
 masmuch as the chairman thinks
 he would rather have it
 out in the present state
 of things T shall continue
 to vote with him Mr
 COLLAMÉR 1 wish to say
 one word in ox planation
 of tho vote I propose
 to give consider that the
 amendment making this pledge as
 it now stands amended pledging
 the proceeds of the public
 lands provided nevertheless Con gress
 may be at liberty to
 dispose of those lands for
 any purpose they think proper
 is and amounts to no
 pledge at all and gentlemen
 around me an nounce that
 that was the motive and
 purpose for which the arnendment
 was made Then if it
 means nothing at all it
 should not be kept in
 There is an insincerity in
 it tQ which I do
 not choose to be a
 party Therefore viewing it as
 i no pledge and as
 intended to destroy any pledge
 I shall vote acrainst thc
 amcndmcnt being there i Mr
 TRUMBULL 1 think that is
 the gen era feeling everywhcrc
 that the amendment as had
 best bc stricken out and
 if the Sen ator California
 will allow the vote to
 be taken it will be
 stricken out without any yoas
 and nays about it Nobody
 is for it that I
 know of I am willinff
 to with Mr GYViN very
 well draw the call for
 the yeas and nays The
 PRESIDING OFFICER If there is
 no objection thc call may
 be withdrawn Agreed l T
 hc question is on concurring
 in the amendment made in
 Committee of the Whole as
 amended The amendment as amended
 was not con currcd in
 The next amendment made as
 in Committee of the Whole
 was from line nine of
 section four after the word
 President to strike out borrow

 not less than ten days
 in suell papers as the
 President tna v direct the
 said advertisement to propose to

 to f hose may offer
 to take the satne at

 those bids no fraction shall
 be considered which Inay be

 Mr President I will now
 renew my motion made some
 time acro to so as
 to let the out the
 words three million I whole
 sum be subject to such
 price as Ilia y be
 Mr HUNTER 1 think it
 would be safest to adhere
 to the amendment of4he committee
 Let us try these three
 million first We shall soon
 know how it will work
 and then we can tell
 whether we can carry it
 further Let us take what
 we can carry and not
 attempt to go any further

 the consideration of the followincr
 resolution as modified by Mr
 POWELL on the 10th instant
 Rcsoh cd I hat so
 much of tbe President s
 messaae as relates to the
 present agitated and distracted condition
 of the country and the
 grievances between the stavcholdina and
 the non slaveholding States bc
 referred to a spccial cotaruittee
 of t hirteeu mernbers and
 t hat said committee bc
 instructed to inquire into the
 present condition of the country
 and report by bill or
 otherwise IVIr WlGFALL Mr President
 last week the Senator from
 Kentucky Mr POWELL moved doubtless
 by patriotic iE1tcn lions introduced
 a resolution to have so
 much of the President s
 mcs sage as related to
 the present distracted condition of
 the country referred to a
 committee of thirteen That resolution
 came up regularly for discussion
 on Monday and vas debated
 yesterday also During the discussion
 yesterday the Senator from Illinois
 MI DOUGLAS was indulging in
 some patriotic p atitudes upon
 the subject of saving the
 Union and understood him to
 say that he was prepared
 to make any effort in
 his power to ac complish
 that very desirable object Hc
 congrat ulutcd the Senate upon
 thc fact that we were
 goin F into details and
 asked for specifications as to
 the t hc wrongs or
 imagined wrongs til der which
 southern States wore suffering or
 supposed them selves to be
 suffering and as I understood
 pledcred himself that wben our
 grievances were made known hc
 would be ready to redress
 them as far of course
 as lay in his power
 Under this state of things
 I stated to hirn that
 one of the grievances under
 which the southern States sunposed
 they were sufferi1P was that
 this Government denied that slaves
 were l roperty and upon
 that denial recused to protect
 the owners of slaves in
 their titlc W hchevcr they
 were within the Federal juris
 our property would be protected
 when within the I did
 not get a direct an
 Fedcral jurisdiction sv rer and
 suppose shall not He answered
 first that if we desired
 protection we should in troduce
 a bill and that I
 would Icarn by his vote
 which would then bc recorded
 whethcr he was ready to
 afford that protection or not
 He then proceeded to charge
 upon me personally and upon
 Senators from the South that
 during ihc last ses Sion
 of Congress we had by
 our votes rcpudi ated this
 very doctrine the right of
 protection I took issue with
 him upon that fact and
 asked 10 bc tried by
 the record He failed to
 produce I Ic atternpted to
 do so He mistook a
 rcso it lution which was
 introduccd by the Senator from
 North Carolina Mr CLINGMAN for
 a resolution that was introduced
 by the Senator from Missis
 then stated lhy motives sippi
 Mr Davis for voting against
 the resolution offered by the
 Senator from North Carolina A
 resolution was then referred to
 by him which was introduced
 by thc Senator from Mississippi
 Mr BnowN I denied again
 that I was committed to
 any such doctrincas hc had
 attril uted to me I
 again asked He replied that
 at the time the for
 the record that he might
 debate took place he sick
 have been misled by thc
 newspapers and that he would
 this morning bring in the
 record Now sir I undertake
 to prove the negative and
 I shall proceed to do
 so Very briefly bccause it
 is amat ter of very
 little concern whether I have
 been consistent or not The
 Senator roun Mississippi Mr IDA
 vrs in troduccd among r
 others of a serics of
 rcsoiutions the following RcsoLncd L
 hat neither Congress nora Territ
 orial Lc gis aturc whether

 right of any citizen of

 IJnitcd States docs the intervention
 ot Congress for tbc protccüon
 of ptopcrty in slaves Mr
 BROWN of Mississippi moved to
 strike out the word not
 Mr CRITTENDEN said It seems
 to me that that presents
 a matter of fact for
 the decision of thc Senate
 whether tbe existing condition of
 the l erritot ies docs
 now demand any interposition of
 do not know that it
 does I do eonaressional authority
 not kilow that it does
 not Mr DAvrs said The
 question presented is amere question
 of fact The resolutions on
 which the Senate arc voting
 are deelarat ions of principle
 As to the question ot
 ihct l should concur Inore
 with my colleague and if
 I had to vote tor
 either proposition should vote for
 his dcclaration because I rather
 think the ueccssity does exist
 but tuatis an opinion which
 am not prepared now to
 declare as a fact Neither
 is it truc that have
 ever retuscd to vote for
 the bill which the Senator
 my colleague introduced The bill
 has never been before the
 Senate iör an expres Sion
 of opinion Mr GREEN said
 There is one other reason
 why this question of tact
 ought not now LO be
 considered and voted on and
 that is this there is
 no Senator here who can
 say that the Con stitution
 and the laws and tile
 rclnedies provided by the laws
 at present ate not adequate
 to protect every consti I
 know Inyself so far as
 tutional right in thc Territories
 the slave question is concerned
 that a replevin has been
 brought in the Territory of
 Kansas which is now pending
 in the court Mr BIGLER
 said Before the vote is
 taken I desire to say
 that I shall vote aøainst
 the amendrnent and against the
 ori inal prop ositi01 l
 of the Senator from North
 Carolina Wew 1 obliged to
 meet the issue of fact
 I should say that there
 is no ne ccssity at
 tllis for Mr BENJAMIN suggested
 that the diffculty could be
 removed by both the res
 olution introduccd by the Senator
 from North Carolina and the
 amendment of Mr Bnowx Mr
 WIGFALL said I shali vote
 against both resolutions and for
 reason the Senator from Louisiana
 has given and in that
 way I think ve shall
 have aceotnplished everything can do
 by laying the reso uti0i1
 on the table As has
 been ob I believe the
 Scnator from served by one
 ot the Senator g i
 avzs it is utterly incongruous
 it is unheard 09 that
 in a series of resolutions
 settin r brth prin ciplc
 n qties tion oP fact
 should be brought up here
 to be It an entire
 non sequitur of the Senator
 from voted for Ohio that
 becau c we do obiect
 to vottng upon questions an
 v intention to eonnn it
 an act of duplic it
 is unddi its jurisdiction when
 the ncCessit y shali arise
 I do not know Whether
 the necessity now arises 1
 am ready by actual legislation
 does arise to Carry these
 rosohitions into tny opinion effect
 but I not now prepared
 for f believe thO CöV0de
 committee has not yet ascertaincd
 the fact as to the
 con dition of the logislation
 of Kansas precisely at this
 time Doubtless before the end
 of the ecssiOEi they wil
 ürnish us the information If
 they do not we may
 at söuie subse quent tune
 obtain the When I am
 satisfied either that Ibe Territorial
 Legislature haspasscd aets that are
 unconstitutional or that the courts
 håve failed and re Used
 to render adequate redress or
 that the courts arenot competent
 to do it shall be
 prepared to vote Or actual
 legislation Now sir the complaint
 which I stated yester day
 on the part of the
 slaveholding States was not that
 there had been no legislation
 but itwas that the Senator
 from Illinois and those whom
 he represents deny our right
 to legislation That is the
 grievance That was the qucsäon
 which I wanted ansxxvered When
 we say that there is
 necessity for legislation when our
 property has been confiscated in
 Territories that belong to the
 slaveholding well as to the
 non slave boldinc States will
 he interpose by thc legisl
 tive by thc executive and
 judicial departments of the Federal
 Government to protect that species
 of property as well as
 every other species of prop
 erty I herc is the
 plann naked proposition a question
 which coen be understood by
 any one but which I
 say in all candor 1
 do not expect to be
 answered directly and plainky by
 him I ask the Senator
 now will he propose amendments
 to the Constitution will he
 vote in his bQdy for
 amendmcnts to the Constitution will
 he pledgc himself in good
 faith to go back to
 the people of Illinois and
 urge before them the ratification
 of those amendment s to
 the Constilution not only vesting
 in the Federal Government the
 power but also making it
 its imperativc duty to protect
 s avc property as it
 is its duty to protect
 every other spcc es of
 property If he wili do
 that t ieil there v
 ill be onc of the
 diffcullics to a reconciliation removed
 But he answers me that
 I am mistaken there is
 no excitement upon the subject
 at tho South we have
 never complaincd the pcople are
 not dissatisfied He tells us
 that there are two ox
 tremes in this country The
 people of the far East
 and those who livc down
 upon thc Gulf misun derstand
 this question entirely and the
 people of Kentucky and of
 Illinois understand it all and
 he and some gentlernan i
 do not know who from
 Missouri who happened to be
 in the Cham ber could
 if they were appointed a
 committee settle this whole diffculty
 in the course of very
 few minutes Now sir I
 say to the Senator that
 neither he nor any friend
 of his in Missouri can
 settle this question The people
 of these States can settle
 it or to makc myself
 understood these States can settle
 it They can settle it
 and they I only can
 sett le it They made
 the Constitution They provided in
 that Constitution for its amend
 ment The States who are
 parties to the compact can
 altcr that compact They can
 concede to this Federal Government
 powers wvhich this Federal Government
 does not now possess They
 can take from this Federal
 Government powers which it does
 now possess If thesc Stoles
 then desire to have a
 new understanding of the bargain
 and can agree upon the
 terms this Union can be
 saved but this Union is
 not to be saved by
 flattering either upon the floor
 of this Senate or upon
 the stump You cannot save
 this Union by singing hosannas
 to it You cannot save
 this Union by making 4th
 of July speeches Whipped syllabub
 is not the remedy for
 the patient You havc got
 to come down to your
 work and you have got
 to do something practical The
 Senator charged further that by
 voting against Mr BROWN S
 resolution i and other Sen
 ators upon this side were
 committed against the doctrine for
 which I said the South
 is contending the Senator from
 Mississippi MI Now sir DAVIS
 introduced another resolution which was
 in these words Resolved That
 it experience should at any
 time prove that the judicial
 and executive authority do not
 po 2sess means to insure
 adequate protection to ConstitUt ionai
 rights ill a Territory aud
 i the territorial government should
 fail or refuse to provide
 the necessary remedies for that
 pur pose it will be
 the duty of Congress to
 supply such defi i cieney
 of thet it sbosv lter
 on our part in That
 resolution I voted fqr The
 other Sena ity or any
 disposition to n paver or
 tor from Mississippi Mr BROWN
 introduced as carrvin out whenever
 it is proper in our
 opinion the M 12ieh we
 here avou a substitute for
 that resolution the following I
 asked him the plain question
 as to Now sir thc
 resolutions avow the doctrine that
 it is the diction whether
 he was prepared to give
 us assurance that duty of
 Congress to Protect of an
 kinds wherever That experience liaViijg
 already Shown that the Con
 72 stitution and tho common
 law ynaidéd by statutory enact
 ment do hot afford and
 sufficient protection to slave property
 some of the Territories having
 failed others having refused to
 pass such enactments it has
 be como the duty of
 Congress to interpose and pass
 such laws as will afford
 to slave property in the
 I erritories that pro tection
 w hicb is given to
 other kinds of property Befoi
 e going further I will
 say that there never Was
 a vote upon this last
 proposition asa distinct proposition The
 vote was between the propo
 sition introduced by the two
 Senators from Mis sissippi Was
 a choice between the two
 1 voted against _the last
 proposition because I pre ferred
 théfirst The first contained a
 clear dis tinct decla ration
 of pninciple that at any
 time and it a II
 times it was the duty
 of this Government to protect
 property in the Territories This
 last resdlution specified no place
 no Territory not Kansas but
 in general phraseology that expe
 rience having already shown that
 the Constitu tion and thc
 common law unaided by statutory
 enactments do not afford adequate
 and suffcicnt protection to slave
 property therefore legislative action was
 necessary Now I will say
 just here that in reading
 this resolution there occurs to
 me at this moment one
 insuperable objection to it and
 one which would induce me
 if it were a distinct
 proposition at this thoe to
 vote against it and the
 Senator from Illinois is entitled
 to all that he can
 get from that I did
 not vote against it asa
 distinct proposition but I would
 have done it I lad
 we voted for that resölål
 ion last spring there is
 not a stunnp im the
 United States upon which the
 Senator when can vassing for
 the would not have runry
 the charges that we had
 admitted his principle his great
 principle that slavery was local
 and would bavc read to
 tbc people this resolution that
 all experience having already shown
 that the Constitu lion and
 the e on nnon law
 unaided by statutory enactment do
 not afford adequate and sufficient
 protect ion to slave property
 and he would havc asked
 tbcm if tbc and the
 laws do not afford adequatc
 protection is it not an
 admission u the record that
 it is local and requires
 legislat i ve action to
 establish it and out of
 our own Inoutbs would have
 been dcmncd It appetirs from
 this debate that when it
 camc to be voted upon
 had never heard it and
 had not read it and
 asked it to be road
 again bc fore I vote
 d I voted upon it
 from the impression made on
 my mind nt the monwnt
 it was rend but as
 I said tho vote which
 gave was not Q binst
 this proposition It was simply
 an ex pression of a
 prcfereucc of thc resolution for
 which this was noved as
 a substitute Thc Senator from
 Georgia Mr IVERSON asked me
 yesterday to give way to
 him for a moment and
 I possibly ought to have
 lonc so I did not
 I will do him ample
 justice IVERSON Will Senator give
 way for a moment now
 Mr WIGFALL 1 wili 10
 that which you yourself would
 do Mr IVERSON I want
 to make one additional explanation
 Mr WIGFALL In then Mr
 IVERSON said r barely wish
 to say sir by way
 of putting mysolt rectus in
 curia that i the propb
 sition ot the Senator frozn
 Mississippi Mr BROWN was introduced
 as a separate and distinct
 proposition and not as a
 substitute for the fifth resolution
 I would support it Mr
 CLAY said I simply vi9h
 to say that the remarks
 of the Senator from Georgia
 who has just takcn his
 seat explain fully Iny vote
 There was then some further
 discussion and the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr BROWN of fercd
 to make it a distinct
 proposition Thcre wus some objection
 to that Ho withdrew his
 motion and a vote was
 taken upon it as a
 substi tute for a resolution
 in a series of resolutions
 in troduccd by the other
 Senator from Mississippi M k
 MASON said L shali vote
 against the a ncndmcnt of
 the honorablc Senator frotn although
 concur as understand it eniirclY
 in its provisions so far
 as it intends to a
 right or a dtity or
 a principle I arn of
 opinion svhenever a case arises
 in one of the I
 crritorfes where any slave property
 or any other property there
 is not by tuc law
 of th i i erritory
 that it is the duty
 of Conure s by proper
 le islation whatever it may
 be to provide udoquato protection
 I llis a assumes I
 understand it that there is
 now an existing casé in
 one or Inore of the
 I erritm ies where property
 slave prop erty of course
 is without protection and it
 asserts a duty for Congress
 and a purpose for Congress
 to provide CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 12 it NOW sir 1
 am uninformed about the facts
 I do not know whether
 there is a single slave
 to be found in tl
 iat Perritory but he it
 so or not if ve
 are to legislate on thc
 subject we tnust have the
 fact before us Sve must
 have a bill to enable
 us to carry it into
 effect and if I find
 in that Territory or any
 other that there is a
 case arising fot the intervention
 of Congress 1 hold the
 way perfectly clear and if
 it is not done shall
 say to rny people VVe
 have been deprived of a
 constitutional right but it must
 appear For these reasons f
 shall vote aaainst the amendment
 Other Senators spoke upon the
 suhject and all gave precisely
 the samo reasons I will
 state that the Senator from
 Kentucky Mr POWELL gave the
 same reasons Other Senators on
 this side gave the same
 reasons Then with what fairness
 is it charged when we
 voted for propositions which distinctly
 declared that it was the
 duty of this Federal Government
 to afford protection to slave
 property wherever it was within
 its juris diction and when
 amendments were brought in l
 do no t say that
 it is my belief now
 but I will say that
 at the time the impression
 was upon my mind that
 these amendrncnts were offered at
 least to embarrass us and
 avoid a direct vote upon
 the subject and a diestinct
 declaration of princlple when under
 these circumstances we choose not
 to commit ourselves to questions
 of fact as to whether
 there was necessity at that
 time for legis lating not
 as to Kansas for the
 resolutions of the Senator from
 Mississippi Mr BROWN did not
 namo Kansas when we crave
 as a reason that we
 did not know it to
 be a fact or not
 to be a fact and
 refused simply to vote upon
 a naked question of fact
 with what fairness I ask
 can we be charged with
 having been to use the
 ex pression of the Senator
 from Illinois Mr DOUG recreant
 in our duties to the
 constituen cies w horn we
 represented Mr GREEN Will the
 Senator allow me to make
 one remark Mr WIGFALL Certainly
 Mr GREEN It is simply
 this hc is pre ciscly
 correct on all the points
 has stated but there are
 other facts of which he
 is not informed Up to
 the present hour havc not
 legal inform atton of tbc
 action of Kansas on that
 question Mr WIGFALL 1 thank
 the Senator NIr GREEN in
 Ncbraska there is no neces
 sit y in J lull
 there is no necessity in
 New Mex ico thcre is
 no necessity in Kansas there
 is a rc I sent
 to tho State Departtnent yesterday
 and the inforrnation is not
 yet legally received w l
 ether there is a leæai
 necessity 0k not Mr At
 the the sen ator from
 Kentucky Mr POWELL I will
 read his remarks upon that
 subject Mr POWELL Before this
 vote is taken desire to
 say that t he reasons
 assigned by the Senator frotu
 Mis sissippi Mr DAVIS t
 hc Senator from Louisiana Mr
 BENJAMIN and tbc Senator from
 I exas Mr WIGFALL I
 shali vote against the amendment
 of the Senator fronj Mississippi
 Mr DROWN to the resolution
 of the Senator frotn North
 Carolina Mr CLINGMAN J as
 an anwnd Inent to the
 resolutions under consideration and against
 that resolution itself I he
 resolutions of the Senator from
 Mr I A vrs assert
 great political principles I he
 tunendinent proposed by the Senator
 from North C ar olina
 asserts a fact about which
 he and the Senator fron
 hlississippi Mr differ I will
 state furthermore that whenevcr ft
 shall be inade known by
 experience or othcrwise that further
 legislation is necessary to protect
 either persons or property in
 the l erritorics ot the
 Union I am readv to
 vote Or it So much
 then sir for this bill
 of indictment which was found
 against me yesterday and upon
 which I was put upon
 in y trial I deemed
 it neces sary to say
 thus much because the charge
 wag confidently made by the
 Senator and because it was
 positlvcly denied by me When
 he comes to glorious Union
 reply if he shall deem
 it necessary to make any
 I I trust that he
 will do justice I trust
 that he mav bc able
 to do justice to himself
 N Iy objection to tbc
 course wc arc now pur
 i suino is simply that
 these discussions au jount o
 nothing We cannot save thc
 Ullion The Sena manner in
 which you are treated when
 voti talk If amendments to
 the Constitution securing to us
 everything that we could ask
 were ratified by athe fifteen
 slÅveboldiDff States and ten non
 s ave holdino States they
 would be in the Constitution
 and a part ot the
 compact but if eight non
 s ave holdino States were
 to vote aryainst those ratifica
 tions as they could and
 yet the ratifications bc made
 a part of the Constitution
 we sec at once that
 herc would be amendments to
 the Constitu tion dis tasteful
 to eight of the States
 and which they probably would
 disregard as they have disregarded
 the present Constitu tion Suppose
 that amendments were proposed by
 us and the fifteen slaveholding
 States were to ratify them
 suppose that ten non slaveholdine
 States were to ratify them
 suppose that New York and
 Pennsylvania and Ohio and Illinois
 and Indiana and Iowa and
 other border States were to
 refuse the ratification of what
 practical use would they be
 to us None What is
 the use of our discussing
 on this side of the
 Chamber what we would be
 satisficd With when nothing has
 been offered us and when
 we do not believe that
 we will be permitted to
 retain even that which we
 now have If the two
 Sen ators from New York
 the Senator from Ohio Mr
 WADE the two Senators from
 Illinois the Senator from New
 Hampshire Mr HALE the Senators
 from Maine and others who
 are re garded as representative
 men who have dcnied that
 by the Constitution of the
 United States slaves are recognized
 as property who have urged
 and advocated those acts which
 we regard as on the
 part of the people if
 they will rise here and
 say in their places that
 they desire to propose amendments
 to tl C Constitution and
 beg that wc will vote
 for them that they will
 in good faith go to
 their respective constituencies and urge
 the ratification that thcy believe
 if these Gulf States will
 suspend their action that those
 amendments will be ratified and
 carried out in good faith
 that they will cease preacbil
 g this irrepressible conflict and
 if in those amend inents
 it is declared that slaves
 arc property that I they
 shall be delivered up upon
 demand and if they will
 assure us that Abolition societies
 shall be abolished that Abolition
 presses shall be sup pressed
 that Abolition soccches shall no
 longer be made that we
 shall have peace and quiet
 that we shall not bo
 called cut throats and pirates
 and rnurderers that our wotY2en
 shall not be slan things
 sa d in good faith
 the S nators begging that
 vc will stay our hahd
 until an bonest cfFort can
 be Inade I believc that
 there is prospect of giving
 them a fair consideration Laughter
 on the Republican side Senators
 laugh in my face I
 beg that my fricnd from
 Kentucky Mr POWELL and othcr
 Union savers upon this floor
 will look and see the
 derision the contempt that is
 expressed in every Senator s
 face on the other side
 when I make these propositions
 I trust that they will
 understand Fas est ab hoste
 doce ri learn oven from
 your enemies some wisdom Waste
 not your time in idle
 prattle Get not into disputes
 Senators from thc South with
 each other as to what
 you will be satisfied with
 and what you will take
 I tell you as have
 told the people whom I
 represent long and long ago
 you will not be permitted
 te keep that which you
 have You are regarded as
 poltroons and they talk of
 force of coercion of holding
 this glorious blood bourrht Union
 as they regard it together
 with hemp And yet you
 petition and bog and ask
 that this may be contil
 lucd in order that you
 may be taxed and that
 the hard earn ings of
 those men whom you represent
 shall be taken from their
 pockets in order to build
 up northern wealth and property
 to clear out their harbors
 and construct their roads This
 is tho tors on thc
 other side and thc Senator
 from Illi nois can possibly
 I do not know that
 they can If they cannot
 it cannot be saved We
 cannot r I hc people
 of the South I speak
 of the people of the
 difl örent slaveholding States and
 especially those upon the Gulf
 commonly called are dissatisfied with
 the present the cotton States
 Government as it is about
 to be administered by the
 President elect There is nothing
 that can satisfy thetn except
 amendmcnls to the Constitu tion
 and those amendments must be
 made by the i northern
 States unanimously or they will
 not be satisfied and I
 say here that they should
 not be aboutcompromise Ikncw tvhat
 tbc result would be I
 say to the Senators on
 the othcr side that you
 will have to abolish your
 Abolition societies if you expect
 to live long in our
 corn pan y Now Mr
 President there is no principle
 of international law better settled
 that that cvery State is
 responsible for the conduct of
 its citizens I recollect when
 James Monroe was Presidevttof these
 United States and John Quincy
 Adanus a citizen of the
 State of Massachusetts was Sec
 rotary of State and John
 Forsyth o f Georgia was
 minister to Spain and Andrew
 Jackson was commander in chief
 of our forces upon the
 Flor 1860 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 79 ida fpontiers that he
 crossed that border he took
 thc fort on the Suwanee
 he took Pensacola and he
 established a governrnent Spain com
 p ained and demanded bhat
 the territory should be returned
 and apologics be madc Mr
 John Quincy Adams as Secretary
 of State wrote to John
 Forsyth to say to his
 most Catholic Majesty that this
 Government did not compound cither
 with perfidy or impotence that
 the Spanish Government had not
 kept a suffcient forcc in
 that territory to rcstrain then
 Indians and that Gen cral
 Jackson had taken it because
 it seemed to be a
 waif that if his most
 Catholic Majesty would send a
 sufficient force there to restrain
 those liv ingA1pon the border
 then this Government would return
 it but it had no
 apology to make for doing
 that which it had a
 right to do and that
 unless a sufficient fbrce was
 sent to Florida to keep
 thepeace upon the border and
 to prevent our citizens from
 being annoyed they should hold
 it I le told John
 Forsyth to explain to the
 Government of Spain that they
 cither had the power to
 restrain their Indians or they
 had not that one horn
 of the dilemma they had
 to take that if they
 had the power and would
 not use it we would
 not and could not compound
 with perfidy if they had
 not the povv cr that
 we could not and would
 not compound with impotence Thus
 I say to the different
 States as t he repre
 sentative of my State that
 within your borders there are
 presses and therc are public
 speakers and unless the newspapers
 have given a false account
 of the fact your President
 electa few months or possibly
 weeks before his nomina tion
 was a hired Abolition lecturer
 delivering at 100 a lecture
 lectures throughout the country exciting
 the people against us we
 say to those States that
 you shall not that is
 the word I choose to
 use and I reflect tho
 feeling and de termination of
 the people I represent when
 I use it you shall
 not permit men to go
 there and ex cite your
 citizens to make John Brown
 raids or bring fire and
 strychnine within tho limits of
 the State to which I
 owe my allegiance You shall
 not publish newspapers and pamphlets
 to excite our slaves to
 insurrection You shall not publish
 ncwspapcrs and pamphlets to excite
 the non slaveholdcrs ao ainst
 the slaveholders or the slavc
 holdcrs ao ainst thc non
 slaveholdcrs W c will hive
 pcacc and if you do
 not offer it to us
 we will quietly and as
 we have the right under
 the constitutional compact to do
 withdraw from the Union aid
 cstablish a government for ourselves
 and if you then persist
 in your arcrressions we will
 leave it to the ultima
 ratio retyum and the sovereign
 States will settle that question
 VVhere the battle s wreck
 lies thickest And death s
 brief pang is quickest And
 when you laugh at these
 impotent threats as you regard
 thern I tell you that
 cotton is king Loud applau
 se in the galleries The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Mr in the
 chair Order Order must be
 preserved in the Senate Chamber
 or directions will be given
 to the Sergeant at Arms
 to clear it at once
 MI HALE Mr President The
 PRESIDING OFFICER Order Mr HALE
 I rise to a question
 of order That threat has
 been made once twice thrice
 thissession was made yesterday and
 it has never bcen enforced
 and if it is ever
 to be enforced now is
 the time Mr Mr President
 we have the privilege of
 discussing matters here of great
 pub lic importance and I
 propose if there is another
 exhibition of feeling in the
 galleries either of as sent
 or dissent that those galleries
 be cleared and onco being
 cleare l the doors bc
 locked and that we be
 permitted to discuss matters here
 with I trust that the
 Senate will act out interruption
 upon this and that tho
 galleries will be informed of
 it These constant interruptions are
 a monstrous outrage upon the
 dignity of this body and
 I will add decency that
 cotton was king and I
 I was sayin sir sav
 that that monarch The PRESIDING
 OFFICER The Chair peals to
 all Senators and all persons
 within the Chamber to intermit
 entirely durincr Mr GWIN IC
 the Senator will givc way
 I will Inovc that the
 Senate procccd to the consid
 cration of executive business Several
 NATORS Why Mr G WIN
 That will clear the gallery
 Mr DAVIS Mr President 1
 think there is rather too
 much fee ing exhibited about
 a harm less thouch improper
 demonstration Mr WIGFALL 1 trust
 the Senator from California will
 not interrupt me with executive
 business The PRESIDING OFFICER Docs
 ator from l exas yield
 to the Senator from Mis
 sissippi Mr DAVIS I was
 merely going to ay that
 I hope the Senator will
 be permitted to proceed I
 think wc are attaching rather
 too much import ance to
 the momentary expression of feeling
 in the galleries i take
 it for granted that those
 who were warned yesterday did
 not repeat the offense to
 day It is a new
 set W c shall get
 them all instructed after a
 while that their privilege as
 auditors can only bc enjoyed
 on the condition of decorous
 silence The PRESIDING OFFICER The
 Senator from Texas will proceed
 Mr WIGFALL Then sir for
 the third or fourth time
 and I trust that may
 be permitted to go on
 I say that cotton is
 king and that hc waves
 his sccptcr not only over
 these thirty three States but
 over the Island of Great
 Britain and over continental Europe
 and that there is no
 crowned head upon that island
 or upon the con tinent
 that does not bend the
 knce In fi2alty and acknowledge
 allegiance to that monarch There
 are five million people in
 Great Britain who live upon
 cotton You may makea shortcrop
 of grain and it will
 never affect them but you
 rnay c ram their granaries
 to bursting you may cram
 them until ihe corn actually
 is lifting the shingles from
 the roofs of their barns
 and exhaust the supply of
 qotton for one week and
 alt England is starv Incr
 and we know what men
 do when suffering trom famine
 They do not burstopcn bams
 and In their frenzy they
 burn and divide the corn
 destroy shall never again make
 less than fivc million bales
 I know that Senators on
 the this glorious other Hide
 suppose that whcn Union is
 disrupted it will be in
 blood and that our neo
 roes will rise in insurrection
 We undcr stand it well
 enough to make the experiment
 and I say to Senators
 upon that side that next
 yoat they will sec the
 negroes working as quietly and
 as contentedly as their masters
 q vere not Icav ing
 that country for a foreign
 land as they did a
 few vearsacro when they were
 called upon to visit tho
 Republic of Mexico W c
 understand that I question Five
 million bales of cotton each
 bale worth fifty dollars at
 least fifty four dollars was
 the average pricc of cotton
 last year give us an
 export of 250 000 000
 per annurn counting not rice
 or tobacco or any other
 article of produce Two hundred
 and fifty million exports will
 bring into our own borders
 not through Boston and New
 York and Philadelphia but tlirough
 our own imports and forty
 per cent upon that puts
 into our Treasury 100 000
 000 Twenty per cent givcs
 us 50 000 000 What
 tariff we shall adopt as
 a war tariff I expect
 to discuss in a few
 months and in another Chamber
 You suppose that numbers the
 strength of govcu nments in
 this day I tell you
 that it is not blood
 it is the military chest
 it is the almighty dollar
 When you have lost your
 market when your operatives are
 turned out when your capitalists
 are broken will you go
 to direct taxation When you
 cease to have cx ports
 wili you have imports Burn
 down a fac tory that
 yields ten fifteen twenty twenty
 five thousand dollars a year
 to its owner and he
 goes to the wall Dismiss
 the operatives stop the motion
 of his machincry and he
 is as thoroughly broken as
 if his factory were burnt
 for the time he is
 bankrupt r Ehese are matters
 for your con sideration 1
 know that you do not
 regard us as I would
 save this Union if I
 could i desire the Union
 to be saved have ÆElw4ys
 been a Union man I
 now a Union man not
 from any silly notion that
 it is of divine origin
 not from any absurd idca
 that blood was ever shed
 for it not becausé suppose
 it is an heritance from
 our fathers for it is
 neither onc nor the other
 This Union is a compact
 be tween States and may
 With the same propriety be
 regarded as an inheritance as
 you would gard a treaty
 between Great Britain and France
 or either of those countries
 and this isatreaiy between States
 by which they agreed for
 then common defense and general
 welfare Änd to se cure
 domestic peace and tranquillity to
 organize a Government and vest
 in it certain powers They
 made a wise power They
 vested in the Federal Government
 such powers as were necessary
 to obtain those objects v
 hich M ere set forth
 in the preamble to the
 Constitution They reserved to their
 State governments such powers as
 were necessary to protect the
 liberty and well being and
 happiness of the citizen at
 home This is the Union
 and when the distinguished Senator
 from New York said that
 there was an irrepressible conflict
 I simply came to the
 cona clusion and I say
 it with all deference to
 his dis tinguished reputation and
 high position that he did
 not know what he was
 talking about Why sir States
 that are monarchical in their
 form of government States that
 are republican States that are
 democratic States that are aristocratic
 States that are slaveholding States
 that are non slaveholding States
 that are am icultural Statos
 that are commercial States th
 at are manufact ur incr
 can all live under precisely
 such a constitu tion as
 thc old thirteen States ratified
 and made binding betv een
 thern and there is no
 irrepres Sible conflict about it
 The very diversity of in
 terest in these different States
 is the reason for forming
 thc Constitution If wc had
 been a homo gencous people
 if our industrial pursuits and
 in tcrcsts had been identical
 there wou d have been
 no necessity for a Union
 no ncccssity for consoli dating
 thc Union but there would
 havc been a necessity for
 destroying the old Articles of
 the Confederation ol litcrating State
 lines abolishing State governments destroying
 the Union and bc coming
 a single consolidated people Why
 Bc cause under those circumstances
 the interests the prejudices and
 the passions of all sections
 being thessame the ballot box
 would have given ample security
 to domestic peace and tranquillity
 and prosperity Laws passcd by
 the Legislature fresh from the
 people operating equally in all
 sec tions and the interests
 of all sections being the
 sarne would necessarily have bccn
 wise and bene ficial or
 those representatives would have been
 turned out at the next
 election and the laws have
 been repealed But it is
 not so here Your irre
 pressible conflict idea is predicated
 upon the sup pokition that
 this is a consolidated Government
 that there arc no States
 that there is a national
 Government as they call it
 that the people who live
 between the two oceans and
 between the Gülf and the
 lakes are one people that
 the boundaries of Massachusetts have
 by some hocus pocus been
 extending themselves until they embrace
 all the remainder of the
 Union and that we are
 one people have a national
 Government and arc under the
 control of the Massachusetts school
 of poli tics as the
 Senator from New York said
 he wras If you could
 have seen This is the
 fatal error it in time
 much of this diffculty would
 have been in earnest but
 it is my deliberate impression
 that it cannot I i
 have been studying the char
 nox v be done acter
 of the people that you
 represent for ycars I he
 family of Dives was the
 most prolific past family that
 ever breathed or lived upon
 this earth Those five brothers
 would not believe either Moses
 or the prophets and if
 onc rose from the avoided
 SVe sce and we know
 and we fecl that you
 are administering this Government upon
 the idea that there is
 but one single State or
 nation and that you nndor
 these impressions believe that you
 are responsible for the domestic
 institu tions of all the
 other States I was glad
 to hear the other day
 thc eonserv ativc sensible statesmanlike
 tone in which the Senator
 from Connecticut Mr DIXON spoke
 When I heard him his
 voice and his sentiment carried
 mc back to the better
 days of the Repub lic
 when those truly great men
 Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman
 and that other great man
 from New Jersey William Paterson
 and Charles Pinckney and John
 Rutledge of South Carolina coöperatcd
 with cach other to form
 the present dead we arc
 told that they would not
 believe him They were prolific
 and theirdpsco ndants have set
 beautiful well balanced Federal Republic
 out of tEcd in t
 he country in whith you
 live Laugl iter the of
 the old rickety concerl i
 of the Confed cration when
 the cotnmon sense of Ellsworth
 and That is your business
 however not minc Now Sherman
 and Paterson and Rutledge and
 Pinck the question is can
 the Union be saved THE
 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 12 noy
 controlled the gcnius of Hamilton
 and Mad isoti and Randolph
 and to South Carolina and
 to Connecticut do sve owe
 thanks for the present from
 of government which is now
 about to bo do stroycd
 They were the men thatdid
 it They were the men
 who saw that it was
 utterly impossible to live under
 a consoiidated nåtional Government and
 established instead thereof a Federal
 repub lican Government gave to
 the General Govern ment such
 powers as were necessary to
 protect them against foreign aggression
 and reserved to the States
 ali those powers which were
 necessary for legistation for their
 own people I said before
 that I was a Union
 man and I say now
 that I am a Union
 man I say that there
 is not and cannot be
 under this present form of
 government any irrepressible conflict that
 those States which are slaveholdine
 have a right to be
 those that are non slaveliolding
 have a right to be
 so and if it were
 not for the single word
 in the guarantee clause of
 the Constitution which secures to
 each State s a republican
 form of Gov ernmertt there
 would bc no reason under
 heaven why some of States
 might not be aristocratic and
 others monarchical if they saw
 fit They would have free
 trade with cach other When
 one of them was interföred
 with or imposed upon that
 State would at once call
 into tho field the Army
 of thirty three States that
 State would at once cull
 from our ports and put
 afloat the Navy of thirty
 three States that State would
 Ihave the Treasury of thirty
 three States and in negotiat
 ing willi fbre iffn countries
 she would have the wisdom
 and the genius o thirty
 three States to conduct her
 forcicrn relations and her forcio
 n dil 101nacy I his
 is the groat advantage of
 the Union but if you
 sul pose that we arc
 to be amused with clap
 trap of 4th of July
 froth and the idea that
 thcrc is anything of sacredness
 in a compact bc tween
 nations or that nations inherit
 right s 1 silnpiy say
 that lho se whom I
 live passeil that point SD
 devoted a friond of the
 ion a ln l hal
 when as I know it
 must be cause I see
 no to save or to
 prevent it the eight cotton
 States have withdrawn from Ibis
 Union as they will in
 the next two months do
 arid meet in convention tn
 adopt a Federal forin of
 government for themselves and to
 establish a foreign department for
 one shali advocate the adoption
 wit hout crossing a t
 or dottin r an i
 of bought in Kentucky and
 in Missouri and in Ten
 nessee and they may leave
 you in the cold and
 comc to us and when
 they do they will under
 stand the blessincs of this
 Union from havilV lived out
 of it a few months
 and they will be prepared
 to carry out in good
 faith the compact which they
 entered into with us Now
 those who talk about a
 dissolution of the Union as
 being one of those things
 that will show that man
 isincapable of self government or
 about our being split up
 into petty factions and States
 seceding and stars flying from
 their orbits have not considered
 this thing as statesmen This
 Government was once nearly wrecked
 on that idea When the
 agrarian higher law doctrine of
 Massachusetts rebelled against the authorities
 of that Slate in 1786
 and Shay s rebellion broke
 out and the people of
 that State who paid no
 taxes said that they had
 fi ught for seven years
 to keep property from Ijeing
 confiscated and now that peace
 was established they had a
 right to an equal division
 when they took up arms
 and that aqrrarian and higher
 law feeling was snreading throughout
 the New England States Hamilton
 and Madison and Randolph and
 other conserva tive men mistook
 thc feeling that was local
 as you say slavery is
 and supposed that the re
 maindcr of the colonies felt
 as those people did and
 hence they wcre for a
 firm strong Elational Government to
 keep the people free by
 the force of arms That
 was their unphilosophical idea but
 as I sai d before
 Ellsworth Sherman and Pinckney and
 Rutledge and Palcrson controlled them
 and established this beautiful Federal
 form that we have been
 struggling to preserve Then whatever
 may come out of this
 it is clear to my
 ruind that instead o this
 being a demonstration that the
 people arc incapable of sel
 ügovcrnment it will be a
 demonstration that thc people arc
 capable of self govennnent that
 these Slates which came int
 o the Union one after
 ano ther and ratified the
 and liladc it binding between
 th and thc other States
 that ratified it will one
 after t hc other revoke
 the ratification and first vest
 cach in its own Statc
 oovcrnmcnt all tbc po wers
 she no M exercises through
 this Idederal department of hcr
 Goveri mcnt and after a
 sufiicient nun lbce have withdrawn
 they will adopt ao ain
 this Con stituti01 and State
 after State will come in
 and I he would amend
 the Constitution or not He
 wants us to act by
 bill He wishes us to
 indulge here in the child
 s play of introducing bills
 1 1pon this question spending
 weeks and months in discussion
 while these States onc after
 another are walkil g out
 of the Union and establishing
 their relations with each other
 and with foreio n i
 say that so far as
 the State I repre Powers
 sent is concerned this is
 the principle upon which we
 went into the last canvass
 the second reso lution of
 the Democratic platform adopted at
 Charleston and at Baltimore I
 hat it is the duty
 of the Federal Government in
 all its departments to protect
 when necessarv the rights of
 persons and property in the
 Territories and whercver clse its
 constitutional authority extends Now I
 am not goino to discuss
 the right or the wrong
 of this resolution It is
 enough for me to know
 that the people of the
 Slate in which I live
 ratified that principle by a
 vote of forty seven thousand
 in the last canvass to
 fifteen thousand a yainst it
 and if that majority is
 not enough to take the
 State out of the Union
 thcn I should like to
 know what majority is The
 question was canvassed the right
 of the State to secede
 was discussed thc w hole
 matter of resistance was argued
 and the distinct issue was
 there made that the elect
 ion ofa Black Republican President
 would i bc an overt
 act an indication on the
 part of the northern people
 that they ill tended to
 administer this Government not according
 to the Constitu tion but
 according to the fanatical notions
 which arc embodied in t
 hcir platforms of 1856 and
 1860 Upon this doctrine we
 went to tbc polls and
 we werc indorsed by forty
 seven thousand men who are
 capable of bcarino a Fins
 It has been attempted to
 be explained t this is
 very unreasonable Suppose it is
 You have got to deal
 with our fony and I
 say to you that you
 have got to yield to
 our foolish determ Ination of
 having that principle recoonizcd in
 the Constitution of the United
 States ar that Slate certainly
 goes out of this Union
 What sir arc we to

 reason to believe fourteen other

 down Strychnine was brought and
 given to our necrroes for
 the purpose of poisoning their
 masters An association called T
 hc Mystic Red was entered
 into by members of the
 Meth Odist Church North and
 the John Brown rnen and
 their purpose was to carry
 out the irrepressi blc conflict
 to burn our towns burn
 up the stores of our
 merchants burn up the mills
 to bring free soil northern
 capital in and thus get
 possession of Texas and make
 it a free State in
 order as they said to
 belt us round with free
 States to starve us out
 or cause us as has
 been said by one whose

 CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 75 is the
 result of that Helper book
 indorsed by your selves It
 is the result of the
 preachings and the tcachiKÆ of
 the Senator from New York
 It is the resuÜt of
 the preachings and the teachings
 It is the I e
 of other Black Republican leaders
 salt of the preachings and
 teachings of your fol lowers
 or pretended followers of Christ
 In your schools you teach
 your children to hate us
 your pulpits you teach it
 as a religious duty Upon
 the hustings you teach it
 Your eighteen northern non slaveholding
 States nominate two of the
 rnost fanatical of your sect
 as candidates for President and
 Vice President You elect them
 and now you tell us
 that they shall be inaugurated
 Previously to the election and
 to the anticipated inawruration you
 oroanized a Prætorian guard In
 Rome it was not until
 liberty had fallen that Augustus
 their first Emperor Inaugurated that
 military body A few years
 rolled on and the empire
 was put up by the
 Prætorian guard and sold for
 money Who is to be
 the Dedius Ju lianus that
 will purchase this empire I
 cannot Phe Senator from New
 York told his John Brown
 Wide Awake Praetorians that their
 services could not be dispensed
 with after the election that
 they would be needed to
 secure the fruits of victofy
 Onc half million of men
 uni formed and drilled and
 the purpose of their organ
 izalion to sweep the country
 in which I live with
 fire and sword Mr SEYVARD
 With the honorable Sena tor
 s permission I beg leave
 to ask him to state
 the grounds of the declaration
 he has just made Mr
 WIGFALL 1 will state to
 the Senator I do not
 keep scrap books myself but
 I saw it published in
 the New York papers in
 a speech Inade by the
 Senator Everybody saw it It
 has I never saw it
 been copied into many papers
 It was a speech delivered
 by the Sena denied tor
 in his late presidential tour
 to the Mr SEWARD Mr
 President J think this is
 the first timc since I
 have been in the Senate
 of the Ul ited States
 that 1 have ever attempted
 to corrcct a misanprchension as
 to myself not say what
 Inay have been published in
 the I ID remember newspapers
 or attributed to me to
 have read a letter which
 I received from some unknown
 person in the southern States
 quoting or professing to quote
 from some speech of mine
 something like this which the
 Senator alludes to I can
 only say this I cannot
 tclt what may have I
 have no recollection of an
 the speeches said that I
 may have made before the
 election or after I cannot
 tell WI kat therc has
 been which could be perverted
 or misunderstood so as to
 ilnply that I have ever
 said or intimated that the
 Wide Awakes were to be
 kept disciplined and uni formed
 or associated at all to
 secure the fruits of this
 victory I think I may
 say safely that I never
 could have delivered anyt hing
 which could have borne sne
 l i a construction And
 now I hope the Senator
 will excuse me one moment
 more Mr WIGFALL Certainly Mr
 SEVVARD He is always very
 respect ful to Imc and
 I mean to be to
 him hope that in making
 this explanation I shall not
 be deemcd I to have
 brought tnvself under any obligation
 to explain anything more hereafter
 or hcrctofore Mr WIGFALL Mr
 President of the Senator of
 course is all that I
 could ask I saw him
 so reported and have seen
 it frequently Who reported it
 I do not know It
 was pub lished North and
 South This Wide Awakc as
 sociation L was going on
 to say had I noi
 been interrupted has itself produced
 an immense deal of excitement
 and bitter feeling r Whether
 thc Senator from New York
 said what has been as
 cribed to him or not
 would not be a matter
 of any moment further than
 ho is concerned That hc
 did not say it I
 am now of course convinced
 I would not misrepresent hinn
 But that this pre topian
 band is organized that its
 members do undergo military drill
 that it is a military
 organ did this last summer
 and heard their regular mil
 ittu y trtunp does or
 can doubt The States have
 held their convention they have
 nominated their candidates they have
 Olcctcd them Now I ask
 Rla ck Re publican Senators
 if the fifteen slaveholding States
 had held a convei t
 ion callinff it national had
 norn inated a slaveholder for
 Piesident and a slave holder
 for Vice President and had
 adopted a plat form which
 in the non slavcholding States
 was regarded as so hostile
 and antagonist ic to their
 interests that they could not
 have an electoral ticket in
 onc of their States if
 tho slaveholding i States had
 carried on a war of
 denunciation and for a series
 of years and had adopted
 principles so offensive and so
 dangcrous to the non slaveholding
 States that one of their
 nomi nated candidates could not
 with safety have traveled through
 one of the non slaveholding
 States if this had been
 the case and mrve had
 elected such a man would
 you have said that there
 was any obligation upon you
 to regard the com pact
 as kept and look to
 the hollow forms of clec
 tions Would you not have
 said We have lost our
 autonomy our right of self
 government a foreign government has
 been established over us these
 slaveholders having a numerical major
 ity have nominated two of
 their own order for President
 and Vice President they will
 havc their Cabinet composed of
 such men the foreign diplomacy
 will bc managed by such
 men Would not that be
 your exclamalion and would it
 not be founded reason Then
 I say the non slavcholding
 States have nominated and elected
 their candidate Tell mc not
 that we have got thc
 legislative department of this Government
 for I say we have
 not As to this body
 where do we stand Why
 sit there are now eighteen
 non slaveholding States few weeks
 we shall havc the nineteenth
 for Kan sas will be
 brought in Then the arithmetic
 which settles our position is
 simple and easy Thirty eight
 northern Senators you will have
 upon this floor We shall
 have thirty to your thirty
 eight After the 4th of
 March the Senator from Cali
 fornia Mr LATHAM the Senator
 from Indiana Mr BRIGHT the
 Senator from New Jersey Mr
 THOMSON ancl the Senator from
 Minnesota N Ir RICE will
 be here That reduces the
 north ern phalanx to thirty
 four Mr BINGHAM DOUGLAS Mr
 WIGFALL What Mr BINGHAIV I
 DouGLA5 Mr W G FALL
 Non tali nec defensori bus
 isti tempus eget Laughter There
 are four of the northern
 Senators upon whom we can
 rely whorn wo know to
 bc friends wl nom we
 havc trastcd in our days
 of trial heretofore and in
 whom as Constitution lovin r
 we will trust we stand
 thirty four to th irty
 four and your Black Republican
 Vice President to give the
 castinc vote Mr Lincoln can
 pnake his own nomina tions
 with perfect security that thcy
 will be con firmed by
 this body even if c
 very slaveholding State should remaili
 in tho Union whicli thank
 God they will not do
 You have elected your President
 and you can inaugurate him
 and will have neither lot
 nor parcel in this matter
 I am thus recapitulating the
 necessity for our action to
 snow that we are not
 acting upon im pulse Senators
 some of thern have spokcn
 of I tell you lhc
 ex the excitement of the
 South citement has passed off
 the fever has subsided and
 the patient has collapscd So
 far as thic Union is
 concerned the cold sweat of
 death is upon it Your
 Union is now dead your
 Gov crrnnellt is now dead
 It is to day but
 in state surrounded it is
 true by pomp and cere
 mony They ate Senators but
 the mournful ceremomes poinps and
 pageants which are scen around
 the n ighty dead The
 spirit has de parted and
 it has gonc back to
 those who g tve It
 the sovereign States of this
 Union Thcrc is now in
 the Gulf States no excitement
 l hcre is a fixed
 determined will that they will
 be free and men vho
 corno here and talk about
 wishing to preserve this Union
 by way of avoiding Vihat
 they call precipitate action toil
 us that wc are to
 be hung if we dare
 be frcc The ScnatQ1 from
 Illinois has declared t do
 not know whether hc said
 it the Senator from New
 Y frk has been misrepresented
 and he may have been
 but it was publishcd in
 his celebrated Norfolk speech the
 President of the that he
 was going to hang Opposition
 party if that President should
 beat h inl and not
 administer thc Governrnent accord incr
 to his notions Well this
 was hardly a fair way
 I think of conducting a
 canvass to hang Lincoln if
 he should be cleéted provided
 he did not administer the
 Government according to tbc Senator
 s idea of propriety It
 was rathe r rough work
 He was then going to
 hang all thc Vir crinians
 who attcmp tcd to act
 upoh his crreat principle of
 the right of self government
 That is the great principle
 I believe of the Nebraska
 act that every peoplty have
 a right to govern themselves
 as they see fib saving
 and excepting the people of
 these sovereign States They alone
 it seems have nt t
 that right Organic law I
 have always supposed was made
 bv sovereignty was t he
 supreme law of the land
 It goes out in the
 form of a constitution or
 an edict _ An organic
 law seems now to only
 such laws as we pass
 here for petty cor porations
 wto be repealed whenever We
 see fit This is the
 Senator s idea of organic
 law Why Mr President I
 am surprised I Would say
 shocked but I do not
 suppose anything could shock a
 man who has lived in
 this city for six months
 nothing certainly of misapprehension as
 to the simplest question of
 the form of gov ernment
 under which we are living
 You talk about hanging States
 about States committing treason about
 enforcing the laws and doing
 all sorts of things Sir
 I hold in my hand
 the first volumc of the
 statutes of South Carolina to
 which I shall refer as
 she is to bc the
 immediate subiect for the operation
 to be performed Oh tin
 d I Gnd that the
 constitution of South Carolina was
 adopted on the 26th of
 March 1776 That was before
 the Declaration of Independence On
 the 261h day of March
 1776 the inhabitants of South
 Carolina became a people they
 then became vested with sovereignty
 they then asserted their ricrht
 to self government They have
 been very troublesome people The
 first quarrel that they o
 ot into was on the
 subject of the tariff and
 it hap pened to bc
 with his sacred Majesty George
 Ill King of Great Britain
 Ireland and France and Defender
 of the Faith and they
 say as the first grievance
 Whereas the British Parliament claiming
 of late years a right
 to bind tho North American
 colonies by law in all
 cases whatsoever have Onacted statutes
 for raising a rev enue
 in those colonies and disposing
 of such revenue as they
 thought proper without the consent
 and against the will of
 flic colonists and whereas it
 appearing to thc_ln that they
 not being represented in Parli
 nncnt such claim was altogether
 tmconstitutional and ij admiLtcd Would
 at once reduce then frorn
 the rank of frccmen to
 a state of the nost
 abject slavery Here was a
 gcncral bill of indictment against
 thc British Government for interfering
 wit h the rights of
 fill the colonics Now it
 is claimed that the people
 of South Carolina have no
 right to con plain of
 any acro res s iorns
 except those that are committed
 upon themselves avid their dissat
 isfaction with your property stealing
 upon the bordcr of thesc
 border States is regarded as
 an impertinent interference Let us
 sec what is the next
 cause for South Carolina resuming
 her posi t ion as
 one of the nations of
 the earth She says l
 he harbor of r ogton
 was blocked up people ina
 icte d for Inurder in
 the Massachusetts Bay may at
 the will of a Governor
 bc sent for trial to
 any other cokony or even
 to the chartered constitutiou of
 government Great Britain in that
 eolony is inateriaUy altered Ooc
 of tho reaso ns which
 South Carolina gave for asstuning
 her position as one of
 the nations o the card
 and organizing a Government for
 herself was that the Boston
 port bill had been passed
 and that the people of
 Boston were im posed upon
 That was right enough They
 go I he English laws
 and a free government to
 which the inhabitants of Quebec
 were entitled by the King
 s royal proclarnation arc abolished
 and French laws are restorcd
 the Rotnan Catholic religion although
 before tolerated and freely exercised
 there and an absolute government
 are es tablished in that
 provincc and its Iitnits c
 xtendcd through a vast tract
 of country so as to
 border on the free Protest
 ant English settlelnent s with
 design of usincr a whole
 peo pie differing in religious
 principles froin the neighboring colonies
 and subject to arbitrary power
 as fit instruunents That wras
 their third cause of grievance
 An other was i Largo
 fleets of arniies have been
 sent to Alncrica in order
 to enfbre c tbc execution
 of these laws Another was
 that The Governors end others
 bearing tlto royal commis Sion
 in the colonies have excited
 dojnestic insurrections proclaimed freedom to
 our servants and slaves enticed
 or In view of the
 prernises they declare indispeusably necessary
 that some I hat it

 fau back as 1775 for
 this Con gress on Wednesday
 the 1st day of November
 17755 declared their independence and

 that there was no hope

 here is a pro vision
 that those who will not
 subscribe to that oath shall
 at the expense of the
 State be sent from it
 and that upon their returnin

 so long as I may
 continue a citizen thereof Now
 Senators you arc deal incr
 with a sovereien State You
 talk about hang ing men
 who obey their oaths I
 tell you that in 1775
 twelve months l eforc thc
 Declaration Independence was made that
 people feeling not the of
 the British Government upon thenf
 fur they Were a favored
 colony but in the language
 of the itumortal Henry snuffing
 the tainted l reeze a
 fit r sawy that the
 colonial rights of the peoplc
 of Massachusetts had bccn trampled
 under foot and thcy saw
 that fleets and arnucs were
 sent to the couritry they
 sawp that taxes had been
 levied without representation and disbursed
 without their consent and they
 determ incd to bccomc a
 frcc people In 17 6
 t h ree months before
 the battle of Fort Moultrie
 they adopted a State constitution
 they organized an army they
 elected a president ghey had
 all the paraphernalia of governrnent
 T hc battle of Fort
 Moultrie on the 28Lh duy
 of June was fought under
 State colors and by ofliccrs
 who hold their commissions sigi
 cd John Rutledge President of
 thc Republic of South Carolina
 That battle was fought before
 the Declaration of Independence In
 1781 they confederated with these
 other States and in thc
 Articles of Confed eu ation
 they declared in the second
 article that they rettuned their
 sovereio nty freedom and independence
 Fro rn that time to
 this they havc that State
 and obedience to the Constitution
 of the United States but
 the oath is allegiance and
 fealty to the State of
 South Carolina Now you tell
 those men that if they
 obey their ozuh if they
 violate not their allegiance if
 they become not traitors to
 the country that has nourished
 and ntu sed them then
 they are to be shot
 down like I dogs or
 hanged like felons This is
 the manner in which their
 remonstrances are met This is
 the language of Senators who
 talk about our glorious Union
 and our being a race
 of free men This is
 the language used to free
 Ameri cans This is in
 a land of liberty This
 is among a people who
 boast that they have the
 right of self government Well
 you will have an opportunity
 of making the cxperiment Bilt
 a word more Those people
 do not believe that they
 are citizens of the Unit
 ed States not believe that
 they are citizens of the
 United States I do not
 believe that I owe allegiance
 to the United States believe
 that I owe allegiance to
 my State and to that
 State that allegiance shall be
 rccocrnized and tlic obligation fulfilled
 to the lett er of
 the law We have seen
 that Sou th Carolina became
 a State and from that
 time o this she has
 remained a State shc has
 exercised all the powers of
 na ti0F1ality but there is
 one fact that I have
 not yet mentioned In 1778
 thc great Power of France
 c ntcred into a treaty
 with South Carolina by name
 and with Virginia and rcco
 rnized their nationality That was
 it 1778 In 1783 Great
 Britain acknowledged tho nationality of
 South Carolina in the treaty
 of peacc between that Powcr
 and these revolted colonics then
 free sovereign and indcpcndcnt States
 1781 as I have already

 prepared The resolution was read
 as follows Resolved That the
 select cornmittce to which has
 been referred so much of
 the President s message as
 relatcs to the perilous condition
 of the country be instructed
 10 inquire whether it bé
 competent for Congress to provide

 or nnunicipal districts in which
 such fugitive slaves should be
 so rescued and if it
 bc fOund that Congress possesses

 Inuni cipal corporation therein liable

 has been r cucd froni
 rightful custody by force or
 otherwise and ai 0 whether
 it is expedient to establish

 further le yislation is requisite
 to secure a protnpt certain
 and full enforcement of the

 or ivhcther an mncndmcnt of
 the Const itution is necessary
 for that purpose By Mr
 NOELL Whereas there now exists
 on the part of the
 people of the southern States
 of this Union a weil
 founded appre hension that they
 no longer hold the power
 in the Federal Governrnent necessary
 to secure their peaco and
 the safety of their property
 against the aguressions of the
 Federal Gov erntnent should it
 becomc the will of the
 people of the northern States
 to assail thern through the
 Federal AdlQin istration or by
 hostile legislation and whereas security
 and peace held by one
 section at the inere Vill
 of an other cannot be
 safely relied on and whereas
 thc great Inaterial int erest
 of tho couvnry in every

 will give to every section
 tfrle means of protection atrainst

 and necessity of abolishing by

 of establishing in lieu thcreof
 an executive council to con

 be deemed practicable by said
 conunittcc that they report to
 this House such details thereof
 as may be necessary to
 accommodate the satne to the

 slave States in the Senate
 of the United States and
 particularly whether this end can
 be acconmlished by a voluntary
 division on the part of
 some of the slave States

 where it now exists or
 Inay hereafter exist and an

 and unamendable By Mr LARRABEE
 Whereas conflicting constructions of various
 clauses in thc Federal Constitution
 havc frotn time to time
 prevailed some of the States
 claiming and others denying certain
 each and that is totally
 inadequate to compen sate these
 officers at the consolidated land
 ofiices I his bill authorizes
 them to employ clerks and
 i provides that thc clerk

 the I persons making application
 for service so that the
 Governmen t docs not pay
 any of it It provides
 further that the compensation of
 register and rc II ceiver
 at the consolidated of äces
 shall not exceed i under
 this bill 3 000 annun
 t each fees exceed that
 amount the surplus is to
 be paid do not suppose
 however into the rl reasury
 the additional låbot imposed on
 these offcerS We had in
 Indiana ten land Offces A
 lt of them except one
 have been discontinued and the
 records of those nine offees
 have beeh deposited in the
 one consolidated offce at the
 seat of gov eynment This
 renders am immense arnqü bi
 of labor necessary in recording
 and making scripts of documents
 and it iS impÖssible the
 work done at the compensation
 now allowed am as much
 opposed as any gentleman here
 to creating new offices or
 raising salaries but think that
 the laborer is worthy of
 his hire I think that
 in all cases where justice
 and reöi ty and good
 conscience require auditional compen sa

 public officers of the coun
 try this House ought to
 and will allmrv it I
 Mr CLARK of Missouri the
 that they will exceed that
 sum That provision powers of

 it is our duty in

 But får the put edies

 SPEAKER The order under the
 reso lution of the gentleman
 from North Carolina Mr BRANCH
 havintr now becn executed the
 next business in order will
 be to call the commit
 tees for reports and the
 first thing in order in
 that class of business is
 a bill pending at the
 last session reported from the
 Committee on Public Lands EXCUSED
 FROM COMMITTEE SERVICE Mr BONHAM
 Mr Speaker if it be
 to sny that I have
 received notice this morning from
 the chairman of the Committee
 on Military Affairs to meet
 that committee on Friday next
 As I do not expect
 to remain long a member
 of Congress I feel it
 due that I shouid resign
 the placé I hold on
 that committee that the gentle
 man who may be appointed
 to succeed me may enter
 upon the duties of the
 committee at once In doing
 so sir I ask leave
 only to say that I
 do not adopt this course
 through any dissatisfac tion with
 rny colleagues upon that committee
 and that I shall ever
 cherish however wide apart Secretary
 of thc Interior to allow
 them a reason able compensation
 for their services to be
 paid out of the contingent
 fund of these oflices It
 is unnecessary for me to
 take up the time of
 the I lousc in further
 explanation ot the objects of
 this bill I desire to
 ask the Mr CLARK of
 Missouri gentleman a question which
 I desire to have an
 swered for tho information of
 the House The question is
 whether there is any provision
 in this bill providing for
 compensation of registers and receivers
 now in office for their
 past services since the offices
 were consolidated Mr DAVIS of
 Indiana I think not The
 only provision on that subject
 is that which makes it
 tfic duty of the Secretary
 of the Interior to allow
 reasonable compensation to reo isters
 and recei vers If the
 gen who have already gone
 out of oflice t lctnan
 from Missouri desires to propose
 an amend ment o that
 kind I have no obiection
 tl at it I Inarle
 for I think n r
 scl t that it is
 right should and proper that
 such compensation should be If
 the gentlcmal l wish to
 propose such allo wed an
 amendment I will yield for
 that pur Dose Tliat view
 of the question did not
 occur to t xe commit
 lthe tee when they agreed
 to report the bill original
 bill was draughted by the
 Commissioner of he General Land
 Office and was acted on
 by the committee by addiY
 g the provision in the
 last section Mr WASHBURNF of
 Illinois 1 should like to
 have the bill again read
 The bill vas again read
 It would Mr WASHBURNE of
 Illinois we may be a
 lively recollection of the urbanity
 and courtesy which have unifotnnly
 characterizcd seem to me from
 the reading of this bill
 that it their deportrnent in
 the discharge of the arduous
 Proposes iot only the creation
 of a new offcc but
 the raising of the salaries
 of other offcers I duties
 which we have 2md to
 pcu form I ask to
 be am opposed to the
 whole of it from the
 begin excused from further service
 on the committee Fling to
 the end I think that
 a salary of 560 to
 The question was taken and
 Mr BONHAM was the receivers
 and registers at these consolidated
 excused land offices is quite
 enough fov the work they
 EIüG11ES to fill thc vacancy
 occasioned in the Com perform
 and that no cleik hirc
 is necessary There are plenty
 of men svho would be
 willing to mittce on Military
 Affairs dischargc all these duties
 for that salary and the
 great trouble will be in
 discriminating between CONSOLIDATED LAND OFFICES
 I think this The House
 then proceeded to the consideration
 applicants desiring these offces whole
 legislation entirely unnecessary I think
 of a bill reported from
 the Committee on Public Lands
 making further provision in relation
 to that alk the duties
 of these offices can be
 perförmed by mcn who will
 be glad to get tho
 offices at the consolidated land
 offices present salary We have
 omcers enough and The bill
 was read the salaries are
 high enough Hence I am
 op The question being on
 the engrossment and posed to
 the bill third read ing
 of the bill l desire
 to say a Mr DAVIS
 of Indiana Mr I AVIS
 of Indiana I desire to
 make a brief statement in
 explanation of the objects word
 in reply to the gentleman
 from Illinois In the first
 place ho is Inistaken about
 this bill cre this bill
 and I presutne that when
 I have made it there
 will be no objection to
 the passage of the ating
 new omc es It has
 been recommended by the Secretary
 Mr WASHBURN E of Illinois
 It permits offthe Interior and
 by the Conmnis sioncr of
 the Mr DAVIS of Indiana
 It only authorizes General Land
 Office The object of the
 bill is the register and
 recorder to employ additional this
 in all the land offc

 been reduced by sale clerks

 payment of fees by persons

 thi_nks that this is unne
 man from Indiana allow me
 to sav a word Mr
 DAVIS of Indiana Certainty Mr
 CLARK of Before the bill
 was reported to the House
 it was submitted to the
 Secretary of the Interior ond
 to the Commis sioner of
 the General Land Offce They
 cXa m ined it and
 wrote to the Committee on
 Pliblic Lands that the provisions
 of the bill not only
 met with their approbation but
 that they considered it absolutely
 necessary for the proper discharge
 of tho public business In
 the State of Missouri there
 are six land omces consolidated
 into one The area covered
 by this consolidated land office
 includes nearly half the entire
 State and it is im
 possible for any onc man
 to conduct all the busi
 ness ot that office as
 consolidated There are books records
 and documents in his possession
 relating to the titles to
 nearly half the lands in
 the State and there are
 daily and hourly ap plications
 involving an amount of labor
 and re know search which
 no onc man can perform
 from personal observation the amount
 of busi ness to be
 transacted at this ofiice is
 very large From the frequent
 applications for additional as sistance
 at this and other consolidated
 land offces thc Commissioner of
 thc General Land Offce sent
 out one of his clerks
 to make examination into lhc
 facts who from his personal
 observation adds his testimony to
 tl at already received of
 the necessity therc is for
 further provision to be made
 But this bill does not
 in my judgment go as
 far as justice to these
 offcers requires and if that
 course meets the approbation of
 tlle gentleman fronn Indiana I
 will move that it be
 recommitted to the Committee on
 Public Lands to give thun
 an opportunity of perfecting its
 provisions I think that these
 officers of the consolidated land
 I oflicos who have within
 the last year been com
 pelled to employ assistance in
 the discharge of their duties
 ought to be reimbursed for
 the ex penses they have
 actually incurred I understand i
 the gentleman from Illinois Mr
 MCCLERNAND has prepared an amendment
 which covers the additional provision
 which I have suggested If
 such be the fact I
 hope he will be Fermitted
 to offer it I say
 in response to the other
 gentleman from Illinois Mr WASHBURNE
 that yon cannot ob tain
 the services of competent men
 to discharge the duties now
 devolved upon the registers and
 receivers of these consolidated land
 ofhccs for the salary now
 allowed by law I have
 in my possession a letter
 from the register of the
 con solidated land omce at
 Boonville Missouri in which he
 states that it is impossible
 for thé reois ter and
 receiver of that land office
 to discharge the dutics of
 the offcc and that unless
 additional assistance be furnished them
 they cannot con tinue to
 hold their offces and you
 cannot obtain competent men to
 fill the omces under the
 present provisions of law Mr
 McCLERNAND Having made some investigation
 into the facts involved in
 the matter under consideration 1
 am satisfied that the bill
 in the main is right
 but i think its provisions
 ought to be extended so
 as to embrace the cases
 of expenses actually incurred by
 these Offcers for clerical services
 and for room rent in
 all cases where a number
 of land offices ha vc
 been consol idated into one
 I will say that in
 Illinois under our land laws
 them and to remove the
 records to some other cessary
 and that these officersget suffcient
 salary office That process hasgoneon
 in the western land II
 already In that he differs
 with the Secretary of all
 the land offices in the
 State have bcen consol the
 Interior and with the Commissioner
 of the States until lhc
 ofhccs in many of the
 western imposing upon the register
 and re land States especially
 so in my State in
 Illinois General Land Office who
 ought at least to know
 oovernmont cciver of that ofiice
 such an amount of additional
 and perhaps in Missouri have
 been consolidated the burdens thrown
 on these oflicers into one
 land offce to which the
 records of all I will
 give my own State as
 an illustration of labor and
 research that they have been
 compelled 80 to ineurthc expense
 ofadditional clerical services and additional
 room rentat their own cost
 I have here a statement
 of the accounts of the
 register and receiver at Springfield
 in which they state that
 they have incurred necessarily considerable
 expenses to enable them to
 discharge the duties of the
 offices to which they have
 been appointed Thesc accountshave been
 presented to the proper officers
 of the Interior Department who
 acknowl edged the justice and
 equity of the claims but
 failed to pay them because
 of the want of power
 under any existing law The
 Secreta y of the Interior
 hovvreverj as has been stated
 by the gen tleman Indiana
 recommended that an ap propriation
 be made to provide for
 payment In Such cases now
 proposc an amendment to come
 in in the third section
 of the bill vhich I
 will ask the Clerk to
 read The Clerk read as
 follows SEC 3 and be
 it further enacted That the
 provisions of this act be
 and they are hereby c
 xtendcd to all other con
 solidatcd land oflices Mr McCLERNAND
 1 move to amend that
 section by adding as follows
 Prorided That this act shall
 bc construed to cxtend to
 and provide tor expenscs I
 wretofi re incurred by any
 recr ister or a eceiver
 or such consolidated land oflice
 addi tional clerical aid and

 r hat the axuount of

 be abproved by tile Secretary
 of the Interior CLARK of
 Missouri I ask in connec

 the gentleman from Illi nois
 that a letter f romthe

 thc necessary expenditures of this

 of the Gen eral Land
 Office in favor of the
 passage of this I now
 call for the previous question
 The cali för the previous
 question was seconded and the
 main qucstion was ordered and
 under the operation thereof the
 amendment was adopted kMr DAVIS
 ot Indiana moved to reconsider
 the vote by which the
 amendment was adopted and a
 so rnoved that the motion
 to reconsider be laid upon
 the table I hc lattcr
 motion was agreed to The
 hill as an iended was
 then ordered to bc I
 and the bill only provides
 for thc admission of a
 Delegate froin that government to
 sit I lcrc as do
 the Ihkegatcs from other l
 errit orics and at the
 sanH rate of compensation Those
 sir are the main provisions
 of the bill Mr SMITH
 of Virginia we of this
 the House who are suddenly
 called upon to vote I
 on this important proposition cannot
 hear a word of the
 geritlcrnan s explanation I hope
 he will speak louder or
 come nearer to us Mr
 THAYER Mr Speaker the bill
 is a vcry plain one
 It contemplates the survey and
 sale of the public lands
 in Dakota It does not
 propose to organize any government
 for the peo ple of
 Dakota for they have already
 organized It provides for the
 admis one for themselves Sion
 of a Delegatc from that
 government to a seat in
 this House of Representatives The
 provis ions for the survey
 and sale of the public
 lands arc the same as
 have been adopted by Congress
 in former like cases There
 is nothing new in those
 provisions The bill only gives
 the people a chance to
 purchase and secure as homcstcads
 the tracts of land which
 they now occupy IM r
 COX I ask thc gentloman
 from Nfassa chusetts whether this
 is not the same bill
 that was reported at the
 last session Mr THAYER It
 is the same bill anditwas
 not only reported but it
 was discussed at the last
 session I now renew the
 demand for the pre vious
 question Mr GROW I hope
 the demand for the prem
 vious question will not be
 sustained Mr SMITH of Virginia
 I think that on a
 measure of the magnitude of
 the one before us the
 previous question ought not to
 be sustained If the bill
 is to be pressed through
 in this hasty manner I
 must demand the yeas and
 nays on ordering the main
 quest ion The call for
 the previous question was not
 seconded Mr GROW Mr Speaker
 this bill proposes the creation
 ofa new offcer to be
 called the sur vcyor general
 of Dakota We are to
 have that new office with
 ail the additional expenses attend
 ant upon it when we
 now have a surveyor gen
 eral for that district for
 it cannot be unknown that
 Dakota is embraced within the
 district of the surveyor general
 of Minnesota and Iowa Nothing
 therefore is gained by this
 bili so far as the
 survey and sale of the
 public lands are concerned And
 it not only creates one
 new oflicc for which there
 is now no earthly necessity
 It provides that a man
 may come here ond sit
 as a member of Congress
 a from a land district
 so that in reality it
 creates two new offices the
 in cumbents of which are
 to draw pay from the
 Government without doif g anything
 for the peo ple of
 the Territory Even if this
 bill become the law the
 organization existing in Dakota what
 ever it is will have
 no more legal validity than
 would that of a vigilance
 committee in the nature of
 which it really is The
 ptissao c of this bill
 docs not legalize government of
 Dakota It o ives no
 sanction to it Every lawyer
 of t his House knows
 well enough that no court
 o jus tice would recvnize
 any rights accruincr or arising
 under a voluntary association of
 the people like that which
 at this day is in
 förce in Dakota They can
 only bc recognized as valid
 when sanctioned by the authority
 of the Congress of the
 United States It is then
 mcrc bagatelle to undertake to
 pass tbis bill it furnishes
 nothing to the people It
 gives then n no relief
 It gives them nothing that
 they have not now They
 have a sur Sir vcyor
 general They can have their
 lands sur vcyed under the
 law as it now stands
 The biiå will accomplish nothing
 new in that respect and
 it gives no validity to
 the form of government which
 now exists there If Congress
 wishes the r rerritory organized
 let it bc done in
 the usual and proper way
 Let the law be so
 drawn that Congress authorizes thc
 people of Dakota to act
 as a political conn nunity
 under the laws of the
 United States When that is
 donc rights will accrue which
 will be recognized by our
 courts of justice So far
 Mr Speaker as I understand
 the pow ers of this
 Government and its duties to
 the peo ple of the
 Territories the mager can be
 summed up in a few
 words that these Territories until
 some action of Congress is
 taken in relation to them
 are not opcn to settlement
 that under the non intercourse
 act they cannot bc settled
 ex cept in violation of
 the laws of the country
 No Settler can go in
 and occupy a Territory l
 ntil such time Congress by
 some authority permits sonho sort
 of a government to take
 the place of its own
 jurisdiction for until open to
 settlement it is under the
 jurisdiction of Congress placed there
 by the authority of the
 Constitution Congress must bc the
 primary law making power of
 these Territories Suppose you acquire
 territory from I a foreign
 Government and they cede to
 you all jurisdiction over it
 then of course Congress is
 invested with power over that
 territory until some legislation delegates
 the power to the people
 to orcranize a government there
 under their own au thority
 Until they do that there
 is no govern ment In
 legal existence in the Territories
 01 the Union When Congress
 does that you have a
 government deriving its authority from
 the law making power of
 the Government In the first
 instance it must derive its
 authority from Con gress for
 is therc such an anomaly
 that any foot of territory
 of thi Government is Without
 a law making power In
 a State the law making
 povv er over the territory
 within its limits is the
 Legis Iature of tho State
 No State has jurisdiction over
 a foot of soil outside
 of the State There fore
 no law making power exists
 in the States for territory
 beyond their limits Then is
 it pos THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

 and I myself do not

 is probable we were absent
 I do taken on it
 not mean to dispute the

 wish it to be understood
 that Some members citizenship of

 must take on the right
 of citizenship of the place
 to vhich burden of excessive
 taxation and that they would

 Mr THAYER Mr Speaker 1
 will reply in If he
 leaves Pennsyl ing power of
 cach place Mr COX And
 do they propose the same
 a very few words to
 the argument of the gentle
 vauia to day when he
 crosses the line of that
 State and goes info Virginia
 he leaves behind proviso in
 respect to slavery that was
 contained man from Pennsylvania against
 this bill It seems to
 me to come with a
 very bad grace from the
 in t hc former bills
 tl hat is the point
 him the right o citizenship
 of Pennsylvania and II must
 take upon himself the right
 of citizenship Mr GROW We
 shall I take it report
 the chairman of the Committee
 on Territories to ob same
 proviso as before with the
 privilegc of any i ject
 that we propose to admit
 a Delegate to Con In
 Pennsylvania thc of the State
 of Virginia member to move
 to strike it out and
 if a inajority gress from
 this land district of Dakota
 when his Legislature of the

 reported bills ship and that
 right extends to the geographical
 If a majority shall strike
 organizing two territorial governments Over
 the vote for those bills
 limits of the State And
 so the Virginia Legis stune
 people and admitting ttVQ Delegates
 to tho the clause out
 then you have not a
 word in Lhe lature fixes
 the right of citizenship within
 her limits When a Inan
 crosses the line which bikls
 about slavery no reference to
 it whatever House of Representatives
 This bill provides divides the
 two States he leaves behind
 him the i We propose
 to leave it to be
 settled by a majority for
 the admission of but one
 Delegate tb repre sent the
 sanne and has therefore the
 argument right of citizenship in
 the State which he leaves
 of the I louse whet
 hcr they will retain that
 pro viso or not and
 if a majority say no
 it will be of economy
 in its favor But the
 gentleman in and must takO
 upon himself the right oc
 citizen out of the bills
 Still we believe that tbc
 people forms us that the
 proposition to survey and offer
 ship of the State into
 which hc goes should have
 governmcnts and should therefore I
 for sale the lands of
 Dakota is an infringement Now
 when he leaves onc State
 of this Union vote to
 give them governments for to
 day there of the policy
 of the Government inasmuch as
 and goes into a Territory
 he is in precisely the
 same condition He leaves behind
 him the right is no
 doubt that there are at
 least forty thousand I no
 is ever made for such
 survey and sale till the
 Indian titles are extinguished Does
 of citizenship of the State
 he leaves and must people
 in what is known as
 Pike s Peak and place
 to they are there without
 any government and with take
 on the right of citizenship
 of the no law but
 mob law which he goes
 and the law making power
 of that Sir docs tbc
 Govermuent of the country dis
 place must fix this right
 of citizenship i charge its
 duty to the pioneers who
 go forlh and Thus you
 harmonize the powers of the
 Federal Government with those of
 the States The au people
 the wilderness in thus leaving
 them ex thority of each
 State is left within its
 own limits posed to mob
 law as their only protection
 to regulate and fix its
 right of citizenship and its
 Mr MAYNA RD I desire
 to make a sucges tion
 to tho gentleman and that
 is whether it own domestic
 institutions and they are beyond
 the reach and control of
 any person not a resident
 would not be better following
 the example of my of
 the particular State So when
 he goes into own State
 and sorne others to abolish
 the velo power altogether the
 territory of the Union the
 law making power Mr GROW
 In most Of the States
 you allow thereof is the
 Congress of the United States
 and until it delegates to
 some onc else the authority
 the Governor to veto and
 a majority of the Le
 to establish a law making
 power there he is under
 gislature to overrule the veto
 This gives timc in hasty
 legislation for the Governor to
 exanune the control of the
 primary and original law the
 bills and if he vetoes
 them the same major making
 power and must take on
 himself the right of cit
 iz enship fixed by Congress
 or by some gov it
 y that passed them originally
 could pass them ernment authorized
 by Then any over the
 veto of the Governor and
 thus in all substantial legislation
 it makes no difference legislation
 by Congress that docs not
 authorize a government to be
 established upon the Territo We
 know that hasty legislation takes
 place in ries does nothing
 in the world towards securing
 all legislative bodies in States
 as well as in Con
 to the people of the
 Territories a government but gross
 Some bills are passed in
 a moment of haste which
 if the attention of the
 mernbers had is a mere
 baRatelle and amounts to nothing
 Then why go on and
 create supernumerary been called to
 objectionable provisions in them would
 not have been passed at
 all In such cases land
 surveyors and add additional oflicers
 in the land offices whcn
 you havc land surveyors already
 I the Governor could calk
 the attention of the body
 to them whose duties extend
 over all the territories as
 Before I surrender the floor
 move that the far as
 the Indian title is extinguished
 NV h y orovide then
 pay for a man froin
 a land district bill be
 referred to the Committee on
 Territo to sit herc who
 represents no organized and ries
 have but a word to
 say in conclusion It can
 see in this proposal no
 bene overnment must be remembered
 that the surveyors general ficial
 legislat ion whatever and f
 move the refer are appointed
 to survey _the lands as
 fast as the ence of
 the bill to Indian title
 is extinguished The Government Mr
 COX Before the gentleman concludes
 I never has proposed heretofore
 to go upon the lands
 Mr GROMT I do not
 purpose to deprivc the of
 the Indians and commence surveys
 before the Indian title has
 been extinguished That creates the
 gentleman forget that in the
 former pgt t of his
 remarks hc said there was
 already a Surveyor general for
 this very purpose Accordingly this
 bill does not propose any
 infringement of our policy in
 this regard But Surveyor general
 of Minnesota has not ordered
 the survey of the lands
 of Dakota and the people
 there are desir ous of
 securing titles to their homesteads
 It is the duty of
 the Government to enable them
 to obtain rightful and permanent
 possession of the land which
 they are now cultivating But
 the chairmån of the Committee
 on Terri tories considers it
 the duty of this General
 Göv ernment to form a
 government for the people of
 Dakota I do not blame
 the gentleman for his persistent
 efforts to magnify his office
 The peo ple of Dakota
 have formed their own government
 and in my judgment they
 are as well qualified to
 do this for themselvcs as
 the Committee on Territorics are
 to do it for them
 This govern ment is now
 in full operation The people
 are satisfied with it I
 wish by the people from
 their own number to recognize
 this government by admitting a
 Del egate from it to
 the I louse of Representatives
 What does the gentleman propose
 to do Sini ply this
 to overthrow the government of
 the peo ple and to
 put in its place a
 government made by the Territorial
 Committee to displacer the offcers
 whom the people have elected
 and to au thorize the
 President to appoint their offcers
 have no patience sir with
 this argument of the divine
 right of kings or of
 Congress The right of self
 government is the right of
 American cit izens on American
 soil and is not derived
 either i would there from
 Congress or the President fore
 recognize the rightfulness and validity
 of the government now existing
 in Dakota by admit Mr
 COX I wish to inquirc
 of the gentleman i thesc
 border troubles and diffculties and
 hence the Government has abstaii
 ed thus far in its
 his I ting a Delecrate
 from that political community to
 proposes any legislation with respect
 to this or tory from
 authorizinø any surveys of lands
 until this House Nothing further
 is necessary and the other
 Territories And if so whether
 they the Indian title thereto
 has been extinguished I now
 move that the bill bc
 referred to the Com propose
 to change the bills they
 reported last ses The systmn
 inaugurated in this bill proposes
 to innovate upon that policy
 and send a surveyor mittee
 of the Whole on the
 state of the Union sion
 so as to obliterate those
 obnoxious provis creneral to commence
 surveys before the Indian with
 a purpose to cntcr a
 motion to reconsider ions which
 caused them to be defeated
 Mr GROW Is the question
 first upon the mo It
 will cnd in border MI
 GROW The Cornmittee on Territories

 CLAIMS AGAINST MEXICO Mr IVERSON
 As there seems to be
 no busi ness before the
 Senate Fmove that the Senate
 take up for consideration ther
 bili S No 112 to
 carry out thé provisions of
 the fifteenth section of the
 treaty between the United States
 and Mex ico concluded on
 the 2d day of February
 1848 The motion was agreed
 to The VICE PRESIDENT Theseqretarywill
 read the amendment pending to
 the bill which was offered
 by the Senatorfrom Mail ie
 Mr HAMLIN The Secretary read
 the amendment which is in
 lincs two and three of
 section two to strike out
 thc words and a on
 the part of the so
 that it will read United
 States both Phat the said
 board shall have a secretary
 versed in the English and
 Spanish languages Ec Mr HAMLIN
 1 recollect very distinctly the
 subject matter when it was
 up at the last session
 It seemed to mc unneccssary
 to have an additional It
 did not conförm to the
 usual practice oflicer Ofco mm
 issioncrs in such cases where
 the amounts invotvcd were no
 greater than those involved ih
 this commission The amount is
 very small and one good
 officer in my judgment would
 be I think the amendment
 ought amply suåcient to prevail
 Mr IVERSON The amendment fthink
 is that instead of three
 commiésioncrS there shall Is that
 tbc object of the amend
 be only one ment Perhaps
 did not distinctly understand it
 The VICE PRESIDENT That amendment
 was agreed to Mr IVERSON
 Then what amendment is now
 pendil ff The VICE PRESIDENT
 The Secretary will acyain read
 thc amendment The Secretary again
 read the amendment Mr IVERSON
 I do not feel any
 very great interest about the
 details of the bill but
 in draw ing it up
 the Committee on Claims simply
 lowed the precedent by Congress
 in establishing boards of conunis
 sions to adjudicate the original
 ciaims under tl is treaty
 There Were three com missioners
 They had always a solicitor
 on the part of the
 Government to see that thc
 Govern ment was not imposed
 upon by claimants and this
 money taken out of the
 Treasury by falée claims I
 would suggest to the Senator
 from Maine whether it would
 not be better to let
 theiée be a solicitor for
 this board His pay will
 not come out of thc
 Treasury it will be no
 expense It comes out of
 this fund to the Government
 which does not belong to
 the United States but to
 the claimants if they have
 any just claim It will
 cost the Government nothing and
 I think it will be
 a protection at Icast to
 other claimants to have a
 solicitor and see justice done
 between them all Mr HAMLIN
 Mr President 1 repeat again
 the history of the Government
 shows that we have not
 usually had solicitors in cases
 of the limited amount involved
 in this commission very rarely
 Now sir it is the
 duty of the commissioner to
 do precisely what the Senator
 from Georgiwsays to see ti
 lat improper claims are not
 presented or allowed if presented
 It is his duty Ho
 should be a lawycr he
 ehould be a compe Rnd
 if he is a competent
 man you tent man only
 want this solicitor for the
 sole purpose Of making a
 place for some particular person
 It is as useless as
 the fifth wheel to a
 coach The commissioner is entitled
 to a secretary to a
 idhirn in writing out his
 opinions and in preparing the
 papers but the very duties
 that devolve On the chief
 officer are those of seeing
 hat improper claims arc not
 allowed and that thpse that
 are allowed are allowed on
 legal and equitable prin 84
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 13 diplts
 The amount is small and
 I would not fritter it
 away by creating places for
 particular individuals l bat is
 all there is of it
 Mt BRAGG Mr President 1
 hope the amendment will not
 prevail The subject was before
 the Committee on Claims that
 reported this bill of which
 I am a member It
 was dis cussed at the
 list session The Senator from
 Maine says there is no
 necessity for this off I
 think the action of the
 board on these cer very
 claims before when there were
 three com missioners instead of
 one as now proposed by
 this bill Bhows the necessity
 of such an offccr Large
 nd extensive frauds were committed
 on the Government notwithstanding the
 vigilance of your commissioners Whether
 the Government has been in
 the habit of having solicitors
 all previous times or not
 I say experience shows that
 such an officer is necessary
 to prevent frauds They were
 committed befbre and in my
 humble judgment they will be
 committed again without It is
 impos the assistance of some
 such ofiiccr Sible for one
 commissioner or a nurnber of
 com missioners to investwate these
 claims A priona facie case
 is made out in relatiDn
 to a clain and for
 aught the commissioner can sec
 it is all right and
 proper as was the case
 when tbc Gardiner fraud was
 committed Frauds Ilia y be
 committed ao ain perhaps even
 with this aid to the
 commis sioner This be an
 additional safeguard to the Government
 and to honest claimants I
 Iliopo thei efore that the
 amendment will not prevail T
 he salary of the offceu
 will bc but a small
 por tion of the fund
 The amendment was not agreed
 to there being on a
 division ayes 20 noes 23
 Mr MASON This is n
 bill in to the Florida
 cluitns I understand Mr IVERSON
 Oh no 1 will explain
 to the Senator and the
 Senate in a few words
 thc object of this bill
 By the treaty bet weerl
 the United States and Mexico
 mnoant was set apart to

 to the unexpended balance o

 by this act first deducting
 such sums of money as
 nnay be due i amount
 of money which the Government
 of the United States agreed
 to pay to Mexico They
 agreed to set apart a
 portion of it 3 250
 000 to pay the claims
 that citizens of the United
 Slates bad against the Republic
 of Mexico Of course it
 was a part of the
 consideration that the United States
 gave for the treaty and
 the territory that we purchased
 from Mexico by that treaty
 It is therefore a part
 of the fund of Mexico
 which the United States agreed
 to pay her but which
 the United States was to
 retain and pay over in
 a cer tain way in
 order to extinguish the debts
 which the people of the
 United States had against the
 Republic of Mexico It is
 therefore the money of Mexico
 not of the United States
 Mr HALE It was the
 money of Mexico if they
 had established their claim in
 the way that the law
 and the treaty pointed out
 but the law and the
 treaty have been fully performed
 and their obligations carried out
 in letter and in sprit
 Everything that we aoreed to
 do everything that the law
 required us to do has
 been done Every body that
 had a claiiu has been
 invited to conne and has
 come good and bad and
 all have been 1 allowed
 together not all but many
 of them believe the Gardiner
 claim was one that was
 al lowed under this treaty
 There is no obligation now
 existing under the treaty or
 undcr the law to pay
 this rnoney The reason that
 propose to postpone it is
 on the satne policy that
 governs the Administration in refusing
 to build custom I louses
 and some ot her public
 buildings The Senator the United
 States ll onx said persons
 in whose t avor said
 awards shall be nnade and

 fhtd it j urth cr
 cnactcd That thc said board
 shall tcrtninatc its business within
 onc year froin the day
 ot orøaniza tion Mr HALE
 I move to add as
 an additional section to the
 bill that it shall not
 take etYect until after the
 public debt is pai l
 and I desire to explain
 the object of that atnendmcnt
 w c ha ve once
 made provision lör these clainn
 ants We instituted a comrnission
 the com mis but owing
 to the state of the
 Trcusury the Ad ministration declined
 to do them because the
 Treasury was not full enough
 That is the ground on
 which I wish to put
 this but do not desire
 to occup any of the
 time of the Senate about
 it Mr SEIDELL Mr President
 the Senator from Georgia who
 reported this bill could not
 i I have bccn farniliar
 with the facts and the
 stipula i tions of the
 treaty with Mexico or else
 he has for gotten then
 u By that treaty we
 atrre ed to pay Sion
 sat and everybody that had
 a just claitn i came
 and some that had unjust
 clainus came as i wo
 know by thc judicial records
 of this District and cvcry
 dollar that could be established
 beforc that commission has been
 paid out of tbc Ih
 cas ury There is an
 unexpended balance left and nominally
 this is to reach that
 Now sir I think when
 ve have paid every dollar
 that could bc established before
 this commission that we ought
 not to borrow money for
 this money has got to
 be borrowed to pay morc
 and invite other creditors to
 corne in after such an
 opportu nit y as they
 have had After the public
 debt is paid and we
 have Inoney that we have
 not to go out to
 borrow it will be time
 enouzh to invite claim ants
 to con le in and
 make claims on the I
 veasury for this moncv The
 PRESiD NG OFFICER Mr in
 i thc chair The question
 is on the amendrnent offered
 by the Senator prom New
 Hampshire to insert as an
 additional section the following and
 be it further enacted I
 hat this act shall not
 take effect until the public
 debt ot the Cnited States
 shall have been paid Mr
 IVERSON 1 have only to
 say in ence to that
 zunendment that it seems to
 mc to be a very
 extraordintu y proposition are any
 claimants that are entitled in
 justice and equity to this
 l loncy it would be
 very hard in 15 000
 000 to the Republic of
 Mexico in consid cration of
 certain cessions of territory Every
 dollar of that amount has
 been paid Another provision of
 that treaty was that to
 the extent of 3 250
 000 the United States should
 undertake to compensate their citizens
 for all just claims they
 might have on the Government
 of Mexico and at the
 same time release Mexico from
 all furthcr obligation on account
 of these claims This money
 is not now a fund
 standing in the Treasury to
 the credit of these claimants
 It is a distinct abs
 lute new appropriation of this
 amount Arlicle clevcn of the
 treaty with Mexico declared that
 In consideration o thc extension
 acquired by the bound aries
 of the United States as
 defined in the filth artiele
 of the present treaty the
 Government of the United States
 engages to pay to that
 of thc Mexican Republic the
 suin of The article then
 goes on to define the
 mode in which it should
 be paid at a certain
 time and subsequently in stock
 All that rnoney has been
 paid Now we come to
 the article of the treaty
 under which the Senator from
 Georgia a ssumes the fact
 and that fact is assumed
 in the bill the bill
 is based on a false
 hypothesis and declarcs a fund
 to exist that has no
 existence The moncy is now
 in the of the United
 States it belongs to thc
 Unitcd States Mexico has no
 claim upon it whatever The
 fifteenth atticlc of the treaty
 is in those X vords
 deed to postpono them until
 the public debt is I
 paid bcc anae this n
 oney docs not belong to
 thc United States It comes
 out of the Government of
 Mexico It is money in
 the Treasury paid i by
 the Government of Mexico into
 our Treasury for the benefit
 of these claimants Will the
 Gov crnment of the United
 States withhold froin any i
 just claimant the amount of
 his claim until it has
 The United States exonerating Mexico
 from a de mauds on
 accou nt of the claims
 of their citizens mentioned in
 the preceding article and considering
 them entirely and iörcvcr canceled
 M hatever their amount may
 be under takc tounake satisfaction

 11Dt exceeding l o ascertain
 the validity and amount of
 these clairns a hoard of
 connnissioners shall be estab iished
 by the Government of the
 United States whose awards shall
 be final and conclusive Providcd
 hat in de ciding upon
 thc validity of each claitn
 the board shall be guided
 and governed by the principles
 and rules of decision prescribed
 by the first and fifth
 articles ot the unratified convention
 concluded at the City of
 Mexico on the 20th ions
 of said treaties for carrying
 their eaid commission into paid
 all the other public creditors
 That seelns day of Novcmhor
 1813 and in no case
 shall an award be to
 me a very hard proceedin
 v full effect I hope
 the SCD made in ihvor
 ofany claim not embraced by
 these principles SEC 3 Hndbc
 it further enacted That all

 there is an end of

 be answered that treason may

 fully aware of against the

 the Senate adjourn to day
 it be to meet on
 I now lenpw my that
 Ssttaatteess abt nænae to be
 final and conclusive on the
 ground that the Monday next
 case has not been decided
 upon its merits but was
 decided on the question of

 be deluded by the idea
 that this is n question
 whether our own citizens shall
 receive two hundrcd and thirty
 or two hun dred and
 forty thousand dollars or whether
 it shall be returned to
 Mexico but vhethcr this money
 which is now in the
 Treasury upon which there is
 no claim morally or legally
 shall be distrib uted as

 proper Mr HALE and others

 motion was agreed to WEST
 POINT COMMISSION M r DAVIS
 I ask permission before pro
 cceding to the consideration of
 the order of the day
 to make a report from
 the joint commission instituted by
 Congress at its last session
 to in quire into the
 affairs of the Military Academy
 The commission have performed their
 labor and submit their report
 with an accompanying rec ord
 which I ask may be
 printed for the use of
 If it be the pleasure
 of the Senate to the
 Senate have it referred to
 a committee I shall also
 make though the commission itself
 being that motion somewhat in
 t hc nature of a
 committee I sup United States
 necessarily levies war against his
 own State and is therefore
 guiltyof treason But while that
 hypothesis is pcrföct y consistent
 with the premise which I
 have laid down that the
 States are sovereicrn the other
 is directly in con flict
 with it Ifthei nhnbitantsof the
 United Stalee be one political
 community if they compose nation
 if there are no States
 bul alt the inhabit I
 ant together compose one State
 or nation then it is
 utterly impossiblc that treason can
 be com mitted against any
 one ofthesegeographical divis ions as
 impossible as Illat treason can
 be com mitted against acounty
 I really do not know
 how to argue questions so
 plain To my mind they
 arc so conclusive that I
 need but to state them
 and feel that argument could
 not add to their I
 pose it may be considered
 by the Senate without I
 had intended to go somewhat
 at length into reference to
 any of its standing committees
 If no one desires its
 reference will move that the
 this question but I shall
 not weary the Senate It
 is important now that we
 shouJd il report and accornpanying
 papers bc printed for further
 the use of the Senate
 and I shall call it
 up fOr begin to understand
 our position and what we
 are II early consideration Mr

 say that at this I
 hc rnotion to print was
 agreed to time I wanted
 to make a which I
 hope STATE OF THE UNION
 will receive the assent of
 gentlemen from cvcry section of

 advisable to make a motion
 to which all will agree
 rather than disagree and that
 is that when the Senatc
 ad journs to day it
 be to meet on Monday
 next Mr HUNTER I hope
 we shali not agree to
 If we can pass thc

 I shall be willing but
 if not it will be

 by these States let it
 be dis solved rather than

 now an effort making to

 VANDEVER have yery little to

 grant alternate sections of public
 lands for seven miles in
 width to aid in the
 construction of a cer tain
 line of road from the
 mouth of the Kansas river
 through the Territory of Kansas
 to the wcstcrn limits o
 that Territory This bill is
 dif ferent from railroad grants
 that have been hcre toforo
 made in this it allows

 makes a grant of alter

 It is the law of

 not whether the in when
 the House adjourncd yesterday I

 for which he rises and
 the incident of the institution

 there was no objec Thank

 the other section i a
 gallant few that old glorious
 Constitution I The SPEAKER Illinois
 loving Democratic party from some
 of whom Is there any
 asks leave to introduce a
 resolution we have upon issues
 which wc regarded mate that
 obiection I trust in God
 sir rial differed of late
 Mr CURRY Let it be
 for information the hatchet will
 be buried between us in
 this The resolution was read
 as follows areat struggle that
 is comina on for constitutional
 Resol eed hy the House
 Q Representatiecs Tl_ bat we
 prop sists in the fact
 that the grant is made
 tc the Ter ritory or
 future State but gives the
 territorial gov crnmcnt authority only
 to locate the line of
 the road The disposition of
 the lands is reserved for
 the action of the State
 government when the State shall
 be formed Under the territorial
 form of government the road
 can only be located and
 thc lands selected and reserved
 Now Mr Speaker I feel
 no particular interest in this
 measure above any other similar
 measüreS that may be propoSed
 for the action Of the
 House This bill simply proposes
 to carry out what seems
 to have been the general
 policy of the Government in
 aiding the construction of works
 of this kind in the
 new States by liberal donations
 or gppropria tions of land
 This bill is simply carrying
 out that general policy I
 have nothing to say in
 regard It has been fully
 dis to that policy at
 this time cussed and IS
 no doubt thorough y understood
 it is desirable by all
 members on this floor think
 that land grants should be
 made to carry forward that
 great systern of roads already
 com plete and in operation
 to the banks of the
 Missis sippi and which are
 now in process of construc
 tion across the State of
 Iowa and across the State
 of Missouri to the banks
 of the Missouri river The
 ultimate object of all these
 roads is to reach the
 Pacific ocean and I bccy
 leave to suggest as liberty
 under the question as to
 whether one t of the
 sovereign Slates of this Union
 shall be erly estonat e
 the inimense value of our
 national Union to I our
 collective and individual happiness that
 we cherish one reason Why
 this bill should receive the
 favor remember how gallantly our
 a cordial habitual and immovable
 attaelnnent to it that able
 consideration of this House that
 the neces coerced or not
 we will speak of it
 as of the palladium of
 our potiticäl sity of a
 Pacific railroad is now fölt
 by all men flag with
 the Constitution emblazoned upon it
 safety and prosperity that we
 will watch its preservation 1
 conceive that this proposition affords
 a basis for was borne
 by V ALLANDIGHAM and with
 jealous anxiety t bat will
 discountenance what the construction of
 that road and it will
 uvoid one SON and LOGAN
 and Cox and MCCLERNAND and
 ever even a suspie i011
 that it can in any

 country different plans heretofore presented
 to the together the various
 parts that we regard it
 as a main and a
 soldier When his country called
 upon to appropriate any money
 from the Federal Treas him
 he answered promptly to the
 call and in the pillar
 in the edifiec of our

 The road contemplated ig to
 start froni the pence abroad
 out our bloody fields of
 Mexico showed that he had
 not of tranquillity at 88
 Missouri river pointing out to
 the wilderness in the direction
 of Pike s Peak the
 design being to continue it
 on ultimately toWard the Pacific
 coast It secures the location
 of the line and the
 selec I tion and reservation
 of the lands along the
 line to the present western
 limits of the Territory of
 Kansas This road will accomplish
 a very con siderable portion
 of that important wofk the
 Pa cific railroad Mr CRAIG
 of Missouri Will the gentleman
 from Iowa allow mc to
 say a word I have
 an amendment which I wish
 to offer to the seventh
 section of the bill and
 before the gentleman closes his
 temai ks I would be
 glad to offer it so
 that the gentleman ma if

 Territories and States of Kansas

 of the public lands to

 the provisions of the act
 granted to the said L

 State of Kansas to aid

 orn Elwood in Kansas via
 Maryville to Denver City Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri I will
 explain tho amendment when thc
 gentletnaD Iowa will allow me
 Mr VANDEVER say in to
 the amendunent olibrcd the gentlcnman
 f rorn Missouri that I
 have no personal objection 10
 it It is a mere
 question as to the starting
 point of one of thcse
 roads There is n local
 controversy betiveen the different points
 along the western bank of
 the Missouri river as to
 what localities Åhe ll be
 made Vthe initial points It
 is a inatter of secondary
 importance altogether a matter of
 entire indifference to a large
 majority of the members of
 this as to where shall
 be the precise Starting point
 on the Missouri river T
 Ille grcat object of the
 grant will have been at
 tained by thc construction of
 a road from any points
 on the Missouri river 01
 western boundary of the State
 of Missouri T lie Inain
 object in the location of
 one of these roads is
 that It shall be an
 extension as a main trunk
 of the Hannibal I take
 it that it is a
 mutter and St Joseph road
 of small irnportanc e for
 us detennine the CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
 December 13 Now another thing
 When Kansas may be who
 is the oldest member of
 the Committcc on admitted into
 the Union as a State
 her bound Public Lands in
 this House Mr COBB and
 who will bear me witness
 that eight years ago aries
 will be fixed considerably inside
 the limits when efforts were
 being made to carry through
 of the present Territory of
 Kansas The object the House
 a bill donating lands to
 aid in carrying of this
 bill is to grant lands
 to aid in the construc
 these roads through the State
 of Missouri t tion of
 roads to the western boundary
 of t hé Ter ritory
 of Kansas When Kansas is
 admitted as debates will show
 that the intention was that
 the roads should be continued
 directly west througb a State
 within smaller limits she v
 ill of coursc the Indian
 country in the direction of
 the Pacific have jurisdiction or
 control over only such por
 I think by refetring to
 the Globc it will tion
 of the lands as are
 within the State leaving coast
 the remainder of the lands
 to be selected and the
 I be found that in
 the debate which took place
 on roads located by such
 State government as may thatoccasion
 itwas stated that when the
 Hannibal II and St Joseph
 railroad should be completed it
 hereafter be set up west
 of the State of Kansas
 would be an advance to
 that extent in a line
 of rail The passage of
 this bill will secure an
 import road extending west from
 Philadelphia Harris ant step toward
 the completion of a continuous
 line of railroad from the
 Atlantic to the Pacific a
 burg Columbus Indianap olis and
 Springfield national necessity which is
 at the present time fclt
 and admitted by all classes
 of all sections of tho
 Union By thus making a
 liberal appropri ation of the
 public domain we may obviate
 the necessity hereafter of making
 appropriations of money directly from
 the natiorjal Treasury to aid
 the construction of a railroad
 across the con tinent Now
 Mr Speaker I statc those
 t hings and cmnmend them
 to the favorablc consideration of
 I the I louse I
 drsirc that there shall be
 definite action upon the measurc
 at this time and shall
 therefore ask that the bill
 may be put upon its
 passao e Before relinquishing the
 floor I desire to state
 that the Committee on Public
 Lands at the last session
 of Congress considered propositions ofa
 similar character in reference to
 toads in Califor nia and
 Oregon and authorized reports to
 be madc to the House
 recommending the donation of lands
 along thc lino of tbc

 Mr CRAIG to enable him

 CRAIG Missouri The gentleman from
 Iowa states t he casc
 correctly The Corn mittce on
 Public Lands havc been induced
 I have no doubt to
 report this bill in the

 said notes at par after
 public advertisement of not less
 than Lands thought il would
 be be determined by the
 Kansas Legislaf ure which my
 amcndn cnt applies as I
 propose to road which is
 to make it BLit in

 if you plcasc the cotnmitte

 the precise poiilt of s

 to the other road which
 is bc endangered by settling
 that question and they have
 theretbrc turned these parties loose
 into the desi tucd as
 a continuation of tho Pacific
 railroad now in proccss of
 construction through the State Kansas
 Legislature to settle their conflictinc
 in of Missouri the initial
 point is to bo sonoo

 object to goino to the
 Kan sas Legislature First because
 one of these roads at
 or near thc terminus of
 that road on the west
 although starting a quarter of
 a degree il side ern

 Committee on Pub i the
 Territory of Kansas some twelve
 01 fifteen lic Lands have
 not decmcd it within their
 prov ince to designate the
 prccisc point of startin miles
 south of the Nebraska line

 proper point can only be
 determined by volving quite as
 much the interests of Nebraska
 actual survey and we Kansas
 Legislature as Kansas and yet
 the Committee on Public i
 to determine that matter after
 such survey shall attempt to
 settle conflicting interests of diflln
 ent localities along the line
 of tho river might en
 danger the passage of the
 l ill through the House
 They have therefore deemed it
 best that the question should
 be referred to the authorities
 of I do not know
 what effect the amend Kansas
 ment of the gentleman from
 Missouri may havc if adopted
 I have no personal objection
 to it but I have
 deemed it my duty to
 state the reasons which havc
 actuated the Connnittee on Public

 conclusion Which is em bodicd
 in this bill Lands propose

 the great body of which

 because it will oblige you

 there is now a railroad

 it is also equally true
 that the State of Missouri

 LAND GRANT TO KANSAS AGAIN
 The SPEAKER The House will
 now resume the consideration of
 the Kansas railroad bill which
 evas informally laid aside to
 take up the i amendments
 of the Senate to the
 Trcasury note Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri Mr Speaker we have
 spent in public lands and
 in money out of the
 State treasury of Missouri about
 15 000 000 to build
 two railroads to the boundary
 if Kan sas One of
 these railroads is finished and
 business to the Kansas line
 We ask no interest in
 the public lands in Kansas
 All we do ask is
 that we shall have the
 same accommodations there in their
 lands that thev have in
 ours All we ask is
 that a Jine of roaa
 running fifteen hundred miles west
 and terminating on the bank
 of the Missouri river at
 the city bf St Joseph
 lnay be extended th rough
 Kansas precisely in the direction
 son Valley rcgions This road
 terminates within one mile ofa
 strai llt due east line
 fronl Denver City and it
 is believed as near as
 the inaps now show it
 that that lil le if
 extended duo west v ould
 run williin one 01 two
 In iles of Genoa in
 Valley I ask a l
 y who advocates this can
 thc gentleman Crom Illinois say
 as much for t he
 men who I know have
 beset this Hall and thc
 committee room Mr LOVEJOY I
 can gay nothing for them
 but I can say that
 it strikes mc that it
 will be safe fore if
 the amendment of the gentleman
 from to leave the disposition
 of this land and the
 loca rv_ lissouri vtere to
 be carried Congress would be
 tion of this road to
 the Legislature of Kansas appropriating
 land to build a road
 fifteen miles and it does
 not strike me as being
 right that Mis of which
 is already built by individual
 capital souri should arrange the
 matter for Kansas and enterprise
 And all this for the
 single and Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri Missouri docs not simple
 purpose of giving an advantage
 t o the town wish
 to arrange anything för Kansas
 but I put of St
 Joseph as the beginning point
 of the road it to
 thc gentleman from Illinois if
 he docs not ii for
 all know that Elwood is
 little more than a know
 that Kansas bas becn benefited
 by the sand bar opposite
 to St Joseph When the
 cit 9 000 000 which
 wc havc spent in luaking
 a road izcns of Missouri
 and of Kansas have with
 their and whether we should
 not have own capital extended
 this road miles fur to
 their border some benefit of
 their money ther west what
 sense propriety would there I
 he road must start from
 one of the two towns
 be in appropriating land to
 render their labor and of
 Atchison or Elwood and no
 olhcr point of capital valueless
 by building another road parallel
 l departure is talked of
 and the gentleman from with
 it Take down the map
 and look at it and
 Illinois knows that to start
 the road frcnn Atchi you
 find that the Missouri river
 from the town son vou
 havc got to go down
 by the Platte of St
 Joseph to the town of
 Atchison flows of the gold
 fields of the Pike s
 Peak and thc Car country
 road to a point opposite
 that point and substantially west
 and you will also sce
 that the there transfer your
 passcncrcrs and freight after railroad
 runs parallel With the river
 Atchison i I riding only
 twenty two miles upon that
 road to according to my
 computation is at least fifteen
 this projected road for Kansas
 Gcntlcmcn know rnilcs farther west
 than St Joseph and the
 map that the amend nient
 is intended for the benefit
 of will Ibcar me out
 What reason then should the
 public that the section as
 it now stands will prompt
 us to grant lands to
 build two roadN par throw
 us into tl 0 Kansas
 Legislature where allel with cach
 other The proposition too bc
 comes more objectionable when we
 remember that bill reported by
 the committec o get up
 herc Leavenworth Quindaro Wyandotte Atchison
 will go into a general
 scramble Atchison is a t0i
 vn of Kansas in which
 these and Elwood and give
 a single good reason for
 thc road cross ing the
 Missouri river at any other
 point than at A nd
 while I have no reflection
 to make upon the lands
 arc proposed to be granted
 and St Joseph rail _Kansas
 Legislature which inay be electe
 å I Say isa town
 of Missouri which should have
 no more the terminus of

 that gentlemen rnay up o

 in addition It state that

 in off of it can
 rive half as good a
 reason for start ing this

 as I have given woul

 to the citizens of Mis

 the House to recollect that
 terniinus ot the present souri

 it of movino a reference
 of this bill back to

 some of my objections to
 public this bill and the
 amendments And with ail re
 I think the bill in
 IS no slay der upon
 thc Kansas Legislature t say
 Cmnmittcc on Public Lands its
 prcscnt form is highly objectionable
 and spcct to the gentleman
 from NLissouri I consider that
 such combination may be formed
 in ICan think the arnendmcntof

 from Iowa Mr VANDE ii
 souri Nil CRAIG would not
 Innke it bctter but I
 tleman informs us that nobody
 could give such VER who
 reported this bill M h
 y it is the committee
 can nan e all absolute
 connection With ili the Pacific
 railroad at the mouth of
 the Kansas river Why is
 it that they can nan
 0 an absolute point for
 tbc starting of the Leavenworth
 road Why do t hey
 not nmno the terminus of
 the Han niba and St
 Joseph railroad as the absolute
 starting point for this road
 I know that the I
 gentleman from Iowa has examined
 the map have it now
 upon rny desk I can
 show any gen t eman
 of this House who does
 not own a corner lot
 anywhere along that river that
 this project is intended not
 by the committee that thc
 sccti0 1 as it now
 stands is intended to force
 the thou sands of travelers
 and the thousands of freights
 twenty two miles down the
 Missouri river after it stri
 Ices that river and before
 it crosses and starts westward
 That twenty two miles has
 to be overcome to get
 back upon the line going
 to Den more than twenty
 two miles has to be
 overcorne for Fort Kearny is
 to the north evcn of
 the point I am ready
 to be proposed by my

 1Ddcr reasons Mr CRAIG of
 Missouri I did not say
 no stand a treaty vas

 give a good reason I
 said nobody who docs not
 own town lots in Atchison

 the gentleman if he comes
 within that category I vlr
 MONTGOMERY is true as the
 gen ing a railroad from
 Leavenworth over substan tially the
 samc route mentioned in the
 bill reported tlcman suggests that
 a small part of the
 small by the Committee on
 Public Lands Thcrefore property I
 own is in the town
 of Atchison butt if this
 bill pass you will grant
 to Leavenworth cannot see how
 that affects the force of
 argu a double grant of
 land First she will take
 land ment my argument is
 correct it matters noth ing
 whether I own some littlö
 property in Atchi under the
 treaty and then under the
 provisions I trust Mr Speaker
 I um not son or
 not of this bill M

 allow actuated by any personal
 interest in this matter I
 claim higher and purer motives
 as the moving mc to

 my interest in the proper
 settlement of Mr MONTGOMERY Certainly
 rl he gentleman has made
 a this question Suspicious men
 are always to Mr PARROTT
 mistake in the assertion which
 hc has just made be
 suspected so at least runs
 the old tidage The treaty
 which passed the Senato last
 winter Tried b that rule
 the gentleman from Missouri provided
 that the railroad cm npany
 in Kansas would 110t be

 not vet City or Fort
 Kcarn y if to Fort
 Kcarny should have a certain
 quantity of land only by
 orlly seems to suspect me
 but hc even charges buying
 it at an appraised valuation
 the Cornn jittec on Public

 against their convictions of duty
 and I MONTGOMERY But at
 only a against the justice
 in the case merely to
 get rid inal valuation as
 the ecntleman well knows of
 the clamors of the lobby
 I do not believe it
 cross exu rnined by any

 if they do not bnv
 them they will have no
 right in that reservation for
 The gentleman is rnistaken In
 his zeal to ad this
 section that om try incr
 to have stricken out this
 bill gives them none So
 t he gentleman is vancc
 thc interest of his town
 he has forgotten I ask
 any gentletnan who advocates this
 section as it now stands
 to ive this House a
 sinole mistaken in both his
 statcn jents in the first
 place l thc courtesy of
 debate In the name of
 the com I know nothing
 that this bill gives them
 any land at ali in
 the res ii mittce I
 scout thc insinuation reason aside
 from that given by the
 gentleman His reason is the
 true reason I he ervation
 and in the second place
 that the treaty of the
 perso k who pressed this
 matter on the from Iowa
 tention of the committee I
 am sure I never did
 committee desired to oct rid
 of the importunities gave them

 Thero is not ameknber of

 ERY T am not mistaken
 in I ncver spoke to

 90 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December
 13 entleman here who knows
 as much about it as
 intelligence of this House to
 urge no stronger do who
 will get up here and
 state that there is argument
 to sustain his amendment that
 certain peltsons who give substantial
 reasons against it any road
 eighteen miles west of the
 city of St I Joseph
 it is not an exten
 It is all in Missouri
 own property in Atchison The
 gentleman insinuates by his question
 that the fact that I
 own property in Atchison should
 influence my argu ment Chat
 is an unfortunate position for
 the gentleman to assume He
 has told us that Atchison
 was likely to secure the
 Legislature of Kansas to fix
 that as the starting point
 of this road therefofe if
 I desired to advance the
 Value Of my corner lot
 and if my conduct were
 influenced by such a motive
 I should not be found
 opposing the bill According to
 his own l who showing
 am acting against my interest
 own town lots in Atchison
 am moving to recom mit
 the bill to the Comniittee
 of Public Lands al though
 it would advance the valuc
 of my prop erty The
 honorable gentleman deeply interested in
 corner and other lots in
 the town of St Josepll
 is advocating the passage of
 this bill with amend ments
 directly favoring his own personal
 inter est s and the
 interests of his town If
 I were to believe that
 the gentleman was in fluenced
 by such motives I would
 find a ready solution of
 the very great number of
 measures brought into this House
 intended to benefit St Joseph
 There does not arise a
 single bill in which St
 Joseph can be interested or
 where an i amendment can
 make her so but the
 gentleman proposes that the name
 of St Joseph bé inserted
 I here is not a
 proposal to build a military
 road I or a railroad
 orio dig a canal but
 the gentlernan assures us that
 St Joseph should be the
 starting point for it No
 matter where a mail route
 is to terminate it is
 sure to start from St
 Joseph I saw in the
 New York Herald of this
 morning that the Committee on
 the Post Office and Post
 Roads were about to propose
 arn ottrland mail route which
 as usual is to start
 from St Jo seph although
 the fact is notorious that
 the mail is carried on
 railroad frotil St Joseph to
 Atch ison and is started
 from Atchison on Its overla
 nd ourney Now L do
 not object to this zeal
 and industry on the pqrt
 of the honorable gentleman to
 serve his own imnncdiate constituents
 nor do believe he is
 influenced by the increased value
 attached to his corncr lots
 because of the passage of
 these public measures But I
 do think that he Sion
 of the Hannibal and St
 Joseph railroad It is a
 separate raili oad under a
 separate charter and owned by
 a separate company Mr PARROTT
 Mr Speaker 1 am very
 much surprised that my friend
 from Pennsyl vanitt after I
 have corrected him should still
 persist in the erroneous declaration
 that the bill now pending
 before the House could give
 to the Leavenworth interest a
 double share of the pub
 lic lands I Chink my
 explanation was patent to the
 comprehension of other persons if
 not to his own that
 this bill does not give
 to a railroad com pan
 y any of the Delaware
 lands at all where the
 gentleman says that it gives
 them fourteen miles upon each
 side of the road I
 say now that it does
 not give them a single
 foot of this land Why
 Because the bill confines the
 lands appropriated to railroad purposes
 to such lands as the
 United States own It must
 be obvious from the very
 nature of the case that
 the United States can ap
 propriato no lands for railroad
 or other purposes which do
 not belong to the United
 States and the Delaware Indian
 reservation on which the gentle
 man from Pennsylvania has arrain
 asserted that seven miles uponeach
 side of the road will
 be given to a railroad
 company belongs to the Indians
 and cannot be infringed upon
 except by some treaty regulation
 Now what are tbc facts
 i hc facts are that
 a treaty has been ratified
 IJY tbc Senate by which
 a certain incorporated railroad com
 pan y in the I
 cn itory of Kansas shall
 have the privilege the exclusive
 privilege of buying of these
 Delaware Indians a certain designated
 quan tity of their lands
 at an appraiscd valuation That
 appraisement is now about beinrr
 made and will be submitted
 to the Indian or rather
 to t E lC Inte
 rior Department of the Government
 and if rati lied the
 company then will have the
 option of taking the lands
 at that appraisement or of
 dc clining to take them
 But it is obvious sir
 t in cither event this
 bill docs not o ive
 to the rail road cornpany
 any of this land whatever
 If they take it they
 pay fbr it and if
 they do not pay for
 it they do not get
 it Now sir ask what
 becomes of the assertion ought
 at least to bd charitable
 to others and that of
 the gentleman from Pennsvlvania I
 l rcslnne ho ought not
 to impute motives which he
 would i that he is
 a disintcrcsted man although the
 facts do not look exactly
 that way for it håppcns
 that not desire to have
 imputed to himself As an
 additional reason why this bill
 should the gentleman hås placed
 himself in an attitude be
 referred back to the Committee
 on Public that looks at
 least very suspicious on this
 qncs Lands wish to remind
 thc I louse chat the
 ccnnw lion of railroads having
 acted upon the Comniit rnittec
 tun eed to report the
 bill last session Since tee
 on Public Lands at the
 last session of Con t
 hcn in the morit h
 of October last a railroad
 gross and tho vacation of
 Congress eon vention of thc
 pcople of the rperr itot
 y of Ran before any
 bill had been franked visited
 thc Ter of Kansas and
 acquired an interest in cer
 sas was held at l
 opeka All the counties which
 are orffanized I believe were
 represented And tain points there
 and then come back at
 the short they there a
 rreed on a sched ule
 roads to which I his
 fore this assertion with other
 assertions to the they would
 ask Congress to lands schedule
 is very from bill before
 us unreasoning fanaticisrn which we
 all know is in think
 thc people of Kansas should
 be heard spircd by local
 interests The gentleman may not
 The y know best what
 roads the pu welfare re
 be conscious of it I
 do not say that he
 is but he quires And
 when the c otnrnittee havo
 t his mat has indulged
 in so Inany and such
 great errors that I am
 bound to believe in charity
 that he is ter befbre
 tl lmn again they can
 consider tl is rne inorial
 of the railroad convent if
 n r I he yoice
 of misled by his prejudice
 and is not under the
 con seventy thousand people is
 entitlcd to a respect I
 trol ofa calm rcason in
 using these expfessions grants for
 this purpose The other convention
 indorsed this bill I state
 now Mr Speaker as a
 matter that ought to weigh
 with members in considering this
 ques tion that no protest
 against this bill has been
 placed in my hands no
 memorial has been for warded
 to me and I state
 further that consider ing generally
 the interests of the people
 consider ing the great advantages
 which the present passao e
 of this bill would afford
 to them I deem it
 to be just to the
 whole interests of the Territory
 that the bill in its
 pcesent shape should pass rather
 than that this session should
 close xvithout the passage of
 any bill whatever In regard
 to the argument submitted to
 tho House by my friend
 from St Joseph with his
 charactcr eal and fervor for
 St Joseph I have only
 thi to say that two
 rival points on the Missouri
 river in Kansas pressing for
 the eastern terminus of a
 t ailroad were unable to
 agree The commit tce could
 not decide between Atchison and
 Elw ood They offered to
 give to ca ch of
 thcsc places a branch both
 branches to unite in a
 common trunk and then pursue
 the way harmoniously to tho
 west ern terminus With that
 sort of selfish feeling and
 I do not say it
 in any offbnsive sense which
 characterizes rival towns they mutually
 declined the proposition and then
 the committee for the purpose
 of settling this point of
 rivalry between these two towns
 determined to refer the question
 to the Kansas Legislature where
 in my judgruent it rightfully
 belones It is true that
 Missouri has built railroads to
 her vv estcrn border but
 it is likewise true that
 she built them with no
 intention to benefit the people
 of the Territory They have
 been built there because it
 was the interest of Missouri
 that they should be built
 there They were built or
 projected long before the Territory
 was orcyanized long before the
 routes of trade and travel
 in thc Territory had been
 marked out and simply on
 the consideration that it was
 for the advantage and interest
 of the State of Missouri
 so to build it Mr
 CRAIG of Missouri TYVill not
 the correct tho staternent which
 he has just made that
 those roads were built or
 projected be forc the routes
 of trade and travel in
 the Territory had boen marked

 deem it a fair proposition
 to all parties concerned that

 questions where its citizens or

 just and fair betwccn all

 have reforej lcc to the
 Legislature as the final arbiter
 The disputed question should be
 referred to the highest representative
 body of the people the
 Legislature of the future State
 That proposition seems to me
 to bc a fair one
 It seems to mc to
 be the only one by
 which this question can be
 fairly and equitably adjustcd forl
 am cer tain that if

 DAVIS of Indiana 1 believe
 now Mr be entirely impartial
 owning nothing in any of
 the points in controversy I
 try to speak all Speaker
 that I have the floor
 and I desire to ask
 the people Mr MONTGOMERY Docs
 not the man ox vn
 corner lots in Leavenworth Mr
 PARROTT 1 decline to yield
 to I say that this
 bill tleman from Pennsylvania makes
 a fair and equitable location
 of the through routes in
 the Territory One thing more
 The policy of granting lands
 to aid in the construction
 of railroads is now I
 think about twenty years old
 Almost every new State in
 the Union has been thus
 benefited in the outset of
 its career as a State
 The development of the country
 is thus secured And besides
 it rnust be understood Mr
 Speaker that the Government does
 not give these lands t
 o States or Territories as
 a gratuity J here are
 two considerations in the matter
 One of them is the
 fact that t he Government
 requires double the amount to
 be paid for the alternate
 sections so that it receives
 as much for half the
 land as it would otherwise
 have received for the whole
 The second consideration is that
 Con rress requires the State
 receiving these grants to relinquish
 her power of taxation over
 the public lands I admit
 that this is a doubtful
 power but nowadays When the
 decision of the Dred Scott
 case is considered as good
 authority by my Dom ocratic
 friends I must say that
 the posver of a Stato
 to tax the public lands
 is afiirlned in that decision
 It is important therefore when
 you come to consider the
 subject in an economical point
 of view that the Slates
 should surrender such power whether
 the power bc certain or
 whether it be doubtful Ellherefore
 it is a consid cration
 operatincron the minds of Representatives
 in making these donations of
 land which cost nothing which
 take nothing fron l the
 gross stun what is the
 question before the House i
 tleman from Pennsylvania Mr MONTGOMERY
 that the bill be recommitted
 to the Committee on Public
 Lands Mr DAVIS of Indiana
 well sir 1 yester day
 offered an amendment which is
 now pond ing and upon
 which I desire to be
 heard by the House The
 SPEAKER The question is open
 to de bate as the
 Chair understands Mr VANDEVER 1
 would suggest that if the
 I louse declines to recommit
 the bill to the Committee
 on Public Lands it will
 then be in order for
 tho gentleman from Indiana to
 explain his amendrneut The SPEAKER
 The Chair has decided that
 the bill is now open
 to debate Mr VANDEVER 1
 called the previousques tion upon
 the motion to recommit The
 SPEAKER The Chair had given
 the floor to the gentleman
 from Indiana before the gentleman
 from Iowa called the previous
 question The gentleman from Ind
 iana is entitled to the
 floor Mr DAVIS of Indiana
 1 ask the to read
 my amendinent The Clerk read
 tho amendment It adds a
 pro vision to the bill
 that there bc granted to
 the l er ritory or
 future State of Nebraska alternate
 scc tions of the public
 lands to the same extent
 and in the same manner
 and upon the same tcrms
 conditions and limitations in every
 respect what ever as is
 by the preceding sections of
 the bill granted to the
 Territory of Kansas to aid
 in the construction of the
 following railroads a railroad from
 sonac eligiblc point on the
 west bank of the received
 and which at tbc same
 time inauce Missouri n ver
 north of the mouth of
 the Platte the States to
 surrender a power which if
 exer cised would fall heavily
 on the revenues of the
 I hope now Mr Speaker
 that Unit od Statcs other
 States which have been for
 twenty years sitting and feasting
 at the table and have
 got all they want in
 the M ray of appropriations
 for pub lic lands are
 not about to set a
 selfish and in my judgment
 pusillanililous example of kicking the
 table over because they got
 cnough i I hopc this
 policy will still receive the
 assent of members of tho
 House of Representatives and that
 the in its present shape
 shall be passed by the
 House Mr VANDEVER 1 ask
 the gentleman Kansas to yield
 to mc for a momel
 lt Mr PARROTT Certainly I
 pronosc to terminate Mr VANDEVER
 this discussion but before doing
 that I simply desire to
 make the stiff yost ion
 that at an ilnport ant
 crisis likc the present when
 matters of great moment are
 pressing upon us for oar
 considera tion it does not
 become bers of the Ameri
 can Congress to sit here
 and wrangle about the startino
 point of a railroad A
 controversy OL this kind onght
 to be settled in five
 minutes time think fro ku
 all that has transpired that
 the truth of theqdeclaration which
 I made in the outset
 is namely that the action
 of the com establi c
 mitteeil cgard to this matter
 has been incumbellt on them
 by reason of these conflicting
 interests in town lots on
 the banks of the Missouri
 river The committee are totally
 indifferent to these rival river
 so as to connect as
 nearly as practicable with the
 Mississippi and Missouri river railroad
 thence into and along the
 valley of said Platte river
 via New Fort Kearny to
 t he western bound ary
 of said Territory a railroad
 from some cligible point on
 the Missouri river so as
 to ccm nect as ncarly
 as practicable with the Burlington
 and Missouri river railroad thence
 westwardly to intersect the above
 named road ator near New
 Fort Kearny a railroad from
 some cligible point on the
 west bank of the Missouri
 river so as to connect
 as nearly as practicable with
 what ever railroad having a
 n rant of lands from
 the Government of the United
 States rnay be located th
 rough the State of Iowa
 terminatincr on the near the
 par river at or allel
 of north latitude in a
 southwesterly course to intersect the
 first named road at or
 near the Loupe Fork river
 and a railroad from some
 i eligible point on the
 Missouri river at or near
 the mouth of the Sioux
 river so as to connect
 as nearly as practicable with
 the Dubuque and Sioux thence
 to and up and along
 the City railroad Nebraska river
 or any other eligible routc
 to intersect with the first
 named road at or near
 Fort Laramie Mr SMITH of
 Virginia With the permis Sion
 of the gentleman from Indiana
 I desire to ask the
 Delegate from Kansas a question
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana I
 will yield for that pu
 rposc Mr SMITH of Virginia
 1 desire to know from
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania if
 he did resenting the Tetritory
 Kansas but nevertheless answer the
 gentleman s question am interested
 in the city of Leavenworth
 0 the extent of two
 lots which are not valuable
 and which I will be
 glad to dispose of td
 the gen tlemai at a
 good deal less Ithan they
 cost ears amo One word
 more I desire to say
 thät I am not actuated
 in my advocacy of this
 bill by any property interest
 which I possess in the
 city of Leavenworth oruin the
 Territory of sas Any such
 interest which I haie is
 hardly large enough to be
 worth influencing my opinion upon
 any question much less upon
 a question Of so much
 magnitude and importaupe as the
 one involved in this bill
 Mr MONTGOMERY One word more
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana I
 cannot yield fur I intend
 to detain the House but
 a moa ment Before I
 proceed with an explanation of
 my amendment I shall make
 one remark in reply to
 the gentleman from Pennsylvania who
 as I understood him intimated
 that the course pursl ted
 by thc Comrnittee on Public
 Lands had been changed by
 the operation of outside inflqa
 ence Mr MONTGOMERY 1 beg
 the I made no such
 allusion do not be pardon
 lieve the committee have been
 influenced by nny such cause
 The remark to which the
 gentleman refers fell I think
 from the gentleman from Mis
 souri Mr CRAIG I repudiate
 the charge I care not
 what outside influence may be
 brought to bear it would
 not swerve me for a
 moment nor do i believe
 it would swerve any member
 of the cmnmittee from the
 course he deemed proper to
 pursue A messao o was
 received from the Senate by
 Mr HycRF v their Chief
 Clerks informing the House that
 the Senate had agreed to
 the amend ment of this
 House to the second amendment
 of the Sanate to the
 bill of the House authorizing
 the issuing of llreasury notes
 and for other pur poses
 Mr DAVIS of Indiana I
 am very glad to learn
 that I vas mistaken in
 asci ibing the remark to
 which I alluded to the
 gentleman from Penn sylvania I
 accept his disclaimer with pleasure
 Mr Speaker I have presented
 an mnendrnent to this bill
 By the order and direction
 of the Come mittee on
 Public Lands It proposes to
 grant to the rrerritory of
 Nebraska alternate sections of the
 public lands for the purpose
 of constructing four railroads the
 main trunk road commencin at
 Omaha City or some other
 point on the West II
 bank of the 1Missouri river
 and running up along the
 line of the Platte river
 to the western bound I
 ary of the Territory of
 Ncbraska The other three roads
 are each to conunence at
 sorne eligible point on the
 western bank of the Nlissouri
 river and connect with the
 main trunk railroad at some
 point between the Missouri river
 and its tcrm inus on
 the western boundary of the
 Terri to_ry There is no
 controversv of interest in the
 Terri tory of Nebraska as
 to the roads it is
 proposed to aid in that
 Territory there is perfect unanimity
 and good feeling there no
 conflict whatever I r I
 hese roads are each one
 of them to connect with
 roads now in process of
 construction westerly through the State
 of Iowa In reference to
 a Pacific railroad which has
 several times been mentioned in
 connection with this bill I
 will say that I believe
 no simple bill claims and
 if they could have avoided
 thein by fixing the starting
 point at a distance from
 any of not ask the
 gentleman from Kansas whether 01
 for the construction of a
 railroad to the Pacific not
 lie owned or had an
 interest in corner lots in
 can ever be passed by
 this House and this Con
 them i believe they wouid
 have gladly recom t gress
 and I believe that the
 only way by which the
 city of Leavenworth mended such
 a course to thc House
 ihe Atlantic and western States
 will bc ever con The
 proposition of the gentleman from
 Penn 4i Mr MONTGOMERY 1
 did nected with the Pacific
 coast by railroad will be
 did not hear an sylvania
 is to refer this bill
 back to the Commit i
 Mr SiMlTI I of Virginia
 tee on Public Lands there
 to have this contro answer
 to that question and I
 now desire to by granting
 land in limited quantities by
 grant ing land in alternate
 secticnos to tho Territories versy
 revived No good can be
 accomplished by repeat the interrogatory
 the gentleman such a proceeding
 The bill is now before
 the from Kansas does not
 own corner lots in the
 city to construct link by
 link such a road as
 the wants of thc country
 through which it is to
 pass Elouse and propose that
 the House shall itself of
 Leavenworth in tbe Territory of
 Kansas require In this way
 and in this way alone
 this If the House is
 disposed Mr PARROTT I have
 no corner lots in settle
 this controversy great thoroughfare will
 be constructed until the to
 vote favorably on this proposition
 to appropri Leavenworth or any
 city in Kansas that I
 know of last link in
 the chain has been completed
 ate lands to aid I
 believe in the construction of
 i Nfr SN IITH of
 Virginia My object in ask
 a great Pacific railroad across
 this continent on ing the
 question was to show that
 the gentlemen As an original
 question I would not perhaps
 who takc so much interest
 in the location of those
 be in favor of granting
 the lands of the Govcrn
 such plan as shall obviate
 the necessity of appro priating
 money fi om the public
 Treasury let roads are more
 or lese affected by them
 in their them pass this
 bill noW I hope Mr
 Speaker personal interests that the
 motion of the gentleman from
 Mr MONTGOMERY to ask vania
 will not prevail to refer
 the matter back to II
 t leman from Kansas whether
 hc is not interested the
 Committee on Public Lands but
 that the in tho city
 of Leavenworth or thecontiguous coun
 House will act upon the
 matter now simply I try

 Now sir it is respectfully
 submitted to the consideration of
 Congress whether Kansas and Nebraska
 ought not in justice to
 be placed on an equal
 footing with other States and
 Territories in relation to their
 intcrnal improvements bv grants of
 the public lands in accordance
 vith the long I think
 established practice of the Government
 that they ought This having
 become the settled policy of
 the Government my own opinion
 is that It would be
 illiberal unfair and unjust to
 the new Territories to refuse
 to grant them what we
 have granted to all the
 other new land States and
 Territories of the United States
 There is no reason why
 the Territories of Nebraska and
 Kansas should not have railroad
 grants to the same extent
 as Iowa and Wisconsin and
 the other II goes annually
 into the treasury of the
 State am informed that it
 amounted during the last year
 to between one hundred and
 fifty and two hun dred
 thousand dollars enough sir to
 pay the whole State expenses
 if managed economically Mr Speaker
 I do notintend to detain
 the House much longer Every
 gentleman here who has been
 a member of this House
 for a number of I
 years fully understands this proposition
 and is I desire the
 vote to be taken ready
 to vote on it to
 day I trust that the
 House will not recommit this
 bill to the Committee on
 Public Lands We have had
 these bills before us for
 the past four years and
 if gentlemen wait for conflicting
 and contending interests to settle
 thcsc questions they will have
 to wait until doomsday before
 that is If this bill
 were recommitted to the Com
 done mittee on Public Lands
 the probability is I think
 I may say that the
 certainty is that no change
 would be made by that
 committee I therefore ask the
 House not to recommit this
 bill which grants lands to
 the Terri tory of Kansas
 for railroad purposes Let us
 vote on it now I
 know not what may be
 the temper of this House
 in reference togranting landsfor railroad
 purposes and I care I
 am here to discharge my
 duty not what it is
 as a member of the
 Committee on Public Lands and
 as a member of this
 House As a member of
 the committee I have already
 discharged my duty and I
 now desire to discharge my
 duty as a member of
 this House I am ready
 to take the vote and
 I call the previous question
 The SPEAKER The first question
 will be on recommitting the
 bill to the Committee on
 Public Lands Mr SMITH of
 Virginia If the call for
 thc north western States Mr
 Speaker these reasons have induced
 me to previous question be
 seconded will it apply to
 favor this proposition Ever since
 I havc becn the whole
 bill a member of this
 House I have uniformly given
 The SPEAKER It will my
 vote in favor of liberal
 grants of the public II
 Mr SMITH of Virginia I
 hope then that it will
 be voted lown lands for
 the purposes of internal improvement
 After you go onc hundred
 miles west of the Mis
 Mr MONTGOMERY I ask the
 gentleman souri river these lands
 in Nebraska as they now
 to withdraw the calk for
 the previous question for ordered
 at the last session or
 Congress to continue that arrangement
 make it rny duty to
 connnunicate the facts to the
 House of Representatives and to
 respectfully request its direction as
 to the printing of the
 present session a con siderable
 portion of which is now
 in this office the imme
 diate colnpletion of which is
 urgently required by the exi
 gencies of the public servrce
 The reasons of Messrs Larcombe
 English for the course they
 have pursucd are assigned in
 the accompany ing letter It
 is but justice to them
 to state that the work
 intrusted to them heretofore by
 this odice has been exe
 cuted promptly and satisfactorily In
 this connection I deem it
 proper to state that in
 pur suance of the provisions
 of the joint resolution in
 relation to the public printing
 approved June 23 1860 I
 have en tered into a
 contract with Mr Joseph T
 Crowell for the purchase of
 the printing establishment formerly owned
 by 10 the Joint Committec
 on tbe Public printing Should
 it neet their approval the
 entire printing and binding of
 all the branches of Government
 or any portion thereof can
 at once be executed under
 its own control and by
 its own otficers The expediency
 and propriety ot such a
 policy I have hereto orc
 strongly advocated and recent experience
 has but strengthened my convictions
 upon the subject I have
 the honor to be very

 WASHINGTON D C December 8
 1860 SIR Having executed the
 printing of the House of
 Rep resentatives for thc first
 session of the Thirty Sixth
 Con gress under a contract
 or partnership with Thomas II
 Ford House Printer and as
 we trust and believe to
 your entire satisfaction we deelll
 it due to you to
 inform you that we cannot
 any longer continue our contract
 with the House Printer The
 reason for taking this step
 lies in the fact that
 Con gregs at the last
 session reduced the prices to
 be paid för the printing
 forty per cent below the
 prices paid at the tune
 we made our contract with
 the present House Printer leaving
 barely enough as ve believe
 to pay the actual cost
 of t hc work While
 thcrefore we would be willing
 to execute tho printing ihr
 the House of Representatives directly
 for the prices now allowed
 by law e cannot consent
 to do it for any
 intermediate party We arc anxious
 to keep our office employed
 our rela tions to those
 who constitute tbc establishment ilnpcl

 work sve can but it
 could not bc expected of

 a sacrifice VVe are very

 to make an explanation JOHN
 HEART Esq Superintendent of Public
 Printing be sold by the
 Government but by making this
 little grant the purpose of
 constructing this great national thoroughfare
 which is to unite the
 Atlantic and the Pacific slopes
 you will make the lands
 on each side of thc

 be brought into market and
 the alternate gcotions reserved to
 the Government will sell at
 If it were tho increased
 price of 2 50 per
 acre not for the construction
 of lhc road the lands
 would remain for long years
 unsold and totally worthless to
 the Government I take it
 forgt antcd that the Govcrnmcnt
 makes money by this opcr
 I can give an illustration
 in the case of ation
 Illinois The State of Illinois
 has sold tnillions Mt DAVIS
 of Indiana I would be
 glad to The resolution vvas

 and the tellers reported had
 been innarket unsold for thirty
 years before the grant was
 made He will correct me
 if I am mistaken when
 I state that under the
 grant made to his State
 have been constructed nearly eight
 hundred miles of railroad They
 havc consn ucted railroads through
 prairies where the lands would
 not have been sold for
 fifty ycars if they had
 not been constructed Every acre

 told that those very lands

 to twenty dollars an acre
 I can cive an illustration
 from my own State Many
 years ago the Con gress
 of the United States granted
 one million six hundred thousand
 acres of the public land
 for the purpose of constructing
 the Wabash and Eric canal
 by which grant that canal
 was constructed and it is

 the sarne PUBLIC PIIINTING AGAIN
 Mr HASKIN It will be
 seen that the lution proposed
 by the committee provides that
 the Superin tenden t of
 Pu blic Printing who under
 the law creating his offc
 c is the officer contem
 plated to do thc thing
 where neglecÆ takes place upon
 the part of the Printer
 of he House shall proceed
 to see that the printinc
 y required by the law
 niaking power of this Government
 shall be forthwith attended to
 Inasmuch as it has been
 stated by the friends of
 Mr Ford the Printer of
 the House that he is
 absent and is detained in
 consequence of illness the resolution
 which the Committee on Printing
 at one time thou fllt
 of declaring his offce vacant
 has not proposing been subrnitted
 to the consideration of the
 House The exicrencv of the
 printin requires that prompt action
 should be had and the
 committee deemed that the resolution
 which has been reported from
 the committcc is all suff
 cicnt to have the matter
 promptly attended to I call
 the previous question upon the
 passage of the resolution Mr
 McCLERNAND 1 hope the gentleman
 will not call the previous
 question Mr BURNETT 1 ask
 the House to vote 1860
 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE 93 down
 the previous question if the
 gentleman I that sale has
 been consummated by the Superin
 away and this House is
 asked under these dir tendent
 of Public Printing and ratified
 as far as cumstances to
 place in the hands of
 his süb cori insists upon
 it Mr HASKIN I have
 no disposition to cut it
 can be by the action
 of the Committee on off
 debate and I waive the
 previous question for I Printing
 for the two Houses of
 Congress 1 like the gentleman
 from Illinois understand that the
 the present Mr McCLERNAND If
 I understand the price paid
 or agreed to be paid
 by the Govern report of
 the committee the communications ac
 ment for that printing establishment
 is 135 000 companying the
 resolution and the explanation il
 I am also informed that
 that office was offered by
 made by the gentleman from
 New York the res responsible
 parties in this city 80
 000 I am olution proceeds
 upon the assumption that Mr
 li also informed that it
 is not in deed and
 in truth worth more than
 40 000 and that the
 materials Ford the Public Prmter
 of the House is not
 here the printing presses the
 type and the fixtures and
 will not resume the performance
 of his duties as Printer
 of this body If that
 assumption is i belonging to
 that printing establishmentare totally unfounded
 of course the resolution ought
 not to unsuited and unfit
 for the purposes for which
 they If that have been
 purchased by the Government pass
 As to the point whether
 that assumption ts true I
 understand that Mr Ford is
 detained office is not worth
 Inore t han 40 000
 it is to me surprising
 passing strange that it should
 have from the city by
 sickness that he will however
 be in this city on
 or before Saturday next pre
 li been purchased with such
 hot haste And now pared
 to perform his duties as
 Public Printer of I we
 are called upon to authorize
 the Superintend this body There
 is therefore no necessity for
 the adopt ion of the
 resolution at present if ihere
 should be any for its
 adoption hereafter Such public printing
 as is indispensable for the
 House now being executed as
 I understand by Mr Bowman
 the Printer of the Senate
 Heisable not only to execute
 all printing which is necessary
 to the current proceedings of
 the Hot tse but he
 is prepared to do any
 additional printing which is required
 until we have more light
 upon this I do not
 know whether or not this
 proposition ent of Public Printing
 to go on and let
 out the printing for this
 House by contract without first
 I declaring the ofiice of
 Printer of the House va
 cant Sir I do not
 understand this thing It it
 may be all honest it
 may be may bc all
 fair all right but from
 the information I have received
 I have my suspicions and
 hence I intend to offer
 a resolution by which we
 will be enabled to in
 vestigate and if possible probe
 this rnatter to its I
 want to know why it
 is that the very bottom
 Government is to pay 135
 000 for a printing cs
 tablishment which in reality is
 only worth 40 000 is
 part and parcel of the
 sale and purchase of the
 and which has been offered
 for 80 000 estabiishment0fMr Wendell
 1 understand that II Mr
 McCLERNAND With the permission of
 my friend from Kentucky I
 will state that the Superintendent
 of Public Printing has pur
 the agent of Mr Ford
 has this moment placed in
 chased the establishment of Mr
 Wendell at the my hand
 a dispatch to the following
 effect price of 135 000
 although the same establish ment
 I am informed was offered
 for sale last s I
 hope to be ablc to
 reach there meaning Washington on
 Saturday year for 80 000
 and when in fact it
 is not worth 40 000
 The materials as i understand
 are That dispatch has been
 placed in my hands by
 worn out the building is
 not fire proof and the
 the agent o Mr Ford
 who also informs me machinery
 is not of the most
 improved kind h that lie
 has made temporary arrangements for
 House Printer to enable him
 to come here and tractors
 greater advantagis than they would
 have under the terms of
 their contract Let them be
 made to comply with their
 contract with the House Printer
 It he can make them
 do it 4nd if not
 then it will be for
 us to provide some other
 way of having the printing
 done After the 4th of
 March next under a law
 which Congress passed last session
 the Government iB to do
 its own printing Now I
 am opposed to making any
 change between this time and
 that unless you repeal that
 portion of the act which
 fixes the 4th of March
 If it will be right
 for the Government to do
 its own printing then and
 we find Ourselves unable to
 get the work done now
 let us begin now to
 have the printing done by
 the Governiüent YVhat objection is
 there to starting it now
 if it is necessary to
 make a chay cre instead
 of throwing the whole burden
 and trouble and expense upon
 the Housc Printer to the
 ad vantage of his sub
 contractors I can see no
 justice in that way of
 doing business or in that
 way of treating the employés
 of the Government Mr STANTON
 Mr Speakcr the gentleman who
 represents the Committee on Printing
 pro poscs in consequence of
 the absence of the House
 Printer and out of consideration
 for him not to move
 a resolution declaring the omce
 vacant but he does move
 a resolution which takes from
 him until the expiration of
 his term every particle of
 the work which he is
 entitled by law to do
 The effect of his resolution
 is either to deprive the
 House Printer of his office
 entirely or to subject thc
 Government to action by him
 for damages in consequence of
 their handing over the work
 to some other parties Now
 sir if there is to
 be any change made there
 is certainly no reason why
 a day may not be
 given in consequence cf the
 sickness of the such as
 is now required to execute
 successfully the printing of the
 House until Mr Ford arrives
 the printing of the House
 I hope this resolution will
 not be adopted upon Speaker
 that I would lilce the
 gentleman who represents the Committee
 on Printing to tell us
 the assumption that Mr Ford
 will not he here and
 that ho is incapable of
 doing the printing of and
 that is why in his
 great anxiety for a re
 the House A few days
 will enlighten us upon duction
 in the cost of the
 public printing und in that
 point Why should we forestall
 him by this vhicil I
 agreed with him and for
 which I voted he did
 not also include the binding
 of this House summary process
 For whose benefit and for
 I desire to know why
 it is that there is
 no reduc whose good when
 the Printer of the Senate
 is willing to supply his
 place for the present and
 is tion made upon that
 branch of the work done
 for I want to know
 how it happens if this
 capable of doing all necessary
 work MI BURNÉ I T
 I had almost determined we
 arc to have a nyammoth
 printing establish that I never
 would again indulge iri any
 discus ment and the work
 is to be done by
 hc Govern Sion connected with
 the subject of the public
 ment directly his resolution not
 broad enough to cover the
 binding also and have all
 the work printing from the
 fact that it is almost
 impossi ble for any member
 of this House to cet
 a full done by agents
 of the Government who will
 be put this matter upon
 a proper footing falling in
 with the views of the
 Superintendent of Public Printinff ao
 ree very readily that they
 Will not consent to do
 this printing any longer under
 the contract they made with
 our Printer but the are
 now doing the printing in
 Mr Wendell s printing offcc
 and whencvcr they are relieved
 from the obligations of their
 contract with the House Printer
 thcn the Superintendent of Pub
 lic Printing in behalf of
 the House is to enter
 into a contract with the
 same parties authorizinx them to
 do the printino upon better
 terms that is to cyct
 the whole price of the
 printing a portion of which
 now goes to the House
 Printer Unques tionably they will
 not do the printing any
 longer I under their contract
 with the House Printer if
 the responsible to it for
 their action and conduct undcrstanding
 of the mode of operation
 by which I House will
 relieve them from it and
 give them the the print
 iil l is donc the
 manner in which it is
 Now sir I want to
 amend that resolution X vant
 to providc that the binding
 of this House II same
 work at a higher price
 And that is just Ict
 out at cach Congress and
 the parties inter I had
 no agency in the election
 of shall also be let
 out by the Superintendent of
 Pub the question which the
 House have to consider ested
 in it I had lic
 Printing that he shall make
 a contract and whethertheywillnowrelieveMcssrs Larcombe
 Mr Ford as Public Printer
 of this House no ao
 oncy in fastening him upon
 this House as let that
 out also and have it
 done directly and ils ofiiceu
 to do its printing Gentlemen
 upon before I take rny

 If there has offered this
 resolution desires to take the
 floor I that side of
 the House elected him shall
 Niove to postpone the whole
 subject until been anv neg
 ect upon his partin doing
 thc print ing of the
 I louse and the public
 service has been next Tuesday
 Mr GROW 1 hope as
 the asked they are responsible
 But sir I injured by
 it tun astonished that tho
 gentleman who represents us to
 vote lown the previous question
 he will the Committee on
 on this occasion should not
 offer a resolution here declaring
 the omce vacant when hc
 must know that if we
 authorize the Supcrintendent of Pablic
 Printinq to let out that
 work bv contract Mr Ford
 would be entit ed to
 and could claim it unless
 his office is declared vaca_nt
 and I arn opposed to
 his rcs olution for that
 reason But sir am opposed
 to it for the further
 rea son that there is
 no nncossity for the resonztion
 Tl hi s Printer Governor
 Ford we arc informed by
 the gentleman from Illinois NIi
 MCCLERNAND will be here in
 a few days Why then
 should we pass this resolution
 when the Printer for t
 House will be here in
 person so soon and we
 or learn can then culler
 declare his office va cant
 from him the reasons why
 he does not perform his
 duties The gentleman from Illinois
 aske i question that I
 would like to have answered
 and that is whether this
 is part CLüd of t
 hc programny that was carried
 out at the last session
 _3f Con gress and vv
 hich was f icn denounced
 as a move ment for
 the purpose of enabling Cornelius
 W cn i not cut
 off debate now Mr BURNETT
 1 will not do it
 but 1 offer the an
 cndment which have indicated and
 which tho can put in
 proper shape Mr GROV I
 Mr Speaker I have but
 aword It seems from the
 to say upon this proposition
 papers which havc been read
 at the Clerk s desk
 that Messrs Larcombe English made
 a con tract with the
 Hot ese Printer to do
 this work English from thcircontractwith
 the House Printer f give
 to them the price which
 the law gives to the
 Printer and deprive him of
 any portion of t hc
 profits of the work That
 is the whole questiön whether
 the House will deprive bim
 of any chance to do
 the work himsclf and takc
 the legitimate profits of the
 work or get somebody else
 to do it leaving him
 some rnarrrin of profit which
 will I enable him to
 realize something from his offce
 it is premature to take
 In my judgment sir action
 on a rcsolution of this
 sort at this time and
 I thcreforc move to postpone
 its further consid oration until
 Monday next Mr HASKIN obtained
 the floor l NiBLACK 1
 would like to ask from
 New York one question before
 he Thev now refuse to

 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE December 13
 ago whén the consular and
 diplomatic bill came the omces
 of both House Printer and
 Senate Sion ab out it
 postpone it I iherefore call
 the up for consideration objection
 was made to its I
 Printer vacant But we must
 meet this case as previous
 question MI STANTON I move
 to postpone the it presents
 itself to the House and
 that is by di consideration
 because Che bill was not
 printed recting the Superintendent to
 contrict to havc the arid
 the statement was then made
 by the chair nnan Of
 the Committee of Ways and
 Means that work done so
 that we may proceed with
 our it was not printed
 because the Printer 0 the
 business House was absent fronr
 the city and because the
 I Gentlemen ask fora postponement
 of this prop persons heretofore
 in the habit of doing
 the print tng refused to
 do it Mr MAYNARD Will
 the gentleman from New York
 allow me to make an
 inquiry I un derstood him
 to say on a previous
 occasion that the House Printer
 had transferred this work to
 Laroombe English giving them eighty
 per cent on the prices
 paid i will now refer
 the House to the proviso
 to the second section of
 the bill chapter eight y
 rof the acts of last
 session of Con gre Ss
 and I ask the gcntleman
 whether the atten tion of
 the Committee on Public Printing
 has been called to that
 proviso Mr HASKIN If the
 gentleman from Ten nessee will
 permit me I des irc
 briefly to reply to the
 remarks of the gentleman from
 Kentucky Mr BURNETT especially and
 also to the remarks ofthe
 gentleman from Pennsylvania Mr GRow
 and 1 intend covering that
 qucstion Mr MAYNARD verj well
 sir Mr HASKIN The from
 Ken tucky Mr BURNETT stated
 that the office of Public
 Printer was vacant i have
 my doubts as to whetherhe
 is not correct in that
 statement but a é far
 as Mr BURNETT The member
 from New York is mistaken
 I did not state that
 the office was vacant but
 I stated that the eflöct
 of the res olution would
 be to declare indirectly the
 office vacant and that by
 not doing so directly the
 Public Printer would bo entitled
 to claim com pcnsation provided
 he would bc able to
 show that hc was ready
 to do the work Mr
 HASKIN In reply to of
 the gevltkcnnan remarks peril it
 me to call the atten
 osition until Monday WV e
 may to day have ob
 iections raised to the consideration
 of sqme bill before the
 House because it is not
 printed there be an effort
 on the part of General
 Bowman the Senate Printer to
 do the House printing at
 the reduction made at last
 session of Congress I know
 that he is now doino
 the I am glad of
 it work ordered by the
 Senate at thc reduced rates
 I know that the House
 printing can also be done
 at the reduced rates But
 in regard to the con
 tract entered into by Larcombe
 English by which they were
 to give Ford twenty per
 cent of the price paid
 if they were to do
 the x vork at the
 reduced rates they would only
 be receiving forty instead of
 eighty per cent under the
 old rates al further consideration
 of the resolution until Tues
 Mr BURNETT 1 hope that
 motion will be i agreed
 to and upon it I
 call the previous question I
 Mr FLORENCE the demand for
 the previous question will be
 withdrawn for a mo desire
 to say that so far
 as my jüdgment ment is
 concerned The SPEAKER The Chair
 must remind the I gentleman
 from Pennsylvania that the previous
 question has been called Mr
 FLORENCE 1 appeal to the
 gentleman from Kentucky to withdraw
 it Mr BURNETT 1 will
 if it Mr FLORENCE Idesire
 that in my i judgment
 gentlemen have not looked at
 this ques tion practically H
 crc are facts suflicient l
 think to induce any gentleman
 who will examine them to
 concur with me that neithcr
 the Senate Printer to 10
 the work at that m
 ice nor can the I
 louse afford to enter into
 the wranglings and janglincrs between
 Public Printers and thosc who
 contract to do the work
 The way to meet the
 difficulty is to authorize the
 Superintendent of Pu blic Prin
 t ing to give out
 the work on contract as
 proposed by the resolution under
 consideration Now sir on the
 sut jcct of the purchase
 of the Wendell establishment I
 desire to inform the gentleman
 from Kentucky Mr BURNETT that
 the Joint Committee Public Printing
 consist ing of JEFFERSON DAYS
 Mr FITCH and N lr
 and Mr ANTHONY on the
 of the Senate I GURLEY
 and myself on the part
 of the House met yesterday
 on notification from the Senate
 com mittee and we did

 the approval l of the
 Secrctarv of the Interior inadc
 for the pur i hat
 cop _tion of tho House
 to the law creating the
 ofliee of ehase Of this
 establishrnent ibr 50 000 less
 than By that law tract
 is ill in y jüdgmel
 t Superintendent of Public Printing
 it is provided that w
 here the Public Printer n

 IVit w Ci i lects
 for sixty days to do
 tliC general w0rlc or dered
 by the House the Superintendent
 may II his verv r
 Govern niel t prin t
 ino lowed by the law
 of 1852 They cannot afford
 inasmuch he has been referred
 to in this debate nor
 the House Printer bas conformed
 to the law The law
 passed in the last Congress
 expressly provides that the printing
 of Congress shall not be
 underlet that it shall not
 be so sub contracted that
 the personal supervision of the
 Senate Printer or the Housc
 Printer shall be withdrawn from
 the execution of the work
 Now there is no gen
 tleman here who will maintain
 for a moment that the
 Senate Printer or the House
 Printer has either of them
 exercised that personal supervision over
 the Public Printing which the
 law contem In referencc to
 the particular claims these su
 ID contractors nuty have upon
 thcPrinters them selves I know
 nothing and care nolhing There
 is one question however which
 gentlemen upon this side of
 the I Tousc ought to
 look at The other side
 of the House are anxious
 to proceed with t he
 legitimate public business of the
 country other day we were
 prevented from passincy A II
 upon one of the appropriati01
 1 bills because it understood
 this morning had not been
 printed by the comrüQ1 lication
 the Superintendent o Printing that
 very little of the work
 ordered during thc 1 rcscnt
 session has yet been nrintcd
 and cannot be because the
 Printer olccted r l hat
 provis done at the prices
 allowed by law ion is
 designed to reach the large
 work ordered by tho I
 louse but not t he
 smaller matters MT BURN ETT
 The gentleman will permit if
 that lye the law ahe
 to ask him t his
 question and thc fact exists
 why does he want to
 have this resolution adopted Mr
 HASKIN I reply to the
 gentlernan that this provision of
 the law creating the office
 of Superintendent Of Publie Prinl
 ing applies to tbc large
 work ordet ed by the
 House and not to tbc
 bills and reports aud Journals
 which we require At least
 t hat is the in
 cvcry dny for our use
 terprctation wh ich the Superintendent
 of Public Printing Mr Ileart
 gives to it and it
 is on that account that
 he sent in tillis conn
 muucat on had applied to
 the general printing as the
 gen tleman says it does
 there would have been no
 necessity action bore it is
 under this prows ion of
 the law that we ask
 that the Superintend ent shall
 have the power which tllis
 resolution i or willi Ine
 at all All that I
 desire II to know frolü
 hirn s hat he means
 w hon hc proposes to
 give him says hc wants
 to cro into the investin

 sir on the subject of
 t hc ta catur of
 this II contract office At
 the last session of Congress
 the gen Mr HASKIN 1
 mean to say sir that
 I am tleman frorn Alabmna
 Mr CLOPTON in a re
 as well satisfied to have
 you the Gov port inade
 on the subject of the
 public printinc as I trust
 you offered a resolution Illat
 inasmuch as Mr Ford crnment

 over and over again that
 a proposition to fix the
 most of us certainly one
 which I should be willing
 day next A days ago
 when the considera to receive
 not for my service for
 few Inonllis tion of one
 of the appropriation bills was
 post I say that this
 amount poned because it was
 not printed I rnade an
 but for ruy whole lifé
 has been received by those
 rnen and in my opinion
 it is too much for
 any man to make in
 the pertörmance of a dut
 y in Nvhich he invests
 not one dollar in moncv
 or brains Now sir I
 merely desire to ask tho
 Housé as I have said
 to look practically at this
 matter The eximencv the situation
 in which we are placed
 is noi one which calls
 for the indulgence of any
 personal feelings The Committee on
 Pub lic Printing composed as
 the gentleman says of JEFFERSON
 DAT 1s Senator F and
 Senat or ANTHONY in thc
 Senate and of twogcntlemcn in
 this House to either of
 whom am willing to concede
 integrity and honesty of purpose
 in the exercise of tile
 functions properly devolving on them
 concluded to confirn t he
 contract en tered into for
 the purchase of ll is
 printing office 1 think the
 rnattcr of this purchase is
 entirely irre levant to the
 question under consideration and only
 refer to it because gellilemen
 have brought explanation and gave
 notice that I would at
 as early a day as
 possible submit from the Com
 mittee on Printino a proposition
 to remedy the existinr evil
 in reförence to the printing
 of this House 1 have
 fulfilled my promise and dis
 charged my duty to the
 House in submitting the resolution
 now under consideration 1 do
 not object to the postponement
 of the further consid oration
 of the resolution until Tuesday
 next I I demarld the
 yeas and nays on the
 motion to lay upon the
 tab le The yeas and
 nays were not ordered The
 question was then taken and
 the resolution was laid upon
 the table ADJOURNMENT OVER Mr
 GILMER rise to aprivileged question
 the House was acting on
 the motion that time to
 which the House shall stand
 adjourned tåkes precedence ofa motion
 to adjourn I make the
 point that the motion of
 the gentleman from North Carolina
 involving as it docs the
 ques tion of fixing the
 time to which this House
 shall stand adjourned takes precedence
 of a motion to adjourn
 and must be first acted
 upon Mr STANTON That is
 the made I ask the
 Clerk to read the paragraph
 on page 145 of the
 Manual which I have marked
 The Clerk read as follows
 The effect of the pendency
 of a motion to reconsider
 according to the universal usacxe
 is to suspend the origiugt
 proposition but where the term
 of the meniberS Ox pires
 svithout acting on the Inotion
 to reconsider the want of
 time or inclination the Inotion
 of coursc and leaves the
 original proposition operative Opinion of
 Mr Speaker Orr and also
 of Mt Speaker Banks in
 the case of a resolution
 directing tbc payment jf lhoney
 out of the cont ingent
 fund of the House where
 Congress adjourned sine die pending
 a motion to reconsider the
 vote by which it was
 adopted Mr STANTON 1 think
 it stands just as l
 clievc from information it in
 10 this debate obtained within
 a few rnornent s that
 the purchase which has been
 madc is a jü ucious
 one 1 understand it to
 have been approved by the
 and I willing Secretary of
 the In to accord to
 hitn and to the joint
 committee oi Congress the credit
 of having exercised a proper
 the contract and uu discretion
 rn willing further to confirm
 thcir judgment by my vote
 if it be necessary Gentlerncn
 have rc örred to the
 price paid for t hc
 building and said that it
 could have been purchased for
 lc ss Now in the
 first place I do not
 believe tho building was ever
 for and I do not
 believe it could be built
 and favn ished for 40
 000 more tha the Hence
 J think that the gentle
 prico paid for it man
 from Illinois had not that
 sort of which could justify
 him in making tho statexnelit
 which he did to day
 sc far as that is
 concerned however I only reför
 to it for thc purpose
 of show ino that we
 have not tho facts before
 us and that we are
 here biii dly 1k the
 gentlcrnan will Nir McCi ERiN
 A ND permit I iVili
 say t ha t perha
 ps n iade i cannot
 state fron l staten ient
 rather too strona mv own
 knowledge an v such ofter
 was rnade Ail I intended
 to sav was that understood
 this printing establisliinent might have
 been pur chased Jnst fall
 foe 80 000 and that
 in fact it was worth
 much less than that perhaps
 not more than NV hct
 her in 1 0int of
 fact it was offered for
 the sun I of I
 do not know ronl the
 I Mr FLORENCE have 1
 believe the price paid for
 it is not too in
 the first place I nro
 large Now si r ceeding
 o sa v that gentlemen
 should take into consi icratic
 n the fact that we
 a re in absolt lte
 want of this printing for
 the purposes of Iceitirnate legislation
 assure you Mr Speaker and
 the House that the onlv
 desire i have in this
 matter is to have thc
 puj ic busiocss properly and
 prmnpt y con ducted It
 is that neither the Senate
 Printer nor the Printer for
 House who have pled red
 themselves to do their duty
 under the law have I
 defy denial of the fact
 that tl ley at all
 done so nave crone outside
 of the law But I
 ann willint r to take
 the resolution reported from the
 Commit If it be necessary
 f tun willzpo tee on
 Prin tine that its consideration
 shall be postnoned until Mr
 Ford w ho is now
 suffering from illness and detained
